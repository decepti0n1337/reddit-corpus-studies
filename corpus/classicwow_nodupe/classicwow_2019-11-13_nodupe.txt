Thanks a ton

No. BoF only has 50% uptime, gives a clear visual indication and Pursuit of Justice=boots speed ench, so pala is still kiteable. Rogue just kites them and wears them down.
---
Weird, I am also coming from Incendius.
---

---
Just made a Undead Rogue, Level 2.
---
But the timers on devilsaurs was lowered thought . With dynamic respawn they used to be 10-15min and now they are 5-10 min
---
Use the gear you find
---
"Who the fuck is this guy? Who here is Randomrogue? Why are you in our Discord, who invited you, what are you doing here?" And then get gets kicked and banned for being a massive weirdo.
---
no one wants to be camped, a few will, but there is a reason why servers are lopsided in retail
---
some people like the challenge, but unless you play 14 hours a day and out gear and out organize the masses on the other side, it is best to deal with the queue
---
There's no difference in the 2019 tos. They are one and the same.
---
Patchwerk wasn't even the biggest dps check in Naxx. Didn't require world buffs.
---
That might be it. I failed to mention the person I attacked was lvl 17 alt someone had parked in AH. they might be neutral with the faction which is probably why I didnt get attacked
---
It didn't, my recording stopped before we went into his room, but once the alliance began gathering outside many players clients straight crashed, before that we were seeing 30+ seconds of rubberbanding.
---
It was unplayable to say the least, you were basically left to AOE and hope you hit something.
---
It did make everything more like an actual battle though, with our limited resources having to move and strike effeciently vs the Alliance's essentially endless numbers.
---
Wow maybe the guards at Lights Hope will do something now
---
Cool story bro. Meanwhile, I'm not gonna waste a shit ton of gold and mats and time when I have no idea if I will ever see any return on it. I already MT for 5 weeks. I help my guildies out non stop with dungeons or crafting. Sorry I am not gonna get played while the inner circle and officers continue to give themselves gear.
---
It‚Äôs not fixed yet :( ...The biggest issue for me is being mana burned in cat form. Soooooo frustrating!!!!!!!
---
Not at all, I was in the Horde raid and had 20 seconds or more delay on my spells, I got disconnected twice as well.
---
Because it's fun? Ever heard of that?
---
Big facts here tonight, huh? What if I told you that you can actually do both those things as they are not mutually exclusive?
---
Same can be said for any role while leveling since priest/mages/warlocks basically share loot pools as well.
---
If you think that is the case dont invite the fury warrior or dont join groups he makes and make your own group.
---
I‚Äôve finally gotten the hang of zf farming.  Now is DM E solo solo farming a better gold per hour or does that require herbalism?
---
Nnnnnnnnaah
---
Try to get even class representation so no T2 helms are wasted??? Idk. Make a google doc/survey monkey. A little effort goes a long way.
---
Yeah, rogue attacks you, understands that it takes too long to kill you and runs away. Prot can survive the burst easily - but can't really kill rogue who attacks them out of the blue.
---
We killed boss in Stormwind, Darnassus and held of raid in Undercity and Orgrimmar. We tried IF twice and lagged out both times.
---
Compensate for little wieners.
---
Flasks aren't needed for BWL either. Not until late AQ40 will they become relevant for most raiders.
---
epic mount = faster farming for more gold and not getting ganked as easily.
---
a thousand upvotes for you, sir. Well said. Well well said.
---
How are the queues on Herod? Was our original server before we all rerolled on Thunderfury like 2 days after launch.
---
For us noobs, what is layering?
---
Icyveins sucks. Check out sixty upgrades.com
---
You sound like an obese 50 year old hoarder who would still be a virgin if he hadn‚Äôt spent so much time fucking the neighbors livestock
---
See? I can make up weird, irrelevant shit too.
---
That was seriously a very nice and helpful comment. Thank you! I actually went to searing gorge for the first time and it was so damn terrifying :D
---
I seriously did kind of forget about all my friends in my list. Hopefully more are online in the next couple of days. 
---
I am in a guild right now with people who I feel good about. But we‚Äòre still small and trying to work our way up to get to a proper raiding team..  so I will work on that. 
---
I want to get to 52 asap - you can start doing blackrock depths at that level, right?
---
&gt; Yeah I'm not complaining lol. I'd rather play on Faerlina than some dead server.
---
Then don't summon tables, Jimmy.
---
Well that's his fault for not death coiling you into fear while he takes it himself.
---
51 resto druid still have been considering training another weapon skill up like daggers w an offhand. Not sure if it's worth it
---
It depends on a lot of factors. To have mana totem break even you need to stand in its radius for a certain period of time (you need to do the math based on your rank)
---
I use illusionary rod instead of resurgence. Basically the only stat is 8mp5 which isnt as good imo as lots of it spirit and stam
---
I just have one to cycle between battle and defensive bound to f so I can charge and be in defensive by the time I get there. 
---
Improved charge and tactical mastery really help with rage. Been arms tanking the whole time. 
---
Now with whirlwind it's easier because I can charge, sweeping strikes, berserker, ww, defensive, tab sunder
---
Tldr; I'm an elitist mage (big surprise) and since I have no power in groups I want to convince the tank to kick people I deem unworthy.
---
Yep.
---
wtf how does one get +100 spell damage in 40s? I have like 40-50 and I thought that was good
---
Magni wasn‚Äôt ever below 95%
---
IDK, travel form is pretty cheap.
---
Yeah I believe that. You probably have a higher chance of liquidating those asseta though or having gotten better gear yourself. But yeah, seems like an unstable situation. I am definitely using precaution, especially as it seems already the officers/GM are heavily looking to gear themselves first with the weapons and low rate stuff
---
I‚Äôve killed plenty by baiting with my health bar
---
Debatable. Really depends on what you're looking for in a guild but for me, selfies are the biggest red flag.
---
You'd think that.
---
THIS. I So just ignore it and keep the dungeon going.
---
Exactly same thought when seeing the Unreal engine versions of zones, lacks soul.
---
If they ever do a major revamp of the engine, this is the direction I hope they go.
---
This happens in /w
---
No. Still not fixed. Sadtimes bruh :&lt;
---
Lol
---
Ever step on a bug?
---
Any warriors ever go for a 21/11/19 build? I was messing with the calculator and came up with it. Tactical Master + Sweeping Strikes, Piercing Howl, Last Stand + Imp Shield Block + Defiance + Improved Taunt. Seems like it could be a good tanking oriented dungeon build. But would I be sacrificing too much in other areas (Solo PvE, PvP, raid DPS, raid tanking?)
---
Hooking actually requires effort tho
---
These always look so awesome, you‚Äôre really talented!
---
Nobody is nostalgic for servers being unable to handle the game.
---
As a feral tank I cannot consume the cookies but I keep them for good luck :)
---
And I respect the shit out of you for doing it.
---
Yes the ratio is skewed, which is what we're trying to address, but regardless there's hundreds of horde players, plenty to group and battle with.
---
Uh, nice strawman - I don‚Äôt disagree. You need to reread in context.
---
I don't know the difference between human and non human rogues using swords, but I do know that the dps delta between 305 and 310 weapon skill is much smaller than 300 and 305. In the sense of player error margins being greater, so I probably wouldn't worry too much about it. Decide what you want to play as, and find a guild that suits you.
---
feral druids are such a fun fight for me. I lose often but man what a cool class druids are
---
It's not an opinion. The rate at which you reach exalted is more than 5 times faster in BC.
---
no....they should just do faction specific queues. and i'm HORDE on these servers.
---
He's just baiting at this point or delusional.
---
Nice ui
---
7/10
---
Well that‚Äôs pretty lame üò¢
---
100% balanced world PvP is dumb as fuck.
---
Wait for Battlegrounds if you want an even playing field.
---
Your call of course, but I would go mount first, no question.
---
What setup do you want if you do want to farm honor? A party of 5?
---
0.7
---
because he is a fucking noob
---
I know someone else asked but can you share source? This would change a lot of how my guild is handling these drops haha
---
Methhead Jesus save us all üôèüèº
---
Wintersaber &gt; any armored sabertooth 
---
Were not getting BC and even if we would there's a huge fanbase who just wants to play classic.
---
So if the grind ain't for you, feel free to skip it! But that mount is worth it
---
Stop free rolling and use dkp instead
---
And it's years out.
---
He's not wrong.
---
I watched some of their runs cause Skarm used to be in the guild. Watched a Naxx run and they have people just /yelling the N word throughout the entire thing.
---
As a healer, LET ME DRINK AND NO YOU DON'T "got this"
---
Getting the Winterspring Frostsaber mount makes no sense in Classic. Not only does it look worse than the other cats, it's also no faster than any other 100% mount.
---
F
---
We don't free roll.
---
What can I farm solo as a 55 mage? Looking to buy some stuff and need some cash.
---
I‚Äôm revered
---
Basicly saying, why the fuck get something years later when no one actually gives a fuck about it, then now when its hard, makes for a unique achivement in obtaining something barely any others have now, then to wait 2 years until almost everyone has it and no longer wanted.
---
Yeah and now there are 2 hour queues
---
The purpose is in the journey, not in the destination. Getting the frostsaber mount with 5 times the rep gain has no journey in it. Doing the grind now shows dedication and focus. Doesn't matter if it's ugly (it isn't). Could be a 60% mount instead of a 100%. The fact that someone has it now is a testament to the person and their effort. Whoever gets it in 2.3 is just another one of the pack. That's because the first guy is ahead with f the curve. And in classic, this makes all the difference in the world.
---
I've got my first sunder on before a dps has time to finish a cast.
---
As long as there is a skull marked and they don't cast until after I charge they would only have time for an instant cast.
---
I feel like OP has seen me tank before...
---
Than what are you using? We have 6 mages atm and we all are getting gear.
---
This 
---
Tryhard guilds are not where a nee player wants to be.
---
So you're part of the problem and don't want your targets to leave. Fuck off.
---
Screenshot of his spec or it didn't happen. Either you have no idea or your other warriors suck
---
yes. we need a 100% horde server
---
Every gnomes dream!
---
Awesome!  I'm glad to hear we have a new warrior for the Horde.  I imagine leveling is going to be hell during phase 2, so if you're getting picked on, make use of the Signal Fire chat.  Usually someone will come to help you out.  Also, my name in game is Stormweaver.  I'm a resto shaman, so I won't be of much use without some other classes with me, but I will do what I can to help you out if those scummy Alliance give you hell.
---
What happens is:
---
You are a skeleton
---
You transform into a kitty
---
You are a kitty
---
You transform out of kitty
---
e
---
You still have 2 days.
---
&gt; Wintersaber &gt; any armored sabertooth
---
It doesn't look nearly as good. It was something I thought was cool the first time I saw one in 2005, not so much in 2019.
---
&gt;Were not getting BC and even if we would there's a huge fanbase who just wants to play classic.
---
We are.
---
&gt;So if the grind ain't for you, feel free to skip it! But that mount is worth it
---
No, it's not. 100% speed = 100% speed and it's objectively a bad way to spend your time since it's &gt;5x faster in BC.
---
Has to be a troll right? But these days I don't even know
---
You don't think being forced to pay for a character transfer is an issue?
---
To each their own, but I'd rather ride out the issues on a big server for the sake of longevity.
---
STREAMSNIPER  abusing  spots and crying about "snitching"    you should get 2 bans for the price of one 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
god some people now a days..  no words
---
I mean lots of people have quit. The qs going from 5 hours to 2 is pretty significant. I see this game having a dedicated following for a long time, but at this level maybe 7 months
---
It will be a separate server is my guess anyways
---
part of the problem? i'm saying that blizzard should be implementing a horde only queue to encourage HORDE to transfer off. you're aware that alliance players aren't currently allowed to xfer, right?
---
&gt; Basicly saying, why the fuck get something years later when no one actually gives a fuck about it, then now when its hard, makes for a unique achivement in obtaining something barely any others have now, then to wait 2 years until almost everyone has it and no longer wanted.
---
It's a /cringe magnet, it's not hard to get, there's a huge number of players with it and it's still the same mount in BC.
---
Nice attempt at a coherent post though, I mean other than the fact that it collapsed at "Basicly"..
---
Theres a surprising amount of animated motion in that Orc that I've never noticed before.
---
The way his weight is shifted looks like hes really stepping off with a lot of power.
---
yep the black lotus price right now is 100% a pump from speculators thinking that it will be worth 5-10x more. literally everyone is saying that they're a great investment now and people are just hoarding them ready to dump them onto the market once the new raid content comes out. News flash, the best investments are NOT the ones that everyone is tapking about. The price is pure pump &amp; dump action
---
It's probably because you suck at wow
---
I need you in my wow-life, come heal something, anything.
---
That's true, but lets be honest. Hunter leveling isn't difficult, regardless of spec. Is BM the fastest? Sure, but thread wasn't about leveling efficiency, it was about OP getting his shit packed at 24. BM isn't gonna help squat with that.
---
Outta curiosity, don't most BM builds end up shooting for Aimed Shot right off anyways?
---
There is one in Hive Zora too.
---
Yes, and if your on farelina message me, I have a guild you can join that is lax and has atleast two people that will stop at nothing to kill others, we like taking on unfair fights, and with you being a priest, id be dumb not to help you out.

Yes I am aware and they should be. How fucking braindead are you?
---
How do you tell if it's working or not? They finished the instance. By the clearest and most obvious measurement of success: It is objectively working.
---
At the bare minimum, if you're going to randomly press buttons people tell you to press, you need a way to measure if things are working or not.
---
But all of the advice anybody has time to give you in an instance is, "You need to sunder" or "You are shit." People won't sit down and explain how threat works (damage, healing, or tank skills), how damage works, how to LOS pull, how the instance works, etc.

---
Okay so merge them then. It worked better in the past than the wpvp lag that makes it unplayable. Unless that was their point. In that well most of us were ok our shit oem rigs back then. It‚Äôs not like people weren‚Äôt killing all the main city bosses and doing this stuff back then still.
---
That's not his guild's name, that's how he feels inside.
---
I have AtlasLoot but can't find where the map option is. Can you point me in the right direction?
---
Yea this overpopulated shit show isn't the classic experience from 2004.  It's the NEW classic experience.
---
Okay, so it's still bugged is what you're saying haha
---
What was his name? Maybe contact his guild and if he has none look in a couple of days if he joins one contact his gm immediately
---
It's more than that, we have more than 6 mages attending the average raid, and for whatever reason our caster drops have been pretty awful.
---
Last time we ran a full MC clear, my group had one piece of Arcanist drop. The other raid group hasn't seen an Azuresong/SoD/RoSP/ToEP drop in 5~ weeks. 
---
Hell, we've had like 8+ Leafs drop and only one Eye of Divinity, at this point our guild bank has 3 Eye of Shadows basically waiting to be given away. 
---
Then we get double Stormrage from Rag with one druid in the raid... And he's already got it...
---
&gt; The purpose is in the journey, not in the destination. Getting the frostsaber mount with 5 times the rep gain has no journey in it. Doing the grind now shows dedication and focus.
---
That explains why people are grinding it in groups. Such focus required. 
---
&gt;Doesn't matter if it's ugly (it isn't).
---
It's objectively speaking worse than the other ones.
---
&gt;The fact that someone has it now is a testament to the person and their effort. Whoever gets it in 2.3 is just another one of the pack.
---
It doesn't work like that. It's the same mount.
---
&gt;That's because the first guy is ahead with f the curve. And in classic, this makes all the difference in the world.
---
It doesn't work like that. There's no reason to have the mount or do the grind. It's cosmetic fluff and you're getting a really bad deal grinding it in Classic when it's &gt;5x times faster in BC. Not being stupid makes all the difference in the world.
---
How do you find a good guild when 40 chimpanzees could clear MC?
---
a few weeks meant 2 1/2 months
---
a couple of months means like 5 yeas
---
Rule 7 is such bullshit. If a "low effort" post gets 1k upvotes, it obviously means the community enjoyed it.
---
"Hey, we know what you did was clever, but can you convolute it a bit more just because."
---
No clue how it's not against ToS. Ridiculous add-on.
---
Can you backtrack to Flamelash when you do a BRD lavarun?
---
&gt; Okay so merge them then.
---
Okay, have fun explaining to thousands of players that they have to give up their name and change it to something else because the server is getting merged.
---
Or... they increased server cap and opened up character transfers, and that's why the queue has decreased.
---
I have nearly 400 people in my guild, and only about 30 became inactive.
---
Not very worth solo farming DME without herb, better to actually run the dungeon
---
I haven't played retail in 7 or 8 years and when I did it was for a month or so following a hiatus of many years. Nice try though!
---
between 15g and 80g per piece. depends on the piece. It's not very expensive.
---
lol thats amazing
---
That age and experience shown on his face. Great job
---
Really? It's Saturday now?
---
Yeah, as I said, the EverQuest system. They completely ripped off that game and then made it more user friendly, or casual, if you will.
---
Fully agree. We can discuss but Blizz must go nochanges at all cost.
---
We'll see after Naxx release/farm how is the game and Blizz will eventually offer us an alternative, being Classic +, BC or something else, idc.
---
Seriously, we wait this since YEARS and after less than 3 months some people are already complaining. Get the fuck out if you're not happy with Classic, you'll never be happy with WoW if you don't like this or retail.
---
/Cringe is a WoW emote.
---
Looks like Netero

---
Anything that goes well with your profession, so if you have mining find melee mobs in caves.
---
If you have Herbalism, try one of the big fields in WPL.
---
Devilsaur farming is profitable if you have skinning (And it's not overly camped)  
---
You could also farm Scarlet Spellblinders in the tower near Hearthglen, they drop the Crusader recipe that goes for 100-200g.
---
And when you gain a few more levels (58 is good), you can farm Hederine Slayers in WS for an Eye of Shadow.
---
[removed]
---
Only viable if you call it Furries
---
you can twodot with no downtime or 3dot if you have imp. vw
---
I'm literally replying to another comment, dude.
---
How is using blizzard bad? From my experience tanking the mages that wait a few sec for me to build aggro and blizzard almost never pull aggro from me. What i hate are the mages that frost nova into flamestrike+coc shattercombo into AE spam cause that  almost always rips aggro and ruins the pull.
---
same thing happened to me. bunch of friends got scattered across a couple of realms. more time to plan this out would have been nice, and we wouldnt have ended up with these mega packed servers (with the exception of faerlina bc of it being the streamer server)
---
I've never had an issue getting corpse camped. Easiest defense is don't click. Go get a slice of pizza, come back in fifteen minutes.
---
Honestly, it appears to me that it just takes one person to lead a good MC. If the leader knows how to tell people what to do, and pick the right people, it runs reasonably smoothly.
---
As for guilds, that hasn't changed for me - go do dungeons with pugs, if you see someone who is boss, see what guild they're in and inquire. It's unlikely a boss player will be in a guild that doesn't have some good members.
---
&gt; Some people like it, And waiting to grind it out because it's easier is silly if one wants it now.
---
The point, as laid out clearly in the OP, is that it's **FASTER** in BC.
---
We don't even know if we are getting BC, let alone if we're gonna carry on from classic. Your argument is weird man
---
If people enjoy the grind, so what? 
---
I don't feel like waiting 2 years + for it as I believe it's better looking and more unique than sabertooths.
---
Let alone getting a sabertooth means buying runecloth to get to exalted ans then spending an other 10000 gold on a second mount
---
Transfer
---
OP is sitting in the middle of the screen. Only character without a nameplate.
---
I want to transfer off faerlina but i dont know anything about the 3 servers i have to choose from. Anyone know? The two i know off the top are earthfury and arcanite reaper.
---
There is no real reason to train up a weapon skill for a druid. They're stat sticks for druids, you'll rarely, if ever, be auto attacking with your weapon.
---
Blizzard should make a WoW anime/show
---
When people say the raids are nerfed they are referring indirectly from the talent tree and item reworks . Players in this patch/version are doing ALOT more damage/healing than the content was originally designed for.
---
For example I was in a server first guild in vanilla and it was a big deal when we kill ragnaros before the 2ND set of sons and that was with bwl+ gear and 40 people from memory.  Pre 1.10 obviously.
---
However in classic my guild kills ragnaros before 1ST sons with 25-30 people and easily, that‚Äôs a huge difference in damage obviously these days there‚Äôs more min/maxing across the guild than previously but still.
---
To be honest when we do onyxia with 15ish people it feels closer to its original difficulty, so I assume if you did MC in its current state with only 15 the tuning would be on par.
---
Retail open world is cross server, so individual server population doesn't matter for pvp.
---
good call, thanks!
---
Have fun in those instances!
---
do you mean to say pending mail is lost if you transfer servers?
---
&gt; We don't even know if we are getting BC, let alone if we're gonna carry on from classic. Your argument is weird man
---
Even if the reputation gain wasn't increased in BC I would've advocated against a pointless grind.
---
Maybe dont play on overpopulated realms. Some realms like illidan have been this bad since retail classic. 
---
Also, if 20 people are waiting for a named mob, it sounds like a job for 4 parties. People just refuse to be at all social and get upset classic doesnt cater to solos. 
---
No excuses for not having friends, people who played day one made 5 mans to do starting zone quests out of randoms. Just invite people and most will join. 
---
It's incredibly frustrating to hear people complain about wanting classic but not actually playing it like an mmorpg from the mis 2000s.
---
Hey everyone, thought it would be interesting to share Gdkp system which is the standard here on Korean servers. Firstly, I‚Äôm an American living in Korea and was very surprised to learn about this system when starting classic WoW here. As guild/raid leader (expat founded international guild on Korean server) I usually end the raids with well over 13,000 gold in my bags. I have not seen a single guild nor raiding group here use any other system. The G in gdkp stands for ‚ÄòGold‚Äô in which all items items are auctioned off after every boss. Items go for a very large sum of gold, with Mageblade and Vis‚ÄôKag easily going for 2,500g or more. The gold is sent to the raid leader and the raid continues. At the end of the raid the raid leader distributes the gold evenly to all participants, usually around 250-300g per raider. As you can see in the screenshot I currently have 13,403 gold in my bag and we just finished Rag and are about to do distributions. I got really lucky and won perditions blade for 670g, which usually goes for 2,500g+ (guild master benefit, no one bidded against me). This system has it‚Äôs pros‚Äô/cons but it‚Äôs extremely fair with loot distributions and 100% capitalist. It‚Äôs interesting to see how gold prices are different depending on the earning potential of the class. Mages have great gold farming methods and their t1 sets/gear tends to go for much higher (1k/piece for t1) than warriors etc. Personally, I prefer loot council, but when in rome you do what the romans do. I thought it would be interesting to share this with all of you.
---
Being resto though, I'm more concerned w stat  and healing bonuses than dps. I'm just not sure how to compare the straightforward stat bonuses from my staff (+18 int, +13 spirit etc) to offhand items that use a different metric like +30 to healing spells
---
thats just sad.
---
You're right !
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
Not really. You should be fine saying you want to play swords in almost all guilds.
---
What if that‚Äôs exactly what he wants! A spy! Wanting changes!
---
-No magic dispel
---
-No disease dispel
---
-No tranq shot
---
-No banish
---
-No sheep
---
-Ranged DPS going oom in 30 seconds
---
etc. etc.
---
You wouldn't even be able to clear MC.
---
Now this is vanilla mentality. Truly living a classic experience!
---
I think it shares a CD with their mana gem, so they dont take it
---
your after that wasn't mentioning wotlk... ummmmm
---
How did get 10 talent points in 8 levels
---
On the day of the Lord you say?
---
exactly am i the only real warlock here?! No mages ever want my shit
---
I tried to get something like this going because it's very fair and fun and everyone wins in the end. But it was just endless moaning and bitching and complaining by people who are too lazy to log in for more than an hour a day. This side of the world is completely worthless.
---
I got chased for lighting up someone's bank alt in booty bay. I doubt the level 2 had a friendly rep
---
PvP balance is not a problem that needs fixing.
---
If you don't like getting 5v1 gang bang: reroll
---
If you feel bad 5v1 gang banging: reroll
---
Wouldn't this discouraged healer/tank that had very little mean to farm gold relatively to mage/rogue/hunter?
---
You forgot sweeping strikes before switching to zerker stance.
---
This is Org on [Fairbanks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610130637394935809/643971872496812032/WoWScrnShot_111219_182247.jpg) right now. You love to see it!
---
GDKP is the 'Gold' standard here (pun intended)
---
My guild did this in late BC, and Wrath, I‚Äôm glad to see people are doing it in MC
---
Join a guild with older guys. Most of us haven't reached level cap yet. We'll get there when we get there. They're a friendly bunch and very understanding of irl situations.
---
To be fair high population servers had a couple of months to transfer before they made faction only transfers.  I can only assume that everyone who actually wanted to transfer would have during those two months.
---
No because they are bidding against hunters/mage/rogues for healing/tanking gear. They are bidding against other healers/tanks
---
As a Mage I never eat the cookie. Sorry locks I appreciate it but it shares a cd with my mana gem which is much more important. On the rare occasion a do need health I just use a heal pot.
---
This is.... completely new and very freaking fresh! People who can't farm (healers) now have a way to get some gold and their loot will probably cost less!!!
---
A lot of the people that are happy with the game are actually playing it and not checking Reddit on the regular. It isn‚Äôt ideal to take the mood here as the overall community response.
---
Depends on how geared your dps is. A single sunder wont hold threat vs the locks/mages I run with when its time to gear a new alt. A crit makes it even worse
---
but idk how exactly the bonuses from my staff (+18int, +13spi etc) compare to other metrics for the offhand I currently have in mind is +42healing spells but I'd have to sacrifice my staff w awesome bonuses to wield a dagger w next to no perks and a good offhand.
---
I‚Äôd also like to know
---
It‚Äôs actually worse than that. Blizzard said that removing layers also lowers server capacity. Now we have no layers and low queues/no queues.
---
For tier sets its not that bad because it's only among your own class. Weapons and stuff is harder and you'll just have to wait a bit longer and hold on to the gold from previous GDKP raids. The bigger problem is gold buyers and Chinese bots. Phase 2 will fix that however.
---
&gt; They are providing the classic experience we asked for from the beginning
---
No they're not. I didn't ask for 1.12.0 trivialized, solved, garbage. I wanted to play the game the way it was when content was current. A vocal minority asked for 1.12.1 and no one asked for layering.
---
Private servers have been a thing for 10+ years. People know what they're getting into. Anyone who hasn't quit already is likely going to still be playing through at least BWL.
---
This, plus it just add's onto the gold they already farm which is very little because at the end of the raid its all split evenly (sometimes a guild bank will take a %)
---
Not everyone should get that though, just me, obviously.
---
Sounds like an interesting system, I can't imagine it would catch on here too many people would complain. I guess it works like DKP though really even if you can't log on to farm after a few raids you'd have the gold to buy and if you already have all the gear you need you are just running it as a gold farm?
---
I haven‚Äôt been involved in large scale pvp yet. Was it a slideshow?
---
Raids are my main income :P
---
Ah, in general you want to prioritize +healing, then the other stuff like MP5/Spirit/int. 
---
For mages it's something like 8int = 1SP~, so it's always a bit skewed in favor of +healing or +spellpower. I imagine it's the same for druids.
---
Nice attempt at calling for moral support.
---
That's really good news. I saw it wasnt listed on the blue post regarding transfers, I guess it was a typo. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Not if you dungeon level
---
Be glad to have a summon function. Without it they'd take another mage.
---
Prepare for later phases
---
Yep I have always played PvE, just not that interested in dealing with griefers.
---
Greetings from Red October.
---
What is happening? Queue on Stalagg too
---
RIP
---
Comments like this are the real RP.
---
I just started playing Classic this week. People on Pagle have been complaining about this. Queues for what? BGs or for logging in?
---
You just mainly farm DM-E jump runs? Just got my warrior to 60 to do this. If so, any tips?!
---
If I recall, this was observed inconsistently across realms, hinting it may have had to do with delayering processes and the dynamic respawn.
---
If you have some solid sources on it, I'd love to see them, but my memory was that it was anecdotal, exaggerated and inconsistent.
---
I was going to say there better be an elv UI import in this post
---
layers are gone,
---
Awesome addition :) Does it work with other Map-overwriting addons like LeatrixMaps though?
---
The alliance sure is active on discord here..boy do they love to talk.
---
Ok, you took me questioning the bit about racials and answered it entirely about Paladins, despite me saying I have a 60 Paladin. 
---
&gt;Defensive Dispels on GCD at literal no mana cost 
---
Cleanse is great yes, it does have a mana cost though.
---
&gt; BoF is the single most dominant spell in WSG mid 
---
It's good, but also dispellable. 
---
&gt; BOP 
---
Good, but also dispellable.
---
&gt; DI 
---
Yeah DI can be useful, it also has an hour cooldown and sacrifices yourself in the process of using it.
---
&gt; Grounding Totem? Please, that's barely useful in WSG
---
This is hyperbole right? 
---
&gt; not like you can ground instants 
---
Sure you can. Ironically HoJ is one of the easiest instant spells to ground in the game.
---
I'm not saying Paladins are bad and I get you have this massive boner for Paladins, but you're omitting glaring weaknesses for this fantasy setup.
---
That's a tough sell to someone who is getting regularly ganked by 60s. They might enjoy world PvP at max level, but many aint gonna slog it out to 60 to find out.
---
Even if they slog it out to 60, I don't know how I could explain to them why the game is fun when it takes 3 corpse runs to get into BRD on one faction.
---
I reiterate, world PvP is envisaged as this dynamic mix of encounters, but faction imbalance has ruined many servers where world PvP becomes an imbalanced slaughter that incentivises not engaging for one faction at all because you'll just get roflstomped by 10 players from the opposing faction, it's kind of sad.
---
I still prefer it to sharding, but it doesn't make it perfect.
---
&gt; Getting the Winterspring Frostsaber mount makes no sense in Classic.
---
This is subjective
---
&gt; Not only does it look worse than the other cats
---
&gt; it's also no faster than any other 100% mount.
---
This is true. I would understand an opinion stating that you should never farm rep for a mount and just get the one that is already available to you.
---
&gt; The reputation gained from all the quests is increased by roughly 500% in patch 2.3.0 
---
Okay, but this could mean I have to wait years for something that I want now.
---
&gt; If you want to do the grind then that's fine but you're going to become a /cringe target.
---
Are you saying that you find it cringey to waste time grinding rep? When you're playing WoW classic?
---
&gt;Hopefully this solves the whole "but it's not abusing a safe spot, you're just out of range!" that so many players on here like to stand by.
---
Safespotting has never been in violation of the ToS
---
the real boomers
---
Depends on your class. As a rogue I'm competing against other rogues for gear. Personally I pickpocket BRD while mining dark iron. I get about 50g/hour. I have no trouble buying gear and rogue gear usually goes for 250g/piece (which is what I make from 1 raid anyway), so I can get more than one piece per raid
---
item level must be 40+
---
#nochanges
---
Yeah maybe 5 years ago. Nowadays the population on this subreddit is just people who use reddit + people who kinda like classic wow. The people who I know who are more hardcore players are on discord but definitely not on here upvoting the shitty test post memes all day.
---
You won't expect loot from a DKP/EPGP guild right away anyway, since you will have no points. Either system you will need to prove you're not a numpty. 
---
tbh the best loot council guilds will have a public spreadsheet available with everyone's loot priority for each item and will be happy to clearly explain everything, including how you can get in on it. This has worked pretty well for my guild. And honestly, if your guild is lacking in your class or you're a few months in and the core raid team already has their T1, you could easily end up with loot quicker than you think.
---
It's not that Blizzard listened to the community - they'd been doing that since Vanilla. The Burning Crusades and Wrath of the Lich King were highly praised. Always have been.
---
It's the fact that Blizzard stopped listening to \*smart\* players and started listening to \*all\* players, that created problems.
---
Dumb players just whinge until they get what they want. The problem being, their whinges are often very short sighted and create other problems they don't like.
---
This creates a circle of whinging which literally never stops and subsequently the smarter people who all realised this, QUIT. That was 75% of the player base btw.
---
Swipe hits only 3 nearby targets and if you spam it like you say you will be always out of rage. You can use it in between while rotating mauling on primary and secondary target and normal attacks on the rest. You need it to manage rage not waste it.
---
Remember y'all.
---
You all had the chance to transfer...
---
classic case of l2p
---
what do you mean? know you can finally play the game
---
Once you have the carapace again like people said its not bad,on average you will need 4-6 strat UD runs the blood i collected in 2 90minute sessions with an epic mount and the scales i just bought on my server they are only a couple gold each
---
Yes.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking on grinding the saber on my two toons. Since I‚Äôll only play those 2 the whole time. I don‚Äôt do anything else. 
---
Any tips?! Mage/Warrior are my two characters. I know to just get like 800+ stacks of runecloth for honored - exalted. Both of my toons are gnome.
---
I think nowadays the average reddit is more the ‚Äúaverage nooby player‚Äù than the real hardcore theorycrafters who gets their news and discussion from better sources.
---
1. Have no money
---
2. Enter Raid, can't bid on anything due to 1.
---
3. Finish Raid, get 300g from distributions
---
4. Bid next Raid
---
5. Repeat
---
Not for an entire fight just talking the first shadow bolt vs charge sunder
---
.
---
ok, than would I assume there is just an error in the guide?
---

---
Get. Fucking. Rekt.
---
From what I understand, it's similar to sharding in retail. Basically, if your buddy on the same server as you is in Ironforge, you may not be able to see him since he's in another 'instance.' It's a way to lighten the server load.
---
Simple. Wait a couple of weeks. You get 300+ gold per raid. You'll get there.
---
That's pretty fucked. You shouldn't be kicked like that if you gave appropriate notice, which it sounds like you did.
---
&gt; Are you saying that you find it cringey to waste time grinding rep? When you're playing WoW classic?
---
So far I haven't seen a single person on that mount not fake AFK in the middle of a crowd whenever they got the chance. They most likely think they're special on their special needs mount, and this is why they're /cringe magnets.
---
Do GDKP runs without winning something and take a split of the gold at the end until you can afford an item
---
I‚Äôm not seeing many heavily upvotes posts about pros or strats here. It‚Äôs mostly memes and telling people to slow down their leveling to enjoy the ride.
---
No. This is stupid. They shouldn't change stuff just because people make dumb life decisions.
---
Didn‚Äôt faerlina just get ddossed the other day?
---
Lol yes, because High Command guild on Blaumeux isnt competely comprised of players that camp in front of BRD or UBRS and gank horde.
---
Its a two way street bud,  either get you licks in or get licked.
---
Free Hong Kong
---
&gt; Any tips?!
---
Wait until BC Classic.
---
That last point reminded me of the first time my guild killed archimonde in BC. The last 3% of the fight was tanked by a hunters bird (named towelie) through a truely absurd number of dodges and I think some parries. Vent blew up with laughter at the absurdity of that bird tanking ARCHIMONDE for 3%.
---
You join the raid and get gold instead of items.  It's universal dkp
---
it wasn't against tos. los'ing was always tolerated, until now. 
---
attacking someone out of guard los is not safespoting.
---
if you have issues with rage, I don't know what you're doing. rage is literally a non issue, y'know, because I have threat (primal fury and OoC help)
---
I wouldn't post things like this, you get down-voted into oblivion if you show screenshots of empty cities lol
---
Well you're getting like 300g a raid, so it's impossible to not have money in this system.
---
I accidentally stumbled across this post and wow, how the times have changed
---
That does sound cringe. I can't say I haven't done this myself when I got some fresh epics.
---
So how bad of an idea is it to go blacksmithing as a paladin?
---
 I've heard it's rather pointless if you go holy or prot eventually, but I am enjoying ret and it would be nice to be able to craft some of the endgame stuff instead of paying for it.
---
Run while you still can!
---
I was referring to the melee priest.
---
The builds I were referring to were ones that are suboptimal dps but open up capability where there previously wasn't.  Sorry about the ambiguity.
---
&gt;keyring 
---
&gt;mallet
---
That was more to demonstrate the disconnect between people on the sub and the playerbase, not saying if you post pros or strats that shows the subreddit is more hardcore.
---
that's actually pretty good lol
---
never once did i say that should be the case
---
Lol!
---
Agreed not sure why Stalagg has a 1hr que atm... they removed layering from it weeks ago and I haven't had a que since today.
---
As a pally who offspeed tanks. 30/21 holy prot. Long as I get a tic or two after the consecration before dps unloads as well as salv on the rest of the group. And they start by attacked the mob I'm attacking. I hold aggro 99% of the time on trash pulls. I've never had to " spread out dps"
---
But you take durability from spirit resing.
---
I did this in classic with ~20 hoj ranked pvpers and we held the boat for 6+ hours. We good in the captains room at the front and all used deviates til we were pirates.
---
Tell me, then. Do warlocks have their Infernals fixed yet after months of bitching? You know what the commonality is between these two changes? They're both things that can inconvenience players, yet one is an exploit and one is an inherent part of the warlock class. 
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d4bjzl/bug\_or\_sabotage\_infernals\_not\_aggressive\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d4bjzl/bug_or_sabotage_infernals_not_aggressive_and/) 
---
Yeah, its unreasonable to say we're on a slippery slope because we're already at the fucking bottom of it.
---
So.... what i am hearing is that you decided to level slow on a pvp server and now are regretting it because you are behind the curve and getting destroyed by those that actually played the game? 
---
If its red - its dead. period. 
---
dont worry, it will only be a mess until bgs come out, then leveling wont be so bad. Till then, rip cause you leveled as slow as you could lol
---
Got one on Skeram as Alliance. 1k, 50ish minutes. As if I needed another reason to consider rerolling lol
---
Clearly not
---
Nope. I said that it's faster.
---
Have to wait for some of the 80% horde to log off to go get camped by them, yay.
---
Had. Alliance on most of the servers are screwed now lol
---
If your machine is good enough, you‚Äôre fine on frames well past the point where the server breaks.
---
Yet again, thank you VERY MUCH for your knowledgeable insight.
---
Hey, you do you! Doesn't seem that worthwhile to me though
---
for a while there were tonnes of cringey shit memes on here that everyone upvotes. People just have really bad taste. It‚Äôs been great having less of them imo
---
Layering was removed.
---
Only works for horde tho, I dont remember any Alliance having server xfer options now
---
The players who didn‚Äôt transfer first time with the queue won‚Äôt transfer now. I think it‚Äôs too late
---
HYPE
---
this has nothing to do with safespoting, its still possible and banable right now. what you mean is los'ing guards, which was never banable in vanilla and its sad they continue with their #changes policy.
---
some people are just bad at the game and need to blame anything other than themselves for the badness
---
Does the revered MC quint come out in phase 2 Thursday?
---
Position 2600 as an alliance on Herod.
---
Do you have starting bids? If yes, are they fixed among all items or do they depend on ‚Äûquality‚Äú/rarity of the item?
---
Wait it's revered? I thought you only had to be honored no?
---
Theres a level of bad that is intolerable. If you've not come across this, I envy you.
---
A cast sequence can‚Äôt do this, but I think you can still do this. 
---
It would look something like this: 
---
    #showtooltip [equipped:spellstone] Spellstone Name; One Hand Name
---
    /use [equipped:spellstone] Spellstone Name
---
    /equipslot 16 One Hand Name
---
    /equipslot 17 Spellstone Name
---
I _think_ this would work, but don‚Äôt have a way to test it. 
---
This is also assuming the `[equipped:spellstone]` condition works with Spellstones.
---
6 days ago you said you moved to earthshaker now you say you raid with progress? Doubt.
---
You said if you do it you'll be a cringe target, jealous much?
---
I bet they remove layers and also reduce server capacity to prevent crashing and lag for thursday. Total bullcrap
---
What 2019 Blizz has to say doesn't matter. I'm talking about WoW btw not its expansions, though it's quite possible that it's still perfectly fine according to the ToS.
---
Blizz has said the a Medium pop server already has at least as many people as the full servers back in vanilla did. Having queues means it is massively overpopulated. There are perfectly "alive" medium servers pop servers.
---
You're free to set whatever loot rules you want for your PUGs.
---
That said, Vis'kag &gt; Deathbringer for all but Orcs due to folks rage calling with Deathbringer (apparently).
---
my response wasnt to OP, but yeah. swipe spam is going to be a lot harder without the xrit to back it up
---
I wonder how those psevers managed to handle that exact scale of battle with 0 lag. Must be some evil pirate magic...
---
This subreddit is filled with casual players who don‚Äôt give a shit about your time. Just because they want to do things at a slow place, doesn‚Äôt mean I do. Same thing can be said in reverse. But that‚Äôs when you ask them to keep up and if they don‚Äôt want to or don‚Äôt care to, replace em.
---
Really sorry for you mate...if I were in your shoes I'd probably stop playing for a while.
---
Yup! 50g minimum bid with 10g bidding increments. Some items (like shadowstrike) aren't even worth 50g and get /roll 40 and randomly go to someone for vendor.
---
That makes no sense. At least try to make sense..If you want to make sense that is..
---
Now I‚Äôm just hungry
---
I was just thinking this too.
---
No, it's disruptive behaviour, also grieving, and abusing game mechanics, very clearly against tos
---
It‚Äôs not about difficulty it‚Äôs about time.
---
We haven't had layers for a month plus on stalagg.
---
By progress.
---
I did this back in ICC, was pretty fun but not new
---
I will never not upvote animals + WoW Classic
---
It is BY FAR the best layout of any city in the game in respect to easy, free movement within a smaller (and therefore faster) space.
---
level 60 population is much more consequential than overall population. a bunch of level 10 alliance chars who log on for five minutes, do one quest, and log back off, might as well not even exist for all the effect they have on the server.
---
What do you mean? You described it working incorrectly (you can see bliz even recognizes it's working incorrectly in their blue post of known bugs...) 
---
The fact people, yourself included, think this is working properly is a massive problem. And I don't mean that as disrespect, I can understand why you think it's correct. But that's not how it worked in classic. This is based from my own personal experience, from most PvP druid videos (any who used it, which is most) from that era, and from bliz themselves.
---
Btw, 16 is mainhand, 17 is offhand. So if those items need to go into different slots, just change it.
---
Do you think Blizzard intended DM North or LBRS to be soloable?
---
GG Alliance! We had around 180 people on horde. Tinker, Tyrande and Bolvar were fairly easy but damn, magni was a bitch.
---
I'm not gonna blame lag or shit servers for our wipe in the throne room but you could've added that we killed all the other bosses.
---
The most fun parts didnt even happen in the Alliance cities. The best parts were when we buffed up in Org before starting and all of the sudden our Spy goes off IN Orgrimmar. Appearently a big alliance raid had the same idea and went into thralls room.
---
Later we were at the UC Zep and another 90 man raid came for UC and we jumped down: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYXh2_1Dh1E
---
Don't play with tryhards and you'll be fine.
---
A couple of % damage from a single player is not going to make or break anything in Classic, the PvE is meme-tier for any semi competent player.
---
Why is there a queue now though? We haven't had a queue on stalagg since September. I don't get it, did people transfer into the server?
---
no, but that is an unrelated issue to pvp
---
&gt; massive problem
---
Social justice has literally nothing to do with being anti-military-industrial. That would be just good ol regular justice. As in, justice for war criminals and blood profiteers, which can be found extensively throughout every tier of the war industry. 
---
Also, we dont have any choice but to contribute to these murderers' salaries. We DO have the choice to contribute or support a politician, so that comparison is completely irrelevant and dishonest.
---
ShadowedUnitFrames for the Unit Frames, Prat for the Chat, Dominos for the Cast Bars and BasicMinimap for the Minimap.
---
OmniCC provides cool down counters, tullaRange makes the buttons go red when I'm out of range, and Masque provides additional styling options for bars and buttons.
---
I just like to see if I can kill alliance before they can move again
---
Only show spells that have cds
---
It's now a 4000 man queue with a 4 hour wait time.
---
In additionto attunements, the soloable parts of tirion fordrings chain, the searing gorge elite chain that starts with farming symbol of ragnaros for melee dps, and the witch doctor quests that unlock juju in winterspring come to mind. If youre horde and melee or a tank, make sure you do the jinthaalor quest for rune of the guard captain too.
---
Yeah Burmese kitty, silk bricks.
---
the reduced the capacity to entice horde to move.
---
"Reeeeee layers!!!!!!!! Blizz will keep layers forever and if you don't think they will you're a stupid fuck who is just a shill for Blizz!! Reeee!!!"
---
3.5 is the max out can go, anything higher goes to 3.5.
---
There are no layers any more, so there is a higher server load per player. That means that fewer people can log into the server without overloading it and thus the cap on player count is lower.
---
Hunter actually
---
no, but before that point, long before that point, servers were lopsided. look at wow progress historical data from wayback machine
---
in 2011 in cata, before a lot of the cross realm stuff (they were mostly MoP and later IIRC) server imbalance was already very strong
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20110202215945/https://www.wowprogress.com/realms/rank/us
---
and if you look at specific realm
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20080826042827/http://www.wowprogress.com/pve/us/illidan
---
that was back in 2008, in TBC, there was a 1 / 0.62 split of horde to alliance, which by 2011 was now ridiculous of 1 / 0.18
---
paid transfers and re-rolls did not help, but if anyone thinks that people are going to willingly be dunked on, you are delusional.
---
It's just honored, you don't get any additional discount at Revered.
---
no it wasn't. you guys are confusing safespoting with los'ing.
---
Cringe target for sure
---
Only if you have some rare transmute recipe. Selling potions isn't more profitable than selling just the herbs on any populated server.
---
You're not making any sense. There's nothing remotely similar about the nonsense you're spouting and what I said. Spending a lot of time for a non-upgrade VS leveling up during the expansion so that you can do current content are completely different things. 
---
No one is keeping track off the score but It's X-0 in my favor where X is some big number.
---
Is that front flip random or do you have to do some thing
---
I wish there was a regular thing going on my server. I would totally farm 2-5k gold and get Accuria, QSR and Brutality blade on my hunter.
---
They promised layers would be gone by phase 2 annnnnnnd that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing? I feel like we should be happy they‚Äôre keeping their word on things like this
---
Yes it was. I know from experience camping the ship pole and getting a 48/h ban from GMs. I also got warned on NW not to do it either. You can't stand out of reach of players to kill them.
---
This might actually be an actually "Unpopular Opinion" - props for being the first (possibly) I have ever seen as such.
---
Side note: players always could have, and should have, switched servers by leveling new toons. I know it's a lot of "work" but if we're not happy, we control our environment. It's like leaving a bad job for a better one. We as people tend to stay where we are even when we aren't happy, because of some misguided notion of comfort. Interestingly enough, the people who tend to migrate and accept new challenges, are often better for it...
---
But that's just my 2 cents worth...
---
What score? What world are you living in? Deluded.
---
dude seriously? how fucking hard can it be to correct the coding sequence of the spell already?
---
So you plan to melee your opponents and hope for a lucky proc instead of cast at them? I really dont think this item is good for an ele sham.
---
If it's anything like my server, plan out which dungeons you need to do and just do them in any order.  Getting a group as a DPS isn't the easiest thing.
---
From the realm discord, looks like &lt;ONSLAUGHT&gt; on skeram went to arcanite reaper. Should provide horde side with some life
---
PvP sets have a lot of BiS for Warriors and Feral Druids. Rest have some mix here and there. Weapons themselves will last you until Naxx.
---
&gt; They should be able to not deal with queues if they don't want.
---
Do you know what "faction-specific" means?
---
Where does wowhead get their numbers from? How do we know they are accurate. I also talking about the wow population in general across the whole game.
---
Never go 31/20 holy shock is garbage go 30/21. Bos is really big for pally tanks otherwise you take a fuckton of damage. 
---
If your not doing cutting edge raiding though go 20/31 your heales will thank you when you tank dungeons and you can still heal real well because pallys are just strong healers in general.
---
Oh yeah I guess I have to spell out how every interaction goes to end up at the point where you're in the guild discord.
---
The number of times where you've self-rekt.
---
what you are describing is safespoting which has little to do with pvping out of guard los.
---
I knew the real you would come out eventually. Welcome, troll.
---
So you wouldnt let someone in the guild join your discord?
---
Yeah, it did. I was doing Scholo at the time. We kept getting interrupted, that's true. But we were only offline for a minute or two before able to get back in. We finished Scholo, yes slower than we would have otherwise, but it still wasn't a big deal to me.
---
Doesn't bother me. I remember server troubles happening all the time in Vanilla. As a teenager I would rage. Nowadays, i don't care so much.
---
i‚Äôve been in brm for three weeks and either seen it full of horde or empty. i‚Äôve seen horde camping thorium. killing off the fp. the entrance to brm. it usually gets cleared when alliance are going to mc, but i don‚Äôt ever see 16+ alliance players just sitting outside brd. 
---
i see LFG chat pop up when HC clears it out and that‚Äôs maybe once every three hours.
---
Changes are happening, fuck.  All downhill from here.
---
I like seeing the range of my abilities, and to be able to see the GCD
---
You can turn your argument around. Just because people play a few hours a day, doesn't mean content should wait for them.
---
Yeah how is that not a low effort post but a well constructed and funny original meme isn‚Äôt?
---
Clearly phase 2 is going to have people run back for... honor?
---
Correct!
---
Same shit. You can't exploit the game to gank people. Killing people from unreachable places is unfair.
---
being hit capped is insanely important for the main tank, missing abilities = less threat = less dps the rest of your raid can do
---
I think there's a spanner you can get from Gnomergan...
---
Roses and other offhands are pretty neat, I think they come from a rogue pickpocketing.
---
Didn't think it was that bad!
---
The problem with other meme subs are they recycle the same memes, so you feel like you're going insane by checking each day or more.
---
Oh snap, logic bomb ftw! It's amazing more people don't see common sense like this! You should be a politician...
---
user name checks out
---
bro not even spamming. i guess idiots like you still need the /s
---
ü¶Ä
---
Remember Esfand is the same guy who accidentally found the layer exploit for dungeon instances and was allowed to do MC a second time by the GM.
---
In my experience people with sad lives like to make other people sad  :^)
---
Lol, have fun!
---
yep... they even exacerbated the problem by temporarily opening transfers for alliance off the server to Heartseeker...
---
I made good mining with money
---
Why don't you start your own meme WoW Classic subreddit and post all the memes you want there?
---
A lot of people don't like seeing low effort memes spammed when trying to find decent content to read.
---
I say let 'em rot.
---
Macros can also prevent it. Try using a charge macro without tactical mastery like:
---
/cast charge
---
/cast defensive stance 
---
If you spam it quick enough you keep the charge rage. Works for other combos aswell btw
---
Right and I'm looking at a 258 min projected Faerlina Queue time.
---
I mean, forgive me for thinking that bliz doing away with layering meant they have found a better more permanent way of dealing with the queues.  
---
I mean, look guys, you're two days out from the most hyped and highly anticipated phase rollout we're going to see for a loong time and people who have been putting in a lot of time and effort to get ready for it literally aren't going to be able to play.
---
A four hour queue time is more than I can reasonably do by about 3/12 hours.
---
You're beyond delusional. Resorting to calling people troll because you can't make sense at any point?
---
Hmm I haven't heard of any Korean guilds taking a %. We certainly don't. I do all the recruitment/raid roster work and supple repair bot etc out of my own pocket. It's just a service I do as a guild leader and I don't mind it. And let's be honest you really don't need a crazy guild bank with consumables to farm MC/Ony (ezpz)
---
Yeah, I learned a while back that reddit can be pretty toxic. Doesn't matter where you are, anonymity makes people assh*les. I agree with you tho, gets old quick.
---
My favorite story about being gank is when I was leveling a DK fresh into wotlk, level 80 belf pally ganked me for over an hour nonstop. I asked a friend for help and they bring their whole 10man naxx raid and camp him until he graveyard rezzed in thrallmar and logged.
---
So cringy.
---
Makes sense
---
I'm a priest and wish I had a warrior buddy.  There are so many priests lfg (even in guild) and all the tanks get snapped up as soon as they log in.
---
yeah i asked guildies if they needed them first then just handed them out. i really don‚Äôt want to reward people macro spamming her stock. it‚Äôs stupid.
---
This makes sense
---
I was a day one migration type. 10 hours into my character with friends waiting 8 hours in queue I convinced them to GTFO to another server.
---
Everyone was reluctant, but they shut up real quick when they were able to log in immediately instead of waiting another 3 hours.
---
Imagine trying to make other people mad, and ending up being mad your self, pretty pathetic if i do say so my self
---
You are the one that cannot understand what a vanity mount is and why people would want one now.
---
I‚Äôve been loving Classic at least as much as I hoped I would.  It‚Äôs a shame how much nitpicking there is.  Yes, there are mistakes but this feels almost exactly like 2005.  
---
It even includes people making the same complaints that would be solved with the same quality of life improvements that led to the game we all didn‚Äôt want.
---
Fish off hand. I think its like a 17 pound fish or something like that.
---
An hour or so on Tuesdays typically.  Tonight several hours.  Other than Tuesday nights not much of a queue ever.
---
My record was 14 before i stop caring. No video tho, just had fun one day.
---
The bm builds I found have you put all your points into bm until you get the level 40 talent then it's a beeline to gain shot afterwards
---
You made the claim, I provided my proof, the onus of proof is on you friend
---
I'm **so** looking forward to Hogger and the Defias quest line!!
---
I'm telling people they can get it more than 5 times faster later. Nice try though. I couldn't care less why anyone would want it. If someone was considering doing the grind they might not after learning that the grind is done more than 5 times faster in BC.
---
This was very common for a while on retail servers too..
---
If you don't get geared, you get tons of money. That's a win-win.
---
Last raid I got no gear, no money, and a bunch of costs for repairs and mats.. GDKP is much better in that case.
---
‚ÄúHe can do arts, let him produce a series!‚Äù
---
its not the same shit. one has a counterplay, the other hasn't.
---
It never does...  Did some more or less humorous approaches to say humans are idiots... But it seems Reddit is full of small ego human players down voting such things...  
---
Drawing is nice nevertheless.
---
He very possibly may never have figured out what stances are
---
Wait, can priest/warrior 2-man jump runs?
---
Insulting me, isn‚Äôt a counter argument.
---
But yes I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs common courtesy to give a simple answer to anyone who seriously responds to an open request.
---
This is moronic
---
In a situation like this though, if both sides can't do anything then the defenders win by default. It *is* an advantage for the Alliance here if you consider the Horde being unable to kill the boss their fail state.
---
My server too - honestly thought queues would be a much bigger deal and was willing to pay the price regardless to be on a vibrant and active realm. It's kind of crazy how they only kick in at the same time each day and that's very easy to play around at least.
---
annnnd its GONE
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=296229/the-keyring-wont-come-with-phase-2-to-be-added-later-this-year
---
i played ret in wotlk and mostly did arena 2v2s.
---
they were utterly broken. so much burst + utility for pvp was insane
---
We as in everyone who understands logic. For your sake I wish people couldn't see the comments.
---
cringe
---
No point in further discussion.
---
There went a bluepost out just now keyring wont come with phase 2 apparently lol
---
100% its a questline, you fight like 5 guys. one of which is a very large human
---
He thinks pve means they dont fight whatsoever just a friendly hello here and there
---
If it gets super bad, I‚Äôm able to Holy nova DM:E lashers down solo at lvl 55 so that‚Äôs always an option. Exp is balls though.
---
And back to what I said, the thread is on fire but everyone else is wrong.
---
Yeah. Did this quite a few times on NA servers for vanilla through to WotLK.
---
Find competent tanks in 5-mans, inspect their gear and ask about their guild. /who to see how many active players they've got. If they're taking two days to clear MC you might want to steer clear.
---
If a Rogue levelled his lock picking up, shouldn‚Äôt he get the chest when ever it‚Äôs locked? Unless there were a Blacksmith to contest? Why is a Rogue blacklisted for taking locked chests? People argue that the Rogue wouldn‚Äôt have made it to the chest without the groups help. Is the Blacksmith not the same then?
---
Yep, my client crashed during the last part of the raid and at every point before the lag got pretty horrible when we clashed.
---
I took my Guild and did Thunderbluff the day before to test the waters and we got pretty bad lag during large AOE with just 40 of us. Was completely unsurprising when we ended up in a slideshow defending but was ready for it. Told my guys to stay as far back as possible to reduce number of players drawn, pre-cast everything, run around when moving instead of trying to mount or cast anything, etc.  Only thing that you can't plan for is a client crash but if all of your clients go down you can safely assume the same is happening for the enemy so just gotta get back in as quickly as possible.
---
It's like public transportation- they want ever ELSE to use it
---
We don‚Äôt! At this point I‚Äôm almost hoping that it *doesn‚Äôt* come on Thursday, just to see the meltdown.
---
Of course but our guild isn't inviting people to the guild so they can listen in on the raid.
---
&gt; You know people have had their account banned by using Chrome remote desktop as it apparently violates TOS. Use caution...
---
This is simply not true.
---
Right, so it doesn't do anything to help anyone camp. Camping is not about targeting as fast as possible it's about predicting where the player will res and getting to them as fast as possible.
---
Was going to post the same thing. Was on Burning Legion during wotlk, many gdkp runs, mostly at the end of the xpac cycle. Had a couple issues when too many people were there just for the gold farm and not enough bidders, lol.
---
It still is only a few weeks after launch
---
85 minute que time on stallag alliance, fuck this man
---
I understand idealistically it's amazing. Just like communism is amazing on paper. I'm reality? Sounds good, doesn't work. Not with 40 people. In smaller raids absolutely.
---
Last word hehelmaorekt
---
Try doing duo or trio Jump runs in DM:West, you can do lasher packs pretty well solo as well if you have gear.
---
Yes, Fury Tank and Holy Priest with decent gear.
---
I'll just drop our PoV of the final Magni push in direct response as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrOesohILk
---
Are they upping spawn rates for herbs/ore?
---
Do you watch twitch? Whats the big deal about streamers.
---
you can get a shovel south of GoldShire from the Tunnel Rats.
---
&gt; Only ~half of players at lvl60 have their epic mount. Lot of people struggling with that gold grind.
---
This is honestly way more than I thought pre-launch. The gold grind has proven itself to be way shorter than I expected - both from my personal experience getting an epic mount and half of 60s having one.
---
I did a few of those in wotlk and it was 100% reportable as long as rules are clearly stated beforehand (everyone was using the same copypasted message). No idea if they'd enforce it in classic though.
---
This is NOT being added in phase 2 as confirmed by a blue post
---
That's what this update is fixing, see my comment from the developers clearly saying the intention is the guards attacking during pvp
---
Where the hell  are the warriors on that dps meter. I know rag is harsh on us but that's crazy.
---
Why did we want to remove layering..? To make 99% of gold farming impossible?
---
Lol is a mage complaining about getting into a dungeon run? I'm just checking becuase thats hilarious if so. On my server if your anything but a mage/lock/heals your fucked in doing dungeons hope there nothing you need in them. Last 40 ive ran have been with guildies becuase it will take 5 hours to get a group otherwise.
---
Be patient, guys, Blizzard is just a small indie company and they can't add a keyring feature in the game so quickly.
---
Lol damn, dude. He was just trying to join your conversation. 
---
Classic horde rogue
---
Its funny because on my server it‚Äôs almost exclusively the alliance killing lowbies, but it‚Äôs always fun welcoming them to the lowbie zones by destroying them lol and hunting them down until they give up
---
Well that sucks.
---
How many warnings do you want blizz to have given before you realise highest pop realms will have big queues? And I say this as someone on such a realm.
---
This system is pretty standard in Korean MMOs for example Blade and Soul there its the standard loot option in-game for dungeon and raids. Like you said it has Pros and Cons but in the end, it has too many cons for me. you can easily milk person for their gold when you know they want an item (not normally in a guild environment but for example in pugs you can expect that) and secondly the person with the bigger pocket will get what he wants for example can a Mage outbid every other caster easily because they have much easier farm than for example a Lock
---
Why wait even longer? It was originally added in the naxx patch so why not just release it now if they aren't gonna stick to the original timeline anyway.
---
1) That's not the ToS and 2) That's not specifically referring to safespotting which has nothing to do with avoiding guards specifically, that's just one way of safespotting.
---
That post doesn't even say that you can't camp rooftops it just says that you can't avoid guards doing so, but if the guards aren't in a position to aggro in the first place it's perfectly fine.
---
Was just thinking the same thing!
---
I have no problem allowing the rogue to keep a locked chest because he went out of his way to level lock picking. People argue he wouldn‚Äôt have made it their without the group, but without the rogue the chest wouldn‚Äôt be relevant. /shrug
---
I‚Äôd say it should be seen as the same.
---
Shazzrah is NOT balanced though. Plenty more horde than alliance, although this is the case for the majority of PvP servers.
---
Nice post man! Youre right let me just transfer off!!! Oh wait, I cant.
---
Lol I don't understand these people that go out of their way to be dicks.
---
I don't think they'd redistribute gold though so cold comfort to those who went for the payout. Pretty confident he faces consequences for his actions though as almost everyone reported him.
---
grays bro! my guild got ours last week.
---
Devout set for deeps and +healing on pretty much everything else XD. Will probably try this tonight, if possible.
---
Check his name, he is a troll. Just ignore and move on
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be fury/prot. Can do it as arms or fury pretty efficiently
---
"never" is a bit if a stretch. Blizzard definitely has its moments in misr dungeons, especially if u have impblizz. But yeah not most dps by any means.
---
Found a cool bear bone weapon in felwood the other day, just a gray, looks like a femur
---
Raise your hand if you‚Äôve been personally victimized by rule 7
---
You're not making any sense. Many people believing one things doesn't make it true. 1 is still 1 even if the entire world but me thought otherwise. That's how logic works. 
---
Stop trying to use others as a shield, you're pathetic.
---
transfer to some server where nobody plays...yeah right
---
Find a badass warrior and do some duo jump runs. You could also 3 man it but that cuts into profits
---
This is what it looked like on dial up in vanilla... After fifteen minutes if loading everything
---
No I'm aware, I'm just doing the right thing, providing proof for people who read the thread, remaining civil, that way people find something constructive from it :)
---
&gt; Holy Shield, hit for 150+ every time you block
---
can you MAKE them hit you, though? No. You don't counter rogues, you\`re just a slow-moving, easily avoidable environmental hazard to them, kinda like that Teremus dragon in Blasted Lands.
---
[Nah, they've decided to delay it further........](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=296229/the-keyring-wont-come-with-phase-2-to-be-added-later-this-year)
---
You guys have overused that word. You can't use it anymore.
---
Yeah give trio runs a shot, having mining or herbalism is pretty key though.
---
Fuck them.
---
How is raiding? Judging from Warcraft logs, it seems fairly non existent.
---
Top comment
---
Ohh, that's actually great to know! That gives me some relief, thanks buddy :D
---
Oof
---
So.. You want War Mode in classic?  
---
    
---
Yeah no thanks.
---
did you actually level up as boomkin? I can't imagine the pain
---
Not more of this entitled greedy ass millennial shit again
---
Read the dev note. They said this fix is to make guard logic fit closer to what was intended and what was intended was if you PVP inside of goblin cities, goblin guards attack. 
---
Notice how they didn't say "unless you are standing outside of the range of the guards"
---
Outside the city, who gives a fuck. Inside, be prepared. That seems like pretty basic for anyone to understand.
---
Depends, do you want to run Jed/Rend or do you want to run full?
---
Holy crap what's the point of having a job then? I farmed 2k this week, that's like $16k/month if I was in Korea?
---
not true.  i've tested this by attacking level 30 people in the middle of gadgetzan.  no way in hell they have a friendly rep with steemwheedle at that low level and the guards jumped me
---
All layers turned off for phase 2. People coming back for phase 2
---
You need some food servers
---
On second thought, let‚Äôs not go to Ironforge. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a silly place.
---
What have you tried farming with Holy Nova?
---
1,000 person queue on Incendius rn, RIP.
---
Why are the koreans always better?
---
"you're wrong because you're wrong, you are ignorant!"
---
Nice counterargument.
---
I patrol low level zones and if a higher level is killing lowbies I camp them until they leave. 
---
I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher of hillsbrad. I am the shield that guards the realms of the horde.
---
Get barov peasant caller. Palas are best healer, bubble and poison cleanse and shadow aura and retribution aura. Be fury prot or dps spec, use preferably plate gear. Tank the last boss behind the pillar so you don't aggro lashers, preferably have engineering and mining.
---
I thought character transfers became buyable today? did they not?
---
Way easier to do solo farming than dungeons at work.
---
You'll generally want the following items:  
---
Strath Live - Star of Mysteria  
---
Strath UD - Crimson Felt Hat  
---
Sublime Bracers - DM Guards (Non-trib run)  
---
Hands of Power - LBRS  
---
Belt - Ban'thok Sash from BRD  
---
Pants - Skyshroud Leggings from LBRS  
---
Boots - Omnicast Boots from BRD  
---
MH - Witchblade from Scholo (Alternatively the Rod of Ogre Magi is a great 2h staff from DM tribute)   
---
Wand - Bonecreeper Stylus from Scholo  
---
Eye of the Beast - Quest starting in LBRS, finishes in UBRS  
---
Briarwood Reed - UBRS (Rare spawn)  
---
BRD/LBRS would be good since there are a few items available for you there, plus there's a quest starting in LBRS that takes you to UBRS for the BiS trinket.
---
So if you cast Holy Shield, the rogue will stop hitting you for the next 10 seconds? Seems like a pretty hard counter to me.
---
You need a space after the - in order to create a bullet point list, and each needs to be at the beginning of their own line
---
Why did they even ban people for going there?
---
Unlike professions it doesn't cost Rogues anything to picklock, it's simply part of the utility their class brings to the group.
---
Raiding.. Won a Major Rejuvenate Recipe for 800g and my crappy Girdle sold for 750g.. those alone got me my mount, all other important boe‚Äôs for my spec
---
fishing is good for healers who don't wanna respec every raid
---
really? I thought killing guards results in dhk. Am I wrong? If that is the case, it's pretty easy to avoid dhks.
---
Sounds like you'd be better off on a solo private server and not playing an MMO
---
Did you drink alcohol ? Each level your drunk you see everyone a level lower.
---
Your character is drunk - it makes mobs and players appear a lower level.
---
I believe if you're drunk enemies appear to be a lower level.
---
Were you drunk?
---
is your character drunk?
---
beeing drunk reduces the visible level of enemies
---
Except it‚Äôs not happening.
---
Saved
---
I wonder if all the accounts being used to sell gold are accounts of past customers?
---
Ah I see
---
The problem with gdkp systems are that when people form an internal agreement to low bid items.
---
Ie all the 4 in raid shamans agree to let each person bid 1g for each item.  They then spend much less per item and reap the reward for the high cost mage items.
---
This is how rifts in relationships and guild drama starts...

---
Guards don‚Äôt count. It‚Äôs fairly easy, but with some AOE stuff... it just takes one person to nuke a raid.
---
There's normally a min gold to enter on these raids and generally forced bidding on upgrades
---
Doesn't look like you'll be playing much judging by that queue :D
---
Your level doesn't matter to me.  Lvl 60 or level 40 i kill on sight
---
bring the player, not the class.  I tank as a shaman at 60 and I don't think ever had aggro issues. mitigation is another thing
---
Egg quest?  Like the Santa cookie quest where you need to farm eggs to make gingerbread?  If so, then I pretty certain it will be, since they did the Halloween season like it was in Vanilla. 
---
If you mean something else, I'm not sure what you mean.
---
It is overused, but this makes me cringe to have 8 slots in my bank and 3 in bag being taken by this goofy system.
---
it's not fine rofl. anyone on vanilla who had the slightest interest in their ranking NEVER EVER joined a raid that might kill and NPC in the open world.
---
In case you don't realise, if a single person kills some lvl 10 vendor with accidental AOE, the entire raid of 40 loses rank.
---
How do you even raid a city when all they have to do is have some unflagged people walk on top of you and pop sappers? Haven't seen a full on raid on IF yet but they tried summoning people into random houses and that's how it worked out every time.
---
Once in the jaw after they demand to be paid, once in the balls for demanding a reserve, and once in the stomachs just cause, so three. 
---
The need three hits.
---
Takes a lot of discipline then. Thank you. so yeah no pugging. id only go with a trusted team.
---
Knew it. Keyring has been delayed for technical reasons, not historical accuracy.
---
Hoping this "first client update" means some progress on the many bugged items in this game and the server performance in mass PVP.
---
To clarify, I was drunk. Lol, thanks for the explanation.
---
You're wasted
---
#nochanges Let's multiply the total online population by 3-4x the old vanilla max woo!
---
I would like even more to have stuff like this drawn for all kinds of notable bosses and quests and when you do it, you get the picture in an ingame gallery. 
---
It would be so cool to have stuff like pictures of these scarlet bosses etc.
---
Me too. Why would the cage even be there if not for cage fighting?
---
Breastplate of Bloodthirst is BiS for druids until p5 or so.
---
Meh, brokentooth is the basicbitch pet. When everything is dominated by BiS, it‚Äôs nice to actually use your brain and pick something you like rather than what you‚Äôre told to use. 
---
Always get mad props to other 60 hunters rocking unique pets.
---
Got it. Thanks for the clarification.
---
And Blackrock Mountain 50 extra layers of bones.    
---
It shall be called the Road of Corpseruns.
---
This is what I've been wondering.  Single layer on Skeram was fine until just tonight, now the que is through the roof.
---
What happened?
---
they are VERY small servers. economy and raiding / dungeon opportunities reflect that. anyone going there is taking a big chance that they will stay dead permanently, with like 2 guilds total barely setting foot in MC
---
the problem is that some people don't want to avoid it, and it just takes 1 person a few seconds to delete weeks of grinding progress from 39 other players before they realize what happened
---
Was Stalagg on one layer? That's probably why big servers are getting hit with large queues right now.
---
On one of the best guilds on this server, so I get to run dungeons just about anytime of day, but I do agree. Will be interesting when they open non-free transfers.
---
Great learning experience for me though, new to wow in general and would not be able to have learned anything otherwise.
---
Memes are definitely not the lifeblood of the internet lol. 
---
The internet was better before memes made people feel like they have to beat every single joke into the ground.
---
It's being updated by the author pretty frequently, what do you mean?
---
Yeah memory is a bit hazy lol

Note for you: apply dot with higest rank of Moonfire and continue Moonfire with one rank lower than your max learned for correct dmg output. Why? Coz spamming highest rank overwrites the dot while lower rank does direct dmg &amp; highest rank dot same time going on whole time. It does not overwrite the DOT so you get the most of it.  
---
And ye enjoy Boomie, TBC is great in few years.
---
They play more and no-life it harder on average.
---
Damn, few hours? Heck that.
---
The post launch development on this game is disappointing, so many items and mechanics that are taking months to fix.
---
Preach! Lol I love getting revenge all the leather wearing warriors as a rogue.
---
Big subs are dont seem sane because when one demographic gets their needs satisfied the opposing one becomes louder. Happens a lot really, circlejerks are inevitable

Alchemy and Fishing. Rich till the end of Classic.

DUUURRRRRRRR HE DRAWRED GOOD NETFLIX HIRE THIS MAN NOWWWW
---
Explains why these lowbies keep killing me. ;) Thanks!
---
Hawkeye increases the distance from which you can use your auto shot/skill shots, it doesn‚Äôt change the width of multi. So instead of only being able to auto shot/Serpent Sting etc from up to 35 yards away you‚Äôll be able to do those from up to 41 yards away.
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt a Rogue benefit from their class perk? Mages make money off food and portal services. Everything has a cost and time is an expensive price to pay.
---
and tbh even if it did, you are part of a group doing inheritly dishonorable actions in killing citizens. it doesn't make these actions impossible, just lays a penalty on those actions and if your group is ok with the penelty keep up the city raiding. and I remember taking part in city raids in BC and wrath. and I watched friends do it in vanilla. even with the penalty it'll be a thing.
---
Speaking from experience, you don't need the points in the prot tree to tank dungeons, UBRS or even off-tanking mobs in MC. It's all about gear, which you accumulate extremely fast when tanking.
---
Personally speaking, the first three rows of the fury tree are useless and not worth grabbing on their own.
---
All of this basically leads you into choosing to go deep in one of the three specs. When I reached 60 I was in my arms leveling spec 31/20/0 and tanked dungeons just fine. Sweeping Strikes excels at holding aggro with 2+ mobs.
---
Before my first MC I specced 20/34/0
---
Did they ever say anything about lowering caps after removing layers? I though getting to a single layer was the final step?
---
I assumed that since we were on a single layer and had no queues we were in the clear?
---
The main reason to kill hydrospawn is because he has 15% essence of water drop which will ah for quite a nice price.
---
They did it to help mitigate and prevent PvP slideshow that they know is coming. 
---
They can‚Äôt relayed, they can‚Äôt fix the servers, they can‚Äôt delay PvP honor system. Last option is to give transfers and queues to thin out servers.
---
Bingo. Had a similar experience when selecting a server to start on at launch. Haven't regretted it, tbh.
---
Oh it absolutely is! That's why it's important to change it to how it originally was. There are a lot of things that are really strong in classic that probably shouldn't have been that way. But this is how it truly was in all of classic wow, and they've kept #nochanges for everything. Why change this? Again, bliz even acknowledges it on their list of known bugs, I just wish they'd put some pep in their step to fix it
---
Orc racial is broken, yes. Its the best in game.
---
That being said, WoTF is very comparable to SF, EA and Perception in WSG. The other Horde racials are shit. Warstomp is a meme.
---
Orc stun resist is also very situational. Yes you have the charge advantage and nades are much less effective against you but premade PvP as an Orc you're almost never dealing with rogues, impact or blackout. Nova on the other hand is a killer. 
---
Your overrate dispels, its a reactionary spell. Yes they are strong but the fact that you can pre-buff a warrior before the battle begins creates GCD pressure on Horde priest and shamans. It means Horde starts 3-4 GCD's behind in every fight.
---
Props, my dude. I'm still hackin' the darts like she's goin' outta style. Workin' man's life eh...
---
What the fuck is going on over there? How hard is it to implement something that has been in the game for years and years?
---
We've had like 10 "first patches" so far and still no keyring.
---
How do you figure that? It's supply vs. demand. He's -1 for supply this way. If he bought it from AH he's +1 for demand. The outcome is the same.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised at how much better the human mind grasps an icon floating on a line at the bottom or top of your screen over a numerical countdown on an icon or a bunch of random bars slowly dissolving. 
---
I‚Äôve played wow for ages and of all the various gimmicky Addons and what not, this one changes things the most but in such a subtle way that you don‚Äôt even get it until you don‚Äôt have it.

It reads combat logs, it doesn't do anything that breaks the game.
---
I wonder if a ban wave came out, how that would implicate the guild
---
If other people are farming 1k+ over a week, that's awesome. Their bids go up, which means your cut goes up.  
---
If you're only logging for Raids to get gear you'd lose out in Loot Council anyways? Otherwise your argument just sounds like 'people who put in more effort than me get better results', which is how it always works in anything in life.
---
No system is perfect or we'd all be using it. I just see less downsides in this one. You can Raid log once a week and get gear or make money. DKP if you don't get gear you have nothing.
---
Sorry I worded it wrong I guss.
---
 you're actually still early
---
Not true at all, might have been true at very start of classic but this is just some spread bullshit that has gone on forever. my 3k+ gold is not worth  6k ‚Ç¨  it's complete BS, if so I'd do just like ur saying just brain afk gold farm while watching netflix and be filthy rich in few months
---
A LOT of people on this sub are heavy users of wow. I hesitate to call them no lifers due to the blow back and due to that probably being an even more intense type of player.
---
There have been dozens of comments on this sub with a ton of upvotes from people saying things like "You say you're casual but I consider myself a casual and even at ONLY 2 hours per day I was able to make it to 60 with no problem"
---
People don't appreciate that being able to jump on a video game for a couple of hours several nights a week is a luxury that many of us cannot afford.
---
I get maybe 8 hours of playing time a week and that's mostly confined to the weekends, I just hit level 40 and don't anticipate making 60 until the end of December. People consider that a snail's pace and would hesitate to even call me casual, in their eyes I'm not even really playing.
---
People in this sub, for better or worse, dedicate a LARGE amount of their free time to playing a video game and don't understand why others can't do the same. I'm not saying they shouldn't do that, it's their lives do what makes you happy, but at least try to appreciate that the grand majority of us cannot meet that time commitment.
---
incorrect, you can time it so it repeats
---
Report them. It is actionable to macro/bot recipes. I've had several campers disappear.
---
Yeah I've probably rgot like 500 downvotes by now for telling people this.
---
Edited.
---
That's extremely saddening.
---
1. Raid Reset Day
---
2. Phase 2 dropped
---
It's people who thought the patch was today/ preparing for the patch release on Thursday.
---
I didn‚Äôt wait a single 6 hour que lol, I got on early hours pre-que cause I took a few days off work to commit. I did have to quit early launch night cause of the crash/kick to end of queue bs. I transferred when they opened to try to help with low pop servers fill out (I waited 3 days but felt I was part of the problem - the ‚Äúeveryone else will transfer‚Äù mentality) 
---
Also I had 225 fishing so I told my friends they could join me on new realm, I wasn‚Äôt doing that again. 
---
So put the soapbox away homie
---
Nah, even being neutral in the city will get the guards after your attacker.
---
&gt; if i went and played soccer with 20 of my friends and scored a self goal losing my team the game then i would understand 10 of them being upset by it yes.
---
You and I have very different expectations of what playing soccer with friends is supposed to be. Scoring on your own time sounds like a hilarious turn of events.
---
A more comparable example is accidentally kicking the ball over the fence. The game stops, everyone is waiting until you retrieve the ball, etc. You know what doesn't happen? People raging and calling others retards, etc.
---
Frustration is fine, but the nerdrage I've witnessed is only really seen in some gaming communities.
---
I wonder if GDKP would work for selling runs. Getting like 30 dudes clearing MC with 10 dudes cutting the check. Shit I bet the really good dudes could run two split runs with 20/20 and get stupid money
---
I promise you there are people that have never heard of this addon that now know about it and are installing it because of this post.
---
It's all in combat logs tho, someone with enought knowledge about the game could see it by himself IIRC
---
If you‚Äôre trying to do sunder armor and then demoralizing shout right after in the same macro, probably not because there is a GCD
---
So much for getting 53 tonight.. came home to a 2000+ queue with a 2 hour wait time.

What add on is the top bar? I see it in a lot of posts. Thanks
---
It didn't crash. I was defending IF the whole time with no disconnects.
---
Is that actually a thing? Stealth'ed nearby players are shown in combat?
---
&gt;Learn to play noob, and spy won't wreck your day anymore
---
I did the grind.  Completed it yesterday.
---
The only reason I'd advocate to avoid the grind right now is because it will be absolutely impossible without layering.  I'd avoid it until phase 3 or 4 since phase 1 is now over.  I had about 5 nights in a row of a group of 5-8 horde corpse camping me so I had to constantly hop layers.  That is now no longer an option.
---
Super happy I have the mount on a gnome now.  Your opinion means nothing to me.
---
What do you fish?
---
Two things:
---
First, that's shit.
---
Second, to the people here being like "hurr durr indie company": in game development there are priorities. I don't know what they are doing now, but surely the keyring isn't a priority.
---
I can live without it. I will complain that it's not there yet. But being arrogant assholes helps no one.
---
Just for the record, this is a game. You want just and fair in a game that is designed to pitch good vs evil? Plays sims or some shit. This is WoW and life isn‚Äôt fair. Gank all you want, if that bothers you then see if blizzard with start at server for conscientious objectors. A land where humans and orcs circle jerk each other while working to increase their fishing skills...
---
Fishing is an extremely good profit maker when you get it to 300. Go fish up some squids and the money will come to you.
---
Maybe you should get better at being sneaky
---
No not entirely, majority are korean. I would say guild chat is 50/50. We have people from all over the world in our guild (117 members) and English is the common language. Personally I‚Äôm learning korean and love practicing my korean while playing WoW. It‚Äôs fun playing with an extremely culturally diverse group as well
---
Thats the point, you reward dedication.
---
Getting 300-500g every week for 2 hours spent, oh boohoo how  punishing can only use that next week for not the most sought after bidded items.
---
Armor looks so cool on the pally.. Too bad it's impossible to get.
---
What tools counter stuns, cc break bubbles, poison depells, heals, and low cost aoe for stealth break? Oh and lets tack on plate armor for natural melee dmg mitigation.
---
That's actually ridiculous. I'd love an explanation, even if it's just "we've run into some technical difficulties with its implementation" or whatever.
---
But instead they just keep pushing it back inexplicably. Really annoying.
---
Titans panel, it‚Äôs the best!
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to find out exactly what phase 2 means
---
It‚Äôs the same as DKP though, especially with multiple tiers relevant. How do you get items when there‚Äôs a dude with 6x your DKP? You wait and don‚Äôt pay the premium price. If you‚Äôre constantly clearing MC and Ony every week, there‚Äôs only so much gear that can drop before your paying 10g for an upgrade because no one else needs it.
---
My record was 16 before i stop caring, no video unfortunately
---
ü¶Äü¶ÄJMODS WILL NOT RESPOND TO THIS THREADü¶Äü¶Ä
---
I had been keeping track of some reddit posts where the authors believed without a doubt that layers would not be removed by phase 2. I think these people just want something to be angry about:  [https://i.imgur.com/NIFiBBT.png](https://i.imgur.com/NIFiBBT.png)
---
sounds like it someone else doing the angerforge runs and then you zone in when the boss is about to die and loot hoj if it drops, similar to mara blackstone rings
---
It wouldn‚Äôt, also we don‚Äôt buy gold. If some asshat is doing it we have no way of knowing, but we certainly wouldn‚Äôt be held responsible for it.
---
No need to ignore a locked chest just because I lost the roll either. If the only way to open the chest is with a key, its my chest, and up to me if I want to allow others to roll on the loot.
---
Gear prio:
---
2 MTs &gt; DPS &gt; Heals &gt; OTs for Armor. We have onslaught belt to our MT for threat gen (I‚Äôm a DPS warrior and I‚Äôm okay with that as it means I don‚Äôt pull threat as often and I‚Äôm already a top DPS).
---
DPS &gt; Tanks/Healers for Weapons designed for DPS. Although our guild gave both warrior Maintanks a Quel‚ÄôSerrar and both druids had a wardens staff (2 groups).
---
Gtz on better RNG
---
Wtf... That was the main thing I was looking forward to
---
i remember doing this in wotlk. its a good system.
---
It's extremely horde heavy
---
Do you guys set role limits to prevent people taking offset gear?
---
Lol no. They attack you even if ur exalted
---
I guess people have just got a lot better at raiding these days.  Back in the day MC was a challenge, I played in a average raiding guild then, even with full 40 man teams and people flasking etc it took us a long time to clear MC, we were stuck on Rag for about 2/3 months if I recall, the main hiccup being people didn't have enough FR gear.
---
That's like saying I need to steal money to match the cost of living. 
---
One could just farm gold and not buy since 1) it is prohibited by  the TOS, 2) besides the AH, rides, and repairs, there's not much use for gold so it's going to accumulate ANYWAYS
---
Yep - if you're in a small number class (druid, hunter, warlock) it's simpler to just round robin pieces at base gold/dkp values and save up for the big drops. Meanwhile big classes like mage/rogue/war are burning their gold/dkp on set pieces due to competiton.
---
To a certain extent... a mage can‚Äôt spend gold on a melee dps item to meme on people. Other than that no, a dps warrior can certainly bid on a t1 set and a healing Druid can bid on feral gear
---

Name another class that can pvp naked
---
ignore this shit OP. it doesnt even make sense.
---
saw speculation that they've lowered the max people online at once in anticipation of pvp lag.
---
Thank you Blizzard for honoring your promise to remove layering.
---
I still stand by my original position that layering should have never existed in the first place. It did diminish the experience of the first few months of the game.
---
People have been doing this since at least TBC. It's okay but it 100% guarantees that the people who have no job and farm all day every day get every item first. You simply will not be able to compete with them on gold (even including the split of the gold pot you are getting each reset) until they have all the items they want from the tier. Instead of using performance (or favouritism) like loot council or attendance like dkp as currency to obtain loot, it simply becomes who has the most free time to farm and play the AH.
---
yes, thank you for the grammar lesson :D
---
didn't knew that :(
---
Thats me when my mate doesnt come online... I am the priest D:
---
Nope, we have someone assigned in every group who gets 1/8th the gold and gets a raid icon on their head. People line up to their respective dude and get their 1/40th cut
---
Bid logging is done on excel and a macro which posts the tally after every boss
---
No wrong.
---
Yeah, and your best attacks have flat +damage that doesn't scale with gear.
---
You're fun to downvote
---
Imo make faction leaders drop loot or gold. Give more incentive for city raids
---
yes thank you! :3
---
[PRINTS](https://society6.com/imadreamwalker)
---
Actually you can see in the picture the icons for gold distributors
---
Pummeled
---
This sounds probable.
---
Yes but resulting in DDoS isn't related to too many players at once. Its a person or group of person that target that and exploit some weakness in it.
---
How about they just don't have shitty servers that can accomodate their paying customer player base?
---
Agreed, but also that kind of makes sense. Time invested scales with reward
---
If he doesn't make good calls no one will stay
---
Ok. So when all the WoW Classic phases are done, everyone's going back to private vanilla servers, right?
---
Congrats you linked the one video I mentioned (funny I don't recall any ret paladins being in that video). You also realize that that video is before patch 1.12? So since that video there are already class balances out and implemented.
---
Remember that combo I just listed? Welp you opened up on someone wearing no gear; guess who dies in less than 18 seconds.
---
Especially on Horde I think 2h is superior with wf
---
Well, anyone who isn't interested in bidding on items is getting paid to be there so you can bring an arbitrary number of PUGs so long as you can still clear it. You could have people truly carried but they wouldn't be expecting to bid high prices against each other. This way there's no freeloaders and higher prices keep it profitable.
---
I recall reading a more in depth discussion about how Korean guild culture is quite a bit different and what we would consider normal all-guild runs are less common. Essentially most raiding happens in these sorts of mixed groups. The only time I've ever seen this type of run dominate in western WoW was the long year of ICC.
---
Not sure if anyone is claiming it to be so, but good to know it already is implemented and functioning on other servers
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
This is not a suprise. When blizzard added more layers they also increased the realm cap so those layers wouldn‚Äôt feel empty. This was stated from the beginning. Today was the first reduction of realm cap.  People have been telling you for months there would be ques when layering went away... not their fault you didn‚Äôt listen
---
Only one guild on all of Incendius is top 25, scuba cops.

They're listed on Warcraft logs.

Basically just use axes and you'll be alright
---
Awesome job? 
---
They havent fixed bugs they acknowledge as legit issues in Sept. Hunters FD+Trap is bugged, plus other issues people are experiencing, spell batching is shit and they just ignore it. 
---
They havent dont anything to improve the servers and the lag which are no going to be a massive issue. They failed to realize layers would be abused. 
---
It feels like they are understaffed to me for classic at least.   
---
That doesnt even get into the launch server issues and the massive faction imbalance which will now cause real issues. IDK that doesnt feel like an awesome job, it feels like they've done the bare minimum to make the most profits.
---
We could 7-man heroic ICC and sell 3 slots. Based on 3rd party gold-selling sites, I remember thinking I was making $10-15/hr while playing WoW (which I would be doing anyways).  Was able to realize some of that income by having guildies order me pizza to my dorm in exchange for in game gold. Ah, those were the days.
---
Incentive.
---
But good point.
---
All the runs I see have (ore) reserved and I was told it ain‚Äôt worth unless there splitting it. Are herbs worth the run or should I be putting my foot down and have loot shared?
---
Reroll on pvp it's better than playing a shell of the game.
---
The saltines continues tisk tisk
---
It‚Äôs very unlikely you will be a protection warrior tanking raids once you hit 60. Warrior is the most played class but most fights in raids require 2-3 tanks. So if you find a raiding guild you more likely end up as a dps warrior who OTs 2 or 3 fights each raid.
---
You will be in high demand to tank 5 mans and ubrs, but not for raids as most guilds will have a couple of heavily geared tanks already
---
It‚Äôs literally in the blue post OP linked. It was hotfixed on the 8th to work correctly, so maybe when that happened to you it was bugged? Idk
---
Any idea when they did that?
---
The technology just isn't there yet.
---
TF is mage hooking?
---
They reduced the realm cap, not the number of players per layer (there are no players per layer anymore just players per realm). They did announce this would be part of their process before the game launched
---
It's cause he's on the browns
---
Which is kind of a bummer‚Äîit‚Äôs kinda fun to just swarm in with a bunch of randos. Maybe form groups within the masses?
---
It depends what you think should be rewarded. I'm not making a value judgment and every loot system will always leave some people disgruntled so gdkp is just as valid as any other.
---
Come on over to Benediction alliance! I was shocked by the number of people in Ironforge and Stormwind on Sunday. I‚Äôve only been playing for 7 days since last Monday, and have been able to find help every time I‚Äôve needed it. Also a ton of nice people I‚Äôve run into.
---
The people who are upset will be the vocal ones, most people don't express contentment, just frustration.
---
So you always visibly see the negative, it's one of the challenges for game designers to figure out what feedback is real and what is just the loudest.
---
You drive a hard bargain! Any suggestions for a us/eastern pvp realm?
---
Correct. The only thing Spy does is show you exactly when that action occurs in the logs.
---
please show me where blizzard said they would be lowering the realm cap. they only said they were merging layers.
---
Theres like 10 guilds on each server doing raids
---
Ignore it then go back after everyone leaves and take it
---
Well at least I‚Äôll get plenty of bag space from not being able to farm as the Skeram horde slaughter me. So the key ring is redundant anyways.
---
Man idk what happened but I went afk for like 15 min and got DCd now I‚Äôm 3500 in the queue. FeelsBadMan
---
Realm caps reduced.
---
Yup, there‚Äôs certainly pros and cons
---
BFD, SFK,SM Gy are the ones I‚Äôve tried a few times but I‚Äôm a tailor/herb so I‚Äôm missing out on the DE/bag space.  Can only imagine VC too and others but I was crossing my fingers for the twink (tree bark) chest that‚Äôs going for a lot rn. Or even a golden pearl that can drop. No luck yet.
---
Can't shaman kill lasher groups solo? If you can do the runs within 12 minutes in DME main entrance, with herb, that's easily 50 g per hour.
---
I'm guessing they lowered Stalagg's cap to try to get more horde to transfer. Too bad its too little too late.
---
BSH in main hand is allright but I found suboptimal due to it's high speed. Doesnt matter that much on single target raid bosses, but whirlwind for example becomes a waste of rage

There are a lot of AH players and farmers who will gladly pay for gear in GDKP runs for their mains or even alts. It will likely get more popular as guilds find themselves gearing out all of their main raiders and bench.
---
I can cleanse blind, it's a poison. So the only thing you have is Sprint. And still, even if you are bobbing and weaving we are both able to hit each other at the same melee range, so all that does is let the paladin get more attacks in versus the rogue who is running in and out of range.

Raiding cities will not be a thing... because someone will always kill a non-guard NPCs. lots of them in fact.

Well i would also say "this is ok" if i am literally standing on the ground without being attacked. Am I supposed to not attack anyone at all or what.
---
if you get sad over being killed in a video game, you are pathetic
---
There was a pvp update last Thursday. It totally disrupted the economy and gold sellers were farming 1000 mil an hour. They hotfixed it over the weekend. The devs don't know shit about pvp and rush updates due to complaints like you've mentioned from the pvp community. That's one of the big reasons the pve scene votes no.
---
Have you gotten in yet?
---
thank you! :D
---
Do you think that it's worth paying 600g for [Axe of the Deep Woods](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=811) and [Flurry Axe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=871), or is the Dal'Rend set better?
---
Dead servers, don't do it. That or re roll on balanced high pop realms like sulfuras, grobbulous, etc
---
I highly doubt it. Why would they?
---
I think it's a combination of people being dramatic aka "servers can't handle going to one layer!!!" Days before blizzard announces most servers are already down to 1 or 2 layers, and melee being stubborn.
---
&gt;In pvp, gnomes and dwarves make alliance slightly better.
---
Against WoTF and orc stun resistance? No. Just no.
---
what phone do you have?
---
This is going to rub you the wrong way so I apologise in advance. 
---
I have checked your discord, it's 95% English. This whole post is a huge circle-joke of 'lol look, Korea plays WoW too and we're foreignere' and it smacks of what I can only describe as Americanism, which is not inherently bad, it just comes off as patronising, imo. I see the same thing every day living here. It's softcore mockery.
---
As for segregation, why don't you just join a Korean guild? Why make an isolated bubble community? I have played Korean servers for years (Legion, BfA and Classic) and I have never once felt the need to announce my foreignness or avoid complete interaction.
---
streamers are on PVP servers, this might have something to do with it.
---
That is like my perfect scenario there to a T. Now quick question, when im getting preraid bis, can i go for bis 1h, 2h and shield or is that being greedy?
---
I was friendly with the entire steamwheedle by a pretty fucking low level.
---
my server has starting bids of 50g on armor and 150g on weapons.  some of the most expensive items are the boe pieces since everyone bids on them hoping to turn a profit through the ah
---
I play on kurinnaxx and it‚Äôs got a pretty balanced pop. And I mean even before phase 2, people are on a pvp server to battle so most likely it‚Äôll make it a little more difficult but expect a fight 4/5 times
---
If it's a PvE server, isn't it more likely that people stopped because there wasn't enough groups/community/raid to play on that faction?
---
How can they just not add the fucking thing
---
Good for you for having your priorities straight and good luck with the kid!
---
Heh, which one?
---
I'm alliance on Netherwind and have had a great time so far. Split feels pretty even horde to alliance. I'd recommend if medium population and no queue is your gig.
---
faerlina from no que to 3k que, might transfer lmao.
---
They're too stupid to be argued with.  Ffs I opened a ticket and got it confirmed that layering doesn't affect the servers capacity and people just said the guy replying to my ticket was wrong lol.
---
shamans warlocks and druids have it the easiest in my raid due to the low numbers and being not essential for raiding.  mages and priests have it tough since there is always a higher number in raids.
---
As far as active raiders I‚Äôm literally the only American. Again the vast majority of our guild are Koreans. What are you even on about? Not going to bother with this anymore
---
The one just south of HG?  That freaking tower is permanent camped
---
I hope you find happiness in something more positive soon.

They do. UD and orcs are just broken in PvP.

I've just been taught that's wrong with English grammar. I'm spanish speaker :D

Its a spot in the inn you could grief from.

I gotta say I am pretty embarassed for the rogues/warriors. Good job, but they should be above you, so thats pretty interesting to see.
---
Replacing people takes time, and a larger than normal time investment can destroy a group too. It's always a complex cost/benefit analysis with many variables some are difficult to know and others are unknowable. Sometimes going with the flow works out fine, other times the fool can cause several wipes and break the group. Every tank should at least consider it an option, but it's not something you should make an one-size-fits-all rule about.
---
First off you must use an axe if you‚Äôre an orc, Orcs have a racial that makes them much better than any other weapon type. I would buy a flurry axe and I did but wouldn‚Äôt buy aotdw unless I was loaded. Flurry axe is bis till the last boss of bwl. Aotdw gets replaced by deathbringer and is less than 10 dps better than Rivenspike.
---
Each layer has a cap of players. Reduce a layer, you reduce the player cap.
---
I know that seems different to what you'd expect, but it's actually how it works, and queue times have increased each time layers were reduced.
---
&gt;If you want to do the grind then that's fine but you're going to become a /cringe target.

Don't reply for the sake of replying

---
Welcome back Kreonn! :3
---
don't you know it's in blizz's track record, release shit before it even works properly. or shove 10 servers into 1 and call it a day and tell everyone to bare with them until they take another few weeks to "fix" the issue
---
Yeah, they complain about "lack of sources" and then I link blue posts describing the process like above and then they just ignore them. Then they claim you're ignorant for "assuming things", all while providing 0 evidence of their own that layers are fixed block sizes.

Have you checked with the goblin engineering teacher in Gadgedtzan?

You generally want 3 hunters - 2 cycling tranq shot and 3rd as a backup if tranq gest resisted.

So, grade 8 was a catholic school, so different curriculum. Grade 9 in high school at a new public school the teacher loved the book. Then grade 10 we would have been considered the acceptable losses in a curriculum shuffle, where we had overlap on certain subjects for one year to even everything else out for everyone else.
---
xfer to heartseeker lol
---
what?
---
There are a myriad of situations where you need to finish one thing in the game specifically, or you are farming for one particular item. 
---
The first few times you rez, you might not know you're getting corpse camped. By the time you spirit rez, with the res sickness debuff and the times running back to your corpse, it'll often have taken 30 minutes+ of your time. 
---
Regardless, corpse camping isn't the main problem here, it's the faction imbalance that just means you get shat on constantly because there are just way more horde than alliance a lot of the time and you're too low level and/or outnumbered to put up a good fight.
---
\&gt; spend a completely irrelevant amount of gold to repair 
---
Someone isn't a plate user with multiple gear sets, clearly.
---
What do you mean by that? What is the reinforcing option for blizzard
---
True but it‚Äôs even more embarrassing for them dying to a swimming crit chicken
---
Between resetting all classic servers, classic+ or TBC enough players will probably stick around.
---
Yes because we can‚Äôt use entangling roots in a cave but we can use Star fire. Hmmmm haha
---
That‚Äôs why the call bras ‚Äòover the shoulder, boulder holders‚Äô
---
That‚Äôs because the Alliance are organized and civilized, and the Horde are savage scum with no direction!  Look at your cities for crying out loud, one is a sewer!
---
Server caps have been reduced so expect more queues on heavy pop servers at night
---
155 minute queue for me at 9:45pm.  GG Blizzard.  OH you know what.  Instead of playing WoW, I guess I'll go play another game.  Great job dipshits.
---
How far along are you? You could try leveling more in dungeons. I leveled with a friend so it wasn‚Äôt as bad. Also if you quest in zones with undead mobs you can work in exorcism/holy wrath so it‚Äôs not as mundane
---
Alot of good this combination does. Alli stuck with a que they cant leave. Horde have little reason to leave
---
Is this actually true?  I'd love to see the mage one .
---
As an Alliance player. That just contributes to the problem. I don't want to out number horde 12:1, its the same problem just in reverse. Its not fun.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Never said how far they'd drop. That's black magic guestimating: but they have dropped or, at the very least, people are not logging in as religiously as they were that first month.
---
Check YouTube for a guide that helps the most
---
Earthfury is in no way dead, but it IS very much a nighttime server.  Before transfers the faction split was very close, but I am unsure how that may be changing.
---
not a whole lot is going to change aside from you probably wont get ignored nearly as often by random enemies you encounter. why everybody so dumdum
---
30 days played in 2 and a half months? Oof that‚Äôs a lot
---
what i meant was why did they reduce layer and reduce player cap at the same time rather than periodically.
---
For me it's payback for all the times it happened to me
---
I transferred to Earthfury and last I checked the stats, there was a bunch more Horde than Ally. It doesn't feel dead, at least not at my level (34). STV is hell for Alliance right now.
---
I wasn't saying anything about Blizzard
---
Yes! You started the Alliance!
---
Careful. PvE carebares will be upset with that comment. Can come to reddit and fight but cant in the game your playing. Cacacacacowards
---
I know this is not the case, but I want to believe.
---
I mean number two comment atm....
---
Dude. It was just a question. In August I had 3-4 hour queues. Don't be a dick
---
I'm a full time job with a significant other type. I'm just happy hitting milestones like... 60,getting my epic mount (eventually), getting my prebis (eventually), etc.

 It's the little things.

They have been reducing layers periodically, but world bosses require 1 layer which is why the huge servers are being cut to 1 right now. As to why the realm cap is being reduced right now, the servers seem to not be prepared for large scale pvp. Blizzards only other option would be to delay phase two
---
Neither PvP or PvE servers are as fun as RP servers.
---
I wasn‚Äôt saying it in a bad way. I‚Äôm just genuinely curious.

Lesson learned for me.  Haven't had to remote in to the game for ages.  Went to a movie with the wife, excited to play my alt.  3 hour queue says I'm going to play CoD WW2 instead.

I basically just got into Westfall, so just starting out so I haven‚Äôt unlocked dungeons yet

As someone who strongly believes if it‚Äôs red, it‚Äôs dead. My goal is to make you take Rez Sickness. It‚Äôs really not to ‚Äúboost my ego‚Äù as some other people on here think.

It sucks for you, but it‚Äôs fantastic for me and that‚Äôs really all that matters at the end of the day to be brutally honest with you

Not having played since TBC, this is actually really cool. Hoping to find a guild on my server that does this. Thanks for sharing man!

31 days played here haha noob

Today is Tuesday
---
Haha, I like it.
---
I've only ever done this kind of thing once - it was shortly after the Nostalrius shutdown when the whole petition with Mark Kern was happening, the event when Blizz flew out the Nost team to their HQ for a meeting, all that stuff. A lot of us were cautiously optimistic.
---
But there was this one guy in a reddit thread around that time that really got under my skin, which doesn't happen often. He was just completely, utterly convinced that Blizzard would *never* release legacy servers, to the point where he kept calling everyone a naive fool, delusional etc for thinking it could ever happen, "falling for that PR crap" etc. I replied a few times and halfway through the conversation I tried to concede and say "well we're all just speculating, we won't know what Blizzard is up to unless they give us some kind of announcement" and he finished with something like "I promise you, there will never be such an announcement. Please, come back here and tell me how wrong I am if they do. Hint: it's never going to happen".
---
So when the Blizzcon announcement came, I actually went back and pmed him. He said some bullshit like "I stand by what I said. I am still not convinced it will happen, there is a good chance the project will get abandoned, so come again when the server is actually running."
---
Then a couple weeks after Classic launched, I pmed him again - he did ask me to, after all. First he pretended to not know who I am, even though I gave him a screenshot as context in my pm. Then he pulled the whole "Sorry, I'm not caught up about things I said years ago, but I'll take the fact that you remembered me as a compliment". When I said something like "next time, don't be so damn arrogant about things neither of us could be sure of at the time", he replies "Sorry, not reading this drivel".
---
Some people are just incapable of admitting they might have made a mistake and it's infuriating. Very few things get under my skin more than a combination of cock-sure, completely unfounded arrogance + an unwillingness to concede that they might have made a mistake.
---
I say keep the rape
---
Best professions for gold income? Strictly gold income. I dont care about making gear or anything. Just want to make money.
---
&gt;Ruthless. They ganked and camped the shit out of everyone back then. 
---
have you ever been corpsecamped for a week or more of real time for trying to fight off an enemy raid on your capital? No? Then you have no idea what "ruthless" means. You log in - there\`s 5-man gank squad looking for you within a couple minutes. You try to fight? They bring a 40-man raid. You try to get a 40-an raid? GL, everyone has given up and transferred to another realm.
---
There's also a bug with rogue energy regeneration which affects gameplay flow and DPS. They very often regenerate 1-2 extra energy on the energy ticks which allows for casting some abilities ticks earlier in combat then they were supposed to be castable.
---
Thats the point of an mmo rpg. To get better stats. Although most of the BiS lists online are pretty bad.
---
So I just got my warrior to 20(human if it matters) and I want to start tanking. I have a shield and mace, what kind of rotation should I be using like charge, switch to defensive, sunder, tab, sunder? Shield block on CD?  Also should I prioritize strength or stamina?
---
It may be just my bad luck coming across inexperienced players but I've never seen an arms tank perform well. I sneeze too hard and they lose aggro
---
Ah just getting started then. I‚Äôd try to find a guild or friend in game so you have people to level with. I agree those first levels were rough and I second guessed it too but I‚Äôd wait it out til you get seal of command and a decent 2 handed at level 20. Also quest in duskwood it has undead like I was saying
---
Ya, this was common in wrath on bg9. You could only join as a gold run if you came to spend huge amount of gold though.
---
Earthfury has a very healthy pop. Fluctuates from medium and even on high at peak times
---
I am currently in a dkp guild, and they‚Äôre great because they change the raid day each week, which should work in my favor, but it‚Äôs usually late at night when I don‚Äôt have the time. I was just hoping to find a place where people are posting for pugs so I could at least get some raid gear when I know I can‚Äôt make my guild‚Äôs run
---
yep, if AR has numerous guilds where even one player out of 40 has NEVER logged a single boss kill, sure.

warcraftlogs has 10 setting foot in MC and 5 clearing.

oh my god i work 80 hours a week at walmart plz base your game around me and my playstyle cus i can only play 30 minutes a week, fuck off
---
Not nearly as big of a playerbase on OSRS as WoW, I don't know exact figures but its definitely not over a million, im not even sure if it breaks half a million. Jagex customer service is beyond horrible, an absolute joke.
---
DKP is wipe for abuse by everybody and while not a horrible system like +1 or just rolling. With overbidding to reduce somebody DKP, classes banding to gether to bid low on tier. +1 is just bad, having items be disenchanted instead of being given out, rolling leads to timmy the afk mage getting Mageblade. 
---
Loot council, when done correctly is without a shadow of doubt better then any other system. Its fair because everybody knows before the raid even starts who gets Mageblade if it drops. If you have a problem with the order, you should be able to go to your guild council and ask why things are being given out like they are. 
---
If you are worried about a Loot Council being corrupt, you would also be worried about DKP being corrupt. DKP is generally easier to corrupt then Loot Council because most Loot Councils are done either way before hand or done with 1-2 random raiders to insure its legit.
---
So if that‚Äôs an acceptable level of effort for a post, memes are fine with me.

I've recently started a new alt on grob after all these amazing stories. Only level 6 and still leveling my main but I also wish I hadn't wasted time following my guild onto a boring pvp server.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know, I do not speak heathen.

I couldnt get the main hand dal rend either for my warrior gave up on that for now. Weapons are rough to get for dual wielders right now.

---
Lol looks like my original vanilla server Sen'jin
---
The hell I know what they are working on!
---
Probably to the class bugs you say instead, since they seem more critical? Or working to the next release? Or working for the server transfer issues, if any?
---
There is a sea of possibilities they could be working on, and there's a high chance it's more important than a damn keyring.
---
Like, I would like it of course. I would not shout about it being delivered as soon as possible.
---
It is for fighting. They're talking about using LoS to kill people who are outside of the cage from the inside.
---
My wife would like me to quit :) but what else would I do? I played another game full on before the June open.
---
I wouldnt have pride either if i was allied with some fat short guys and midgets..
---
I just took a break to do something else after playing it for 2 months straight.
---
I felt like I needed to try hard for the guild i was in, but I wasn't leveling fast and they found other players to suit endgame dungeon and raid needs at that time.
---
I think the game would have been more fun if people didnt know everything about classic at launch. I felt like I had to rush through the game to keep up because I was new to Classic.
---
I feel lawyered

There are a ton of omega proud Alliance players as well, you'll encounter them eventually and they're just as weird.

In Everlook you can hang out next to the Inn and snipe people. Right in the middle of town. It was broken as fuck, good move Blizz.

I did? Maybe you should read it? It says exactly ‚Äúafter this step‚Äù then it lists realms where people should transfer from to avoid excessive queues?
---
Quote me the exact part that you‚Äôre disagreeing with me?
---
The cap is being reduced because the layers are being reduced so in a way - yes layers do affect queue time
---
No resub then

that's like chucking water balloons at people sitting at a bench and saying you'll stop throwing them if they stand up.

I forgot about those, for sure.

They rarely drop for me, but do sell well and are needed for crafting.
---
yeah you're giving them a choice but you're also not doing anything to help them.
---
Always take these logs with a grain of salt. +-10% is possible because we don't know exact numbers and people already have twinks which are leveled high enough to screw up the ratio logs. so its possible/ probable that it is 60/40.
---
This didn't age well....
---
offer to sell the key to whomever wins the roll
---
The energy bug isn‚Äôt only positive. It‚Äôs sometimes it can be 19, sometimes it can be 21, but it should be 20.
---
I don't get that at all. Southern pride (which I don't have even living in Texas) is based on prejudicial traditions. The Horde sees the Alliance as enemies, but not because they are different colors per se. The original alliance hated the original Horde for not being human or almost human (night elves) in appearance. Trolls, orcs, undead, and cow people don't mix well with mostly humanoid races. Worgen are humans that are werewolves (acceptable to the alliance). By the time pandas joined the alliance, the alliance had modernized to not dislike the differences. Mainly because Varian and Anduin have a lot of respect for certain members of the Horde. The Horde is more a collection of tribes that have pride in their tribes that then come to the defense of the overall whole. The individual cultures within the Horde have pride in their tribe over any obeisance to the Horde.
---
It is what it is...  and since you are in the honor range (starts at 48) you will give free honor to them(in 2 days atleast), for no effort, you are just a drive by for them. Thats it.
---
We do this also from time to time, to get a little battle going, maybe someone is logging onto his 60 or another 60 come to help them etc. Most of the time its nothing personal!
---
Personally i've only seen it be 20, 21 and 22
---
Not only that, but on that actual website it literally says the census only counts those people that have accounts on that site, or something along those lines lol. So it‚Äôs for sure not 100%, it might not even be close
---
Again, why don't you just play with Koreans then?
---
This is the most NA thing I‚Äôve ever read. 
---
New Jersey btw.
---
I absolutely feel the same way, but found that quitting just lead me to other addictive games, or even just wasting time on youtube.
---
You have to learn to moderate. Learn what things are actually important to care about doing in the game, and which things are luxury. 
---
For me, it went like this: Do I actually need full consumables to go raid? Hell no. You need a couple of potions for the rag kill and that's it. Ok, but my guild requires those things. Therefore, you don't require that guild, you require a guild that feels the same way. I rerolled on the RP server, took my time hitting 60, and now I raid 3 hours on Saturday night to clear MC, and \~30 minutes on Fri/Sun for Ony. If I feel like logging in, I can run a dungeon, or grind some, but there's not actually anything I NEED to do, I just log on when I want to and have no other obligations.
---
To anyone else feeling this: Just put a bit of thought into what exactly you feel you need to do vs. all the things people falsely think are actually needed.
---
Not true at all. I legit hate gold farming. Others only want to raid. This system is not for a lot of people.
---
Only would be funny if he was boomkin.
---
Druids never remaind a skelett when they shifted into cat or bear or seathingy. On privatservers maybe but NEVER on classic...
---
Don‚Äôt listen to these morons telling you they are dead servers. These people think you need 20k people for the game to be playable. Vanilla servers had a 2500 player cap and servers like Arcanite Reaper have more people than that when being listed as medium.
---
What's everybody's feeling about a healer entering MC at LVL 56 with pre bis and some bis
---
Eh I'm horde and they run scared from me unless they have numbers, but that's most of you alliance :D
---
This system was the standard for pugs back in Feenix and I even saw it a couple of times in Nost. Besides a couple of bad experiences with leaders leaving with all the gold, I would say it was pretty good. It gave an incentive to people who were already well geared to join pugs and it gave fresh 60s a fair chance to get gear since they could get into the raid just by flashing gold instead of showing high-end gear.
---
no changes
---
Its funny how you guys froth at the mouth whenever Blizzard wants to change something else but this is somehow ok because a bunch of you rolled on a PvP server then whine about getting killed by a level 60 or people in the goblin cities.
---
You couldn't do the dungeon without your group but you also woukdny even be able to open the chest without you. How about you get two rolls everyone else gets 1
---
You gotta slow down with all these metaphors lol
---
You don‚Äôt have to lead once in the dungeon. Most likely someone else will know where to go once there
---
Exactly, they only state that they are reducing layers to 1 and nothing more. The rest is speculation from OP.

Here's another video; Druid Raid Officers would do annual raids on a horde city and basically try to invite every druid they could contact.
---
Have 2 others but we're planning on puggin
---
The person who makes the group does the chat spam, that's it. The rest of it everyone bumbles through if it's their first time.
---
We ran this for months in ICC during WotLK. Made unbelievable amounts of gold. Once you have a trustworthy raid leader/money distributor and a core of raiders who show up weekly and can clear content reliably without the "carries/whales" needing to contribute much, it's $$$ time. I would absolutely love to see this catch on in Classic.
---
I just came to play a little and relive what I once loved. Don't have the time to invest but still having fun
---
I rerolled from warlock to priest exactly for this reason. Gave up on my 54 prot warrior too because I don't know the endgame dungeons well enough to play a tank.
---
My priest is only level 32 now but I can easily get into groups now as a healer and I intend on learning the game as a healer before continuing my journey as a tank.
---
This was a very common thing on US servers for pug groups until master looting was removed, but it wasn't something people advertised it was kind of an invitation only situation.
---
Make friends with someone who knows what they‚Äôre doing. Ideally the tank should know the dungeon and be making the pulls, but sometimes a rough dungeon run can be a great learning experience.
---
As a tank I can tell you the things to avoid are body pulling other packs while you try to get to a mob to dps and don‚Äôt cheap shot the main target as its being pulled. This stops the tank from generating initial rage and can stun a mob at a bad position
---
I also played vanilla back then and never saw a druid with noggenfogger. In dunno what addon I saw some druids with noggenfogger while they are in boomkin form, but it wasnt classic at all. So I still highly doubt it. And even for release blizz got alot wrong, so....
---
I want to leave Skeram but I'm trapped.
---
I mean they'll go away eventually... but yeah that's what they're doing and they've communicated fairly openly that this was their plan
---
&gt;My girlfriend started playing classic for me and was having a blast, but now that she can‚Äòt even do the simplest things without getting ganked by random 60s is ruining the game for her and I feel that‚Äòll be the case for many other casual players that are in our level range.
---
This is why they made PvE servers.
---
It was your choice to roll on a PvP server and now you're complaining about PvP?
---
Wtf did you think it would be like? Some gentleman's duel type shit where every fight is even and honorable? Fucking LOL.
---
If you don't want to be killed, roll on a PvE server.
---
If you think it's bad now, you have no idea what you're going to be dealing with come Thursday, especially as a lvl 49. You are literally going to be a snack.
---
It can't be that fucking hard.
---
You're talking about going straight to the nuclear option and replacing someone (which in some cases can mean a long ass wait for said replacement to arrive) and talking about giving a shit about other people's time. At some point you have to realize that the vast majority of the time, people accept the mediocrity because it's annoying, but not worth wasting either your own or the other members of the groups time trying to "fix" with a hard line stance. You just say fuck it and get it done.
---
&gt; We removed the ability called "Eye of the Beast" from hunters and, as a result of several code changes, it was actually impossible to us to reinstate it in modern WoW-- it would be a tremendous amount of work. Well, to make Classic happen, we had to do most of that work. There are still some bugs to fix, but we actually think in the modern game, thanks to the work we've done to make "Eyes of the Beast" work again, there's no reason we can't give hunters that ability back in Battle for Azeroth, and that's like a small example of something.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\- Ion Hazzikostas
---
So, without classic requiring Eye of the Beast, the Shadowlands expansion would likely not gotten that ability back.

You literally only read the title of my post before you commented and now i'm the one who doesn't care what you have to say?
---
You're going off what you saw. I'm going off what I actually experienced lol. I am telling you it 100% did retain skeleton form while in cat/bear. And it is supported by bliz even listing it on their known bugs. So I dont mean to be rude, I just don't weigh what you remember "seeing" vs real life experience.
---
Heads up OP, looks like it's [not coming out in phase 2](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/will-keyrings-be-coming-with-phase-2/355335/10) either.
---
&gt;Where does wowhead get their numbers from? How do we know they are accurate.
---
iirc there was an app that tracked server populations until Blizzard put a stop to that app. It was probably around Sep when that app was killed.
---
That's not a whoosh... He acknowledged it as a gag. He was simply stating it's sad it's still a thing.
---
opt-in PvP layer sounds a whole lot like war mode.
---
Yeah but no ones perfect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I'd be surprised if Blizzard has that functionality available to the add-on API
---
Thats a slap in the phase, right there!
---
There's people that park low levels next to that vendor in Everlook. I put my succubus on stay next to them, run outside Everlook, and have my succubus one-shot them. Still easy to do.
---
sums up blizzard recently tbh
---
layering is gone and now theres no leather on the AH on my server, lol.
---
Usually the tank will lead or whoever knows the dungeon the best. Lookingforgroup add on will help some
---
Hi there! I'm a level 45 horde considering using my free transfer. I would be going from Bigglesworth to either Arcanite Reaper or Anathema. Anyone have a sense of demographics between all of those 3? I don't want to jump ship into a server that is mostly Alliance.
---
We have a token Boomie in each group too hahaha they're some of the most charasmatic people in the guild further cementing my love for droods
---
More layers = higher cap.  They are related in this way.
---
Ah ok, thanks.
---
In Vanilla they had faction population restrictions on some servers. You could not create a character without an existing character on that faction.
---
Well the last of the launch fuck ups will finally be over.  This whole layering thing was stupid to begin with and didn't fix anything.  If they actually had enough servers for people to sign up with at the beginning que times wouldn't be a problem now.  All layering did was delay this crap until now.  Now that it's finally done with I gotta wait again through the que times until more people move if they will.  It makes it harder for people to move since they are established on their servers with their guilds and the community where if they didn't have layering to begin with it would be a lot easier for people to just change to less populated servers.  I wonder how many people are going to miss raids and how many raids are going to get postponed because of this?  I'm sure the economy is going to be nuts too since all those extra resources are going away as well.

yea, i know people with 1080ti/2080tis and 8th/9th gen i7s and they get stupid low fps on wow.
---
but in MC with 40 people i average around 100 fps, so that is great.
---
Ok, last one I promise. 
---
How fucking blind are you. 
---
The title of your post is ‚Äúlayers don‚Äôt affect queue times‚Äù when it directly does. I read the blue post quotes you linked but you decided not to link the one where it completely negates what you stated.
---
 I read the blue post quotes you linked
---
No, just "nom." and wait 3 hours to find another Ally.
---
sounds like something i would do
---
Herod queue has been 2 hours for most of prime time. There was no queue until about 5pm-5:30pm EST.
---
Time to riot
---
I had the exact same thought. Waiting for some Reddit detectives to get down to business and get an answer
---

---
as a mage I invite rogues and warrior dps to all my grps (cuz those lousy ass caster dps always roll on my loot)
---
I haven‚Äôt done enough runs to give you a GPH figure as I‚Äôm only about 7 farms in. What I do know is there‚Äôs like 8 packs and you use PI for each one so that‚Äôs just 20 mins per run. Mana requirements are steep at 6k but BoE AH 50+ greens provide this easily.
---
But there‚Äôs about 4x high-tier herbs each time and I‚Äôve already got my Priest trinket book from it unsure I‚Äôd that‚Äôs luck or not. Plenty of videos on YouTube about it you just have to take it slower since they‚Äôre 60.
---
Go Kromcrush. We need more alliance to beat the Horde. I am happy to assist to run some dungeons.
---
for me, the nice thing is that you don't have to play all the time- you aren't missing out on anything. Lowe level dungeons are still happening. I have one toon in a guild that is currently recruiting players under 35 so they can all level together for Ony and MC
---
I just took 5 days off, its all good
---
Even when you plan it out you don't do enough damage. Lol ok man congrats &lt;3
---
Yeah I switched to heartseeker
---
Not sure but I think it‚Äôs super late (phase 5?)
---
As a hunter, I approve this message.
---
We all have some ptsd from having servers taken down and losing our progress. Classic isn't going anywhere though so really there's no need to rush to the end. A large percentage of the community has regular jobs, partners, and other obligations that don't feel the need to rush to end game. Plus rushers have alts to level. Lastly, friends that play love the game and aren't going to quit anytime soon.
---
Don‚Äôt you even have a phone?

Its because you are shit and your guild leader is an edgelord who typed first /create world.

---
I am considering buying BFA. Is it worth it?
---
Good on you for making the responsible decision. Congratulations on the little one!
---
Nah, I play a rogue, I can tank well enough to not die before the mobs do. I woulda just told em to boot the tank.
---
I have an alt problem.
---
Oh good, I found it.
---
With view distance increase in Legion there was plenty of similar screenshots of this kind from retail. Legion and BfA zones are gorgeous.
---
'Never' *looks at UD Strat* Yeah, I'ma have to go with Trollicus on this one.
---
I had set my Hearthstone to Kargarth in the Badlands. It was an okay-ish alternative....
---
Are you like instantly moving the moment you feign death? Because you gotta wait for like a second or half a second. You can't just feign, then move again. 
---
Feign Death is working fine. Us hunters are using it to farm DM:N
---
Agreed, looks like par for the course on a week night.
---
No
---
Not 100% but I‚Äôve heard zf is still best for mages, with or without herbing)
---
If you‚Äôre horde yes, if you‚Äôre alliance stay.
---
Long post - read it though, and you're probably right. It "can" work. But, knowing human nature, this seems like a step closer to retail, where from the sound of it, you may simply purchase most of your in-game experience.
---
I miss the days of guild loyalty. Building and earning a reputation. Working hard to improve, help others, and make a community worth being around. I miss that moment when the guild would say "hey, let's give that item to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, because that will help everybody" even if they use DKP or w/e system.
---
I'm not sure that environment could still exist in that realm, at least not in the US culture.
---
I'm not Blizzard apologist but it WAS added in 1.11, significantly longer than when P2 is based.
---
That said, I'm quite disappointed I don't get it either, I hate carrying my BS rings on me at all times or risk never opening a lock. 
---
Like if the problem is requiring a patch could they.. Not have just done it on the maintenance we just had?
---
Correlation does not equal causality. 
---
Layers do not affect queue times. Only 2 things affect queue times:
---
- how many people are trying to play on the server
---
- how many people are able to be on the server at one time
---
Blizzard are changing the 2nd part (realm cap), and implementation of Phase 2 is bringing more people online to check the World Bosses and PvP out (even if it doesn't start until Thursday, a lot of people don't know that and are logging on after reset), plus the weekly surge of logins upon Raid Reset. 
---
The combination of these two factors are driving up queue times. Just because they're also reducing layers at the same time does not mean they have anything to do with queue times.
---
No changes üëåüèº
---
You should make a new subreddit around this, I love your work but I hate seeing all this fan art spam this subreddit. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs amazing! But annoying seeing it when I just want to see posts about actual classic wow.
---
Prat does rollback from dc/logouts
---
can I have your stuff?
---
Can‚Äôt speak for all the Libram‚Äôs, but I imagine only raid tanks would want the fire resist one, aka next to no demand
---
At the end of the day it's all subjective.
---
It actually kind of started with wanting to help out a foreigner getting cursed at in general chat for an English question. We wanted to welcome everyone and help those foreigners who don't have a full grasp of the language yet.
---
Looks like you won‚Äôt even be ‚Äúplaying‚Äù for at least two hours anyway bub lmao
---
And my bow!
---
ITT: you guys are wrong and I don't mean to be rude but the Druid class absolutely needs the ability to mask shapeshifted forms for an unfair PvP advantage
---
I'm 33 on my rogue alt now. Never had a single issue finding a dungeon, since I always create my own group. LFM works way better than LFG. Whispers, trade/general/LFG/world chat channels are your best friends. Tanks sometimes take some looking, but whisper enough tanks in your level range in appropriate zones and you'll get there.
---
I recommend checking out how to properly use the /who function [here](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Who_List) if you're not familiar.
---
You can type eg. 
---
&gt; z-"tirisfal glades" z-"undercity" z-"orgrimmar" c-"warrior" c-"druid" 30-37 
---
to get all eligible tanks in 30-37 level range in your /who list ready to send whispers to.
---
Of course, you might just be on a quieter realm than me. I still have queues every weekend (and Tuesday) at peak times on Ashbringer, though there are still bigger realms like Gehennas on EU.
---
 Also Rogue. 
---
Relic Coffer Keys for gold farming. Just saying.
---
Targeting is a huge help because it shows the range of the person. I can rez outside of your vision, but Spy automatically shows you whether I am in within a certain range or not. That is huge for someone who has 3 seconds to attack me before I can get on my mount.
---
save the beads in your bank from the furblogs for revered -&gt; exalted.  i got exalted with timbermaw too easily
---
Well they implemented the change as a "Big Fix" in 2.0.1 which is why I say it's working as intended. Especially as Noggenfoggers worked differently from Savoury Delights at the time.
---
I also quit not long ago. I have all the time in the world to nolife the game but it gives me no satisfaction whatsoever... I personally have the daunting feeling that spending too much time in video games is a waste of precious time. But here I am on the classicwow subreddit just looking at what is going with the game haha... oh well...
---
Erm, I believe the original horde was literally formed to destroy and eradicate the Dreanai, then followed them to Kalimdor, and attempted to wipe out the Alliance's existence. That really kinda set the tone for a looooong time between any faction aligned with the Orcs for any reason, even if it was a matter of their own survival (i.e. the Undead).
---
The panda's didn't really leave anyone a choice, and joined both as a means to establishing balance.
---
But, I digress. The OP's comment is essentially what you refer to as "prejudicial traditions" - the Horde, despite their own colored history, love to paint the Alliance as the "bad guys" much like the "south" loved to paint the "north" as the "bad guys" due to infringement on their beloved "states rights." Don't forget, the "south" attacked the "north" first, much like the Horde first attacked the Alliance.
---
Ultimately, those who still hold to the ideology that "the south will rise again" may be seen as similar to those who revel in the "for the horde" mentality.
---
You can't say that and not list at least 8 items to support your claim lol
---
That's not how supply and demand work.  Supply going down does not make demand go up.  People don't want *more* flasks just because there are less flasks available.  They want the same amount of flasks they wanted before, just some people will have to go without and some people will have to pay more.
---
Supply going down with constant demand makes *prices* go up.
---
You are literally describing "griefing" with the forced reloads. It's a douche move.
---
Gehennas EU had 11k queue yesterday after layering removal
---
Green lens of nature's wrath
---

Elven Spirit claws

Wrists/back of nature's wrath (or deep woods)

South sea's boots

---

---
that SM dagger
---
They all add up, the shield more than makes up for having mostly cloth and leather.
---
It‚Äôs surprisingly less annoying than you‚Äôd think to just alternate the trackers every few seconds. I found the profs to go well together
---
Dang. That's a tough break. Have you considered adoption?
---
P.S. In all seriousness, you're probably doing the right thing - but, I hope you get another opportunity to re-connect some day!
---
oof
---
I've done splits where one person gets ore, another herbs, the third gets unneeded items for de.  The herb guy made the most because the miner got no crystals.  Herbs more consistent but if you get lucky with crystals that's the best.
---
50hrs a week or 3 hrs a week - once you're raiding you're progressing at the same rate
---
I doubt it's going to happen, but I think it is the best and most fair solution because it give feedback to the players that need to take advantage of the process specifically and we can't leave if we wanted to.
---
Actually unsubbed
---
Yup. I'm avoiding that crowd. Hit lvl 44, and I couldn't be happier. I pretty much ignore the majority of rush rush rush and I've loved solo'ing content, or finding groups of players to enjoy a dungeon or two now and then. It's been fun, disconnected, but amazing.
---
P.S. also why I chose not to lvl a warrior this time.
---
The detail in Stranglethorn Vale has really impressed me this time around. It's a very well designed zone artistically.
---
I‚Äôm lost ive been on faerlina for a month and this is barely more than the wait time was for me the past 4 weeks trying to login around the time this was posted.  I got the remote and login 2 hours before I actually plan to play, nbd
---
I agree. Go to Skeram Alliance so us Horde can have an equal fight. It's getting lonely.
---
Lol if you have skinning you get that quest done so fast
---
What? The stats are way off cloudkeeper are biz plate
---
I mean, that‚Äôs the concern everyone has. But I like to think black lotus at 30-40g is a relatively safe investment. I doubt that price will ever go down.  
---
Worst case scenario just make an alchemist alt and have him use your lotus‚Äô to make flasks for you.
---
You will pull everything. No skips and an extra hour to clear probably.
---
Hey bud, i just wanted to say, that you are making right decision, wow will not give you same satisfaction as happy family will. Do what you gotta do to, and don't look back. 
---
Cheers and all the best luck!
---
Your best bet would be to have a weak aura that tells you when Demo Shout is fading and my a alt/shift/ctrl modified macro for Sunder/Demo
---
Problem with that is you just need 1 person to get a little bit greedy, and suddenly the whole 'low bid' system falls to pieces, it really needs a group of people that are on board. Also a lot of these systems implement a minimum bid to prevent that, something like 25/50/100g minimum bid on worthwhile items.
---
been in for hours so i made this tbh
---
So I'm on Anathema Horde side. got a 60 priest.
---
Theres basically 5-10 raiding guilds that constantly clear MC/Ony. The one im part of is pretty much doing MC in 3hours and 20-25 man Onys every reset. A few of the guilds are even beginning to field multiple MC rosters.
---
Yes, it is a lower pop server and there might be more alliance, but there is no corpsewalking to instances. The economy is a bit strange given low pop but overall its fine.
---
I honestly like it.
---
Cloudkeepers are especially good for non human/orc warriors who use these paired with the edgemasters handguards.
---
Always epic mount
---
That quest is the reason why people in USA still searching for big foots.
---
It's not opt in. Why are you just inventing things to complain about?
---
is there a way to make a trade macro or something that i can copy paste for my crafting ad?
---
When i copy paste all the links go dead/grey.
---
Oh good, never mind then.
---
Cool story bro
---
20-50g depending on luck/ah prices

(meant MC &amp; Ony as they said in the post) 
---

---

---
Cloak of Shrouded Mists 
---
Fire Rez: 
---

---

---
Arguably truestrike ring as well but eh
---
Lol it‚Äôs the first day with queues in months plus it‚Äôs raid night.
---
Lol ok
---
Just never seen it before. I can't even type it!
---
what are you selling to net you that much money?
---
guilty
---
I'm sure they will make new content for it, and when that happens it will be fresh and new
---
This is definitely a concern that I've been wrestling with, tbh. At the moment, I've got mining/skinning and have been making pretty good profit for a low level. 
---
I planned on farming when I hit 60 until I had a nice financial cushion from which to power level a crafting profession. 
---
But predictably, I see all the resources in my bank and keep thinking "I should do something with this bullshit."
---
Arms would help against Zevrim's sacrifice debuff, but if you have two Barov Peasant Callers between the two of you, you shouldn't need it.
---
Yeah as a paladin who has mining this was one of the few ways I was able to get some nodes deep into caves.
---
Lol I'm telling you man. It def was strong, but it was legit
---
I've heard tell that it was in the beta though
---
whats wrong with biggles?
---
Yeah while there is the "swarm" on the Alliance side with the multiple Olypus guilds, the Horde guilds seems more PvP oriented and organized.
---
I'm saying if they wanted to fix this problem, they should have increased the aggro radius, not their attack radius, because the issue was never outranging the mobs it's avoiding their ire in the first place.  You could stand right beside the south side of the arena, right on the sand, and avoid aggroing patrolling guards if you were 60 and timed it right.  No need to exploit terrain.  Or stand in the back of the inn, and shoot people at the front.  Same thing, at 60 you are outside the guard aggro radius.
---
I also said they might have done this, and simply used an incorrect explanation in the blue post.  I haven't been able to play today so I don't know.
---
No shit advice:  get in dungeons until 60.
---
grobb is probably the most balanced then incendius, benediction, bigglesworth. this is what I hear from others
---
Sure, that‚Äôs why you checked heartseeker :)
---
There was always going to be a huge drop in players given how much hype classic had and the fact that everyone and their dog tried it. The player base right now is pretty incredible, and even if there's an enormous drop Blizzard can always merge servers, which ensures great population sizes for a very long time. 
---
The game's just too good to die honestly. You've had private servers alive and healthy for a very long time, so I don't think classic is going anywhere. Maybe if the new retail expansion is really good it'll lose a lot of players, but thats not for another year
---
Nice! That‚Äôs crazy exciting my dude
---
And you MUST realize phase 2 Inc and raid reset brings people online.
---
No it does because the supply is lowered lmao
---
I hear your opinion, but regardless of all pointed facts i still am addicted to this game and have been for the last x ammount of years ive played it on private servers . If you dont want to play min max then dont. Not  everyone knows all the information.
---
First rag kills and 60 dings too
---
Thats not obvious, you removed the whole name with a white box.. could be a rogue hiding under there..
---
&gt;you might pull them
---
You will pull them, along with virtually everything else in the instance.
---
Usually 300-450g per 2 hours actually
---
I play tauren works fine for me holds through all forms
---
The internet is a lot more developed than it was 15 years ago. The ease at which information spreads is why everyone knows everything about the game. People don‚Äôt like wasting time, so they search up guides and the most efficient ways to do things. This goes for most things in life these days, not just games. Even if a new game comes out, eventually it will be minmaxed too because that‚Äôs the way people play games these days.
---
Oh, speed clears makes sense.  For any normal raid that is clearing at a normal 2-3 hours pace, aint nobody using those types of consumables.
---
You won't need any keys during p2. By the time you corpse run to the instance your group will have given up and disbanded.
---
 Here is raid logs of people who decide to raid on each server.
---
I don't know why anyone would trust c+ to be any good.
---
RIP. THEY JEBAITED US
---
i wish level 1 hogger raids would be an official thing
---
/s
---
well at least now they can come back unofficially!
---
We can apply the same logic for a lot of things though.. the whole it was added in X patch is a moot point when at this point it's pretty off the normal path
---
Tuesday is not as high volume as Friday Saturday or Sunday and there were no queues on any of those days (nor last Tuesday for that matter). If you honestly think today, a Tuesday, has the most demand to play out of any day in the past several months because phase 2 releases in several days then I guess that's an explanation.
---
Also I can't trust such assumptions that you're making. You didn't ask whoever camped you whether they were using Spy or not. I'm not sure how you're figuring out so well whether someone is using Spy, making a macro, or neither, but I'm pretty sure you, or me, or anyone else couldn't just tell like that.
---
So let's not use assumptions as an argument against Spy. Let's use logic. Logic says Spy does nothing more for camping people than the simplest macro. I agree with people saying that you're not always looking at your combat log, but this is just something entirely different.
---
You should NOT be downranking spells while leveling..
---
[I fucking called it] (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dvb3cp/why_is_there_no_mention_of_the_keyring_being/f7ccje2/)
---
I was thinking the same thing.  Pets seem not to agro at all most of the time, and a prowling lvl 47 pet followed me through Scholo for several runs without ever causing issues even with normally skipped packs- in fact she never agroed anything.  I've also had pets tanking a mob and other mobs literally walk through the fight and pay no mind.  It's truly wacky at times.  On the other hand, agro range in EOTB is wildly large it seems at times.
---
Cya later.
---
You can use shouts on CCd mobs and generate some threat without breaking CC.  Helps let those sheep know who's boss
---
And just another of these posts. Glad that i'm on a server without a qeue and heck what, its not dead
---
Sadly not, mate. I think a Kickstarter would be flagged to Blizzard and might cause some trouble.
---
Ah see there‚Äôs your problem, I‚Äôm not running windows 10, so this clearly won‚Äôt work for me, thanks anyways though
---
Anathema isn‚Äôt on the list
---
Reddit: omg dm way too soon blizzard why u ruin wow
---
Reddit:omg my keyring not fast enough unsubscribe
---
So name a loot system that can't be corrupted &gt;.&lt;
---
Nobody is logging there raids I believe is what that means.
---
No set date yet. They've concluded the story for BFA, so there's probably 6-8 months left before they drop their next expansion.
---
BFA has been the worst expansion in WoW history, critically and subscriptions-wise.  
---
When people have put ~15 years in to a game and then suddenly hate it and quit, something was done wrong.
---
If it's red, it's ded.
---
Most people still think phase 2 dropped yesterday.
---
Also sure, they might for sure lowering the cap again. The problem with you is that you say layering has nothing to do with queue times. 
---
Why lie and spread misinformation?
---
I enjoyed reading this, wish I had read it a month ago !
---
My 18-year old isn't still sleeping through the night. Any tips?
---
Druids are solid in pvp, they‚Äôre just a class that bad players can‚Äôt really do anything on though. Lock and rogue both can be played semi effectively by garbage players but a garbage Druid is going to be completely useless, and this is coming from someone who‚Äôs exclusively played lock the past few years
---
Its just weird seeing people say "I cant reroll - too invested" into a character that may have 2-3 days played. If you look at the bigger picture, your /played is going to be much higher than that. 
---
I rerolled my lvl 35 Alliance character cause my friends picked up Horde, it really wasn't a big deal - it even had 225 fishing on it..
---
Oh I'm not disagreeing, I want my keyring too.
---
Like I said, I'm far from an apologist for Blizzard lol, I'm just addicted to their games, just more on an interesting tidbit rather than making excuses
---
I agree. The point was, that its not a melee spec.
---
Hey, I can see myself! The buff caused a HUGE lag spike, it was fantastic
---
It's neither a lie nor misinformation. They've reduced layers continuously since launch without affecting queues
---
Your name is in the quest, nerd.
---
Undead lock/priest can confirm this.
---
8pm cest??
---
How many are just buying the mats compared to the pots though? Pots would be easier to sell.
---
That's not logic. That's rationalizing.
---
You're so wrong that I don't even have to prove it. The proof is that you're going to get down voted for saying that.
---
Don't tell anybody!
---
I play as alliance there. Currently am out of town working so it‚Äôs been several days since I could play, but have played there since the server launched. 
---
I feel we have the numbers on you guys during the week but my god do y‚Äôall ever come out of the clock work during the weekend. 
---
I like our server though, there‚Äôs definitely always a couple peaceful spots to hide out. There are several bonuses that come with a lower level pop server.
---
Good luck out there, heathen.
---
its literally not worth anything to do pvp yet
---
It‚Äôs actually 25% melee attack speed reduction. 
---
25% miss chance would be nuts tho :p
---
Cya later, and when your kid is 3-4 she can fish for you while you sleep.
---
Need Before Greed?
---
From what I read before the code to manage the bags is a total mess with tons of completely hardcoded crap everywhere, which is also why they never managed to change the size of the base bag. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it‚Äôs legitimately very difficult to add the keyring code back into the game for classic, and that they are running into tons of bugs and problems trying to get it to work which delayed the feature.
---
Just hit 60 and managed to scrape 900g together. With phase 2 dropping, does it make sense for me to wait on my epic mount until I can hit rank 3 in PvP? Is it realistic for a Tauren Warrior (arms spec, but planning to respec prot) to make rank 3?
---
What a lad
---
The bag fairy :O
---
&gt;no argument
---
&gt;resorts to ad hominem
---
Clockwork.
---
lol
---
People ninja all the time
---
Wow big props to the devs, I was not expecting them to do something like this.
---
I used to do gdkp runs in wrath good cash and easy gearing for peoples alts.
---
Blizzard told people this would happen. No excuses and no more of these posts.
---
Will it be alive 6 months down the line?
---
You should upgrade your own bags to 16 slot bags first so that you can fit more bags in your bags
---
&gt; Lowering the Realm Cap is a much more plausible reason.
---
or maybe a bunch of people are coming back to pvp?
---
Also, with some clever use of LoS your priest will never be targeted. At zhevrim the sacrifice can also be resisted (shadow prot!)

Salty much ?

The irony is that I browse this subreddit via the "controversial" tab specifically in order to avoid the memes, and that is how I found this thread.
---
As for why memes should not be allowed, the simple answer is that if they are, they take over to the point where there is literally nothing else left.  If the mods are beginning to take a more proactive approach to cleaning up this sub, you won't be hearing any objections from me.  I can remember a time before release when this subreddit wasn't the mindless swamp of image macros that it is now, and I preferred it that way.  I am old enough to both remember and prefer articulate, serious conversation.
---
I don't believe that there is any legitimate defense for misanthropy-inducing idiocy either, personally.  I am often accused of being humorless, but I do find some things funny.  I just don't confuse stupidity or immaturity with comedy, that's all.
---
I will also point out that I was tempted to violate rule 2 while writing this response.  I have just endured tanking a three hour long Sunken Temple pug with typically impatient DPS, and I have an exceptionally small amount of patience for fools, at the moment; and especially for fools who are adamantly unrepentant in insisting that they are anything else.
---
What does the leaf give you exactly?
---
Wait till a new phase drops lol
---
In the first 6 months OSRS lost 75% of its playerbase.
---
Sounds about right fot ActiBlizz.
---
I feel lucky to have a pocket healer :)
---
My buddy picked up Priest and is playing for the first time, he got an itch to do some DPS and my main is perma-specced Prot for raids and dungeons..
---
The solution is we rolled Warrior alts! We just got WW axe - fiery enchants, grouped up with 2 other IRL buddies cleaving through SM
---
Well, the issue here is that OP didn‚Äôt write ‚Äúthis is broken, please fix‚Äù. 
---
Personally, I would‚Äôve thought that dropping Grounding Totem would count as a passive, non-aggressive action (similar to applying PW:S, Ice Barrier, etc). But I have never played Shaman, so I don‚Äôt really know exactly how the interaction works. 
---
But the main point is that asking ‚ÄúHow does X work?‚Äù differentiates from ‚Äúwtf is this Blizz? Plz fix‚Äù. Not allowing people to be curious and learn is harmful.
---
Welcome to being heals. Your not alone, really can‚Äôt do much as a holy priest. I mean you can but not very fast. Everyone I know who has a priest for raid heals has an alt, typically a mage to make money on with aoe farming.
---
amazing!
---
Hard to say if people are memeing when they say this, but there have been a metric fuck ton of changes.
---
&gt;  for the late response, it's the EasyFrames on curse. It has some problems with party display(can't show numbers) but generally good.
---
Thanks !!!

it's way easier with 40 people than 20

I want.. no.. NEED to see your rendition of the lich king! I love your art!'
---
Because it's not true...
---
I think you mean shield slam, which is true and its only 20 rage instead of 30 for MS. But then you can just park your war in IF for the rest of its life because your characters not doing anything else but tanking dungeons.
---
OR
---
You tank content as Arms/Prot hybrid and can have fun in PvP (or any other content really) while being 90% as effective at tanking as a deep prot tank. I know what I'm doing.
---
:-) I can't do that when there are people in need. I decided if I'm going to play a priest, I should play like a priest.
---
Money laundering lol
---
I dont remember the exact number, but irs aq40/naxx gear minimum. Btw if you have that many hunters, your guild isnt getting anywhere that far lol
---
Think it's total durability
---
Yes it will probably be like starcraft. 30k active players even though many consider it a "deadgame".  This is a few years away of course and after all the vanilla content has been released.
---
Well I'm a software engineer. Even worked as a game developer some time. And I also wonder how hard it could be...
---
Besides not being a goblin city, why isnt this a thing for all Neutral cities, like thorium point?
---
pitchfork
---
Yes, using Simplified and Traditional Chinese are fine with English client on China server. The font supports all language encoding by default. However I just tried Korean characters click create and it says the character name is not accepted. So I think each region might only accept limited languages and English names.
---
this was the goto format in Wotlk in Eu. my main income. tank gdkp in close to bis gear, dont buy anything, get share of the pot = magic money. I miss them so much
---
On top of being a small indie company, they‚Äôve probably also started developing games from their phones now so it takes a little time to adjust. Please be patient everyone.
---
A mage can't best two warriors at the same time unless something is very wrong
---
True but Taurens have horns and more stamina. But you're right. I've played both Tauren and Night Elf druids. Just not sure how significant the difference was. The dodge and stealth boost is actually better overall than stamina. Thanks!
---
Ty man, I'll test it later today.
---
As a Prot tank, I just endured a three hour long ST pug with multiple wipes; and the sole reason for all of said wipes was impatient DPS.  The Hunter and DPS warrior were always a good thirty meters away from me and the healer.
---
After the third wipe, the only time I moved from the healer's side, was to tank single targets, when I knew there would be no adds.  I whispered the healer and told him that given the other bad pugs I've had recently, as far as I was concerned, DPS could eat shit from now on.
---
***My role in instances is exclusively to keep the healer alive.***
---
DPS are almost always sociopathic children, who care exclusively about either loot or some other form of venal self-glorification, such as their place on the damage meter.  I can do more with a group of 3 or 4 who are not idiots, than I can with a full group if the DPS are morons.
---
I will stay back next to the healer, and let the DPS pull, because they always insist on doing so anyway.  If there are melee mobs, then I will tank them within sight of the healer, and I will never take my eyes off the healer for a moment.  I know now that if I do that, we will avoid wipes, but we won't if I focus on what is in front of me, and expect someone else to look after the healer, because most of the time no one does.  I am on my own, and I will now behave accordingly.
---
Oh no, not these posts again...
---
The mental gymnastics you people try to go through to explain away direct proof is hilarious.
---
What evil people. Buying gold! I hope they all got banned /s
---
I will note that you can usually have lively discussion on in-game topics, like builds, optimal ways to play classes, etc, buuuut Classic has been out for 15 years and everybody knows everything already. In other gaming subreddits, it can be helpful to have discussion amongst the hardcore crowd, but on classic it's kinda pointless.
---
then we will have second mount posts, fighting against windmills
---
Hey, that was my nickname in high school!
---
I'm all for goblins getting increased range, but this would be quite a stretch.
---
Gouge is 45\* energy
---
Luckily we won't have to worry about that for atleast for a year.  We first attempted all of MC though.
---
I think the two are unrelated. Out of the 100 or so old guildies and friends i know that came out only 3 resubbed. That said we are a pretty active discord and bounce around a lot. We aren't coming back till av.
---
Also the transfers were trash, you couldnt even pick the free ones, still i really enjoyed classic. I'm not hating on the game, just being realistic. Its a great game but its also very old with powerful nostalgia for those who like it.
---
This is full of LUA errors for me.
---
Is it designed only for dungeons?
---
Ancestral speaking, ‚ÄúThe Original Horde‚Äù may have been the bad guys but had they not long settled into Azeroth without much initial resistance? (Night Elves were so caught up in their own emo shit I kinda write them off)
---
Genuinely am foggy on the lore and just simply enjoy discussion.
---
I myself am an avid alliance player, and very much at least lore wise feel to be the invasive faction.
---
???
---
You just jump down, avoid all the trees and kill the flowers...to my knowledge, nobody I seen actually tries to do the whole dungeon.
---
You‚Äôre not bad it‚Äôs touch and go. I still die every once and a while. It‚Äôs a tedious pull I often skip the stayrs and just do the boss
---
Yeah agreed. I forgot how rough west mobs can be.
---
Found the rogue
---
&gt; Now that he's four and is playing GTA V
---
It really is 2019
---
Are you actually playing on an English realm with a German client? Isn't this hard to understand abbreviations or spell names people use in chat?
---
Anyway, gratz to 60! :)
---
&gt;and a key to yer mums place!
---
But you just said the "Mara scepter" didn't count?
---
Done! You're turn :)
---
And now er get to wait a whole lot longer :(
---
My moonkin is 57 my day will come!
---
i can't believe you've done this
---
It's not harmful to do on PvE as well though to reduce the experience of empty cities and weird ah prices for the less represented faction.
---
we should have 2 years between content updates so you can get to level 60 in 5 years, is that enough time?
---
nah, you're just a sapper suicide bomber if you're melee, that's also fun.
---
Pally. Not 60 yet. But I can do any role well enough that most aren‚Äôt willing to wait along for a better option so they just role with it.
---
&gt;With scheduled weekly maintenance beginning at 7:00 a.m. PST on Tuesday, all WoW Classic realms will be set to a single-layer. We expect some realms listed above to experience long queues after this step. We especially encourage players on Arugal , Faerlina , Herod , and Whitemane to use the Free Character Move service to avoid excessive queues.
---
Honestly I only know of that one personally.  Most of the time it's a mithril chest which I can't open so I don't even bother, and I rarely see the large chest that I can open.  
---
Sorry I can't be more helpful here!
---
9pm which server?
---
How can it be a dead server when blizzard said low pop realms have more people then any actual vanilla server back in the day? Those are medium pop realms, perfectly okay, actually better then okay, if you want the true classic experience roll on those realms. Not these 4 hour queue servers with thousands and thousands of players
---
My record was in the 20s before i stopped caring. Forgot the exact number. Never even told anyone until now. I‚Äôm sure a stealthed rogue probably caught a vod of it. Somewhere on youtube i bet with views in the 30s or so. I was in my mid 40s with kids when i did it but I stopped playing wow. RL first you know. Probably have like 50 kids or so, but I have no dna test.
---
NugEnergy is all I use that‚Äôs rogue specific
---
No I haven't.
---
Druid will likely be my alt. Never played the class, but I have a lot of respect for pretty much everyone who has.
---
Not even the most dead realm. Remulos has ***one*** Horde guild with an MC clear on warcraftlogs.
---
It's the unfortunate truth that there is going to be more than a couple dead realms in the next few months.
---
So if you dont farm 24/7 you wont get shit? Sounds great üëç
---
I think its really funny how many different people jumped on you for proof and pics immediately, hilarious to me.
---
Yeah, in your situation that seems like the right decision.
---
They might still bite you in the ass for the patreon. But here's to hoping they don't!
---
/chatlog ezpz
---
TBH i see it having way more than 30k active players, just judging by how how private servers have gone and how big a playerbase wow has maintained in general, but I could be wrong. MMOs do have an "end point" to some extent while games like starcraft do not, so who knows.
---
Could you explain to me why you rhino what you've quoted in any way contradicts what I've said?
---
There could be a single Alliance player on a 100% horde server and he would still try to gank at dungeon instances. It's what they do.
---
This is constant on bigglesworth except it‚Äôs mostly horde
---
Last few days I‚Äôve seen the alliance come back and clear em all
---
I've attended chinese GDKP runs on private servers before and let me tell you, they are fukin awesome if the following applies to you:
---
1. You are geared AF and just joining to share the gold at the end.
---
2. You are rich AF and can buy all the shit you want.
---
Basically, GDKP isn't for fresh 60s with constrained bank.
---
Classic healing was always fun to me.
---
I mean raiding in classic is basically show up, get loot. It‚Äôs that easy. 
---
Just find a guild with enough people.
---
Hes right tho, some people are just assholes that get off on making other people miserable; nothing left to discuss tbh.
---
How so, If im friendly with a reputation, why shouldnt they defend me if im attacked...
---
Stalaag should be horde heavy
---
I dont think Reddit has the reach to even influence Blizzard. Ive seen Riot devs active on /r/leagueoflegends but I have never seen a Blizzard dev officially acknowledge the WoW subreddits.
---
maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have listened to the bitching and opened so many realms the first week
---
Problems are already visible. Gehennas-EU had major problems yesterday in Orgrimmar. Opening mail took minutes, people got stuck into flight path, players just disappear in front of you..
---
And this all happens with just people doing their errands (AH, mail, trading etc). If they do not change things, our visions of large scale WPvP battles will never come true.
---
It is direct proof that reducing the layers directly increases queue times. Get your head out of the sand.

Last night lbrs "mage sheep the blue whenever I mark it"

I think he used sheep 3 times ... I marked nearly every grp with more then 3 npcs to make the life easier for our 57heal .

We had several adds and the mage never did any cc on his own.

Oh more mobs nice "spamming arcane explotion"
---
Why would you dual wield with mobs over your level and not use a 2h?
---
Until you forget a key to something
---
Want a challenge? Roll on Herod. Could use some more ally to eat
---
The point on GDKP runs is often that a large section of the attendees are geared AF and basically carry the raid, making up for consumables not being used.
---
It‚Äôs built on trust and there is no way that would ever work in eu or America
---
This would make guilds disband here
---
People here are all bastard coated bastards with bastard filing

Top guilds could prolly pull it off but I don‚Äôt see any reason for em
---
Morbid may mean something different than what you think it means, but your comment *did* make me look up the definition again just to be sure.
---
Could you explain why servers that have had 1 layer for weeks and no queue now have queues?
---
Farelina
---
With epic mount sometimes you can beat the dismount timer and go through the whole building onto the bridge to remain mounted. 
---
Don't know the exact mechanic of the dismount check but sometimes it has a pretty long delay. I just know that stopping, then moving again, or jumping seems to make it do a check right away.
---
Reddit: NOCHANGES

Reddit: UNSUBBED

So due to many comments like yours, I bought around 20 Lotus for a price of 23g each yesterday.
---
I feel like I'm on Wallstreet, really hope the will price will rise sooner or later  =)
---
Many factors influence queue times. This DIRECTLY proves that layers is one of them.
---
Also, I'm not convinced that actually happened. Do you have any proof?
---
But it has affected the queues when they've removed layers. Servers that had no que got que when layers were taken away. Also, when WoW Classic was released the  login queue dropped by aproxx 3500~ once in a while when layers were added.
---
If popcap is raised to 5k, the servers popcap is 10k with 2 layers. That's how it works, because that's what Blizzard have said it works like.
---
Not even gonna give any more time troll. Good day.
---
Well, when I'm going somewhere, I grab the key.  It's not exactly rocket surgery.
---
Blizzard have pretty strong monitoring and logging systems now compared to 2004-2006. Gold buying today is infinitely more risky and I honestly believe it wont' be *as much* of a problem now as it was back then. People dont want to risk perm ban now that the risk is so much higher. Adding to that, farming methods have been refined so even casuals can farm gold pretty efficiently now just by learning from a youtube video. I remember farming Tyrs hand as warrior in 2006, making maybe 10-15g/hour. Today I farm 3x that/hour by using more efficient methods.
---
That‚Äôs not the same. A mage doesn‚Äôt charge for gold in a dungeon or raid. Same with buffs. If you are in a town then you can expect tips, in a group not so much. With that said, if it‚Äôs locked, I usually pass for whoever unlocked it.
---
oh coo-\*70-30 server\*
---
so it's a pve event?
---
&gt;The original alliance hated the original Horde for not being human or almost human (night elves) in appearance.
---
Are you for real? Maybe it was something to do with the fact that the orcs invaded, raided and slaughtered their way through human lands for decades? That trolls are ancestral enemies of the EK Elves (from which they descent themselves) and that the Forsaken are an aberration. I don't think there's much about Tauren.
---
But overall, the orcs are interplanetary invaders that have already genocided other races in the past and attempted to do the same in Azeroth. They are even the canonical winners of Warcraft : Orcs &amp; Humans. They razed Stormwind.
---
It doesn't prove that it's just the wording they chose to use because they don't know or care about the argument we're having.  They're forcing 1 layer and reducing the cap which increases queues.
---
They will probably move those servers back then also
---
No, small indie team working on Classic, despite it saving WoW suscription numbers right now, when BfA failed miserably. I get it many people from original team were helping prior to launch, but it looks like now all those devs are making ShadowLands and only a bunch left to maintain Classic.
---
I just don't get it tho. Spending hours of your day just griefing, preventing people from playing the game? Could be making money, running instances, professions, alt. Litterally anything.. Like raiding org or whatever I get that but dozens of players standing outside instances for hours. Why
---
Our guild got him to 6% last week and then just couldn't do it. He's definitely going down this week though.
---
That is not proof that servers that were single layer before had no queues but have queues now. If you don't know what proof looks like, here is an example of overwhelming proof that removing layers increases queues:
---
&gt;We know that servers had double digit numbers of layers early on
---
I severely doubt that. I was on one of the large server and when I tested it never got near 10 layers. Do you have any proof?
---
&gt;do you believe that these servers have lost over 90% of their population as they dropped to 1 layer?
---
Not 90%, as I doubt any server had 10 layers, but yes I do believe there has been quite a large amount of loss in the player base.
---
50g start on everything 10g incitement bidding
---
same haha
---
 Hey man do you think if I'll use another command to reequip my staff after I use the spellstone by having a condition that is tied to the One hand's equipment will it work? Or will it fuck up everything cause supposedly it would activate on the same click as my command to use the spellstone? And if it wont work is there a way to tie this command to the fact nothing ia equipped on 17?
---
Herod. At 9pm was 2600 in queue, was almost 3 hour wait.
---
I second this. Come to Herod. Not only are we the biggest server behind Faerlina (if you even count those fanboys) We have a ton of alliance, probably more than most other servers. Ironforge  was absolutely packed tonight and so was stormwind. Make a level 1 and check it out for yourself. While we have a ton of alliance, we have even more horde. 
---
We could use you, and you will have a ton of guilds to choose from. Come to Herod.
---
Rogue engineer when the solution to a lock is overkill.
---
Impressive indeed! Gz on completion. I am on the same grind, but only need revered for Flamecore pants. Also doing it solo with DIOs. What would be your estimate om stacks needed for revered? Would be nice to have a concrete goal to work towards.
---
I guarantee thats the absolute majority. I rarely PvP, but once in a while I just feel like grouping up and fighting it out, and those few times are worth all the pain you have to endure while you get ganked while leveling.
---
Us too! I try to diversify as much as possible but it's hard. If you look at class server pop it's pretty obvious why mages/priests have such competition.
---
is there a way to set up details aggrometer to play a sound when you get above X% aggro? i havent played for a long time and was used to omen in wotlk. somehow i often miss, when i come close to pulling aggro. the dtm interface is a bit unclear to me.
---
I see. Magmadar only requires 1 presumably because your forst time there you only have 1.
---
The zep tower fight and stormwind were smooth (and darnassus, but there was no-one there..). Start of the raid  at ogrimmar where we slapped the one "small" raid and both times we headed to ironforge were lagfests.
---
It's called WIM or something

&gt;:(
---
Marksmanhubters will still outdamage u even without trueshot aura enabled, spec is only for late-late game and just shit with t1-t2. A beastmaster-marksman hybrid would be a better choice imo.

My point is that pre-1.12 racials didn't have a huge impact on faction pop then.
---
It was possible a long time ago to increase your base bag. But it did take them years and years.

Lol. You don't get to do that. You don't get to say "Yes, I know they *said* that it works this way, but it actually works the other way because I'm right and they just forgot and left it out."
---
There are MANY details that they left out. NONE of them allow you to ignore that they directly said that reducing layers increases queue times.

Youre not the hero we deserve but the hero we need!

So much for no changes. Fucking cunts.

You really just came here thinking "hmm how can I make this about me?"

Don't go to Skeram. It is one of the most unbalanced servers around.
---
Don't forget it has the best soundtrack too
---
The elite patrols in eastern plaguelands are an example that comes to mind. At least you can seperate them what I think this did is addressing since it doesn't feel right to pull the shadow priest lady only to fight her alone
---
I keep repeating for myself: why... why free private servers worked better, than blizzad does now?
---
Its not Blizzard anymore.
---
Should I be offended if some guild officer says, no hotw spec, respec deep resto or no raid spot for you?
---
It helped me a lot for tanking, so if you wanna tank BFD/stocks/gnomer it could be worth it. I also just love deadlines so I enjoyed getting it.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs built on trust

literally like Loot Council
---
That's highly subjective, I don't think many players would consider pvp fun
---
Standing on the ground, outside of a guard's aggro radius was \*\*never\*\* against ToS. If this were the case, you would be forced to aggro every guard in a city to be complying with ToS. Now, standing on top of a building, where guards were unable to reach you via any means? That \*\*is\*\* against ToS. Source: multiple GMs over my WoW career.
---
What? People waiting? This has never happened to anyone before ever
---
Way more players quit than one would have anticipated, considering a few months ago servers had numerous layers (so pop cap was 4 times bigger) and still 10k+ queues
---
What mod changes the original name plate appearance on enemy mobs?  I like it.
---
What is the addon used to display the damage numbers?
---
Nope, I'm horde; the theory is just outrageously dumb.
---
Literally rocket science:D
---
Don't play with anyone whose lifestyle forces them to severely restrict the amount of time that they have for it.  This isn't just because of the length of time that instances require, but because in my experience, the amount of time someone has available, tends to correlate with their level of kindness, as well.  Rushed, overworked people are unhappy people, and unhappy people are mean.
---
yes
---
That was because they removed layers which affected the spawn rate.
---
From boss in library
---
I know I won't have time to raid week in week out, so I will always be behind on DKP in any guild. That's fine, it's how it is. But I'll be decently geared with pre BiS and at least getting some gold would really incentivise me to help with a run in the knowledge I won't get gear
---
I personally saw a lot more people online on Stalagg. Cities have been a lot more full. 
---
That being said, I am happy that they finally implement faction specific transfers. Shoulda done it the first time around , but better late than never. So I do have some appreciation for them coming through with this part.
---
I don't imagine faction specific queues are any way close. This is just the way it is. Yeah it sucks, but you stayed on a high pop server. Just the way it is. This is going to happen every time a major news comes out for classic. You're going to see a huge jump in playerbase that will taper off after a week back down to normal/non queue times.
---
the server i was able to transfer to is dead as fuck. just a few dozen 60s online most nights.
---
Should have come to Burning Steppes, loads of dark iron and rich thorium
---
Some ppl live for others. Just like my mother:)
---
I mean 2h will miss 9% of the time on mobs 3 levels above you. 6% if you are human/orc using your specialized weps. Dual wield is 27% miss, and 24% with human/orc specialized. Plus you lose so much value from sweeping strikes, whirlwind, and mortal strike. I honestly cant see how dual wield is more efficient for this specific case.
---
Can I still get blasted by ranged dps from the booty bay water while fishing?  What about the edge of the ramp by the boat?  Been ganked there so many times while guards walked right by me doing Nothing.
---
Is the engi thing that boosts fishing by 100 worth it? I m 300 gnomish engi.
---
People don't get what safe spotting means. It doesn't refer to standing outside of a guard's aggro radius. It means attacking from a place that is unreachable by guard pathing.
---
Layers disabling? If they were disabled prior to that, then just a lot of people returned into the game to gank some Alliance on Horde dominated servers and vise versa in phase 2.
---
They make PVE servers for people like you btw.
---
I hope everyone that downvoted this comment feels stupid. There is now a blue post confirming that the Keyring will NOT be coming with Phase 2. It didnt come today and it won't come on Thursday.
---
Some of you idiots never learn, always sucking the teet of Blizzard despite their objectively terrible and vague communication.
---
It's always meant standing in a place where guards are unable to path. If safe spotting referred to standing outside of aggro radius of a guard, players couldn't attack each other outside of a town.
---
so....how do i enable the feature after disabling it??
---
Swipe alone will not keep aggro on the dps' main target. Compared to maul, swipe doesn't generate nearly as much threat. You need to work some mauls in on the primary target to keep aggro against geared dps. 
---
Try only swiping while a raid geared dagger rogue is backstabbing Skull over and over. Good luck.
---
I'm the guy who made the post that Blizzard is going too fast that got several gold and platinum and I'm fine with keyring coming later. Who gives a fuck lol*. It came later originally and anyway end of the year is really close.
---
So different people, different opinions. As it is, Reddit is not a singular entity.
---
* well apparently a lot of people

He hit a spot there....

It can be plenty hard if the specific design of bags didn't allow for any modularity with how they are setup.

I remember that Blizzard increasing the default backpack bag space eventually was a huge deal because the backpack space was hardcoded in memory with no wiggle room in adjacent blocks to allow for more memory to be used. So they had to rework the entire memory structure to be slow for a larger backpack.
---
Blastershot 100% of the time
---
Well survival won't work for higher dps right now. The change to survival for higher dps is pretty late game.
---
What you could do tho, would be a bm/mm spec with bother scatter shot and intimidate for pvp reasons, if your raid group doesn't mind, that you don't do Max dps.
---
Otherwise I can actually imagine a bm/survival specc as a melee hunter might also work for pvp, as people won't count with that. You would have to fight with rogues and warriors for the weapons tho
---
Shitty thing to do, but I doubt it would be ban worthy? When you join a raid you also agree to its premisses and loot system.
---
Getting attached by mobs but need to finish writing first
---
Okay, do they have 2 hours to beg for a group in game? I‚Äôm on netherwind and find it hard to get groups as a healer (60) during prime time for relevant things, many people on our server are raid logout status.

Bro nice

Let me put it this way: nobody else seems to pull off this level of fidelity. Also, that anime style (oddly) fits well into the Warcraft universe (and I am not an Anime fan).

Having played with alot of Chinese warriors, they are terrible players. Also they always slack on consumables. Warrior dps output is very dependant on:

A) Consumables
---
B) Gear

Hold on a second are you shitting on retail here ?
---
Are you telling me you hadn't ever told yourself "this game is beautiful" in years of playing retail before you played *classic* ?

Have you ever set foot in Sholazar ? Uldum ? Any zone in Pandaria or Draenor ? Azsuna ? Suramar ? Stormheim ?

Your cat is gorgeous. My first thoughts were: "Such a cutie" &lt;3

This is good advice, but if you plan on sticking with bear for a while, you should still try and get a cheap Warden Staff. Unyielding Maul is very marginally worse when comparing the weapons straight up, but it is currently better because you can attach an Iron Counterweight to it which gives you 3% haste (you can also put an Ele Sharpening Stone on it for +2% Crit). Once the +Agi enchants come out (phase 3 I think) Warden Staff will again be slightly better than Unyielding Maul. 
---
If you can find a Warden Staff for like 100g, it's probably worth scoping and banking, depending on how much disposable gold you have.
---
Wowhead has this great tool for searching up items where you can filter and sort stuff by the amount of agility on them, so finding out what the max. agility set available would be is actually pretty easy.  
---
[It looks something like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/mail-chest-armor?filter=21;5;1000#items:0-13+20)
---
nice
---
So you have minimum bids on items, and only allow higher bids in brackets of 5, or 10, or 20, or what-ever-gold-amount.
---
Can wait for hours in queue because playing with popular streamers is more important than my time
---
I support this simply because the horde on Stalagg are complete twats.
---
Make a level 1 gnome, run to IF and make a gold beg whisper macro, send to everyone in IF, then get the tram to SW, do the same. Mail any money to your main and delete the character, rinse repeat.
---
The queue isn't a problem by itself. The problem is that a full server that also has a facrion imbalance will make the imbalance more severe, because the underdog faction will already have additional pressure to transfer if they seek a balanced experience. An imbalanced server with a queue can kill a server or at least exacerbate the problem. 
---
Faction specific transfers were obviously, and everyone is happy they did that. Faction specific queues follow the same logic and Blizzard should implement them before it is too late.
---
For Revered I believe you only need 240 stacks of Dark Iron.
---
Sure lol
---
It sounds like you were dealing with a warrior player who didn't want to listen to advice; but then again, given the prevailing mindset that DPS is the only thing that matters, he might have also had the belief that if he just concentrated on doing as much damage as possible, that that would generate sufficient threat by itself.
---
There is ***intense*** negative stigma in this subreddit, against using Protection spec and a shield.  In my experience a person can expect to be viciously condemned and attacked if they are using anything other than Arms and a 2h, regardless of the situation they are in.  Even people who are polite about it will still be very adamant.
---
So as tanks, we can expect to be condemned either way.  If that Warrior wasn't sundering and couldn't hold threat because of that, then he gets called a bad tank; but I, when sundering and using Revenge, can still get called a bad tank if the DPS think I am too slow, even if by doing so I am making sure that no one dies.
---
In my experience, the only thing that DPS really care about, is a group taking as little time as is humanly possible.  They want everything five minutes ago.  I rail against this, so I am called a bad tank; but again, an Arms tank with a 2h who is doing everything the community tells him to, won't be anywhere near as effective for holding threat as someone who is specced Prot and knows how to use it; and will therefore be called a bad tank.
---
But you really think the classic team is just sitting on their asses doing nothing?
---
Well, yeah, but it's still an amazing trinket :)
---
Borders off, class colours on, power bars on
---
Which zone ooc?
---
You could stand on the tip of the ship that's on top of the inn in Ratchet and shoot people below you without being attacked. The guards couldn't find their way up but would attack anyone that shot back or tried to run up and attack.
---
I hope this fixes it.
---
The raids I have attended has required you to either be geared AF (being a carrier) or if low geared you'd be expected to bring alot of gold.
---
Oh ok. I reread and now I see that.

There's a good handful of quality PeterSteele brand free bags floating about too.

"What‚Äôs fun about killing low level players?"
---
Short answer is; posts like OPs. I am fueled by the salty tears of players that willingly rolled on a PvP realm.
---
If you want a longer answer it boils down to denying the enemy. Every minute I keep your level 49 priest from leveling up is another minute without a priest camping Blackrock Mountain mind controlling people into the lava. Every minute I kill you and force you to call for help is a minute where your faction can't farm resources or get their quests or gearing done.
---
It's nothing personal.
---
They can be a bit clingy.
---
same, doesnt track anything...im going to try older version, cant test right now, in a server que
---
Thanks! The mats from MC count as 4 stacks so any leftover gold will help out. And Blood of the Mountain is something like 0.5% drop from each mine. So, it all comes together in the end. Good luck!
---
Ah, dang, not one of my raiders. Poor lowbie.

Buying gold is already against ToS and Blizzard has some pretty good systems these days to detect it.

what if i told you that your server and his server will probably have the same amount of people playing at once, its only the queues that change..

I reached 60 yesterday with about 7.5days played + 1day on an alt. This calculated to roughly 2.5 hours of play EVERY DAY.
---
Miss one day? Play 5 the next.. etc

Working full time and having a family which I believe alot of the veterans have. I do not think it is strange that many have not reached 60 yet.

I do find it strange seeing how many people can play this game all day every day. How is this possible? Are they on Welfare?

Havent seen any bloods yet. When my guild finaly get around to doing MC, im hoping to score a deal for the mats, lets see. Original plan, however, was to do it solo. U just proves it possible!

&gt; Not true at all. I legit hate gold farming. Others only want to raid. This system is not for a lot of people.

You literally just pointed out two pro's.

You hate Goldfarming -&gt; Which is why the 300-500g after each raid will come in Handy.

Such a done statement just gtfo. Every server was overcrowded until they came with the dead ones. Noone is transfering when lvl 60 and in a solid community.

I mean it was rather obvious. They said first patch months ago and didn‚Äôt say a word about it since then.

I started a warrior (level 15 atm) out to try tanking and I've read a good amount, but still seems a but unclear.  I'm specing arms to make soloing easier if needed, but I plan to mostly dungeon with this guy so I might respec...
---
I've read a decent amount but doesn't feel like I'm getting everything...
---
From what I've read it seems to be:
---
Charge
---
Shouts (Demoralizing then battle?)
---
Consider Thunder Clap on harder hitting targets?
---
Apply sunders
---
Revenge when u can
---
Cleave / Heroic Strike when necessary
---
Shield Block when down (wont get for another level)
---
Theres no mention of Overpower, Rend, etc...or Shield Bash although Shield Slam is mentioned, but wouldnt get unless Deep prot.

Tried to just read and not bother anyone with questions, but so much info to digest lol

I jumped up after my 32nd flip and just started flying upwards in a continuous flip, the 33rd flip got going and set me spinning faster and faster. I tried to count the spins but my character turned in to a blur in the middle of my screen, allwhile continuing up and further up. 
---
I tried logging out and resetting but whenever I logged in I get back to the same spinning flying night elf.
---
I was doing the first satyr packs (8 pull) with decent results as a new player with mediocre dungeon blues and no t1/t2. I think the best money is just to clear up to that and stop.

Just crafted my Robe of the Archmage last night; now with its active effect + mana ruby I can clear with 100% success in 13-15 minutes.

" Memes are the lifeblood of the internet."

I'd say this is pretty subjective.
---
I am sorry to hear youve experienced that. I've been in bad ones too usually where theres drama dealing with relationships. But I've been in much more successful ones too. So my own guild decided wed do it ourselves. And we've been very good with it. Half of our officers actually have less gear than the other members of their fellow class. Theres never been a time where every officer votes on the same person to get an item unless only one person wanted it for example. The first weapons to drop went to non officers too. Like for me, I'm a fury warrior and officer. Deathbringer dropped, and I didn't even put my name out for it.
---
You will have drama with all loot systems though. DKP has issues just like LC. I did DKP in vanilla, we used a bidding system. It was great until the next tier came out and everyone had hoarded their DKP for it so we were disenchanting upgrades.
---
/r/notfunny

Yes because 3-4 raids Alliance we're at gate and it started lagging so much we could've enter even if we wanted. The lag was very bad ! Idk how they consider themself ready for ph2 with that kinda servers?

Unless you done a lot of dungeons you will probably need some better gear to be able to it efficiently.
---
Adds can be tanked out of los from each other too - that‚Äôs what we do. We kite the adds one at a time into a corner where they are out of LOS of the others and dps them down. all they can do is heal themselves (though i can‚Äôt remember if they can actually heal themselves and not just others)
---
That depends on what you're after. If you are after gear then yes. More gold means you get more epics. If you are already geared and just want gold, then attending GDKP as a carrier can net you some good gold.
---
its a win-win system actually. Unless you are a fresh 60 with no gold and no gear.

Only worth it if you intend on doing those dungeons anyways, do not go out of your way for that one‚Ä¶ Go out of your way at lv30 for Succ if drain tanking, go out of your way for the blue offhand (still have it at 59..), go out of your for your blue robe at 35 - 37 if you do not expect do venture into a dungeon that drops one! :)

Even though you might have enough hit to not miss with your abilities hit still is valuable because the white hit cap is almost 25% at 305 weapon skill and most of your damage comes from white hits as well. Striker's Mark is better for dps than Blastershot.
---
Using your brain you would realise Broken Tooth is probably the best pet to run outside of raids if BM specced since it will have more Frenzy uptime than anything else. In fact, frenzy uptime is so high on Broken Tooth that you will have almost 100% uptime on long fights with 3/5 frenzy, while other pets require 4/5 or 5/5.

Just make an alt, send the things to the alt, have the mailbox be the bank
---
a raid geared rogue was selling the boost for 100g, pay on drop. we duo farmed the boss - he had an Engi trinket and bombs to kill the adds immediately, he would tank the boss with evasion, then vanish when low, at which point I would pop my evasion, and we'd kill the boss. I would then vanish and he would run out of the window as he was a gnome.
---
Because originally that wasn't how I they planned to do it. They just didn't want 5000 people in the starting area so still 5000 people on but over several layers. but since it's far more popular then they thought they started using layers to increase pop per realm
---
But there are no more layers, so the amount of time per person in queue increases.
---
Yeah who the fuck came up with these garbage rules?
---
Will have to try this. I've counterspelled them in the past but I guess it wasn't the right spell because they feared immediately after.
---
Well thats not really true tho, if you wanna compete as a melee you have to grind winterspring + gold for mats or just herb them yourself. Either way you cant just keep getting pots and juju's by raidlogging
---
implying it's not the same thing.
---
On my server it was 5-10 min respawns even with 2 layers so that should not have affected it, also there were more players online/in the zone earlier on when the respawns was longer. So blizzard changed the spawnrate manually 100%.
---
Lawbringer cant drop for horde. Couldnt in vanilla either. Just after the BC Prepatch.
---
Loot council works wonders for serious guilds in retail where you actually need to distribute gear to progress, it does not work in classic. (Or generally does not work).
---
People are greedy, and the only reason to have gear is for your own amusement, since its not needed to progress.
---
the offhand is super awesome, it has an active heal effect minimizing your downtime and you can pair it with hypno blade from sm-lib and wear it into your 40s
---
You can also drink and Shadowmeld in Moonkin form. I had no idea either.
---
Yes but that's been fixed in the legion client. So were back to wtf is blizzard doing
---
Its pretty easy.
---
Just say "Everyone who can open rolls". Most likely you will be the only one rolling.
---
As many ppl told you. You can play retri but it will be very hard to find a spot in raids. As you will do damage like tank if not less. But if u feel happy to play it, do it! You can always respec on holy or prot if u feel like it. Good luck!
---
Pretty sure you actually on a high lvl herbalism..
---
I'm on a PvE server and there were times I saw low level players and was tempted to gank them (*I mean come on, I'm playing an undead rogue!*), but ultimately decided against it because I'd feel too guilty.
---
The truth is it can be tempting to....well, bully. I see someone leagues below my level (and on a PvE server, it's very easy to NOT be flagged) and it can be tempting to gank them. I hate to say it, but it's the feeling of being more powerful than them and having the ability to get away with it that drives the desire to gank lower leveled players.
---
For the record I haven't, but I recognize the feeling.

also, probobly not their only char standing there so they can still play with their mains :D
---
sounds like he's just a bad player, not because he's a multiboxer
---
Agreed. Blizzard was fuking stupid with the release.
---
They went from 5 servers to 50 in just a few days. Instead they should've opted for 15 servers on release and waited a little.
---
Wait. Next you are going to tell me asian people are not all the same.

Also understand that warlocks are just a good pvp class. They're hard to counter for mages.

I think he meant the person being attacked needs to be at least friendly for them to come to defense.

I also think I read that in recent patch notes, I thought it was about other factions though.

It existed on private servers, ill be suprised if it doesnt happen in classic.
---
Honestly I'll be more excited for the honor system once BGs are out. For me the most fun thing in phase 2 will be mountain/world boss PvP. Roaming around ganking people will be fun for a bit, but not as good as battling for a world boss for hours to secure that BiS loot.
---
I haven't been playing wow classic as much as I thought but proper class quests are one of the things I miss most. I'd do the quest just to experience it again whether I need the staff or not.

Only quest I go out of my way to do is the Succubus one

Checking ironforge.pro arugal is A45 / H55. I don't think it gets much better than that?
---
I think Rhok is a pretty good weapon for a long time.  Could probably sit on that instead of fighting for melee weapons. 0o
---
Nice looking ui. What's the unit frames, raid frames and action bars?
---
Yeah... nah. A lot of the transfer servers are dead and would be boring to play on depending on your play style. If you can't tolerate a queue, then don't, but don't act like everyone should do the same. Faerlina is a super fun server.
---
it's not the same. DKP for raid consumables is much more abusable system than this. this system pays out to everyone in the end and has a lot of failsafes that DKP simply doesn't account for. the only thing you need is a GM who isnt' gonna ninja 13k gold.

this dude gets it. No DKP system is actually equivalent to this because none of them give you an immediate return on time investment every time.

GDKP is kinda a bad name for it because it's not really anything like DKP besides the bidding.

but I did also see other advertisments that said you could just afk at entrance, so I guess that's possible too. but probably costs more as it needs more boosters.

The GM will allow rolling with advantage. Still only ups yours to 33% instead of 20% to win it. Can't be paying for someone else to get a chest 2/3 of the times. (I just guessed all this math, most likely wrong)

I still don't understand why people are complaining about this, you are on PvP server. The horde are your enemy. They kill you because they can and they should. Do you think this will change when your'e 60? It will most definitely not change and you will still get ganked while doing anything in the game. When P2 hits, it's gonna be constant ganking and griefing, even more than now.
---
You can start BRD at 48+, healer's do not need to hit the mobs so you can be under leveled. Do arena runs or something.
---
Dungeon trash doesn't live long enough to apply 5 sunders. You would need 75 rage for that (unless you're specced prot for leveling)

Some of us don't care about pvp

Yeah.  So after 8 weeks (OP said everyone got around 300) of no loot I'll finaly be able to afford mageblade for 2800G (OPs number)

It's never been worth it based on 'success' rate vs 'stuff it was meant to stop'. If you like the once in a blue moon type niche scenarios then sure (and if you absolutely cannot find better talents to pick, which is insanely hard all things considered).

Interresting, i havent experienced this since ive been to cheap to pvp respec. But it is kind of a huge deal. Did this happend right after respec? Or does it happen even if youve been logged out and come back in, the fall dmg 10 sec cooldown that is?
---
 Im thinking maybe cause of stupid wow classic scripting the login 10 sec cd could be cause by your talents not loading before your abilities and then it takes the standard stealth cooldown.   
---
Could you please make a video or a bug report about it?
---
use a condom next time
---
My god you just described my situation almost exactly. My little one is 5.5 months old and doesn‚Äôt sleep regularly so i can‚Äôt really play coninously for longer periods. I found myself playing too much at times - a time i could have spent with him. So i made a rule - i can play only when he is sleeping AND if that doesn‚Äôt make me oversleep the next day and reduce time spent with him.
---
I‚Äôve been leveling hunter and liking it a lot. How hard are raid spots to come by for hunters and do you really even need to run dungeons for hunter gear outside of BiS? 
---
Is alliance warlock as bad as people say? I‚Äôd like to try another fast leveling class at some point.
---
Thanks for posting that. It confirms what I've historically been told by GMs. By people, I was referring to the people that have been crying "safe spotting" whenever a guard doesn't aggro someone.
---
Try playing a hunter and you will really feel the pain!
---
It's especially great if you are an enchanter and you have to keep 5 enchanting rods on you/in the bank. Engineering is really fun too with it's 3 tools and tons of other gadgets.
---
That‚Äôs what I mean. Wanted to make sure I didn‚Äôt farm eggs today in vein lol. Thanks!
---
I dont think thd details plugin has an option for that, but maybe try WeakAuras and set it up yourself? Not sure if that will work either, depends on if WeakAuras can get data from details
---
Yep :)
---
Example 100 dmg each sek = 4 sek = 400 dmg from one mob.
---
Miss one attack avg? =300 dmg.
---
Attack 25%lower = 1.20s per attack = 300 dmg
---
But slow is way better because less burst and more reliable
---
No, but if this lord almighty out dps'es fury wars in leather he should.
---
That‚Äôs actually such a good idea
---
GDKP was very popular in WOTLK. Perhaps before your time?
---
This shit is exactly why I rolled PvE this time around.
---
Thanks dude. Are they horde or alliance?
---
**GIVE US FACTION SPECIFIC QUEUES AND ENFORCE A 50/50 concurrent online balance (or atleast 55/45, or 60/40, or what ever). JUST DO SOMTHING**
---
Faction specific queues for high pop servers would be a good way to force some on bigger faction to xfer away
---
This happened on my first classic guild. Joined because they were established in retail and it turns out that meant that officers and the "in" crowd got everything and new classic players got nothing.
---
When raid time came around most people had no idea whether or not they were getting in. I'd been a member since like week 2 of classic where 60s were few and far between helping people out, being active in game and discord and come time for the first full guild raid, nothing. Some people streamed them and I'd never even seen most of the raidrrs talk in guild chat.
---
They said they'd be rotating raid spots to try and get a good team but what that actually meant was that 30+ people had guaranteed spots and the other 40 or 50 level 60s had to log on and hope. There was absolutely zero communication from officers in regard to raid spots.
---
To top it off their "epgp" system was basically ignored and they loot counciled gear to their buddies. Week 2 raid they gave mageblade to an officer's alt.
---
During all this we'd have 5 to 10 people gquit every week on raid day. On week 3 I didn't get a spot so I quit and immediately found my current guild. It was started by a few friends and is mostly comprised of new players.
---
The leadership runs a "transparent" loot council (everybody that wants a piece links their current gear and rolls, then the council deliberated and takes rolls and upgrade potential into account) that as far as I'm aware everyone is fine with, there's little to no loot drama, everyone is fun to play with, among the raiders everybody knows everybody for the most part. It's like night and day from my previous guild.
---
&gt; The amount of resources they have dedicated to Classic is laughable.
---
Hey, at least that's the genuine vanilla feeling! For those who haven't been around, there has been a lot of criticism of vanilla WoW back then, mostly pointing out how all the post-release content was stuff that was already in the game files since the beta.
---
Queues arent awesome. 
---
We did a tonne of queues in the first week and you just do life stuff while you wait. 
---
Starting zones were awesome the zerg and trying to fight and make it was soo good.
---
The world of pvp is alive.
---
Alts usually have bigger bags than the 10 (or 12?) slot bag from the quest.
---
Holy shit, I haven't seen Slahser since he was making meme strats for Dota.
---
Was expecting a Slahser's way of raiding MC with a magetank or something.
---
&gt; If you're broke and don't farm then you won't get loot initially but you'll get a ton of gold so you can afford to buy your fair share of loot after a short span of time.
---
Or now people have even stronger incentive to buy gold, making the market inflation at crazy level. Anyone who can't log in for raid will have to swallow the bitter fact that mats like essences of water/air/earth are now 30-50g.
---
You do realize warlocks can farm just as efficiently right? If not even more efficiently since Lasher farm is so nerfed here compared to private servers. Warriors can tank strat live and reserve orbs and earn just as much if not more than a Mage can farming ZF/DM/Mara. Farming Black Lotus at off-hours was also really easy before they removed layering. I keep seeing these complains "REEE mages solo everything qqqqqqq" when it's not even the best solo farming class in this phase.
---
Or reflected with Shadow Reflector, which is fun
---
He speaks with reason....get em boys
---
Procrate is low, and it will "sort-of" follow if its continiously kept in combat. If combat ends, he wont follow you when you move to the next pack/boss.
---
I like that outlook.
---
If you dont agree with me, you just did not understand it fully. Cant have different opinions right?
---
I'm actually typically the opposite. I'm very live and let live, no grudges. I'm just jaded by overwhelmingly poor interactions with Americans in Korea (they're almost imperialistic here?) and I have the self dignity to recognise when I'm being used the way Cythrex is. 
---
Maybe he views it as mutually beneficial but anybody with sense can see he is being used to provide free English lessons. Korean gamers have absolutely zero reason to play in an English language using guild other than this, and you can ask any foreigner living in Korea how desperate Koreans are to learn English.
---
Is also for pve. Gluth onyxia etc
---
Rule 7 in 3...2...1
---
Both the Sacrifice at Zevrim and the poison at the last boss can be LoS'd.
---
Every time I see this place, or the camp in Thousand Needles, I have to wonder what the hell they'd do if a bunch of people just went at the base with a bunch of picks and shovels
---
This is why i gave up tbh, i know it will just frustrate me trying to pvp in large groups
---
Amazing. Thanks for this, bud!
---
Census addon is broken. Stop grasping at straws.
---
Yea, key rings came after chain mail
---
As a druid i still lose mana when a hunter viper stings me in cat/bear. Legitimately makes the feral vs hunter duel flip completely. I know people talk more about other bugs, but for fuck sake this one is so frustrating.
---
It was fixed in patch 1.4, and it cannot possibly be that hard to fix.
---
&gt;Right, but my point is they never merged realms even when there was no cross server functions.
---
Probably because crossrealm functions where always planned as the solution to this. Wont happen in Classic, so they might aswell merge.
---
Maybe he just needs a writer?
---
He‚Äôs a lying he bitch then
---
&gt;Which means someone would have to run 8 weeks of raiding for a CHANCE to get 1 item.
---
No different from your chances when rolling for all drops. Luckily, there is more than one item.
---
I doubt any veteran players can play every day for 6+ hours or whatever.
---
There are still a lot of young people playing who might be at school still.
---
Failing on certain doors at 300 every now and then is annoying tho
---
Or or OR hear me out.
---
You could take their free transfers.
---
Wait WAIT. With kut complaining about it being dead
---
None of those are axes. I‚Äôm an orc, i use axes because of axe specialization! üòÑ
---
Typically its not good for pve because youll die if the tank isnt fear warded or stance dancing.
---
Please consider Incendius. As a horde player can confirm its one of the most balanced servers there are but we are a little horde heavy. Alliance raid UC all the time and honestly I'm happy that I have moved there. Economy is very fresh, cities are packed, come hang out!
---
I mean, both.
---
Sure, MC is easy, but classic isn't just MC. People are gearing up for PVP and BWL progress. Good guilds are taking loot dist very seriously because of how few items you get from MC and how relatively close BWL is.
---
People are wise to corrruption nowadays. So any guild I know of that does LC (including ours) is EXTREMELY cognizant of fairness because they know people won't take bullshit.
---
Maybe it's different in the US but that's my current experience on EU. People who treat MC gesr as a joke/trophy are in for a rude awakening come BWL.
---
Looks like the old guy from Hunter X Hunter!
---
This solution forces people who choose a PVP realm to be on a PVE realm. 
---
Most people on PVP realms actually enjoy pvp. What if you get on the PVE layer several weeks in a row? How is that any fun?
---
It's mostly because of DM Tribute runs, the potions are cheaper than the mats.
---
Still better than 14 years ago where you only needed 100 horde to lag the server out.
---
This game is so complicated, I don't understand a thing
---
Maybe you only started more recently?
---
They should bring the darkness version for the Scourge invasion event! :D
---
Blaster is for pvp, strikers is better overall
---
So I guess when priests are bidding against mages for the same item, the priests tends to be at the back of the queue
---
It also has a lot to do with hardware and engine improvements.
---
Places like Tanaris, Un'Goro, Searing Gorge - I don't remember these zones being anything special at all back at 800x600 resolution on a CRT monitor and crap view distance.
---
Suddenly, I'm seeing rolling sand dunes in Tanaris and it looks really nice.
---
While this is true, and the GitHub repo info for the private server code is very interesting, they should have anticipated the need for a rewrite with the inception of the project and done it before release. They must have been aware of the limitations of what the servers could support.
---
So you're not a "Classic player" if you like this system? I play Classic and I think this is dope and I don't conform to any of the points you made?
---
" will phase 2 make leveling on a new server absolutely painful? "
---
It will be the hardest time in your life!
---
But without a good challenge, life is boring!
---
I'm a rogue I'm only 42 tho rn lol I'll give it a try tho
---
Oh shit dr yeast what‚Äôs up!!
---
The entitlement is real.
---
I'm leveling a tank just now after playing healer for a while for this reason.  
---
Already excited to meet these kind of people.
---
bored of raiding?
---
That's fucked
---
Where in Lib? I‚Äôve been there, but there‚Äôs only a bunch of busy elves
---
7.5 days is also fairly fast btw. A lot of people will take ~10 days played to 60 afaik
---
Enchanting/Engineering (PvP server) Druid. I‚Äôm feral/resto 30/21 and I OT for my guild and have to carry tank gear, consumables, resistance gear and healing gear. -.- along with all the enchanting and engineering toys and rods. This broke me.
---
Thanks for taking the time to upload this! Must have taken you quite a while to get it right.
---
Seems decent for pugs and pretty bad for a guild.
---
Loved that youtube comment under ur vid :-D
---
Having 305 weaponskill essentially counts as +3% hit. Rogues get 5% hit from combat talents, so to hit the 9% ability hit cap you only need 1% hit on your gear. Hit chance beyond that improves your white hits but it basically means that you're easily able to sacrifice hit chance for stats/crit.
---
oh no! muh content!
---
My server has no ques, layers have been off for a while. 
---
Its also high pop, there are masses of people online, super easy to find groups for stuff, theres always pug raids going and the population seems stable.
---
 Servers with way smaller populations than this didnt "die" in vanilla, the high and even med pop servers will be fine in the long run as their populations are mostly already higher than full vanilla servers.
---
I noticed this bug when I was levelling - nobody seemed to know WTF I was talking about though.
---
Have to admit I abused it to kill the Forsaken Courier (the UD with like 6 bodyguards).
---
Ask them to hire you, you fool!
---
Crystals/Sapphires from rich thorium veins but couldn't get shit yesterday on single layer firemaw..
---
I leveled my shaman as elemental, Boomkin probably wouldn't be much different. Though a certain wider range of mobs i can easily kill. Elementals with nature immunity is quite annoying as a shaman.
---
I dont understand what point you're trying to make. There is no such thing as infinite gold so that point is moot.
---
Back in wrath of the lich king my close friends and i ( who at the time was part of the "1%" ) use to host 25man gdkps and, the ammount of gold people would spend to catch alts up was absolutely disgusting, i have a screenshot buried somewhere on my old rig of after LK from one of our most successful nights and had almost reached gold cap. (214.7k gold)
---
It was insane how much wealth some people had.
---
I just started my character two weeks ago. Not everyone started playing at release and not everyone levels like a maniac. Even though I really played a lot these last two weeks. 
---
I get that people want to have real world pvp action, but having 3-5 horde for each alliance player is really no fun for me personally, which is why I‚Äòm really looking forward to bgs.
---
I mean its just a game, i get off on that kind of things in a viritual world. But irl im pretty nice.
---
sit in kargath and spam "portals 1g", you'll have you epic mount in a day
---
Seems like a stack of Pi's yeah.
---
Haha this post is a lovely blast to the near past. Didnt age well
---
I run a skullforge reaver and shield on a holy-reckoning build. It's so funny getting the reckoning pop when i finally get a millisecond of not being stunned, quadruple reckoning them for half their health and apply the 30 second dot from the sword. 
---
A real spirit breaker
---
Well, there are no axes available that are better than those two I listed that are axes.
---
Probably not then i'll yoink my free transfer from blizzard and join whitemane :)
---
Any tips or tricks for SFK? Or just Holy Nova everything?
---
and a cat!
---
Sunder not only generates threat. Its a major dps buff for the group and should never be missing from a boss.
---
That's not true according to data (I'm Horde)
---
Top dps on trash. Main dispeller on bosses. The o shit back up healer. King of the burn phase. But keep believing its a meme specc and inactive roll... mc is hard too no? Never gonna happen rag kill 1st week talk
---
Multiboxer? Those tauren definitely look related ...
---
Got a kid same day classic released, I'm 55 now. Just play a few hours a day
---
Herb/Alch
---
This game is called Warcraft!
---
If you got no fun in a war, you should play hello kitty world!
---
You must be a nice person to get to a ‚Äùpersonal level‚Äú, because I just commented about something I‚Äòm not too fond of in a game, man.
---
same deal here but both sides had the same rules and were required to show up with 100k min
---
Don't join a raiding guild until 60, people just gonna stress you about getting 60.
---
it is  same in Chinese servers too. positive sides are more than negative here actually. at worst you end up with some gold in your pockets.
---
wtf
---
Why would they do that, honestly
---
You are playing a decade old game... the same thing happens on retail (look at the Ashran battleground)
---
Nothing is going to stop this lag. This is what blizzard meant by the "think you do, but you dont"
---
No, only linked mobs. The scarlet courier and the oracle would be such mobs. On the courier, you could pull him and just wait for his bodyguards to reset before fighting him solo. 
---
Solenor the slayer is the felwood demon target for the hunter weapon quest.
---
As an alliance place on Yojamba, my lowest number of deaths before getting into BRD is two. Only dying once sounds amazing. 
---
I have had groups fall apart before they start because some party members give up trying to get to the entrance
---
Auctionator or auctioneer I think
---
Not the point, faction balance is the point, not the queues.
---
Wooosh...
---
Which hasnt passed yet, i am still on that train tho, boredom is real
---
Yeah, I play on a RP-PVP and it seems nice. No one is hardcore pvp or anything. We all just play the game normally.
---
It gets cheaper over time because there are fewer people bidding against one another I would assume. You run a few of these and you have enough to grab a piece of gear and then still get your share of the money back at the end. 
---
Eventually every other character that needs that item will have it and you'll be bidding against no one.
---
Theres only two raids, if you only play for raids only then theres gunna be a lot of downtime.. There's so many other things to do than prevent other people from playing the game
---
Not just hidden bids; hidden bids with an incentive to bid higher even if you guess that your bid is already higher than anyone else's bid.
---
I've thought of a refinement that makes it easier to use with the base game and given it a new name: **Flamestrike Single Bid** system, or **FSB** (not to be confused with the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation). A mage casts flamestrike, and everyone announces their bid when the spell casts.
---
You can also use a warlock using their channeled PBAoE, and everyone bids at the moment the warlock dies. Anything flashy and predictable. It's like rock paper scissors. It's better if everyone types out their bid like "Thirty eight gold" but doesn't matter much since an addon could do that too.
---
To reiterate what's in the linked post; after everyone simultaneously places their bid, the raid leader finds who bid the highest and announces that. People who want to match that value can then /roll based on their own bid. The person who rolls highest wins the item at the price of the highest bid.
---
So if Nadia bid 38 gold, and the highest bid was Mikhail's 400 gold, then Mikhail would /roll 400, while Nadia would /roll 38, and if Mikhail rolls 10 while Nadia rolls 35, then Nadia pays 400 gold for the item. The raid leader splits the gold with the raid using the system of 8 sub-leaders (since WoW does not have a more convenient way to do it).
---
When dual wield tanking MC as Fury/Prot what bosses would you advice using a shield against?
---
They definitely reduced server cap.
---
Don‚Äôt go storm strike and get the healing cost +totem cost reduction from resto so you can get the + hit talent
---
shouldnt little kids be on school right now, instead of being on the internet
---
Shoo, go back to school
---
I never understood this. I assume it is people who have been bullied that needs to compensate, or just your average low-IQ person with lack of self-confidence,
---
you see that change Realm button... ?
---
Press it, and use its functionality
---
Rem is the only pve Oceanic server so it's not to do with there being too many servers!
---
If/when paid transfers are added, yes. Free transfers across server type are unlikely.
---
Except I did it all the time on Kazzak-EU back in Wrath.
---
This. The queues aren't this issue, the issue is sitting in a queue almost as long as the amount of alliance on the server. I'm sure not even horde want to play on a server with no alliance.
---
Nothing to merge Rem with though, it's the only pve Oceanic server
---
Removing layering does not change how many people fit on one server. It simply puts all players in one layer.
---
Increased queues are not from layer removal but from increased interest by players. People returning, playing because of changes to the game
---
Yeah, I get that. Just didn‚Äòt expect the whole reaction just because I questioned something in a game. 
---
But then everyone cries when people outside of reddit or the gaming community call people toxic on here.
---
It‚Äòs not like I want to take the fun from you or want to change anything. I also don‚Äòt think you‚Äôre a bad person for killing players in a pvp based game. But I guess people read a lot into stuff on here.
---
Where did you pull 80/20 out of?
---
Do you want to wait in queue? Everyone hates queues. You pay for the game and you can't play it. Blizz shouldn't be forcing people to transfer to different servers. It should stay as an opt in functionality.
---
Jamflex bad swampman good
---
Naaah we just have a bunch of Hunters, lol.
---
Thanks. I hate it.
---
I didn't do it till lvl 52 because I didn't realise it was a thing, just saying :)
---
Sen‚Äòjin wasn‚Äôt that bad! 
---
We farmed allis many times in IF and there was at least like twice as much at 12pm
---
But yeah it wasn‚Äôt a high pop server...
---
I started flipping right after the launch. Haven't stopped since then. I use adult diapers so I won't have to leave my pc. I assumed this was normal so I didn't bother with recording it. But the delivery guy who keeps feeding me saw me doing it.
---
WOO RESULTS
---
Or you spec into deep prot for a week or two until you are decked out from dungeons and then respec to do other stuff.
---
Works well every time. But then I 100% focus on dungeon running when in prot spec and do nothing else.
---
And then 1/3 of alliance would be paladins and 1/3 would be priests to accommodate that.
---
You realise it‚Äôs a haikmoo ...
---
And here i am in a loving relationship with a baby on the way, works doing good. Was promoted to lead role before summer. And im ganking allys every evening to unwind.
---
My IRL life is probably happier then my wow life.
---
As a lvl 41 druid, im fishing (mostly Oily Blackmouth) and flipping vendor recipes. Bought my Warden staff (bid for 189g) and slowly working it up to 200g again to buy my mount.
---
I'm referring back to the first few weeks of launch where many servers had queues of over 2 hours, and when most of the transfers took place. I can't judge how the removal of layering is going to affect the highest population servers yet.
---
Yeah, there are both, I was just disagreeing when the guy said "no-one".
---
what do you mean 'more than anticipated'. It followed the same pattern as any game release these days. Lower queues doesn't necessarily mean less players too, it just means players don't necessarily log in everyday after a couple of month (when they will usually play a lot at release). It is a good thing anyway. Most medium/high servers are way overpopulated anyway. The Vanilla world is just not designed for such high pops.
---
*Jurassic park music*
---
You're still attacked by guards, if you attack a player, regardless of status in goblin cities. So your point doesn't make much sense.
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
What they do inside the game is irrelevant, you're at least *playing* it. If they can't find a group at that moment they can go do something else rather than watching a number tick down.
---
I presume it's that all the night elfes have a very similar model and similar equipment
---
One solution to this might be for money from class-specific drops to be shared only within that class. Advantage: it doesn't matter whether the members of a class agree to bid low on an item only they can use. Disadvantage: less of a penalty for playing a popular class, I guess? If all bids are fair, sharing earnings this way slightly increases variability of reward for going to the raid, but it's still much less variable than a raid where all drops are rolled for and if you win, you pay nothing for the item, while if you lose, you get nothing.
---
It becomes less feasible to round-robin drops if you use the Flamestrike Single Bid system, described here: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dvjmpi/korean_wow_raiding_culture_info_in_comment_gdkp/f7dxaie/
---
Whether players can collaborate to round-robin with FSB is like whether people can agree to roll Greed on BoE blues or epics in a 5-person group. Some people think you should, but all it takes is a single person to decide to hit Need, and then everyone has to. With a multiple-bid system, if someone does this you can just bid above them, but not with single-bid.
---
You can't transfer to gehennas.
---
Ahaha only 13 upvotes dude, it should be okay :)
---
*says loudly in british accent*
---
Haha I had a friend tell me you can attack people from a roof in everlook (he's a warrior so not like he could do any real harm this way). He shot someone and immediately a ton of guards started catapulting him all over the place.
---
I get what wpvp is. But thanks for reminding me!
---
I think I miscommunicated what originally put me off. It‚Äòs faction imbalance. 
---
I‚Äòd consider transfering the character to a pve realm, if it gets too annoying but there is not such a option yet. Can only transfer to a lower pop pvp. Maybe its more balanced there and people aren‚Äòt so hardcore there. I will wait a bit and see what‚Äôs best here.
---
I can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt survive
---
It was the easy way out for sure. The PvP strategies would be a lot different if Forsaken were undead and shifted druids beasts but if that was the case from the beginning, they wouldn't be a change in strategies because they would have always been there. If they changed it now it would probably cause an outrage similar to Eve online's "age of chaos" this fall.
---
I can, but then I would leave the guild I am in, the friends and contacts I have made on this server and start from scratch. Seems kind of a shitty deal :)
---
Lol my server had a 2 hour que
---
Guess it depends on whether you like it or not :D
---
Well then.
---
You usually need to have a certain amount of gold just to enter the GDKPs.
---
If none of them want to transfer then sure.
---
And they claimed that the spaghetti code rumors about the original backpack were not true back in legion yet again they seem to have difficult time bringing back such a simple feature.
---
Hunter spots are somewhat hard to come by. Most raids don't want more than 2-4 hunters at most and there are a lot of hunters. Although you might find it more lenient in MC but after that Hunter damage starts dropping off. If you want to impress your guild and find a spot easier, pre-bis is recommended.  
---
Alliance Warlock is really only a pain in PvP, because of the Undead racial. You'll have an easier time to find raid spots because of the scarcity.
---
Cant you pay for a server switch? I couldnt just abandon that much progress.
---
Gehennas is the highest pop server in all Classic, I highly doubt there is a option to transfer to it?
---
Haha retail bad classic good
---
Bottom floor in the opposite corner from the tunnel that leads to dnn
---
I was doing that, too!
---
What people forget is that content came quickly in the beginnig. Only with AQ it started to slow down.
---
* Dire Maul, Azuregos and Kazzak came 4 weeks after release
---
* Honor System 9 weeks after release
---
* WSG and AV 4 months after release
---
* BWL 5 months after release 
---
* ZG + AB 7 months after release
---
* Green Dragons 8 months after release
---
* AQ 11 months after release
---
* Naxx 16 months after release
---
So, even by going after the original EU release schedule, we'd be in phase 4 by next april
---
Let's compare:
---
* Dire Maul came 7 weeks after release, so 3 weeks slower than vanilla schedule
---
* Azuregos and Kazzak come this week, 11 weeks after release, so 7 weeks slower than original release
---
* Honor System comes 11 weeks after release as well, so two weeks slower
---
* WSG and AV would be on schedule with a late december release
---
* BWL would be on schedule with a late january release (= Phase 3)
---
* ZG + AB would be on schedule with a late march release
---
* Green dragons would be on schedule with a late april release (= Phase 4)
---
* AQ would be on schedule with a late july release ( =Phase 5)
---
* Naxx would be on schedule with a late december 2020 release (= Phase 6)
---
you're right, I did not think this through, mind soothe isn't worth shit there. thanks for catching it!
---
Then what am I as a Horde EU player?
---
A Italian?
---
Wtf is hooking
---
There‚Äôs always a reason to take the easy route
---
Yup. Selling mats is a lot more profitable than the potions atm
---
It's the other way around.
---
Just farm mats until they open up realm transfer
---
Possibly, but that is an additional cost
---
I agree. I much prefer subreddits where the community are allowed to decide what type of posts they want to see using the upvote and downvote buttons.

And they claimed that the spaghetti code rumors about the original backpack were not true back in legion yet still they seem to have difficult time bringing back such a simple feature tied to the backpack.
---
I should probably respecc to disc/holy, aye? Shadow specc won‚Äòt give me a boost whatsoever if I can‚Äòt even get to the mobs :D
---
Dont agree, especially if warr is fury/tank full geared
---
My server is like that every day, 90 minute ish Ques. Not tried since removed layers I'm excited.
---
&gt; and maybe convince them to leave.
---
I am the co GM of our guild and we do not want to transfer to new server that is dominated by alliance just to skip artificial queues on our current 50/50 faction server. 
---
We made a guide for our members to use RDP / Teamviewer to login from phones and sit in queues during commutes. We have good ties with pretty much all of the other top guilds on our server and they are not leaving either.
---
I‚Äôm a Warlock (58) and the last two levels are feeling like they‚Äôre taking forever. I barely have any quests left except for LBRS/UBRS, Strat and Scholo quests but everyone seeems to only take lvl 60s. Anyone an idea how to quickly level to 60? Thanks a lot in advance!
---
&gt;Now everyone hates that idea.
---
Why lie just to make a point? Like, you have all the information available to see why some people were complaining about the faction-specific transfers. There are several threads about it. You can just go there, read the posts, understand what is the concern and get a clue of what is going on.
---
They would have been a great solution during the first weeks, now it's too late.
---
I admit, I do think I shouldve rolled on a rp server
---
Tell me how it's "broken".
---
Yup, 2ms ping! It‚Äôs wonderful. If you decide to roll an alt here or something let me know, we have a fairly big guild now with an active discord
---
If bids are simply hidden (and you only get one bid, since you're not responding to anyone else's bid), suppose you guess that another player will bid 500 gold.
---
All you have to do is bid 510 gold, and you win.
---
With this system, if you bid 510 gold, then you will /roll 510, while they will /roll 500, and I think you only have a 50.5% chance of winning this roll. If you really want the item, you'll bid higher than 510.
---
Those are some great calculations which would work if PvP was only theorycrafting, but you missed some very important practical points.  
---
Faster weapons mean less mobility. Putting Gorewood bow above Carapace Spine Crossbow definitely isn't good.  
---
There are no "bis" trinkets, you should always be switching those depending on the situation &amp; matchup although I do agree some trinkets will generally be more useful than others. (Frost reflector will be more useful than AGM against mage for instance).
---
I kinda feel like the %crit stat is highly undervalued. You shouldn't forget the +30% dmg increase from Marksman Talent Tree (Crown of destruction &lt; Helm of Narv / Lok'Delar ends up less valuable than an item that will have 4 more stam &amp; 26 attack power, but following your assumptions 2 crit = 64 AP. (Meaning 64 AP &lt; 4 stam &amp; 26 attack power)
---
I'm also pretty sure you didn't take into account bonus sets because full T1 will be better than any of all those items.
---
It's a great piece of work for sure but don't fall into the trap of over theorycrafting things especially when calculating the matchup, it's not a turn by turn game, especially for hunter with all the variables.
---
Good job but you can still improve this sheet :D
---
Tell me about it. 2k Ques are normal. Not tried since layers removal. I'm also Gehannas.
---
Dagger rogue combat i assume. I dont know about your gear, but around 9-10% hit, then i would go for blaster.
---
1%crit is more valuable than 1% hit
---
It's particularly common with 2h tanks.  They figure since they're not using a shield they shouldn't sunder or something...
---
Then accept and embrace the waiting queue.
---
yuo knew this was going to happen
---
Sure there are. Axes become a lot stronger than any other type with +5 weapon skill from axe specialization. I‚Äôm only looking for alternatives to axe 
---
of the deep woods and flurry axe who are best in slot! 
---
For example
---
Dark iron destroyer
---
Annihilator
---
Serathil
---
Bone slicing hatchet
---
Windreaper
---
I just dont know how east these axes are to obtain.
---
Their top rogue has mostly blues (but brutality blade) weil the lowest one is very purple.
---
Where can I find them? Just in the realm list?
---
My guild is looking to expand to two raid teams, with our main raid team clearing mc/ony in about 2 hours. You could also look for a guild like that.
---
Why though? This is something that I really hated about other communities that I used to follow (e.g. League of Legends) is that everybody kept creating more subreddits for different types of posts, and then I had to go to like 4-5 different places to get their content. I'd much rather /r/classicwow be THE hub for classic wow content, and let the good stuff get naturally voted to the front.
---
They do
---
Nope you need to make a korea battlenet account with korean phone number. You living here too?
---
&gt; there's like 6 weeks left to the year, it's not that bad guys
---
they probably meant the first *phase*, it's not that bad guys
---
It's not high priority is what's going on.
---
I was talking about sustained TPS, revenge is more threat than sunder, and revenge+shield block = 15 rage = unimproved sunder. There are obviously better burst threat combos to start a fight but the start of the fight is usually not when 2h-tank is having threat problems since they have good burst, like you said. The problem is the sustained threat generation in my experience.
---
t0.5 didn't even exist until 2006.
---
Yeah not sure what this guy is going on about. Far far from the truth
---
Naive??? what are you talking about?
---
if you have a bad experience you warn other people to away from it lol... I thought this was common sense. but hey this is reddit
---
don't want to be 'harrassed'? don't be a c#nt. simple as that.
---
Okay, I just failed to understand the reason for introducing rolls in a bid system. So the roll acts as a means to increase higher bids simply put?
---
This is why the free transfer offer isn't enough, I will never go back to playing on dying realm even if it means sitting in queue because zones full of people, filled auction house and being able to get groups even off-peak hours makes the game so much better. 
---
You should be given free transfer option to any popular realm any time if you take one of those offers to now transfer from full server to fresh one incase it dies down.
---
Both. Lore pretty much went out the window and dropped in quality with Cataclysm and continued to spiral downward. With each expansion, they've "streamlined", and homogenized classes, while removing customization options. 
---
Pretty much every class plays the same now, almost like a rogue: use an ability to gain a "combo point", use an ability to spend your combo points, and every now and then cast a proc for free (kind of like warrior overpower). Pretty much every class and spec follows that play pattern.
---
The game is structured almost like a mobile game, too. I re-subbed for a month, and I went from 30 levels under the cap to being fully geared in that month.
---
Except you can't be "fully geared" now; every item is randomly rolled, like drops in Diablo 2 and Diablo 3. Imagine you get your Tier 2 helmet from Onyxia. That's the highest level helmet in the game now, and depending on your spec and class, it's the best helmet in the game. In BFA, not so much. Yeah, you got your T2 helmet, but it's only itemLevel 80, with 16 stamina on it, when the "best" helmet is the t2 helmet at itemLevel 87 with 26 stamina on it. 
---
Even more, all of that aside, in BFA a great deal of your customization comes from Azerite Traits, which is like a talent tree, except it's on gear, not your character.
---
So you beat a boss, and you got your itemLevel 87 "best" helmet which is better than your last helmet, yeah? No, sorry, even though your new helmet is "better" or at least should be, your old helmet is actually better because it has the right "talent points" on it; switching the helmet pretty much re-specs you, and the gear that should be making you better is actually making you worse. Go back and grind those bosses again until you get a helmet with the right itemLevel AND the right talents baked in to it.
---
In wow you can always catch up, as each raid tier basically invalidates the previous tier. There's no perpetual character progress beyond 60, so you cant just keep advancing.
---
My gf always did that in bear form :D it didn‚Äôt help her yesterday, though. XD
---
Just transfer to a lower pop server. It's what I did and it's been a great decision. There are still plenty of people online but I can actually quest now. Still people to group with for quest bosses too.
---
based
---
Did you just imply Faerlina has faction balance? LMAOO
---
World bosses are kind of a joke anyways with their 2-5 day respawn for such a large server. I don't even expect to see a single one of them alive pretty much ever. Not to mention you have to be lucky enough to be actually at home and logged when they spawn.
---
Layers have been removed.
---
&gt;Holy Shield (rather meh and just drains all your mana) 
---
Use rank 1 for any uses after the first one. 
---
&gt;On the other hand Holy Shock is an amazing Threat generating tool and with enough spellpower + crit no trigger happy warlock/mage/hunter will be able to pull aggro off of you.
---
Most pulls are not single target, tank paladins don't have "enough spellpower" as at most they will have two T2 pieces and some spell damage from trinkets/weapon unless they want to wear cloth and Holy Shield generates more threat than Holy Shock over time. It only loses in the burst aspect and even then, it's not that great.  
---
Holy Shock: ((380 + (SP * 0.47)) * 1.9) / 30 seconds = 722 every 30 seconds + SP addition (which won't be high until more T2 is available). So, the equivalent of a 722 hit, so with a ranged hit of &gt;930ish or so, you'll lose aggro. 
---
Holy Shield R3: ((130*4 + (SP * 0.05*4) * 1.9 * 1.2) = 1185 every  8 seconds assuming all 4 blocks are spend + the coefficient from SP (5% every block, 20% total) **plus** BoSanctuary triggering (66 extra threat per block)
---
Holy Shield R1: ((60*4 + (SP * 0.05*4) * 1.9 * 1.2) = 547 every 8 seconds with same assumptions as above.
---
That's a lot to trade to have a mediocre "burst" threat generator on a 30 seconds CD.
---
PvP server no pants and some weed. Anything else is coward shit.
---
This was pretty normal in ICC back in day.  Was how I made most of my gold during that xpac, buying the boe epics and reselling.
---
70% PvP
---
30% Gold farming
---
Layering was awful initially.  People abused it from the get-go and it made the world feel less cohesive.  I am glad you are enjoying the game, but I know a few people that quit, I am guessing many thousands of people did.  I can tell you that I personally did not enjoy layering and I am glad we are rid of it.
---
You know what, I get that. I don‚Äòt even want to complain about those type of ganks. I was generally speaking about horde raids camping flight points and dungeon entrances. But it‚Äòs probably the same reasoning? :D
---
But what if the gold farmers (who somehow aren't getting banned, nor are their customers) are earning their money by farming essences of water/air/earth?
---
If this is a server population problem, maybe it's time to transfer to one of those "empty" servers where there are enough spawns to farm these items.
---
I honestly don't mind the queue, I see it as a good thing. I just don't understand how I went from no queue at all for over a month, including DM release, and now I had a 1hr queue? 
---
Something changed, not sure what.
---
A SMOrcu,

SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc

Looks like a stroke to me...
---
can confirm, am chill
---
&gt; Servers with way smaller populations than this didnt "die" in vanilla
---
Just want to point it out to you that Vanilla was growing during the entirety of Vanilla whereas Classic will have a constantly dropping population. Chances of low pop realms actually getting real bad in future is high.
---
Exactly, if everything is inflated than your expic mount is "cheap" and you just farm whatever you can do efficiently. The only people this hurts are people doing raw gold farms, and fuck em. People who enjoy sitting in ZF and or lasher farming are just psychopaths to me.
---
Is it just me, or are there a lot of similar posts like this where some guy says something like "we got this" or "were fine" and then the text of them dying? 
---
I saw one several weeks ago, then it seemed like a bunch more popped up soon after.
---
I am starting to suspect set ups here.  Doesn't seem that difficult to stage  something like this. 
---
Not trying to shit on the OP or anything. I get it, its funny.
---
I am horde on Grobbulus and play on a pretty regular basis. Had no idea it happened. Probably happened in the middle of the night
---
Great question. Probably about 3 or 4 times. But that's more to do with my wife's lack of sex drive since the second child. I've still be vigorously masturbating at least 10 times a week.
---
And people trust blizzard to develop classic plus lmao
---
There'll be two differences - Hillsbrad and 48+ zones. Every other zone will likely have the same or less PVP than there has been over the last few months.
---
**UPVOTING FOR VISIBILITY**
---
How to counter faction inbalance.
---
1. Free transfers for specific factions (already implemented)
---
2. Faction specific queues to favour less populated faction and encourage the higher faction to xfer off the realm (**NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED**)
---
3. Concurrent population balance cap. i.e dont let current online balance go past 60/40. Manual tuning may have to be done to servers that have vastly unbalanced factions suck as 90/10 (most RP-servers).
---
I would say the axe from Ras in Scholo is a good shout.
---
They are decently tanky but nothing to brag about. Therefore you still want to kite with netomatic, frost shock, earth bind, iron nades etc. A shaman will be blown up by a warrior or rogue after a swift struggle unlike a holy paladin.
---
Spells work on a two-roll system, one for hit (misses come up as resists) and another one should be for innate resists (where resistances come into play). The paladin talent should work on the 2nd one only.
---
&gt;Both classes have talents that give 10% reduced chance to resist their respective fears.
---
Warlock's Suppression gives hit, not reduced resist chance if I remember correctly. I need to recheck some documentation, but all this comes from Blizzard not having spell misses (due to level v level and spell hit) coming up as "misses" and instead appearing as resists.
---
Nah we were dicking around most of the run like this. This was just serendipity.
---
We had them on Shadowsong as well, I quite enjoyed it as a casual non-raider. Managed to get my Paladin geared and still made a good chunk of gold in the end.
---
Lol you sound like a carebear pve er on a pvp server... in 3weeks it will feel like p1 again with a bit more hk raids... pve---&gt;
---
Do LBRS/Strat/Scholo they all give plenty of XP.
---
My guild leader (a mage) took on 3 warriors at once in the arena. He managed to kill 2 before the 3rd one got him.
---
No. I literally said it, because it does. It's like 52/48 whereas most pvp servers are &gt;60/&lt;40
---
Cries in being a druid
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call it that, but maybe having it more balanced in regards of faction population? 
---
And yeah, I also don‚Äòt get why 49s are green for 60s - buuuut it‚Äòs wow Classic after all, it‚Äòs not like they didn‚Äôt change it afterwards - so I don‚Äòt see why I should be complaining about that. That‚Äòs just how it was.
---
Its not butchered, just a single letter wrong
---
Well all those you listed you might as well just farm and save for Deep woods and flurry axe. You can give it a try to farm those Bone Slicing Hatchet.
---
Maybe I should take off the tin foil hat then, I guess it just happens a lot.
---
So brit style
---
I wonder how these things get timed? Do they rely on the raiders themselves starting a timer and reporting the result?
---
no don't, i like that hat
---
same happens with eye of kilrogg
---
I planned around making it to raid on time because I knew there would be queues. I didn't do it for some reddit spergs. Grats on your bis on a useless spec. A rogue in quest greens will outdps you
---
People have reasons to play again? Most of the player base is just raid logging since they have reached 60 and have most of / complete pre-bis. With pvp about to come online, players that normally only play one evening have a reason to play every day.
---
No thanks, lets leave the lid on pandoras box.
---
And it's not like this is a new game or new bugs...
---
Took 30 days off when Classic released, created a char on Gehennas, hit 60. Now I can‚Äôt play because of queue. Don‚Äôt go to this realm.
---
can you give me the mouseover macro for that please ty
---
Unistalled.
---
2x freezing bands, epic mounts are vanity items outside of premade BGs.
---
You're chill but you're not one of those undead bastards
---
I do get that! :D
---
Depends a lot on the herbs prices on your realm, but it is not worth putting those hours to level herbalism to 300 to just farm DM. If you farm more than 2000 gold then maybe but otherwise that ZF is still nice. I like it :)
---
You should make a book with all those amazing artworks! I'd definitely support this project!
---
I know, i know :)

Brute force. One tank on all 8 adds. One tank on Garr. Cleave it up.

Imagine being salty about having to pay for a service.
---
Uploading your combat log.
---
Stealth stalking groups of the other faction, and waiting for one of them to accidentally get too far away from the rest of the herd to be saved
---
U can still get 3 buffs. But i believe there was some way to stack the same ones (probably had to run the instance again to get a different buff id, not entirely sure though).
---
Sorry, iv'e played on a lot of the non-layered servers and finding early morning run's is impossible you can feel a massive difference from layered/high to the medium/low pop servers.
---
Running this as spriest , quite profitable . I skip the first boss , and only take the last boss to 50% then reset via the branch to pillar jump. That way I can get 5 resets in an hour if nothing goes wrong.   
---
Hydrospawn is not worth killing imho.
---
I have a full time job, just not much else to do. I remember a guild on my old server called "work eat wow  sleep"... now I'm that guy.
---
He said no one will take him.
---
Maybe you can try BRD? LBRS is also slightly lower level and doable. Personally i had the same problem, no one would take a non 60 rogue to these places. Luckily i had enough quests leftover to finish
---
So what you're saying is, if you were 14 years again you'd happily enter the addiction, knowing it took 8 years of your life? 
---
I'd do the same honestly.
---
After thinking about it a bit, it comes down to this: you won't like gold bid if you don't play much outside of raids (meaning you don't earn any gold) and you have no use for gold other than to bid for items in raids. You'll get fewer items, which you want, and more gold, which you don't want.
---
Things like repair costs and flight paths were ways to make players care about money even at the level cap. Some people might add talent respecs to that list; maybe spell reagents too. Maybe engineering bombs etc. for PvP too. But still, some people won't care about the extra gold and will care about getting fewer items.
---
For every player who gets fewer items in a gold bid raid because they don't farm guild, there's a player who gets more items. So on average it balances out. But the players who get fewer items in that gold bid raid, and who don't care about gold, might want to form their own raid to have a higher chance of getting items (at least until the rich players get all the items they want and stop bidding in the first raid). If this newly formed raid will clear content, this is a smart choice and these players who have no gold, who don't care about getting more gold, should do this.
---
Haven't done a gDKP run in awhile. Though from what I remember, it really suffers if you've got someone in the group who's good making large amounts of gold. The income boost feels great at first until you realize the group is funneling them gear because they can afford to eat the loss.
---
2 hunters for pulling, 1 warlock for curse.
---
Racials may play a role in pvp, but overall it's not as huge as it may seem. Skill, and gear will be able to overcome those with racials at their advantage. But then again you're horde so I wouldn't worry about that for you when facing alliance.
---
I got rich as fuck in WOTLK running GDKP pugs. Love the system for pugging, though not so much a fan of it as a guild loot system
---
Good for you dawg :) realizing it and taking action is impressive. Best of luck with the baby!
---
Anything that drops weapons: humanoids, demons, undead, and the centaur-like dragonkin. Really, your best bet is to level up. A level 20 grey weapon will vendor for \~20s, a level 40 grey weapon will vendor for \~1g; they both have the same drop rate and the mobs will be on par in difficulty for same-level characters.
---
Weird way of saying tbc but ok.
---
herbalism, farm silversage, dreamfoil, plaguebloom, icecap look for black lotus while farming. 225 alch aint gonna make you money. since you cant really solo farm much of anything, try 3 man DME jump runs, vendor the blues, you have herbalism so you just need a miner for the 3 thorium at the end, you'll get lots of ghost mushrooms, dreamfoil and gromsblood, plus the class trinket books and possible quel'serrar book. thats my best advice for a resto sham with your profs.
---
RemindMe! 6 hours
---
Dude it‚Äôs really simple just use your compass to read the map... it‚Äôs completely idiot proof as the map is always pointing in the same direction...
---
Don't follow the general opinion, rather than experience it yourself. Followed advice from reddit instead of just playing what seems to be the most fun to me and I regret it.
---
Outdps me but cant beat me in pvp.
---
Is Nethergarde Keep in EU decently populated? I'm a Pally and really only interested in PvE, but dont want to be in a dead server
---
Most of the time when nobody wanna "take you in" I just make my own group. There are plenty of lazy people looking for group but that don't "want" to make their own group.
---
Just join world/lookingforgroup and spam LFM LBRS and grab those you want. LBRS is completely fine from 57+ and all my 3 60s have basically dinged 60 from 57 in LBRS. It is around 3-4hrs/lvl there.
---
What are you counting for? To calculate your goodboi points?
---
exclusivity is a hugeeee thing....alliance were the only ones to have Lionheart for like a month and a half or so, some of our warriors paid 200g + neutral ah 15% + mats to get it, one guy on horde had +4 stats to chest for a while he charged your mats + 20g to do it, etc etc
---
Removal of layering hype? Give me a break
---
Haha. Can totally relate.
---
Not much. I play (sadly) on a PvE server, and I run around flagged 90% of the time. Sometimes I‚Äôm surrounded by 5 allies and they will just let me quest/farm. 
---
That‚Äôs pretty boring.
---
Goddammit Blizz, get your shit together
---
Yea should have asked for summoning stones and transmog and THEN they would fix the servers.. we fucked up..
---
Just get the addon ItemRack and keybind the swap. Comes in handy for travelling too, because you can equip carrot on a stick, boots and gloves with mount enchant with a single button. I use my f1-3 for different sets
---
I mean a big part of raiding is getting those gear drops, which he would likely not get without spending a shit ton of time farming, even if he's getting gold from raiding. Everyone else gets gold too so it's really only a competition between people who spend a lot of time farming and people who spend even more time farming.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt suggest rerolling on a pvp server now of all times. Except if you‚Äôre into getting killed on sight by 40 man raids of the enemy faction. Because that‚Äòs what‚Äòs already happening right now and phase 2 hasn‚Äòt even started. I would wait a bit if I were you, but hey if you want that thrill, go for it. :) 
---
Being lvl 49 now of all times.. kinda sucks, though. :D
---
fuck that guy, you should find his house and burn it down.
---
I'm a big fan of the rock elementals in the badlands. Grey's are pretty valuable, plus lots of solid stone, core of earth, etc.   36-38 in the north, 38-44 in the south. They can sometimes be fairly heavily camped though if you are on a busy server.
---
Gorillas in stv always decent, valuable Grey's again, some BoEs, and loads of leather if you are a Skinner.  Same with tigers and stuff in the same area.
---
Any human/ogre can be great if cloth sells decently on your server
---
Reddit simply makes it obvious. The *internet as a whole* tends to funnel people towards echo chambers simply due to how people behave. Like attracts like.
---
And once all stuff is purged off the target you figure out you have 4 second cast time. :(
---
scammed
---
Direct proof? There are a bunch of servers that didn't have layers that now have queues
---
Faction imbalance is an issue, and I get that we risk driving people off the server if it gets too aggressive. That being said, some PvP is to be expected, but grouping up on a sole player is not my idea of ganking or fun.
---
I play Alliance on Firemaw-EU, so I know a bit about being the underdog. It sucks most of the time, but it's also very satisfying when you win fights you're outnumbered in.
---
&gt;So your point doesn't hold much weight
---
I was joking, not trying to make a point. But the point is that being Friendly (a fairly easy accomplishment) shouldn't give you any advantages (aside from unlockables) in PvP, especially if your opponent happens to be in higher standing with that faction. Bruisers in Goblin cities make sense, because that's what they were designed for.  And it's good that they get buffed. 
---
In certain private servers, the guards were already much more powerful than their Classic equivalents. They would one-shot most clothies (2k+ damage) and 2-3 shot plate wearers even at 60. And it just meant that PvP was not an option unless you wanted some quick durability loss.
---
If you REALLY care about having the best race I would reroll to orc. If you're going to casually play Bgs for fun with friends stay troll.
---
Based on scrape data (from census) prior to these transfers opening ratio is 60H-40A plus minus 3% either way.
---
Server really does feel 70:30, but the data says otherwise so  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
No they haven't. Citation needed
---
I full noobed out and read the bow symbol as 3 hunters :D
---
You're right naturally.
---
I always find stuff like this to be very interesting too. 
---
I am told that mages just spam frost bolt in MC, yet I see half green half blue mages beat out almost full purple mages.  If they are all doing the same thing then I would figure the more geared ones would be doing higher damage.  My theory was that the more geared ones were doing other things like dispel, but even in fights where they don't do that its the same story. 
---
We had a new rogue come into our raid group recently who just hit 60, and still had some greens on, top the dps charts in overall damage.  
---
Im just a tank so I don't really know whats going on behind the scenes, but theres gotta be something going on that im missing.
---
When I inspect some people I can see their talents as well as their gear.
---
But others I can't.  
---
Come to think of it it's usually warriors I see the talents of (my class). Is that why? Or is it a mod or something they have?
---
Anyway to see talents of other people?
---
1. Do we in fact know that tank will be retargeted again? Might just move on to next on the list 
---
2. I've done several Ony's where Ony only gets 1 fireball off anyway, so may be worth it still.
---
Nope not worth. It will take you way more time to reach rank 3 then it would be to farm 100g. Better have that epic mount now for convenience, faster farming, and to not gimp yourself in world pvp.
---
If you read my post I explain why I can't do that
---
Look at EVERY THREAD ABOUT QUEUES AT RELEASE and you'll see people saying chunks of 3.5k~ players are removed from queue with a few seconds delay.
---
Because? Layers. And yes, Blizzard have said layers creates an entirely new virtual realm players can play on. 
---
Like, out of  everything in this world why do people create conspiracy theories about layering and it's affect on queues?
---
I think there should be horde only and alliance only realms, where none one create the opposing faction. Most people go to these one faction dominant servers because they don‚Äôt want annoyance and want to play with the most amount of people. 
---
Just reroll pve some might say. There are 3 pve servers for eu eng, all of them have smaller amount of horde players. They can‚Äôt play with each other and they will have limited option forever. Why not just make 2 alliance servers and 1 horde and everyone will have the most amount of players to play with. 
---
As I play allaince on pve server it is always annoying to have non attackable horde players. I can‚Äôt play with them. They are just taking server slots from actual player with whom I might be able to play.
---
Thats me trying to say limited invulnerability potion in voice chat.
---
lil brainfart
---
Yeah.. sorry about that. Lvld a human warrior to 60 first. But all of my friends either quit or rerolled horde. So I had to decide, quit the game or reroll.
---
I didn't think the balance was going to be that bad and pvp isn't the issue is being camped for long periods of time... I explain it in the post
---
Basically this.
---
Most help comment, thank you
---
But most people don‚Äôt want balance
---
Welcome !!
---
How many keys are actually in the game? Like long term keys - not temporary quest ones.
---
Strat, Scholo, DM, Gnomeregan back entrance, BRD Cell key, BRD Shadowforge key, Relic Coffer keys (do they even get in there since they stack?), Scarlet key
---
I suppose the BB-Gnomeregan Transporter key doesn't go in there and neither will the scepter of Celebras or the ZF mallet. What would you need more than 8 slots for?
---
In that case I apologise for reading you comment in the wrong tone :p
---
Link to what you're talking about? I've been on those threads and haven't seen that
---
Because hoarding!
---
well you rolled on a PVP server, so this was 100% going to happen.  
---
So maybe you have made a wrong choice on rolling servers.
---
But to help you, it might be wise, to level in a Alliance zone, instead of a shared zone, to get less camped by the other faction.  
---
Im not familiar with Alliance zones, but try to look for quests in yuor own faction controlled zones for leveling.
---
definitely hacking. 
---
INC permaban
---
That is if they mean "later this year" literally. 
---
The prior keyring announcement didn't really age well.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=294460/keyring-coming-to-wow-classic-in-first-patch-after-launch
---
on ally we also lay on hands the tank so he gets the 2m buff and like 2 or 3 healers on gar then the rest go on the add tank 
---
he takes a fuckload of damage you only really want to try it with a tank in good gear , doubt a pre raid blue tank can take the damage
---
The medium pop servers are gonna be legit dead after phase 6. If you're the type of person that plays classic for classic itself and you're not on a high/full realm, you done fucked up. Deal with the queues and lag now because the more casual player base isn't sticking around when there's no more content.
---
I used to join every sunday I think it was, coming early to ensure that I got a spot. Usually joined on my warrior called "Utterly", I think.
---
Was great times. Good raids, and great bounty.
---
Because Wotlk has dedicated gear for each role. In classic tanks share many of their BiS with DPS
---
He is lvl 49. There are no zones where he can level which is alliance zone, only contested. The first few zones are for people to think this server is good you can progress. Then you get to lvl 30 ans ganking starts to happening.
---
and pvp isn't out yet. I think the queues get bigger/longer as soon as pvp hits and the hype brings people back for a few weeks.
---
I can just see the panic to finish the word while mobs starts hitting him.
---
This has also been a great part of the taiwan server as well. We call them gold raids. However, the gold is not distributed evenly but through damage charts, highest damage gets the highest pay. (rules declared before raid) and the gear auctioning part is the same. Often, you have to pay an entry free in retail so the numbers do not  exceed the gold cap. (RL can move gold first)
---
Ele and Enhanc are both good for PVP IMO.  
---
I've played both PVE and PVP 14 years ago on my shaman, and tried all the specs and nothing is better than havin that WF proc and absolutly delete somebody from the game.  
---
Just go and experience PVPing, if you love the class, you probally enjoy PVP as well.  
---
But try both all the specs for PVPing to learn which favors your playign style :D
---
try saying lips friendo
---
I'm a little bit of everything kind of person.
---
The most important thing for me is doing fun things with people I like.
---
I have a 60 Warlock on whom I raid with my guild every week. If I crash into PvP during the week, that's cool, too. 
---
I have a number of alts to explore other classes, level other professions, take in the world, play with my more casual friends, and meet other people's alts. :D
---
How does this work? You have 10 bosses to kill, 1,5 to 2 minutes per boss would leave 7 minutes for thrash and walking the distance. How do you even manage to walk the entire distance of the dungeon in 27 minutes?
---
Hahah and so many people smugly announced it would be for sure with phase 2
---
Layering was only there to handle the early rush. Layering abuse has been rampant since day one. Using layers to fight a world boss while the other faction is on another layer is not going to happen on pvp servers when the pvp system is live. 
---
All of these were known, yet you mock the transfers as of you weren't warned before August even. 
---
So people rolled high pop, stayed there, and now want to be mad they have to deal with queues list like full vanilla servers did. 
---
Welcome to "illidan server" is all I can say to these folks. You chose your own hell, stop complaining that blizzard didnt accommodate you for months leading up to this.
---
You're not late at all. Classic is here to stay. There's no expectation that you should be "geared" for end-game dungeons (brd, DM, lbrs, etc.), because that's what they are for. You're free to level at your own pace. People were starting leveling months after server start on some pservers, you're good. Approach gearing normally. Get a few prebis items (or close to prebis) before you start raiding and you are good. There's no rush. People will still be running UBRS and MC well into phase 5 and 6. Don't worry.
---
Yeah but then everyone asks "whats that?" Just to get me to try and say the whole name
---
So I just read a guide on GDKP, but it doesn't say how you get cash, only that you have to spend it to bid on drops.
---
&gt; If you don't get geared, you get tons of money. 
---
Where is the money coming from, is it distributed by the main raid leader?
---
Are you hoping the people you griefed feel bad for you now? Lol
---
Or it evades
---
Meh I‚Äôm playing orc shaman. It‚Äôs definately a disadvantage to roll troll in pvp but I wouldn‚Äôt call it massive. If playing orc bothers you so much that you open a reddit thread for validation to play troll that‚Äôs a clear sign you should pick troll. It‚Äôs not worth it to be disappointed all the time
---
I'll probably release a print-ready PDF or something after finishing the series for everyone to print it at their local print store.
---
they dont know the lip they safe to sacrifice
---
Man I want to play a shaman so bad right now! Great work. impressive use of engineering!
---
At some point a friend will make an alt and ask you if you can farm the end boss of GR with them ... or some shit. Don't throw stuff like that away.
---
I like how griefers are currently sad and want us to feel bad for them
---
It's fucking hilarious actually
---
What do you mean?
---
he's justified because it's pretty unfair that horde have the option to transfer off but he doesn't. alliance are basically getting fucked from every direction here. make the queue faction specific and you solve everyone's problem. now you'll have frustrated horde transferring to heartseeker where they're desperately needed helping the balance on both sides. seems like a solution where everyone can be happy
---
They stack, your guild is wrong. You can have faerie fire, sunder,CoR and annihilator axe debuffs all active at the same time and stacking.
---
Im guessing it is fishing
---
use the realm transfer option... its the only logical option.
---
From my perspective I don‚Äôt herb for money. I herb to get consumables to use myself and to trade within my guild for stuff I need. From a money perspective I can understand a welcome for a price increase. But say Mongoose goes from 2g to 6g per pot. An hour of (inefficient) farming right now post layers gets me about only 10-15 plague bloom and essentially no mountain silver sage. I need to travel to other zones to get that. You‚Äôre really not making much money anyway. Or maybe I am just not good at farming.
---
Oh don't get me wrong I love druids.  I actually love all classes and that's the issue. I play every class and have professions that accommodate them.  Druids are probably my closest to "main" I ever get because they are so versatile but, once again I play the game for other reasons than dungeons/raids.  I honestly have more fun gathering mats and making things for people than actually playing endgame content.
---
fuck blizz
---
Yeah, and it can take 20 minutes or more to form a dungeon group and fly there, but you dont see summoning stones in the game either. If you didnt want classic go elsewhere. You can have a different opinion than the massive playerbase but stop acting like the loud minority is the silent majority.
---
Are Soul Link warlocks basically immune to CC? I haven't really had a chance to try it, but I assume attacking the demon will break CC on the warlock and vice versa?
---
Almost... OmniCC shows the cooldowns in your bars for your abilities and items to use while CAD shows them for aktive buffs/debuffs (aka .auras).
---
I read posts like this back in vanilla and it's why I rolled PvE. No regrets.
---
They don't. Your rogues shouldn't use expose armor.
---
you're not as no changes as can be then. this kind of thing opens it up for them to make any kind of change they want and justify it with "this better serves the original intent of X". they may or may not continue to make changes but no changes is insurance, a safe guard from letting blizzard make the changes they want on a whim
---
The patch they added those 4 slots also broke the whole game for a while.
---
I think its unfair that only horde get to kill the gnome.
---
Where you kill the last boss , there is a branch (near the ledge that you kite him on) . You can jump on the branch , and from there jump on the pillar to reset aggro. Then jump down , kill the imps (the boss won't aggro) , mine the thorium, reset , repeat.
---
Maraudon hasn't been worth it since Dire Maul released. I'd recommend replacing LW with Engi and learning to solo DM: North instead, it's much better gold with some RNG % to get A LOT of gold.
---
errrrrr...... wut? 
---
i'm talking about the massive amount of people dick riding blizzard for no good reason. 
---
Seem like you are a little upset about something, maybe chill for a while and then re-read my comment.
---
Well he even died from it
---
I'm at tanaris and it's pretty much what's happening atm.
---
Should be fine now
---
&gt;  If your shitty cheap solution.......is to force boot players every 4 minutes 
---
so this happened to you 1 time, doesnt mean BLizzard has implemented this as an "solution"
---
Yea troll has the worst racials, but shaman is one of the best pvp classes
---
So they did a variable grace timer then?
---
This is certainly worth unsubscribing for.
---
What is going to provide more enjoyment, resisting 30% of all stuns or enjoying your characters animations? Don't listen to min/maxers. If you value the animations of your character, roll female Troll, it really doesn't matter.
---
Is it possible to learn such power?
---
Best should is to run lower level instances for cloth and items to DE.  I do this as a resto shammy, and can clear SM easy enough, and ZF with a little more care.  doesnt get me quite as much as 50g per hour, but I can get 30-40g per hour, which is more than enough for a resto shammy.  
---
I am considering leveling a mage or hunter, purely for farming.
---
that's a shitty idea, cause you'll get way higher prices with 20 people paying than 10. It's in the interest of anyone trying to get gold to bring as many people who want gear as possible.
---
It will be there thursday.
---
Didn't have a chance to watch the vid yet (at work, will do at home).  
---
I have some questions just from skipping vid a bit.  
---
Saw you using thresh sword and felstriker. How would you rank alternatives to this ?  i know thresh blade is from a quest, but how would Krol compare to it? and what are felstriker alternatives? (sorry if it's explained in the vid, didn't have time to watch yet)
---
Nearing 60 myself, i saw there were a couple of builds, using either prep or  coold blood, might give this build a try though.
---
We did normal and heroic icc on us-archimonde it was super fun.
---
Laughs in Rogue
---
how would i grind 100g a week as a warr
---
Sick. Thanks for cheering me up man.
---
Thanks! It's pulling from my old data but I suppose new logs will update that.
---
What happened there? Was it just one person (me) or is it a system-wide thing?
---
and yet most ret paladins would destroy you 1v1 how about that. there's more to the game than raid dps parses idiot
---
I look forward to not wanting to tear my hair out when I realize I went to DME for farming just to leave my key in the bank. Compared to everything (nothing) else coming in P2 it was definitely what I looked forward to the most in the update.
---
You wont make a dime raiding without gdkp
---
Does anyone have a link to the run?
---
These are individual pieces. This is the first one from the Alliance series. The Horde series is currently at chapter 20.
---
The realrer question is why did I buy a naga
---
Oh yeah you're right
---
CantRead and CantSpell in same grp, cool
---
You dont need potions to raid, and if you need them you are doing it wrong. They just make it less of a headache
---
You wont get booted if you actually play. Standing still scanning the AH using TSM for 30 minutes isnt playing. Its afking
---
Pallys are better for druids than shamans would be the short way of putting it
---
Pallys have an infinite stream of efficient heals, bears take a steady intake of damage, they just synergize well with the way paladins heal. Paladins also have a great o shit button in case you get crit/crushed twice in a Row. Comparatively shamans specialize as raid healers and chain heal does little for you. Armor on crits is nice but priests do that for us
---
Pally buffs are way better for druid. You reliably get Kings and Wisdom that make you more powerful while also having reliable mana recovery. Further feral druids dont benefit from the hordes biggest advantage which is windfury. It means s comparatively druids are closer on threat or further behind on dps depending 
---
At the end of the day it's not a dealbreaker necessarily but QoL for ferals is higher as an alliance
---
I sold yesterday runs in SM for 5g/run per person, made 100g in a hour. Best way to me as a warrior
---
Just leave the horde kids on their shit servers they deserve it, and find a balanced server.
---
yep, it's just that easy to play man just downrank some shit and don't bubble the tank unless it's a pally.
---
Looks like blizzards attempt to stop people hogging the servers and let everyone play is working nicely.
---
Made a nelf hunter to lvl alch a while ago and one of the first things i did on my way to darnassus was 12 in a row. Nothing will top that! Not even when i got onslaught etc on my first MC raid!
---
Because there's almost nothing to do as a holy priest in dungeons, so you gotta kill the boredom. I do dungeons while watching youtube videos on my 2nd monitor, no joke
---
Wait for the tank to lose half of hp, spam heal till full, repeat. Maybe bubble and heal another target if they pull the aggro
---
Such is the life of a heal bot
---
Have you tried fighting an SL warlock? I have no problem with other hunters but trying to take an SL warlock head on rarely ends well.
---
Because  people thought layers were introduced to segment people in the world, not increasing population cap, but segment them into layers with less players per layer, thus lowering lagg that would happen with all people in the leveling zones. 
---
Removing layers would mean just making people on the server play on same "layer", thus not reducing player cap.
---
Reducing player cap while removing layers doesn't make sense at all, unless there's a lot less people playing. (but judging from queues that's not the case).
---
So instead of having 10k players on server playing on one layer, you have for example 5 layers with 2k players each.
---
When removing layers, you get more players in the same layer going back to 10k players on one layer. (population cap is still the same - considering that everyone still plays).
---
What most likely happened, is that they reduced server cap while removing layers, since some people quit, but that only works for servers with more than one layer.
---
My only problem understanding this is that only the servers with high population still have layers, and they are the only servers that "should" have queues when reducing layers to 1. In the OP's situation, the server with no layers for 2 weeks started having queues at the time the rest of the servers got rid of layers.
---
So either:   
---
a) they reduced server cap on ALL servers with removing layers on the rest of the servers, (no clue why, if the servers still had to have layers due to high amount o players)   
---
b) more people logging back for phase 2  
---
c) something else
---
Luckily kinda done with it. I mean I like the dungeon but after farming several trinkets and the arena chest for my buddies I'm glad I can take a break from it
---
Once you get your pet should never die more than once, if even that. I find killing Princess a lot more stressful than the King, except when FD bugs out.
---
On EU I didn't see them much until WotLK when they really gained traction, especially for high level PuGs.
---
I also second this!
---
I think I count at least 20 in there. If you do a 6 month sub for each account you‚Äôre still paying the equivalent of what, $260 a month to do this?
---
Either that or advance classic to BC after P6
---
No my solution to stop people afking, is to have people play the game
---
Hey can you quote where I said anything at all about raiding? I bet you can't!
---
whats so difficult to implement a simple UI
---
No Activision-Blizzard is definitly a multi billion dollar company. The problem is that they have 4 dudes in a basement somewhere in the desert actually working on the game. Blizzard 100% expected Classic to flop, which is why they havnt invested anything into it. EU had like 5 servers at launch...
---
yeah at no point was i bringing up being sodomized, or even saying anything other than expanding on a well known phrase 'dick riding' i.e. brown nosing, i.e. sucking up to a company who doesn't give a fuck about you and clearly doesn't give a shit about its users either. 
---
But carry on being mad about nothing, and carry on blindly defending blizzard.
---
Two runs with 20 raiders and 20 payers would pay more than one raid with 20 payers
---
The absolute best thing you can do is just prepare mentally for an onslaught. I'm in the exact boat you are (lvl 55 though) but I chose a pvp server due to my friends wanting to do pvp.
---
I just let all the camping glide off me and see those last lvls as a massive grind. I know that 2 hours of playtime means 1,5 downtime the coming weeks till I'm 60 and geared. Every gaming session that goes relatively smooth is a bonus.
---
Just don't feel that you have to rush m8 and don't compare yourself to people that have more playtime because you can't keep up. Create your own goals and adventure and LET GO
---
Let's avoid using logic altogether by avoiding providing a solution!
---
Hired!
---
This was in Winterspring, by the owlbeast caves.
---
It's OK. Blizzard aren't apologists either.
---
And consumable usage. Flasks n shit.
---
Feign death only works if you stand completely still have have it macroed to do 6 different things. Before that it wont work at all
---
I‚Äôd use https://classicwow.live/leveling , it‚Äôs free and works quite well imo.
---
either farming lashers in DM  east or carrying lower level people through scarlet monastery
---
From what you say its definitely the right decision. 
---
Good luck with the little one and enjoy your family life my friend!
---
*Glass cannons* as our guildmaster likes to call it:D
---
It seems people have finally made up their minds about what to play, good!
---
\#NoChanges everyone should be forced to play on CRT monitors.
---
Haha :D I'll get back to you on that - just in case :P Even though this is very, very unlikely... Hope dies last :p
---
Yeah, majority of people complaining about server lag brought this upon themselves by ignoring all the warnings and signs.
---
&gt;  Remulos has one Horde guild with an MC clear on warcraftlogs
---
Yeah on Warcraftlogs.
---
The optimism is big!!
---
What does the 300 Horde raid yesterday have to do with them Fixing it though?
---
**Blizzard:** We're going to make sure there's no cross-realm shenanigans because we want to recapture that server community feeling from Vanilla
---
**Also Blizzard:** We're going to set population caps at such a high point that a lot of "low" population servers are still bigger than Vanilla high population servers
---
While this is cool to look at, the volume of people that you see and have to deal with in zones just feels like you're still playing cross-realm, just now they're all on your realm. All they did was re-brand it and change how it's handled technically. In terms of player experience, it's a placebo.
---
Thanks, it worked! :)
---
1. Sappers to get aggro on all of them
---
2. Engineering shield to **KEEP** aggro on all of them.
---
3. Use all worldbuffs and consumables available to you without breaking 32 buffcap.
---
4. PROFIT.
---
They've clearly bungled a lot of things because they're trying to run Classic the same way they run retail.
---
Instead of developing servers and functionality specifically for Classic, they're being lazy and just using retail as a crutch to copy and paste shit in.
---
As a frost mage your most important stat after spell hit (which is only on like 3 items) is (frost) spell damage. Most purple items don't give as much spell damage as "of frozen wrath" green items. So thanks to frostbolt mana efficiency and being able to recover mana with mana gems, in some slots you're better off using these green items than purple ones - most notably wrists, boots and cloak.
---
That's actually a really mature decision. Hope it turns out well for you!
---
They've give people a solution for a different problem than the one you have. Not everyone raids, not every one wants layers, not everyone is upset that when they're not playing the server isn't reserved for them, not everyone tried to cheat that solution.
---
Oink oink
---
Should have transfered when they gave you a chance instead of bitching. This was obviously gonna happen for weeks.
---
&gt; Or you know, just live with it. Spy was a thing back then too.
---
I've never said I couldn't live with it. I won't stop playing because of the addon. I am just voicing my opinion on how I feel about it and that I believe World PvP would be more fun without it.
---
Nice victim complex because you can‚Äôt defend your favorite corporations actions.
---
Classic Reddit.
---
Classic is running on the BFA client. The blizzcon demo ran on the Legion client and they had the keyring. 
---
Blizz just dont want to deliever for some reason.
---
$50 says they believe delaying content will keep people playing longer.
---
/r/ihadastroke
---
Looked them up. Saw on wowhead they *should* be profitable. Checked AH. Full stack is 3G, and 20 looks like a lot of farming.
---
isn't it more for giving 100AP to the rogues and warriors? xD
---
Nobody in my guild ever want to do anything other than Arena runs (and only arena) these days. None of the healers are interested in making bank, so I've been forced to find random healers in LFG chat to heal me for 2man jump runs.
---
Their loss tho. Best haul I had so far was 4 hours where I earned a total of about half of 550g from my split (we got a Compendium and a bunch of crystals/sapphires).
---
Not finding groups in dungeons for gear reasons isn't a thing, and hardly one for raids as well. Class expertise and role matters more than gear most of the time. 
---
Phase 2 won't influence dungeon experience much - besides BRD, which is a gankfest even now.. Expect a corpse run or two
---
and we all know that if it was playable in a beta for what, 300 machines for 2 days last week, it totally is ready to be rolled out to millions of players
---
Pathemar: I want to join
---
Vikingbatman: (you) shouldn't!
---
90% sure that's what they said
---
Try Guidelime addon
---
We kill most bosses in MC in around 30 seconds. Ragnaros takes 1min30sec-ish.
---
Me too!
---
Join Bennidiction, it's not alliance favored but it's about 40/60 A/H split so a fairly ballanced experience.
---
Fuck sc
---
not what i am saying at all. The technology clearly exists however, and a issue that stops feature deployment being allowed to continue for over a year is pretty embarrassing for any development house.
---
https://translate.google.com/
---
There you go
---
In raids, you'll be too busy spamming raid heals to the rest of the raid, especially melee DPS.  On some other fights where there is less raid healing then yes you can spam Rank1 HW to get AH perma.
---
one of the things I like the most about classic is that its not expected to you to do ANY damage. I even do some damage in my downtime, but i really love this experience. Its the most chill experience any game ever gave me. However when shit hits the fan you are on your edge. Also you cant go afk for even a second. But i Love healing and just watching the bars. 
---
However I often go with fury leather wearing tanks into instances so the experience I just described its kinda different (by choice). Try having a leather tank and talk about doing damage again. Its faster but you are in way more stress.
---
That said, in normal groups I actually like when the tank oder dps fucks up and pulls way to much, its my time to shine and show my experience and also the only time you are challanged. But if you manage to survive a near impossible pull (like earlier, we were doing Dm:W the guy who drops the mp5 trinket with only 4man, we accidently pulled 2 banshees and 2 other blues ghost alongside the boss and I still managed to keep them all alive) you get praised - thats what we live for!
---
actualy the hunters are there to opull
---
You can also LOS the cast by just tanking him on the corner of the broken pillar close to the wall and LOS the cast. Same goes for last boss and Enervate if healer is a priest.
---
Also, Fury is really good for 2man. 
---
Source: I'm Fury and I've done countless 2man jump runs with shamans and priests. Haven't found any druids yet who were interested, so can't comment on that comp.
---
They just won't apply ANY sunders on ANY target. Dunno why. Dumb or trolling?
---
This is literally the thing I was waiting for the most.
---
At least you‚Äôll get world boss loot easy. Fuck me they‚Äôre going to be a shit show on high pops
---
Tbh I'm terrible at making gold so this was very welcome. Spent all I had finally getting my epic mount, at least now I can afford repairs.
---
There's a middle ground between a skeleton crew that does a couple fixes every so often, and a fully fledged development crew though. it's not just one or the other
---
Nah, healing is definitely safe at least. But any remotely offensive action will set the guards on you, that includes fear and dispels. I've been hit by it when I was spamming dispel on myself to get away from a mage, but my target kept switching to him and I dispelled him instead (holding alt isn't very convenient while running).
---
Everyone who experienced dead vanilla servers will without a doubt suffer trough crazy queues before risking a transfer towards a lowish realm. I did the mistake and sure as hell won't repeat it. 
---
Player dropouts are real, today's lowish servers will not come back and will be dead in one year. So if anyone plans to play this game longer I'll suggest sitting trough long queues.
---
Unfortunately Blizzard fucked it up with a pathetic server count and name reservation at start which hindered a natural distribution in many ways. And even though some realms might not be empty it's likely that it'll be unbalanced because they did not monitor and restrict creation from the start.
---
Something that was pointed out and occurred back then too, I just hope that the balance is recoverable on some realms, a nicely balanced PvP server is just awesome.
---
"Late".. you are an idiot
---
Asurin2 I was going to insult your intellect but clearly you have some kind of diagnosis so I will refrain from it.
---
What the ACTUAL fuck! Those chances are less than one in a million!
---
* Guild bank
---
* DKP Management.
---
* Raid Signups.
---
* Event calendar.
---
* Recruitment applications.
---
* And maybe character gallery.
---
Aww you listened to me and went back to whining. I'm commenting because it's a terrible idea.
---
At some point I think they're quite likely to merge a few servers with low populations like this one. Unless you're a doofus like me and rolled on a RP-PvE realm with a low population. They probably won't merge that one because it would mess up the RP.
---
There are a couple factors that will differentiate dps's.
---
First is uptime. Uptime is the biggest differentiator in any dps competition. Did you get stunned, moved, MC'd, bad positioning etc, any of these will tank your dps. You want to spend as little time not dps'ing as possible. This means early charges, and in the case of multiple mobs like garr, planning your pathing so you move from one mob to the next almost without stopping dps. This is the one I personally have the biggest trouble with, and the single biggest loss of dps for me.
---
Second is managing cooldowns. Remember to use them, and remember to stack that shit on top of each other. Cooldowns are multiplicative. That means that, for rogues for instance, Slice and Dice + Blade-flurry + crusader proc on top of each other is more dps across a 3min period than having all of them but spread out in sequence. Way, way more dps. If Slice and Dice is +20% DPS and Blade-flurry is +50% dps, S&amp;D+BF won't be 170% dps, but more like 180% dps.
---
Third is stats. This is the compound of buffs and gear. Buffs eclipse gear at this stage of the game. prebis will 100% outperform purples if they are stacked with consumables and world buffs and purples is only semi-stacked. This balance tips somewhere in late BWL farm / early AQ40, I believe.
---
Fourth is rotation. A few classes are really simple, and the rest of them are relatively simple as well, but people still manage to fuck them up.
---
Next MC I'll be sure to do that.
---
No wonder it took four hours with a warlock that click spells and backpedals into mobs.
---
You can solo Princess runs in Maraudon for around 30g/hour, but best with herbalism.
---
You vendor Tinkerer and Princess drops and pick up blindweed and ghost mushrooms.
---
That is only for hearthstone players.
---
As much as I adore the picture it makes me a little bit sad. Im stuck with an undead character when I just wanted to play nightelf. But all my friends went horde so I went too because its more important to play with them and everybody said undead is best priest. 
---
I would love to AT LEAST reroll to a troll priest :( I am one of the top priests in my guild and well geared and cant go back now, but i realy dont like looking at my undead. It really bothers me (dont know if anybody can understand)... Troll would at least be kinda nice for me but this fucking dead body without elbows ... noooo
---
the graphic detail itself isn't comparable to modern games with high res in game graphics requiring quantum computers to render but there was a true artistic charm that went into the world design that i think makes it truly timeless beyond just a nostalgia factor.
---
Thunderbluff is wonderful really rivals my favorite, Ironforge.
---
Great! I hope I'll find it on here. Thank you for the response!
---
I actually hope you're right (not just because I can't dance xD), because it would blow everyone's minds tenfold. If Blizzard can pull this off, it would instantly restore a lot of faith in them, which I'd prefer very much.
---
I make an average of 35g/hour with fishing, not the best but I'm lvl 42 and can watch netflix at the same time
---
I think you‚Äôd would probably be best of with Druid. Lvling as a newcomer is a long road, and Druid is great for that. Plus you can fill any role in a dungeon- you find a group instantly and, what matters most to me, you can learn group dynamics from every point of view.
---
Green "of Frozen Wrath" pieces also often beat out arcanist and other such items for pure DPS, and some pre-raid blues are straight up insane. Arcanist is bad as DPS gear, good PvP gear though.
---
Grobbulus: 50/50 split. The alliance is dominant in WPvP
---
You ignore the most important part of mithril though, solid stone. Which is legit more than mithril, normally by a decent amount.      
---
For example mithril bars are probably 18 to 19s on Herod, compared to stone being never less than 21s each. Recently stone has been 25s+ per.
---
Ctrl+a, ctrl+c, backspace is engrained in my muscles in times of panic
---
I started Classic a month ago and completely burnt myself out trying to hit 60. I'm almost 53, with almost a full bar rested now... I actually feel really guilty spending so much time playing and I'm not even at 60 yet.
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
buying dkp is useless outside your guild. And dkp is innately worthless; if everyone donated the same dkp worth of items, they would all be at square one - it would be like they donated nothing.
---
There's always a chance that it's impossible to switch out the bag as they said, but after the comment they figured out a way to add an additional 'authenticator' bag and just have the UI display it's slots in the same frame as the original bag.
---
There is an excuse. 
---
They have a fucked up netcode or ISP which is not very easily fixable. I think you won't get a much better excuse.
---
Reason being a much too small Team trying to make it all possible as fast as they could. For us.
---
I know it is not correct and shouldn't be like that but People can't even give them a Little fcking brake. 
---
When this shit is fixed People will go on about the next Thing etc. 
---
I honestly don't care and would totally understand if Blizzard wouldn't care because this community is literally a bunch of crying Little wieners. 
---
Go visit your mom she may be able to comfort you :/
---
You guys won't get it anyway you hear that private Servers were able to do it and instantly expect Blizzard has to be able to do it RIGHT AWAY RIGHT NOW NO MORE WAIT TIME I WANT IT NOW xD
---
Literally weird, spoiled, pampered People in this subreddit that think everything should be just like they want it. I don't even mean PVP anymore. It is the same with every "uproar" in this subreddit
---
r/ihadastroke
---
All of your solutions are garbage. World PVP is why layers don't make sense. If a raid is on layer 1, and an opposing faction layer is on layer 2, there is no official and supported way to engage those two in combat, and the raid with the boss on their layer gets a free kill. 
---
All methods to prevent layer abuse and 'quick swapping' will make the problem worse. 
---
Your solution does NOTHING to fix that, and you probably didn't even consider it. Your only defense for that is for blizzard to add a manual layer swapping button, which defeats the purpose of preventing layer swapping. 
---
Adding even further, if only players who exploit the feature can get around said limitation, then the "official" stance on layers is to expliot them for PVP. 
---
Do you not see a problem here?
---
So lets get this strait: you want blizzard to develop a new, and radical method for layer handling.... because &lt;25% of realms will have queues over 5 minutes. 
---
Instead they are offering transfers to low pop servers, and continuing with the "classic has no layers" plan they've been setting up since far earlier in 2019. 
---
But no, that isn't your favorite choice, it isn't the one that benefits you the most with the least effort on your part, so its not what you are even willing to consider beyond calling anyone and everyone who disagrees with you an apologist. 
---
Here's one back - anyone who disagrees with 1 layer per server is a selfish whiner who just wants what they want, and doesn't care what anyone else says. 
---
You say to people like you - Layers were planned to leave, and you don't care, you DEMAND they stay because layers are too good. 
---
Layer abuse is too rampant and hard for GMs to monitor effectively, but you don't care, you have "the magic pill" to fix layering and they just wont listen to you!
---
world PVP and world bosses will have major issues with layers? Who cares about that! I don't want to queue or fight over resource nodes. WHAT ABOUT MY PLAY EXPERIENCE!?!?!
---
That is the "don't take your side seriously" side that the "smug" people see you as. 
---
When they try to engage you in talks about how this was always planned, you just boo, hiss, throw things, and call *THEM* entitled and smug for not being you, and then claim they have no arguments. 
---
TLDR - I guess when you ad-hominem all your detractors and don't take their talking points seriously, its easy to claim they have non and don't try.
---
When all you boss fights are under 1 min all you need is hit and spell damage. You don't need the big mana pool.
---
Oh, ok, that explains a lot. Thx!
---
I'll most likely stream it too. Depends on the Pug dates. I'll try and do the one saturday but they're usually full on tanks. Most promising MC will be Tuesdays until I start hosting
---
&gt; Either way pretty sick set up, you've got my interest
---
r/homelab
---
It usually balances better than that. So most normal gear is in mid-contention between a few average pocketed players. If they win, you'll be much richer than them. Money most people cannot earn in a week of normal play. If you keep raiding with a guild, the rich farmers have the gear fast and everyone has siphoned more money for the next drops to bid against. You'll make a lot of money if you aren't buying gear, then snag bargains at the tail end when the bid wars are dying.
---
If a rare, interesting and desirable item drops however, rather than only benefiting the classes it works for, or the lucky bastard who it rolls for, or watch it be given to a high ranking member, it can seriously benefit the entire raid if the whales start dumping big bids. That 1% drop mount in a 25 man raid in retail has now made you guys all significantly wealthier. 
---
But the main one is the geared people continue raiding and carry you through the raid to earn good money. Otherwise they just sit on this effort/reward ratio and when the new raid drops they get all the gear anyway for no benefit to other raiders.
---
Being 60, almost all problems I had in the groups were with tanks. But nobody usually dares to complain about it
---
"Sorry no ammo, I'll just facepull"/
---
 "we dont need to waste time by pulling the packs back" -&gt; gets feared into another group / 
---
never does los pull, AT 60! /
---
Is too proud let us know that he never did the dungeon/
---
You are not allowed to give any advice, because he's the pro as a tank/
---
Pulls three packs at once, even though theres no real aoe dps in group, healer does everything to keep him alive, tank still is complaining about mana breaks/
---
The unholy cycle of being too impatient for the healer to regain mana, then ass pulling too many mobs so the healer has to spend all his mana/
---
When we wipe to his asspulls, he starts complaining about everybody else 
---
...
---
And then demands every piece of gear/ consumable/ rep reward, even though half the time we have to do his job, just because 
---
hEs iN hIGh dEmAnd 
---
We once kicked the tank from the group because we couldn't stand his fuckupery + attitude before. It felt so good.  And then we cleared the dungeon without any more wipes through clever pulling and kiting
---
Hopefully!
---
For normal herbs it's not really a major issue. You're not seeing herbs like Plaguebloom and Ice Cap being picked up on spawn all day every day and there's an infinite amount of Dreamfoil and Gromsblood being spawned at any given time. There's plenty to go around and prices will just depend on how much labor people put into extracting it.
---
Black Lotus on the other hand is a different issue. Yes, on certain servers it will be a luxury item. However, while many people would agree that guilds needed to flask up for raids back in the day that's not really true anymore. Having more damage and more mana makes things easier, but with the knowledge and skill we have today there aren't that many encounters that straight up require flasks to be beaten anymore. You will probably see many guilds scale down to only using tanking flasks.
---
You talking about the epic set? im talking about the blue set
---
Getting to the boss is the hard part, it takes practice. I wiped soooooo much. Now I breeze through and get to the boss in like 7 minutes.
---
Ooh my bad, didn't know that. Thanks for the info though!

---
$50 says they believe delaying content will keep people playing longer. 
---
Clearly evidenced by releasing Dire Maul early.
---
Definitely not massive disadvantage. Stun resistance is big when against rogues but versus something like mage or warlock troll is actually better.
---
Strangely enough I knew it long before before I made to IT.
---
I'd rather stock up on swiftness potions tbh &gt;.&gt;
---
Unless people or on purpose suggesting the ones they don't have, so they can stick out when every ones else gets then...
---
&gt;Not finding groups in dungeons for gear reasons isn't a thing, and hardly one for raids as well. Class expertise and role matters more than gear most of the time.
---
Ronsude is right on money, I don't believe in "I don't get groups because I'm class X" statements simply because I, and most people I play with, don't care - as long as they player knows their class, pushes it to the limit and makes an effort and communicates, any class is fine. 
---
On the note of gear and being concerned for groups, though; there was a post yesterday asking about if it's worth getting pre-raid BiS that you pay for (think Devilsaur set for Rogues) or if you can just skip it and wear whatever since you'll be replacing it eventually - if you find yourself asking a question like that (and I don't say you do) you should think of it from a raid leader's perspective. If there's one spot left and you have a choice between Rogue 1 with Devilsaur and most pre-raid bis pieces (and who's been bringing consumables to raids) and Rogue 2 with a bit fewer bis pieces who doesn't bother with consumables, I think it's an easy choice in most cases. That logic can be applied to group content as well - so putting in an effort will pay off sooner or later. 
---
TL;DR - you are not too late, at all - know your class, do your best and try to work on your gear and communication. No reasons not to get a group if you're ticking those boxes!
---
&gt; 51% chance
---
I don't know if you actually calculated this and rounded correctly to full percentage point or not but since I like math and I could see immediately that it's most likely not exactly 51% and wanted to figure out how to calculate it I worked it out.
---
So, if the /roll 510 gives 501 or higher, it wins. This happens with probability 10/510 or ~1.96%. For lower rolls n=1-500 it has ((n-1)/500) chance to win, i.e. if the /roll 510 gets 251, the /roll 500 has 50% chance to be lower than that, 1/500 , or ~0.196% chance to tie, and 249/500 or ~49.80% chance to win. Each roll n (from /roll 510) has 1/510 chance of happening so we get a sum: (sum((n-1)/500))/510, sum going from 1 to 500, which can be written as sum(n)/(500\*510), sum going from 0 to 499. The sum is trivially calculated as an average times number of items in the sum: 500\*(0+499)/2 = 124750 so the probability for the larger roll winning when it rolls 1-500 is 124750/(500\*510) or ~48.92%. To get the total chance we add the 1.96% from earlier, and get 50.88%.
---
For a general case of /roll m vs. /roll n with m&gt;n, we can write the probability of m winning as (n\*(n-1)/2)/(m\*n) + (m-n)/m. The /roll n will win with probability of (n\*(n-1)/2)/(m\*n), and the rolls will tie with n/(m*n) probability.
---
TL;DR: /roll 510 will win /roll 500 with 50.88% probability, which does round to 51% as you wrote.
---
I mean, Dreamfoil and Gromsblood are the two worst herbs to evaluate the market on, as people are just spawning them over and over with instances. Look at other more specialized herbs and there is a profit to be made.
---
Dude you are hilarious.
---
Just because you can't read doesn't mean others can't.
---
You seem very attacked by what I wrote. Where did I hurt your Feelings? You got tissues or should I bring you some? xD
---
The thread asks for the whole addon to be removed, shouldnt be rocket science but removing the addon entirely removes the KOS feature.
---
Yes, I fully agree on the gathering professions. If you absolutely have to farm gold at a low level, I can suggest skinning and herbalism. While leather is worthless on the AH, it provides a decent boost to your wealth if you skin every beast you kill and vendor the product. Plus, it doesn't take up any tracking slot if you combine it with another gathering skill like herbalism or mining.
---
I started leveling a warrior with skinning and herbalism on Friday. I'm level 24 now and have made 30 gold on the character so far (minus 6 gold which I used to buy a rare offhand weapon for faster killing). Wild Steelbloom and Swiftthistle go for about 60 silver each on AH, and I wager it'll rise even more with the introduction of PvP and removal of layers.
---
I haven't gone out of my way to grind, I just pick up anything I find while questing. Yesterday I looted some blue caster shoulders that I expect to flip for 20 gold as well, so it's a profitable and non-boring method.
---
It's actually good because it creates an incentive for those classes to join even after they're geared.
---
Is it though? I feel like it would be pretty hard to keep a tank alive as he‚Äôs tanking a boss + 8 adds. Plus you got god knows how much melee dps to keep alive as they just wreck every boss as fast as possible. It could be possible with less but I feel like adding +1 DPS for -1 Healer would have diminishing return. Save an extra second or two on a boss but less mana available to heal/buff/etc.
---
Farewell. Very brave/good decision. Hope you have much precious time with your family. I feel your sadness though üôÇü§ó
---
I was quite worried about tanking as a paladin any dungeon, but turns out with a good enough healer and DPS you're generally fine. Raiding though will be a challenge
---
It looks like players want all the quality of life changes they added to retail throughout the year. 
---
Basically, ignore the playerbase until the money train stops rolling, because players don't know what they want.
---
Except for the head piece, I am wearing fully plate in PVE and looking like a real warrior rocking 4 items of t0. I reached the hit cap. For PvP I switch two plate hit pieces with two more t0 pieces to give me some extra stamina anf the set bonus. When I get my Lionheart helmet, I will rock 100% plate and still dish out good damage while looking badass. Leather warriors look like clowns.
---
Isnt there a fucking sub for gamers and cats by now? How is this in any way relevant to wow, other than by chance running in the background in 10 % of the picture...?
---
I rolled PvP because I need to raid at off hours and found a guild recruiting with the right weird schedule that rolled on PvP. It has nothing to do with PvP and all about where the right guild fit was.
---
Also bye , no point in debating with someone who can only see  what they point later oinker
---
Noice, remember to take a break from white knighting gaming companies that is taking your money to have some time over to white knight all the e-girls you are subscribed to.
---
There's usually a min bid for this kind of thing.
---
&gt; it is 98% likely a bot and 2% likely a player
---
So you can prove those percentage numbers ? or is this just your gut feeling.
---
Hey Hey hello!!  
---
What do you guys think is overall in PUG/Premade BG'S
---
Warlock (SM/RUIN or Conflag)  
---
Hunter Marksman
---
i know they have huge different roles, but what is overall Stronger -DMG/BURST- wise probally or Constant dmg? what class is more viable in many comps? and what benefit more from MC till Naxx gear.
---
So far thanks for the helpful Answers! :)
---
Leatherworking isn't a good moneymaker, don't worry about it unless you're doing it for some sort of class fantasy or just want your name stamped onto your items.
---
Herb and mining are good for both maraudon and DM. If you can't get the hang of DM north, you can try east instead.
---
The guy who replied to you tore your argument apart
---
dude its 2019,its easy for blizzard to do this as you walking to the bakery to buy bread
---
Fall damage etc. breaks stealth and makes it a 10 sec cool down.
---
It was like this in Classic.
---
Vanish and other shit is still broken though so who knows anymore.
---
im not going to translate shit, when im on a english based forum.
---
If people die you lose buff and time
---
Aleynagamer wasn't complaining though.
---
Does it say High next to the server name mate?
---
Not true at all
---
No stacking, no.
---
Haha :P Any Kind of optimism is White knighting to everyone that just watched his YouTube/twitch and learns it from their Idols :P
---
Can I not ask to give Blizzard 1 DAY until People start complaining. I mean tomorrow if it isn't fixed I'm all with you :D
---
You guys act as if I just insulted your whole Family. Do you really hate Blizzard that much? You might wanna look into playing other games then you moron :P
---
How geared do you need to be do consistently bring down king?
---
This is actually intresting, if you dont get items you atleast get gold :D
---
Alright so:
---
* look what people are suggesting
---
* also take into account that they might be suggesting the opposite of what they really think
---
* ???
---
* Profit
---
that sucks,but at least "later this year" means a month wait
---
Backend thing. I'm running 2-3 parallel scripts to parse WLogs, and my guess is multiple queries for database for same person caused this.
---
Could not say it was only you (i've seen this for another person too), but i would not say it is system-wide either :D
---
Gonna check for more dupes asap, but i'm pretty sure it is maybe 1-2 more ppl max
---
Good Job Blizzard !
---
If this is true, you just made my day
---
Everyone I've talked to about classic + vs TBC have said TBC because blizz would fuck up classic +. Who are these trusting ppl?
---
Generally not worth having one shaman (or priest) spam downranked heals to keep up the armor buff. If you have 8 healers normally, you're giving up 1/8 of your healing efficiency or you're swapping out a DPS who could speed up the kill by a bit. 
---
It would be the easiest job in the raid, though.
---
Well - deal with it then and don't annoy People with your useless comment xD
---
He didn't write anything in german literally just a Picture. If that is too much for you then this world is not for you bro. Not everyone everywhere always has everything english like you probably would like to. 
---
Dude some People actually talk more than english even it is crazy.
---
You can Report the post - maybe mods will remove it :P
---
Yeah but, I think spell damage scales better still.
---
Some sketchy guilds there, even for a nelf party
---
To put it into perspective I killed him while forgetting to swap out Gnomish Mind Control Cap and Tidal Charm on, which are basically like having empty slots against a boss. The rest was a mix of greens and pre-BIS.
---
Gear will help you kill him faster but strategy is key. Someone in full greens with perfect strategy will take him down faster than someone in full epic who tries to burst him down head on.
---
I don't understand this question. Have you never done something without wanting anything back? This is just on another level.
---
They're not larger. As stated by Blizzard each layer is roughly the size of a normal 2005 server so now that we're down to one layer the servers are almost identical to their vanilla counterparts when it comes to concurrent players.
---
Do you do this SM Library solo as a warr? If so, how?
---
Yeah absolutely. Transfers were made to give people an option to avoid queues. If they take away transfers, they gotta take away queues as well.
---
Oh, so by increments of 10 % ? That explains it, thanks.
---
I am obviously not speedrunning, but when my raid has ten healers the healing is a snoozefest honestly.
---
Joannas is amazing, buuut it costs money. If you don't mind paying for a guide, go for it.
---
Standard practice rly this.  Dom faction feels safe to camp
---
Perhaps you live on the moon with a huge MS lag but on Earth the game was released in August and been in alpha/beta for way longer, its soon 2020 down here. Nice logic, I am guessing you or your relatives work at Blizzard?
---
I'm not really a fan of faction swapping as that destroys an important part of classic, the faction conflict.
---
 Also as a minority faction your only choice is to swap to make it more balanced? That shouldn't have to be your burden.
---
I think if they manually 'linked' certain servers once in a while that have unbalanced populations enabling people to switch (like they did with high pop realms now) that could be a better idea. Although all that aside I do think there isn't a lot of interest from most players to leave unbalanced servers atm.
---
I can't imagine being so bad at the game that you need pots to get through the encounters.
---
How would that work on a PVE server where you can have characters of both factions?
---
no they do not. read the post or dont bother... 40m raids reset every wednesday, Ony resets every 5 days, upcoming 20m raids reset every 3 days afaik, so its getting pretty confusing
---
Yeah seems pretty straight forward.
---
Fine, Mr Pedant.
---
Those chances are ~.0027%
---
Not quite 1 in a million. But its close enough that no one cares.
---
This existed in pservers. Except that hosts kept all money for themselves
---
So really I only use thrash blade because I am a dagger pve player and dont have a better sword to use. Kroll blade,  Dalrend and viskag would be much better.  As far as Felstriker alternatives, a fast stat stick like Bonescraper would be great!
---
If you are a tank. Go to start live and reserve the orbs. It makes decent money
---
What a beautiful color! I haven't seen that red/brown color before. #catlover
---
You would tend to see high-end guilds do this on certain servers where they boost a few wealthy alts for cash.
---
It's not about faction balance, it's about having to pay the price of a high pop server when you're essentially playing low pop. If you have 2k horde and 8k alliance on your server, you're getting the experience of playing on a typical 4k pop server but are still forced into 10k pop server queues.
---
Try typing in /1 in the zone you are in and see if anyone is about.
---
Why on earth would this have been coded to have interactions with anything outside of checking bags slots for keys and moving them, the only other thing that would need to be coded for is when attempting to unlock a door the code would need to look in 'keyring' instead of 'bags'. 
---
:o super hard stuff here
---
Healing them to 100% health? That's an idea. I just make sure they're above 50%. Renew keeps them at 62-ish% for about a decade at the end of which I pop a Heal rank 1-3 (rank depends on mood) leaving them at about 90% and keeping them there with the help of another Renew. 
---
That's a perfect scenario of course.
---
I just swing them down in fury nothing wierder than that.
---
We all know you are horde imposter
---
Same thing goes for the last boss with the spell "ennervate" (mana drain disease). Always make sure to LoS it. Dispel the thorns from time to time, and pull him into the cave at 50% when the imps are coming. That way the other adds in front of the boss wont aggro.
---
Pre-raid or t1 bis?
---
I understand. Just making sure you're on the right side. :)
---
Yeah because having OP guards with snares and knockbacks in Horde cities and crapguards without any form of CC in alliance cities is fair and balanced. 
---
Ooh you dont like the bug that lets people manadrain you in catform? Stop crying and reroll another class.
---
Orc on anything looks bad. Inspect an orc warlock on horse. Now imagine riding an undead horse. Just waste of runecloth...
---
thats what I've been using til now, but I find it pretty inconvenient, thats why I asked for an addon
---
Good we got this sorted
---
The open free server transfers with no faction/server restrictions is what brought the current lack of balance in the problem realms. Now we have to deal with queues even though it's not our fault, until enough people quit or transfer until things are stable again.
---
Whilst this is true, just running DM East once with any group gets you the key.
---
This.. is how a key should be obtained. I continue to be salty about UBRS.
---
It would largely be mage vs warlock and warlocks can make a ton too so not sure it would be that big a deal
---
Sure, but that's also a hell of a lot better than nearly every other class in the game. I'm an MC geared Rogue and because I'm single target I'm never going to pull the DPS on trash packs that a mage casting Blizzard can.
---
Does that mean Blizzard is optimal, no, but it's good enough. You don't need 1337 D33ps for dungeons.
---
how about a WA showing when your at less then 3 of a specific item :)?
---
&gt; Nothing is to much for me
---
Awesome :P
---
Farm start live. Reserve the orbs and split them between you guys.
---
I'm glad you came here to stroke yourself off about how kind you are.
---
You want controversial? Here‚Äôs one that‚Äôll make pussies collectively quiver across the world.
---
PVE servers should not be apart of Classic.
---
That would cause a lot more alliance to roll on PVP servers.
---
The only way to fix it now is for Blizzard to hard merge servers together, they won‚Äôt though, because players rerolling means more time spent playing the game which equates to more subscription time, so regardless of how many ‚Äújust transfer‚Äù people there are on this subreddit, DON‚ÄôT do it, it‚Äôs definitely not worth it.
---
&gt; my comment was just me being skeptical of something
---
as was mine, but i don't jump down your throat about it. 
---
Nice that you can go straight to insulting people though.
---
You can follow the bot around, tag mobs before it does, and have a free assist for your farming. I "played with" a level 55 Hunter bot yesterday for about 2 hours. I'd follow him, wait to see what mob he was about to fight, charge and tag it before his first shot, and let him do all the work.
---
most low-med pop have them sub-20g
---
I hope you're right. But as I wrote that would do nothing for realms without queues.
---
wow, you got so salty about that comment you had to look into my other comments. petty af
---
people "hate" it because it was both factions first, then half a guild transferred and it was restricted to faction.
---
Faction specific transfer to and from one-sided servers is a great idea and that together with faction limited queues would go a long way towards solving the problems.
---
Yes it‚Äôs a great pvp talent, those that say otherwise don‚Äôt know what their talking about
---
When you‚Äôre going further up the holy tree the relative talents are kinda weak from a pvp perspective but even without comparing talents it‚Äôs still really good
---
Ideally you want to stack it with SR/glimmering mithril to get the most use out of it. If geared and played right you can give decently skilled SL locks/priests a lot of problems especially with that talent.
---
I thought followers of the cloth weren't suppose to drink when on duty.
---
Parts of it are outdated, for example, it says go to Silithus when you're level 55, but there's nothing there yet.
---
I love how funny you are.
---
Literally nobody cared about the lags in world pvp until Phase2 came closer and now suddenly everybody is crying :O 
---
Alpha probably didn't even have enough People to find out large scale pvp would be a Problem. In beta I also didn't hear any complaints about it :p
---
Actually None of my relatives have worked or do work for Blizzard.
---
I just like to not talk everything into the ground and make it out to be the biggest Problem we have in 2019. We have much worst Problems than "200v200 fights now working" :P 
---
Actually I like the idea of being the White Knight. I just wonder what you are in that case. 
---
The scum of the earth?
---
Riot?
---
Until you forget your Strath key and nobody else has one and your HS is on CD, so you have to leave the party while in dungeon to get back to OG to get the Damn thing.
---
They actually have. That's why they have encouraged you for over a month to consider switching servers, unless you want them to forcefully move people, causing a whole other shitfest?
---
I think he does want something back; recognition and praise. That's why he made this thread and that's the point I was making. It's not altruistic when you go to reddit and say look at me I'm so good.
---
Phase 1 BIS
---
i didnt understand...can somebody explain pls? New to the game
---
multibox bad
---
I've leveled lots of characters in vanilla conditions, without heirlooms, no xp pool nerf etc. without a guide. Checked that website now to see where should my current alt go and saw that we are in the same area. Nice.
---
&gt; I'm sure not even horde want to play on a server with no alliance.
---
 Im sure they dont, but they are doing everything they can to turn pvp servers into horde only pve ones.
---
Undead female too bruh
---
ok
---
I find WeakAuras absolutely horrible tbh. I much prefer using toolbars for these things.
---
Are you me?
---
i've done this a couple times but it just kills me mainly because other people suck lol. i would prefer a solo way if at all possible.
---
If you are an obsessive-compulsive min/maxer that worries about having or not having certain perks or abilities you are apt to enjoy the game a lot less and only see the shortcomings of your chosen race whenever you die to something. "Stun resist would have saved me", "war stomp would have interrupted all those casts" - you get the idea.
---
The fact is that all the 3 racials have their own strengths, good for different scenarios. Pros and cons for each can be drawn, and you can and will always find a scenario where racial X would have been better than racial Y, but in the end such a comparison is completely pointless. If you plan on solely playing Enh I'd argue that Orc has more things lined up for it (+axe skill, Bloodfury and stun resist), but you'll be just fine with other races too - and if you're doing any other spec, it will be just as good as Orc.  
---
Stop sweating it and worrying.
---
some of these blues and greens just have way more damage than epic raid pieces
---
Why do u want 200g for the mount ? Its 100 if u are honored
---
ive been farming Aszara beach last weekend for a shamelessly 8 hours... non stop, no braining etc etc
---
I was being whispered by several people , asking or blaming me for botting....  
---
So i can image people seeing me or someone grinding they think of botting.
---
Specially when the ycheck several hours later and the guy is still doing the same thing :p
---
oh no not the downvotes
---
Yeah, I'm gonna call mass BS on that.
---
It wasn't the first raid for many people because you need like what, at least 7 people with Aqual Quintessence to douse the runes unless you do double douse shenanigans (which means you have had to run MC multiple times already), and many fights require specific knowledge of what's going on or you will get your ass WRECKED. Shit like Lucifron's curse, Baron Geddon's death bomb, Gehennas's adds that heal for 80k, Shazzrah in general just to name a few, if you don't know EXACTLY what you are doing you will wipe in seconds.
---
Oh realy? Interesting
---
Wait Reddit wants layers back? This is gold.
---
Oh alright I guess i miss understood. Our server pop is still relatively healthy for now and well balanced. So I guess with phase 2 being out we arent in a bad situation with how delicate pop balance is. Seems like it was intentional to not have transfers to here so I suppose I'll trust blizz's judgement for now.
---
By being in town (or a low level zone) for 5 minutes.
---
Well, the ganking will be utter hell, but a few more bag slots would be nice...
---
I like this kind of informative people.
---
Advancing servers is the best imo half assing it with separate servers is gonna bleed the classic community dry
---
I'm glad you and your wife were able to work out something that works for you both!
---
Keep in mind that as the baby grows older and starts to sleep less and wants to play more, you will have to scale back time in the game. You'll always have some, don't worry, but take it from me, every minute you spend with that little guy/gal is the best minute of your life.
---
Absolutly. But having the AH screen up whilst tabbed down isnt playing. You will NEVER get booted for being afk if you actually click stuf. You know that right?
---
Stop it. Get some help.
---
OK, I'm sorry then for blaming not reading my comment. But still, for melee you would want something else. Preferably something with an on hit procc effect.
---
And in true warlock fashion you can even stand up again with soulston and /spit on his corpse (:
---
And then you guys give him bad advice like wasting rage with thunderclap that generates close to zero aggro
---
Better to get someone all the way up in one go than having to make multiple casts over time, as long as you aren't overhealing. I'll always chain a R9 renew after a greater heal on the tank for that reason, lets me MP5 my mana for longer before I need to cast again.
---
Yo, you made me have a damn good laugh and I appreciate it.
---
FYI  check todays (latest) wow classic patch, they fixed  discombobulator ray dismounting.
---
The blue dungeon set, e.g. magister, is T0.
---
The blue/epic dungeon set, e.g. sorcerer, which can be obtained by upgrading the t0 set via quests is T0.5

Please tell me your tank plays Orc!

Level 12 Night Elf hunter finishing up Teldrassil quests, about to head to darkshore tonight. I‚Äôm looking at getting a cool unique pet, is The Rake my best option at this level? Is he the best cat before Broken Tooth?
---
Spellpower flasks are 168ish on Skeram
---
I play a rogue and i say that my dps fluctuates alot with rng around 400-550 dps depending on whether i get alot of backstab crits or not. There are really frustrating fights where i could only crit 3 out of 15 backstabs. The deviation is considerably lower if i play combat swords, as it is less dependant on yellow dmg and more about auto attacks.
---
Another thing to consider is buffs, which are arguably more important than gear at this point. A pre raid rogue with songflower+ ony+ dm+ mongoose flask+ juju+ firewater will beat a full BWL bis rogue with ease.
---
It's also a matter of uptime and letting tanks get threat. A lot of people in my group literally go in with the tank while i wait about 5-7 seconds for the tank to get 2-3 sunders. Min maxing here is indeed to attack with the tank and vanish to delete all your initial threat really early into the fight.
---
So, I agree with you 95%. Warlocks are awesome, do great dps, and their utility is near boundless. I love having good warlocks in my raid (really blessed to have 5 damn good warlocks).
---
But you do need mages for the decurses on all of the Salamander fights. If a warlock could decurse, well... mages would have a problem...
---
This! Don't use thunderclap to build aggro
---
Oh? I thought that only applied to low levels. Alright then.
---
A. How many of your cities have near unguarded back doors like hordes?
---
B. This is not all the city guards it's zepp guards only
---
C. Classic, just like Vanilla never claimed to be balanced. 
---
D. As you say- ooh you don't like the guards on horde zepps? Stop cry and reroll another faction
---
Good luck in irl dude! Wow clsssic is a great game but requires a lot of dedication to have the best. Ypu can always come back for bgs!
---
Yeah I love the times when the shit hits the fan.  That feeling when I've already used my innervate, a major mana pot and can only cast R4 healing touches, but we're down to the last guy in the pack.  It's the crack that keeps me healing.
---
Except ‚ÄúThunderclap‚Äù is an awful waste of rage for the agro it generates...but you‚Äôre right.  He sounds kind of lazy to be a competent warrior tank in classic.
---
For tribute runs to net that high amount of gold you need to sell the loot, bringing more rng in (some items sell good, some not at all) and depends on people buying items.
---
Lucky for the tank a healer is just as replaceable in 5 mans
---
Yeah you can't attack most players in enemy towns (or dueling outside) unless they start first.
---
Yeah I understand that. I'm just trying to make the point that not many people will do that even if the option is available. 
---
I would never faction swap my lvl 60, but transferring to a different server might be an option if my server was super unbalanced
---
Why are you telling me to settle down? I don't care if you hold keys or not.
---
You need to find a guild to pay some protection money. There ain't no police in our warcraft world bro.
---
You will only loose karma with this kind of argument, even tho it make sense.
---
Even if you don't defend blizzard and try to give perspective of why they are in this mess you will get downvoted.
---
I Tryed to explain why comparing QOS from an illegal service (private SERVER) and a huge company doesn't make sense because they don't have the same standard. I have been called a blizzard lover even tho I specified blizzard where in the wrong.
---
Maybe the pservers crow have something to do with that.
---
No he left before we killed him ,poor guy was distressed
---
XD lol . Love it.
---
thats because you stop for mana. we had 0 mana breaks. that means mana pots + runes on cd
---
so they can get you to buy the 100 dollar collectors game next time they do extend it
---
The pvp trolls convinced the plebs that pvp servers are the only way to wow.  I aint falling for that trick
---
You hit the nail on the head. Ony/MC can be done in a night with a good, experieced group. When BWL comes out, there's another night. Then once ZG is released, you can do MC/Ony with 20 people on off raid nights, or pug it (you still want to do it, the fiery/lava cores are still useful, and some gear (like bindings) will still be desired).
---
Its once AQ40 and Naxx come out that things get dicey. You may still want to raid MC, for bindings or whathaveyou, BWL still has some amazing gear that will help in clearing Naxx, and AQ40 has some gear thats BiS or near BiS even with Naxx gear.
---
I'm totally immune to this. But it's not that much better either.
---
In fact I'm at the opposite end of the spectrum:
---
I do everything in so much moderation that I get almost nothing  done be it at work, gaming or relationships. Everything progresses in very little trickles and I don't fully commit to anything :/
---
At least you can say that you really commited yourself to WoW. If you can use that kind of energy for something more produtive, you'll get so much shit done in no time. Something I'm completely incapable to do.
---
Dumb.
---
Is it the same guild? Onslaught does not seem like somehow original name.
---
For sure, my guild on Windseeker starts our raids at 8pm on Tuesday night.
---
I'd rather see the QQ here versus in the servers discord
---
Once I figured out how to solo these, poor warriors now have to look for paladins or druids to farm with instead.
---
why people even want TBC is beyond me. We finally got classic, leave it the fuck alone please
---
do you assist others who purposely tag your mobs for hours on end, then let others dick you down for hours on end
---
Same for me. Just works best. Mana wise it works great and gives more flexibility.
---
Healing to a 100% can oom when a magetard pulls a mob at the wrong time.
---
No. There are free transfers if you want a lower population server.
---
Haha this is hilarious :D I feel like he 420'd a Little too much
---
I thought your name was shit rex till I looked at your username on reddit.
---
I think there's at least some "faction agnostic" people who would do it. Do you compete with the opposite faction for PvP ranks? Indirectly that is. If not it might be people to the minority faction if it makes ranking easier, like how you only compete against your own faction's rating on live.

I don‚Äôt know why any guild wouldn‚Äôt want a player like you. 
---
I‚Äôm actually shocked that you didn‚Äôt find one before but I guess most guilds during first month were all about rushing to the end.
---
As a developer I will tell you that it isn't really a lie though. It's true most of the time. And it's a good thing to tell the PHB to explain why "just adding a little feature" in the legacy code base is going to take a month of work.
---
Q fucking Q. Grow a pair.
---
Look! SlowToad, as an internal blizzard network technician, is here for glory and answers. Thank you! Now we know, the billion $$$ company "could" fix it, but, more likely, they accept bots while checking server foulplays.
---
Yup and that applies to all of reddit
---
Well yeah what else is there
---
You could multi box this it would be a real pain in the ass you would have to spread your characters out evenly in areas that they can explode in by themselves
---
I get way more gold seller ads in-game now then I ever got in retail. The amount of sellers certainly is at least the same.

Black lotus is rare. that makes flasks a useful item for an alchemist. There isn't a problem.
---
I AM SO UPSET
---
Do you honestly blame people for not trusting that they would though? I'll admit, I had high doubts they would remove them come phase 2. I'm not complaining about the queues though
---
I didn‚Äôt play Vanilla and I‚Äôve played retail since WoD, so it was a bit of culture shock for me!
---
But if your guildmate with the same clause \*is\* buying gold, this now means he gets all the gear first.
---
I tried this once and the boss ran towards the pack of mobs in the back then my barov peasants followed him and pulled the pack of mobs and wiped us
---
Simple, you don't. PVE servers should not have faction based queues ever.
---
so just farm or learn to play the AH?
---
I would 100% faction change if it was available paid or not, and if I didn't roll shaman.
---
I personally like being the less dominant faction, back in wod I was one of the 1% alliance on illidan.
---
And because of that such raids have little meaning until Blizzard actually provides a even and lagfree playing field.
---
Education starts with understanding.
---
Wasn't a guild thing, but in WotLK I was a part of my servers best ICC gdkp run.  We'd usually bring in 4-5 big spenders with shit gear as Carries, and cleared all but Saph and LK on heroic.  Weekly split was around 13k and then I would do 10 man mount sales and was making about 20k+ a week from just farming ICC.  Probably the most fun I had raiding in WoW.  Seeing a big ticket item drop like DBW and seeing the bids just keep going higher and higher was great.
---
&gt;Guards will now correctly be more willing to assist players in PvP  combat who have Friendly or higher standing with them. However, they  will continue to not assist players with Neutral standing.
---
What does this mean exactly ? If you are friendly to Gadgetzan, and attack other players, the guards will help you instead of fighting you ?
---
I've seen this kind of prices in the internet, but just the other day I saw someone selling gold for $0.12 per gold on my realm. That seemed like a much more reasonable price.
---
The Madness of the Old Gods has taken him.
---
No reason to take so offense
---
Yes they‚Äôre rare and rightly so. But they were already rare before the layers merged and now with more people than ever they‚Äôre more rare and basically a luck lottery to obtain. That‚Äôs what I am getting at
---
They'll probably flag them and ban them in 1 huge banwave.
---
To be honest this was my second attempt.
---
I had a character on a layered server and one on a non-layered server and the economies are a night and day difference. Glad layers are officially gone
---
Schooled.
---
Should've named it "A haikuh". Kuh is german for cow. You're welcome.
---
Stalagg is not &lt;30% alliance, at least not of raiding 60s which is the only population that matters when it comes to faction balance. Its more like 35-37% ally.
---
I have tried all the popular ones. I keep going back to Johana's. I have 1 character at 60 using it, with a few others between 20 to 50. All the others are just variations of Johana's work without the detail; his is the best imo.
---
First you have to get to 60. And with a baby and only an hour a night it takes forever.

It's a good feeling when you get a message from one of your dungeon group friends like this: "dude this mage in my group is garbage wanna come dps (insert instance here)
---
that is the queue.
---
You say it like he came up with that word himself lol
---
They're asking about the race for their class, not the spec.
---
typical reddit meme. sad for the wasted time
---
What's with the personal attacks? I'm simply stating why I do it. No need to speculate so negatively about my life
---
I joined a guild out of no where because they were super helpful in SM runs in my 30's. Stuck around. Offered help. Made myself noticed in gchat and made sure to always be kind. 
---
Yesterday they relayed the favour and spend hours helping me get my ony attunement for last night's raid.  
---
I would say to just give it a shot. I couldnt see why they wouldn't want a good well rounded player who adda value. It's not like you're just coming on and asking for help all the time. 
---
I have zero IRL friends on my server but have made around 10 solid in game friends who I chat with all the time when im in game. 
---
Just remember to have fun and don't go too deep into the game as I'd your tendencies take control it could be a dark path (the classic addiction)
---
No I'm saying that people won't leave the game to the point where raiding by the time Naxx comes out will be hard to do. 
---
It wasn't a matter of ability of players as opposed to number of players.
---
Who are you to dictate what's positive?
---
As a Hunter, at what point should I replace my devilsaur set ? I did MC the other day and looted the T1 gloves. I also have the T0 pants with the 4 set bonus. Should I replace my devilsaur set with the T1 gloves ad the T0 pants ?
---
Same problem in other loot systems though. The goal of every system is to allow people a fair shot at getting items, and slackers will always benefit from the same conditions. The only solution is to have a closed roster and kicking them out.
---
Lmao thanks for this, gotta show this to the guild lol
---
Only 4 hours? You got lucky.
---
I want the fortnite music on this clip
---
Is it beetlejuicing if its him
---
Priest LOS, barov peasant caller and shadow reflector on warrior
---
Yeah, something.
---
Well you can't really OOM if you spam rank 1 heals if you have any mp5 at all, and you can stay far away from bosses and therefore dodge most of the dangerous abilities that melees have to run out of. You'll have to move from some rain of fire and other things, but really, this has to be the most braindead thing you can do in a raid -but given the crappy payoff considering it takes up 1 raid spot, I don't think anyone does it.
---
Wouldn't underestimate Geddon. Ignite Mana cannot be dispelled by druids and will wreck them quickly. Yeah resto potion, but 2min cd and only 30 sec duration. You need a good rotation to keep up enough healers. If all use the resto pot on the first ignite, the 2nd will kill the raid within 15sec.
---
were you keeping track of who was bitching, or are you just a cunt
---
I doubt you'd ever see it as a guild system but I've seen it done in PuGs.  Back in Wrath these were huge on my server(Area-52).
---
I love that I get I get downvoted for stating that it was added in naxx then you get upvoted for saying that it felt like it was added before naxx, this subreddit makes nosense at all.

If you're neutral and get attacked, guards won't help you. If you're friendly and get attacked then they will.

 lvl 110 
---
Sorry mate, think you got the wrong forum. Try r/wow instead.
---
Lol copper and iron mines are not being overfarmed, people just casually get those to level and skill up not much money to be made off of it, also spawns much more and in more places then other higher level nodes
---
That's actually a good input. This wouldn't work with shamans and paladins, class changing would be a Pandora's Box. The faction specific class would have to transfer to another server.
---
Plus in this case it's MC so no one needs consumables anyways.
---
Wait, why above 50%? I healed 2 priests to lvl 60 in classic and yet I have no idea about this.. pls help
---
What server?
---
Grip is good
---
Found the safe spotter.
---
Well yeah..... I did say the initial time investment of leveling to 60 and getting that pre-raid bis is large. After that's done you don't have to play much at all. (in phase 2)
---
Also if you can only play 1 hour a night then I'm going to say classic wow isn't the game for you. Even once you hit 60, 1 hour play sessions isn't enough time to get anything done properly at end game.
---
&gt; tanks oder dps
---
Haha I guess you are german?
---
Fun fact: I didn‚Äòt get why that was top comment until you replied with r/beetlejuicing
---
Lmao, why?
---
Druids are amazing in 5 mans. They hold threat easily and Innervate can really turn a bad situation around or speed up a run considerably. If you have plans to tank in raids then that favors the Druid, likely you'll be used in any boss that requires more than 3 tanks.
---
As far as the support/dispelling playstyle goes Paladin is definitely the king there. In PvE they're rather boring so it really depends on whether you'll be spending more of your time in PvP or PvE for you to make that decision. 
---
As far as gearing goes no class gears up faster than Druid. You will walk into a raid and walk out with half a set done. That being said Paladins aren't particularly popular either usually being the 2nd or 3rd least picked class so they gear up about as fast as Warlocks do which is still very fast. Personally I think Druids gear up too fast, it's nice to have something to work for instead of being done by the time everyone else is barely 20% the way through gearing up.
---
Lol blaming Blizzard for your own incompetence is really a thing now. Hilarious
---
This happened 2 days ago to me, took me 30+ minutes to get to BRD because of alliance death squads
---
Free transfer does not have an expiration? If so that‚Äôs awesome
---
Massive misrepresentation of the whole night. We had been running around smashing cities for over an hour. Wiped a 100+ ally org raid on the way out of the city, killed mekka once, wiped another ally UC raid, killed tyrande next, then highlord and then mekka again. Yes we wiped eventually on magni but ally had over an hour plus to organise themselves and get ready by then and therefore had a massive advantage. The longer you do this for, eventually your gonna get wiped against home advantage. Its not hard to have non-pvp flagged players run in and sapper if you know a raid is coming. Bottomline I'd hope both sides had fun and could post fun screenshots/videos without having to smear the other side. The fact that you have to try and sell the night as an ally win, really strange tbh man. Smarts of insecurity.
---
It probably would've been faster if it wasn't 5 AM by the time we finished. I was pretty delirious 
---
There were also several wipes that got left on the cutting room floor
---
No, but I wasn't playing on a pc from the previous millenium on a 56k modem either like most nostalgic comments about vanilla wow implies. 
---
The standard internet speed was 4 mbps from the provider we had in 2005 which isn't that far from the speed of modern cellular networks.

A "tank" with a 2H is not a tank; they are a DPS that is playing around.

OP should have actually changed his toons or level an alt while waiting to not get kicked.
---
I essentially couldn't play last night.  My realm had a 120 minute queue time.
---
Yeah, I basically refuse to pug tanks.  It's odd how bad a majority of them are.  I think they have some weirdo power fetish for "leading" a group, because I cannot imagine it being fun performing as poorly as they do in a role that can be very frustrating.
---
50% Raidlog om my main, while farming gold and helping guildies do dungeons. 25% afk while watching Netflix. 25% level alts.
---
or just escape and type that message again after combat. You weren't writing an essay, it can be repeated.
---
 I hope you're right. But as I wrote that would do nothing for realms without queues.
---
Or maybe the WSG?  fingers crossed
---
They ban in waves. Otherwise they just figure out detection methods and carry on. report and wait. It's the only thing we can do
---
The amount of time you waste you could have grinded the gold to buy it from the AH or a lot of xp towards a level. Just keep an eye out on AH for it maybe going a little cheaper.
---
Once I did get the pattern I found the bags to be cheaper than the materials, as with everything you craft for leveling tailoring with runecloth. 
---
The bags actually use more cloth than some of the other runecloth recipes, however they do hold more value. So if its just skill points have a look at the other patterns, even uncommon ones going cheap on the AH.
---
Aww thanks. Yeah we've done lots of things. More naps. Less naps. Letting her cry a bit. Strict bed routine. She just... is terrible about it until her third sleep cycle usually.  We will keep working on it though.  It's like an irl rep grind!
---
Hi, I am level 52 with my rogue at the moment and still carry the swords from SM and Razorfen when and where could I get a good upgrade for my weapons? (sword spec)
---
Indeed. :D 
---
Hope to see you on the battlefield(s)! :)
---
Hey, odyssey in dreadmist
---
Renew feels like a waste of mana, and it's a great way to pull aggro on big packs
---
It's not solo, you have your pet.
---
Level either a mage/lock or hunter
---
I want to spend my time somewhat equally in PvP (BGs) and PvE so gearing quickly wouldn‚Äôt be terrible to me. I just read a lot that Druid‚Äôs absolutely suck in battlegrounds unless you want to flag carry. I gotta admit nothing gets me off more than putting a fat heal on a DPS and saving him.
---
Incompetence would be me failing to keep my spot right away.
---
The grace period timer was changed dynamically, tonight. I have confirmed this with an alt account.
---
That's not something within my control.
---
stopping people pick a side on a server. would work if everyone who join a server. only existed on that server. if you have a friend that plays horde on a high horde server. you are actively telling a person he cant play with his friend
---
Too hard for me
---
That really didn't age well :D
---
Thrashblade is from a quest chain in Maraudon. You'll need to run Mara anyway to get your Blackstone Ring.
---
It's a damn inventory container, how much spaghetti code could there possibly be? Your bag doesn't do anything special, it has no spells or actions or effects, and it doesn't even interact with the world aside from depositing and withdrawing items.
---
So even if nobody knew how to work with that code, just take 2 months to rewrite it *properly* this time and save yourself from a lot more trouble in the future.
---
Ok cool, thanks! I got schooled on my math failure earlier, so I had to double check.
---
Kill only Garr
---
You can still transfer though...?
---
I suggest Thrash Blade from a Maraudon quest:

---
Lol... Classic Experience. 
---
What happened to the playerbase in the last 15 years that now playing this old wholesome game is the same as smelling a burning trash can full of shit?
---
I instandly like the system.
---
The only time healing really gets difficult is if your DPS are impatient and pull agroo a lot. 
---
You run a dungeon with a mage
---
You raid
---
That is pretty much all situations :D
---
because some people prefer it over vanilla? Why is that so hard to understand lol
---
It‚Äôs not getting sad, but frustrated. If it is enjoying to you to frustrate other people... I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äòm not a ‚Äûpeoples person‚Äú either... but I personally still think about the person sitting behind the screen, trying to enjoy a game and don‚Äôt only see the avatar. 
---
Maybe that‚Äôs a problem for some. 
---
If it‚Äôs not and you really want to annoy other people... well I find that kind of sad tbh. And I hope you find something in your rl that makes you happy.
---
EU hydraxian waterlords horde has 2 on warcraftlogs and they were months old. Yet I personally know of at least 7 guilds with active raid groups.
---
Not everybody logs.
---
just to say that WeakAuras can do everything even create toolbars with specific triggers, it's basically a addon to create programms ingame of course you need to know Lua very well but still it can do literally everything.
---
For example I improved a Weakaura from Wago for all consumables that triggert even for specific classes and show if the item is found in your inventory and can be used when you click on the glowing icon and then shows the buffamount. The weakaura only loads when you open your charater sheet. With other words you have all required/possible consumables you like to use in one windows and free 20 button from your toolbars and remove the manuall check in your buffbar if the specific consumable is still up and for how long:

This is how our ICC Gdkp runs were.  We'd bring in 4-5 rich, undergeared people to be carried.  They wouldn't get a split of the pot and bought most of the gear.  But big items like the trinkets and weapons some of the carriers would bid on as well.  Things like Deathbringers Will would go for like 70k+.  We were also the best Gdkp run on the server so we had a good reputation which helped a lot in finding buyers.  Pot usually ended up around 10-13k split.
---
What reason would I have to prove it to you? I didn't spend thousand(s) of dollars editing the video. I spent Thousand+ on hiring a machinima artist and professional artist FOR the video, and the two trailers leading up it. I'm not bragging i said it to make a point, the "why" is what does it matter to you in all of this.
---
Then they'll never learn. Had a MC Pug last week because I couldn't make the guild run in time. MT pulls with ranged weapon - 4 DPS warriors charge in and promptly die. I've also seen my share of people drawing aggro and then trying to "kite" lava surgers. First repair bot needed to be placed about halfway to Garr despite no whipes. During bosspulls tanks lost aggro usually during positioning because everyone was throwing instants as soon as range permits. 
---
I don't expect everyone to always play 110% super focused and defensive but can't they at least be careful at the start and then ramp up depending on group? Same with repair costs. I pay roughly 1g in a full MC run on average. If they need to repair to full roughly twice each run + consumables this can't be healthy.
---
There's a recent blue post specifically saying that removing layering will increase the queue time, so it actually is less players.
---
&gt;Last night with level 55 two hand axe warrior
---
this is probably where it went wrong. From ST forward it's much, much riskier to 2h tank and unless you are very well geared, it's pretty inconsiderate if not disrespectful toward your healer. Things start to hurt quite a lot in BRD; large packs, punishing caster abilities, magic attack fire elementals and a lunatic of a last boss. I'm sure it can be 2h tanked if you're borderline outgearing and outleveling it, but while leveling up - slap on a freaking shield already. DPS just have to follow marks and play accordingly. 
---
Druids have quite nice threat generation for the most part and a huge HP pool, but healing them (at that level at least) felt more spiky and unpredictable than healing a warrior of the same level (using shield + 1h). 
---
Further adding to this, toward the end of the dungeon the mobs are significantly higher level than in the early parts, up to level 59 for Emperor, and things start hitting pretty damned hard, fire elemental packs and caster packs after the salamander boss spring to mind. It's a tough dungeon if people don't know what to do or how to play (insisting on 2h tanking when healer's struggling, for instance) and can be more akin to a 5man raid than a dungeon. That said, it's awesome XP considering all the quests, and there are lots of decent pre-raid bis items there. 
---
Try finding a decent tank or better still, a guild group. Level 56 should be fine to heal the whole thing, I think I was 53 on my first full run but ran it with a 58 tank and some equally leveled DPS.
---
* Corrected an issue with the Gnomish Cloaking Device that caused it to incorrectly drop the player from combat when used.
---
That 1 stings about as bad as the no key ring issue. I really loved how it worked like vanish and I would rely on it a lot in many situations. Now it's just a worse invisibility potion with an unreasonably long cooldown(1hr).
---
Whether it's against #nochanges or not, please revert it back Blizz else it's a pointless item that shouldn't even exist and will never be used.
---
I'm the opposite.  I have all the time in the world and I wish I wanted to play, but I just can't force myself to do so.  I log in and just stare at my toon thinking of how much more leveling I have to do, and if it'll even be worth it due to my server possibly going to shit.
---
Everyone looks like they're having so much fun, but I just can't even force myself to have fun in classic.
---
I doubt you can make more than 15G per hour.
---
Trust me. I tried. Either on azshara and nightfins/oily.
---
Lawbringer is great pvp gear but terrible for raiding. It's probably best used in pve  for dungeon tanking.

Got 4 essence of air in 6 minutes the other day. felt preeeettty good

If you don't cancel the auras and use a "dust macro" or "powershift macro" the then you lose those aura's every other shift. It's a reported bug we are still waiting on a fix for.

Honestly, I had no idea of the origin. All I know the sub is about aptly named reddit accounts that are at least older than the comment
---
Check the official forums/MMO-Champion.
---
it launches Thursday
---
The lord generals sword in BRD from General Angerforge is a good option.
---
From my experience, BRD is a big jump in difficulty from all the previous dungeons.
---
I play horde on Grobb (48 atm) and I feel almost every neutral hub is dominated with alliance. I feel it‚Äôs more 55A/45H than 50/50 from my perspective. At the moment, I get gambled by 60 alliance 1/2 times a session as it is and I‚Äôm sure Horde do the same to the alliance. Just the nature of the server.
---
Don't really understand the point of logging classic fights, atleast at this level. MC and Ony are jokes, there's no nitpicking through the details.
---
I tried. She got so upset that she threw up each time I tried putting her in her bed. 5 mins later, throwing up. Even if I went in and calmed her, never worked. Never seen anything like it to be honest. So we have a routine but I still have to put her down myself.
---
\&gt; linking the auction houses of multiple servers, as that would increase supply
---
If supply increases, and demand increases, does anything *really* change?
---
What? My server is fine.
---
I feel like you don‚Äôt even need a raid. Sure it‚Äôs not as much xp but let the low level tag a couple, gather em up and frost mage them down. Four mobs that‚Äôs ~2400xp in about a minute. After eating/drinking and just running around to find mobs, that‚Äôs still about 100k-120k xp per hour
---
Now if only I could figure out how to keep my melee alive on the trash packs starting at Geddon...
---
You know the ones I'm talking about. Two fire elementals (Flameguard and Flamewalker I think?) And 1-2 magma elementals. Something keeps chewing up the melee, and I am wondering if it's a healing failure or a melee failure. It's not just pyroclast barrage either, its happening even after banishes go out. I've been having them equip fire res gear during these pulls, but even that is of only limited effectiveness.
---
A lot of mages won't respec to arcane power for raids, as a lot of people consider it not worth it to spend 100g of farming to save 2 minutes of a raid time.
---
I'm willing to guess you are stalagg horde.
---
Dude the tactics are so simple. Every boss has like two sentences of easy tactics max.
---
Emphasis on when he said ‚Äúexact time‚Äù. I‚Äôm assuming he already knows the day lol
---
Just enjoy your character and PvP. Do racials make an impact? Sure, some more than others. But not having or having certain racials shouldn‚Äôt make or break the game for you.
---
The answer to this problem may lie right before your eyes in the bottom left of that prompt.
---
Nublizzard is so fucking lame lol
---
Was your only goal to raid the zeppelin? And nothing else? Not even continue on to Org?
---
What's the point of that?
---
What's your opinion on running dungeons with overleveled players?  Ran Uld yesterday with a group that included an overleveled warrior and could barely run fast enough to get to the mobs before they died (I drank once between pulls and almost lost the group).  I understand you may want to farm items and everything but this was a very underwhelming experience to me.  I mean if you have to rush through everything what's even the point of this game?
---
Stalagg WAS what they did about high pop, it was the alternative to herod and faerlina which they said everybody get out of. They fucked up launch and now we have to deal with  it
---
Uff especially in LBRS this is rough. Makes pulls downright easy if you just sheep or even sheeppull the casters and clean up the melees first.
---
But this thread isn't about PvP... It's about the imbalance of factions and queue times.
---
Having a 5k queue on an imbalanced server that has 4k horde in queue and only 1k alliance is absurd and only makes the imbalance worse.
---
Always kill every Mage, Warlock, Rogue, and Shadow Priest on sight. It's for your own safety. Special importance is on Undead anything.
---
Anytime you find yourself behind on zone levelling, the best option is to grind out your levels in dungeons for do and loot.
---
It‚Äôs all about the hit bonus with the Devilsaur set.  You don‚Äôt wanna replace it if you can‚Äôt sacrifice the hit %.

Why get rid of him tho?
---
&gt;Why on earth would this have been coded to...
---
Fuck if I know, but if that's the world of warcraft that you play, that has to be our basis. If it's spaghetti to hell, it might take an unreasonable amount of time to figure out exactly where the problem is. Why risk anything if they can just wait?
---
&gt;:o super hard stuff here "Spaghetti code" is never a fucking excuse, fix your work.
---
I think it's unreasonable to make claims about what's easy or hard if I have no idea at all about how something is done practically. Are you a high level computer engineer or whatever? 
---
But sure, Blizz might just be lazy or greedy. Only they know I suppose.
---
IIRC the critical issue was that your gold was stored in your backpack in an invisible slot. So any error in an update that messed with the backpack could have messed with people's gold which is just about the worst possible thing to screw up.
---
No, the point is there isn't supposed to be that many players on the server, and the solution avaliable is transfers. "Enjoying a populated server" includes ALL the aspects of that, including higher competition in the open world.
---
druid healing is great all the way through. As long as you have int/stam gear, you can heal till BRD with Feral build. I have successfully healed or tanked upto SM Cath so far, and I am a tank build.  mana becomes even easier when you start getting points into Heart of the Wild.  
---
I mainly used Healing touch too, and could pre cast it, and then abort the cast if the tank didnt need heals. 
---
At level 30 you get Tranquility which is also a great "oh s\*\*\*" spell (5m cooldown).  
---
I mainly only used the Hots on the other raid party, as they are faster casts, and save Healing touch for the tank.
---
Very early on there was a mechanic to do with visibility in the darkness, I think it was initially planned just for duskwood
---
Using torches like you see the Night Watch patrolling with. Like a lot of cool ideas it wasn‚Äôt feasible on their timeline
---
That‚Äôs not even true what are you talking about? Lol
---
This is the main reason I dont play (and have never) on PVP servers. world PvP as you call it, seems to be 3 v 1's or higher levels ganking lowers, or vast outnumbering the opposition. It never seems to be fair fights. 
---
World PvP and city raids all happen on PvE realms too, so you do sometimes get world PvP. 
---
But I just dont see the attraction of being outnumbered and griefed as you just go about leveling your character.
---
Not really what you asked for but still relevant for you; I think AoE-farming mages of the opposing faction will become ever more KoS from now on. Thread carefully.
---
You afk you lose. It's not that hard of a concept. It's incompetence. You also had the option to transfer and you have been warned multiple times about this. It's 100% your own fault.
---
I don‚Äôt get why other people don‚Äôt see it. He is clearly just doing this for attention. The amount of people on this subreddit is a drop in the bucket to the amount of people that actually play. Trying to make this post out to be some kind of advertisement for his kindness is a joke. His target demographic is new players just starting out. They certainly aren‚Äôt checking Reddit. He‚Äôs posting this so other people will jerk him off and it‚Äôs working. People that do this kind of thing that truly just want to be nice don‚Äôt have the need to tell others about it.
---
People refused to transfer. They can blame themselves.
---
Tomorrow.
---
He‚Äôs not saying that he WANTS it to fail though. He is just saying, that some people who still play classic might stop enjoying it.
---
When you bid on an item, who does your gold go to?
---
So... PVE servers?
---
I think the people who are split on phase 2 are people who haven't hit 60 and are terrified of getting constantly camped by 60s. That's my guess anyway.
---
If there aren't supposed to be that many people on the server then why would blizzard increase the server capacity to accommodate that? Don't them, as the creators of the game decide how many players are supposed to be on a server? Your points are shortsighted and invalid, thank you for your feedback however. You are probably someone benefiting/profiting from this issue.
---
No.
---
Pagle is one of the largest population servers.
---
Didn‚Äôt they say it was coming with phase 2?
---
I just logged on this am, saw a node, hit it, 2 crystals in 3 hits. Time for work.
---
ZF until 54, BRD till 60
---
Hell my son is 2 1/2 and the only times i get to play are when he is sleep too. I'm been looking for raiding guilds on my server but all start when I'm still at work, nothing late 10pm + at the moment. Maybe I'll get to enjoying that sweet raiding like when I was a teen.
---
So, horde?
---
some people really care bout that?
---
Chinese farmers doing exactly the same routine over and over not caring about getting ganked 50 times. I don't think so.
---
well maybe you're okay with grinding dungeons all day and night but i like variety. not here trying to min/max broham. and yeah both are fun when in the right mood
---
Oh, I thought pve server meant that pvp is disabled.
---
Oh hey

Then you meet me. I'm the carebear who wants to help everyone and who gets worried when someone dies. When the dps is a moron and AoEs the mobs with 0 tank threat, you bet that I'll throw every spell I have to keep them alive.
---
Which means that the aggro inevitably goes to me. Which you, the tank, have to pick up. Which means the dps never learns.
---
Such is life...
---
Sure, let's just pack up 79 other raiders and move 'em.

---
They absolutely do... a normal raid the tank will drop in a seconds. You need to prepare for that with a lot of buffs and manage the pull exactly right.
---
1. It will just make the price of herbs/flasks more expensive which will have a natural cap of balance supply vs. demand. If it would be too expensive, people won't buy it and the price will drop.
---
2. People are much more skilled in general and used to MMO now than they were before. In fact, flasks aren't really necessary aside from tank flasks maybe.
---
Once PvP launches they'll be targeted for honor.
---
Jesus.
---
Just enjoy the casual side of things. You already have 30 days played so you‚Äôre probably decked out m8.

Now reduce playtime to like 8 hours a week. When the baby sleeps go gank some newbs. Farm professions.

You don‚Äôt have to quit entirely is what I‚Äôm sayin.

The macros on wowhead are slower than certain other macros, and ignore the other shitty recipes. Ever since i got a better macro from a guildie, i lose like 1/10 recipes. Just as a heads up to people using the "buy slot 31"-macro.

can you share this data? Trying to level in Badlands right now and it's swarming with horde.
---
You finish WPL/EPL and Winterspring?

Fuck Layering. The problem is not lack of layers, the problem is low respawn times. I‚Äôd rather they decrease respawn times for Rich Thorium and/or Black Lotus than adding layers.
---
Layers make the world feel fake and disconnected. I like one layer. It‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs supposed to be.

Don't do this. It's bannable to use software to automate actions like this. It's botting

And thus the retailification of classic continues
---
Don't ever cite wikipedia child. Check out the Blizzard post near the top. It specifically mentions comparing yourself to other players on your realm. The guide lays it out too, it's server wide. 
---

The ones going for real honor wont be found in quieter areas, thats not to say a casual will now have incentive to kill you but there will be places that are gonna be calm enough
---
Took me quite a few tries to get it, but agree with macro suggestion. I my 1 key as '/tar qia' and my 2 key as 'buy vendor item slot 31' (or something like that, Google the actually string to use). Then my mouse pointer over the coming to close window. Spam that fit 30 minutes and hope the right pattern spawns
---
I gave up replying, some people just didn't get this.
---
Dude, I swear to god, I came to say the EXACT same thing lol
---
Yes, it's absolutley in Blizzars best interest to ignore botters for 2 weeks just after classic was released to make sure no one can farm because botters occupy the area.
---
Because it's fun to have a ban wave.
---
Oh my bad then.
---
Yeah, not sure if it's delayed or they just don't care.
---
If you can get the Lotuses that cheap I'd take a gamble and start shopping like a madman. Even with layer abuse, black lotuses are bound to run out sooner or later, and then you'll have a big supply to unload from at a nice profit since the demand will be higher with the limited supply. 
---
That is, unless Blizzard caves to the QQ and somehow alters the herb respawn times - but when have they ever listened to QQ? (/s)
---
That's a you issue. You could have rerolled on launch day when new servers came up or the day after. You chose to stay knowing this would likely happen. YOUR FAULT.
---
you toggle the pvp to make yourself flagged. when alliance attack horde cities, folk then flag and fight them back. 
---
But if you just want to quest away, you can stay unflagged and cant be attacked. 
---
You auto flag if you go near opposing towns or cities.
---
Only way to answer this properly is for you to find a dps spreadsheet, input your gear and raid makeup and see test the different pieces. There's a hunter discord channel with spreadsheets like this available. Stat weights change based on other stats so your case will likely be slightly different to other people's.
---
To do things efficiently

Hi.  Just finished both grinds.

Was easily exalted with Timbermaw when I finished Winterspring Frostsaber rep.  Hope that helps.

Blizzard assumes people like the undead because of edgy evil stuff. But some guys just want to be literal Grateful Dead.
---
Probably not. Which ever the case, I think it's funny.
---
Check out the Blizzard post near the top. It specifically mentions comparing yourself to other players on your realm. The guide lays it out too, it's server wide. 
---
Also a good slot warmer for stuff you don't have the dedicated equipment for. It has higher stats then Lightforge. So yes, every paladin wants it but usually not for PvE healing.
---
The ratio across the entire game doesn't impact the players experience on individual servers so it's a meaningless statistic in this discussion.
---
Even more reason to spam sunder like mad. Each cast counts as a hit and you should level that weapon in no time.
---
Literally 95% of the people wanting faction specific transfers wanted them WITH a faction specific queue.
---
Blizzard bans in waves, nothing new there.
---
Why would they provide free transfers away from the server, if they didn't think it was overpopulated?
---
Low level pet has the same aggro range as a 60 pet, it's basically invisible.

Don't cite to wikipedia. Check out the Blizzard post near the top. It specifically mentions comparing yourself to other players on your realm. The guide lays it out too, it's server wide. 
---
Yeah, but that gets tedious over time. An add-on for it makes it a lot easier and you can focus on raidleading, doing dps/heals/tanking and having fun instead.
---
It would undoubtedly change the game some ways but at least it would set a standard across all servers. You will always have the option to create characters on low pop realms to farm mats for gold if thats what you wanted to do, and its obviously easy to get the gold over (set a rediculously high price on an item for your alt on another server to buy to thus transfer the gold). Of course when everyone starts doing this to farm mats, then its not that easy anymore even on "dead servers", also people on populated servers who didnt want to do that would farm gold in other ways, such as selling services/questing for gold/farming for mob gathered loot instead of node gathered, stuff like dark runes/essences/etc. Literally the biggest change would be the price of gathered materials.
---
When do you think he said anything of the sort?
---
At some point you'll accept the fact that now nothing beats aoe dungeoning and/or questing, xp wise.
---
Sorry about that. Still, at least you've been lucky enough to be able to use this "exploit" of layering up to lvl 50.
---
Well when I look at combat log I can only see the damage I deal and I recieve, nothing about other players. Idk how it gets this info. It ruins the game and is stupid.
---
They're citing to a website that is flat wrong. Check out the Blizzard post near the top. It specifically mentions comparing yourself to other players on your realm. The guide lays it out too, it's server wide.

Buying now for later use is still speculating, so I was including those people in my statement.
---
Ulda has a ton of quests, but is a pain in the dick to complete at the "right" level. If you look at the meeting stone outside, it's something ridiculous like level 41 to 52.  
---
It can be fun and challenging to do at-level, but with undergeared/under-skilled PUGs, it's a slog. Sure, do it once or twice for the "authentic experience", whatever.  
---
Enchanters need to go there to learn some formulas, so high level characters are going to be there every now and again. The last boss drops a quest item that gives a 14 slot bag and a ton of exp; he also drops weapons that fill the gap for any 2hander class, as well as a ring with RNG suffixes that can be pretty good and last you well in to your 50s if you get the right stats. Some of the quests require multiple trips in to Ulda, too, and no one wants to be the dick who got their quest items and dropped out before clearing the place. All of these are good reasons to just rush the place and get it over with: farm a 2hander; farm a good ring; get those quests out of the log.
---
I'd put Ulda as the #3 worst thing in classic WoW.
---
1: Horde Onyxia attunement  
---
2:Gnomeregan  
---
3: Uldaman  
---
4: Sunken Temple
---
I agree with this. I hit 60 Monday morning and played all day, then played Tuesday til 4pm. Managed to get MC and Ony attuned with a few pieces of pre BiS. 
---
I was falling victim to the anxiety/need for full pre raid BiS when in reality if I'm in blues/high spell power greens I'll be OK. 
---
Managed to get a guild invite for an 9/10 MC guild that want me to raid tonight. After the raid I'll logout and no logon til the weekend
---
Subaru*
---
Probably the absolute last thing on the priority list of the massively reduced GM workforce.
---
Says end of year. Im calling they mean some bullshit like the Chinese or Mayan new year that is infact many many moons away.
---
... PvP? It's a huge thrill for a stealther to hop on a boat/zeppelin and take on multiple foes
---
I mainly went PvP because my private server guild wanted it. Personally I don't care that much if I'm on PvP or PvE server. I do find large scale world pvp (i.e guilds vs guilds) to be quite fun, but in average day-to-day play I rarely engage in world-pvp on my own, but mostly because I'm warrior.
---
There's something about Mulgore and Teldrassil that never ever gets old to me.
---
Music in Teldrassil is the most WoW thing in the game for me.
---
Are you actually bringing all your dungeon keys to Molten Core?
---
That's on you.
---
You can't cast Insect Swarm in Moonkin form, can you?
---
TIL alliance has no guards leading to their boats at all. For the record, the zepplins have no guards on them.
---
Horde just seems more fun.
---
Maybe, maybe not, blizzard is terrible at announcing their bug fixes because that would show how incomplete the game actually is.
---
This post aged poorly
---
Well alliance tend to roll on PVE Servers more because they have bad PVP racials (compared to the Horde) and nice PVE racials.
---
Horde is good PVP racials and not so good PVE racials which is why they tend to be more on PVP Servers.
---
This can of course vary because it is only "minor" differences. A lot is still down to skill
---
Maybe in US, but the majority of EU pvp servers were still layered yesterday, its going to be crazy over here.
---
/r/agedlikemilk
---
I guess we'll see what happens when bgs come out. Hope you aren't planning on grinding GM on horde
---
Hit is always better than more spell damage for the raid, unless we're talking individual logs. Highest logs are possible if you run choker + mana-igniting and frozen wrath head (unless you have 3 set), but it's super inconsistent. Most good mages run ban'thok over mana-igniting and strat neck over choker simply for consistency.
---
You do realize that Retail has a cash shop...that just got a brand new mount  a few months ago.
---
What I could see them doing for Classic is offering the Collector's Edition non-combat pets (Zergling, Panda Cub,...one other I think). Then also the Blizzcon non-combat pets like Murky (which was, I believe from the first Blizzcon back in 2005).
---
They could also pick from the 'unreleased' stash of non-combat pets, tameable pets, mounts, armors (as Ensembles).
---
Then there's the services that have yet to be implemented: Server Transfer (paid), Renames, Faction Transfer (the client and server code are based on 7.3; so both support this).
---
I don't imagine they'd do it any time soon, but I know Activision-corporate is eyeing that [estimated by the public] around 2 million Classic-only subs.
---
Actually only one letter is wrong.
---
Hmmmm.....
---
7 months and not sleeping through nights yet? Shit mine is 1 month old and I hought the sleeping through nights was almost here... FML.
---
But if not for sleeps why is it made of warm?
---
10 mins a day on an alt parked at the AH can net you a few gold a day easily... idk what to tell you man Blizz isn‚Äôt going to adjust respawn timers due to population size. They also aren‚Äôt gunna change the way world buffs work even tho WAY more people are clearing endgame content
---
For healing there is a green item that has the same amount of healing as the incendius bracer, but has no fire res so its pretty much the same. I assume there is a frozen wrath bracer just like that too.
---
Do things like the Mara staff and ony neck go on the key ring too?
---
Because you enjoy the game's content? Also, why would running dungeons with a group of 5 people in the recommended level range be "slow as humanly possible"?
---
&gt;but the price point at the moment is not created by people who are actually using flasks.
---
Annihilator is in the game, and does stack with FF/SA.
---
the people you're talking about must be buried really deep in there I see no evidence of them existing
---
Just take a peek here:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-gear-bis-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-gear-bis-classic-wow) 
---
This list provides options, both in mitigation and in damage/threat.
---
If you want to be completely optimal, your set should be adjusted per fight, and based on your group's abilities. Ideally, you'll wear the bare minimum of defense/mitigation gear to survive the fight, and fill everything else with damage gear so that your DPS can crank out bigger numbers. It's a trial and error thing. Just watch your healer's mana and watch how low your HP goes over the course of a few runs; swap out an item here and there until you reach a balance.
---
If you're not surviving, sacrifice all the agi/strength until you have the stam and defense to survive. If you are surviving, aim for %hit and strength.
---
What happens with mats/greenies/ores etc?
---
Ofc he doesnt
---
Those kind of peoples directly go to my hatelist. Always nice to see their reaction when they asked to be invited to my group later and I answered with a "Sorry I don't want to play with you".  I start nearly all my group for dungeon only 1 time i got like 5/6 dps contacting me at the same and was kind of busy looking for the best choice. I still answered them. Don't find an excuses for your assholeness.
---
as a warrior I broke my set with the plate gloves from MC, but I‚Äôm also orc and have 6% hit easily from other pieces
---
This is alma.  I cant say I am not surprised our Sempius made it to the top of reddit.
---
This is not me being mean.
---
Who gives a flying shit on what you make. You make this game out to be what you want and if you want to make a troll then make one. Don't give it to the societal "this race is better" dick measuring contest. 
---
Play what you want buddy, you'll enjoy it much better.
---
As an officer you feel like you can do something to prevent the meltdown :/
---
I've used to be a very loyal community member.
---
Horde have better racials.
---
Night Elves have shadowmeld, which can be fun but not much else. Dwarves and Gnomes have decent PvP racials but pretty specific uses. Humans have sword spec and that‚Äôs it.
---
Horde on the other hand,  have great and fun racials. Orcs get a nice attack power buff on top for stun resist and axe spec. Trolls get blood craze, one of the only forms of haste in classic wow. Tauren get an awesome fitting stun. And undead get a nice fear break on top of eating the corpse of their enemy.
---
Listen here you little shit...
---
Hey all kids are different.  Some take to sleep training much better!!
---
Mine is chill though the day. Great at traveling. Eating. And great temperament.  Sleep is her one flaw lolol.. I can live with it.
---
Good luck!!
---
PVP servers are just more populated by horde players, and pve more alliance players. That's just how it is.
---
There are pvp servers dominated by ally players though, due to mass transfer usually.
---
&gt; By this logic literally everything is a pain to invest in.
---
Yes. It kind of is, which is why I'll need to prioritize what I farm.
---
I get it, you disagree. With limited play time and resources, it's just one more thing you'll need the space, time, and materials for. 
---
If you plan on playing solo a lot I think it's worth investing some time, otherwise you're going to have healers who can take care of you :)
---
I did all roles while watching shit on second monitor, it's not just healers. It's mostly why I played wow, you could watch TV shows while doing something.
---
I'd advice you to look up a few different pre-raid bis lists and not just stick to 1. A super fast google search will land you with a number of different lists, several of which present you with alternatives.
---
my bad, you're right I confused it with nightfall
---
Dire maul East
---
dungeons
---
Did this sub just become r/beyondthebump?
---
There are certainly animators who can produce comparable quality and fidelity. I imagine the reason most don't is because its very expensive and time consuming to produce an entire animated episode with the same level of quality of in a single image.
---
how much gold you  been clearing per hour from mara?
---
Tbf he only misspelled one letter
---
friend of mine spent 45 min trying to get in this weekend. finially said fuck it.
---
sent another friend all his gold and items worth any money (one was a staff of jordan) logged out and deleted his character. told us classic simply was not for him 
---
was a 53 warlock
---
The firewalkers have an ability called fire blossoms randomly doing roughly 3000 damage to a random person they target while the fireguards have a cone firebreath like the chili you can cook. Fire resist gear may have you resist or you dont resist and you get fully blasted. I simply wait until the tanks have properly positioned the mobs and I put on my PvP gear. In full PvP gear I'm around 5200 health unbuffed. I lack the required amount of hit but I dont mind.
---
Make sure to move out of the mob range, because if you are already low and a lava reaver comes thundering towards the melee group, things can turn nasty. Their cleave is 360¬∞ so standing behind them still makes you a prime target. Due to the nature of all this raid wide AoE damage, make sure to bandage yourself.
---
tl; dr Have a minimum amount of 5k health raidbuffed, disengage and heal yourself, dont mind the damage meters, ranged will be above the melees.
---
I checked and in the last 7 days, its hugely horde &gt; alliance now
---
I'm in the same situation simply because real life does not allow me to play more than maybe 10h a week. 
---
I'm trying not to feel rushed and just enjoy the game but right now I'm struggling a bit with that since it seems that I'm the minority and I'm missing out on all the cool stuff going on. I know there is still alot of players like me and that the end game stuff is still there but can't help feeling a bit frustrated that I can't level faster.
---
Possibly. Rabbit holes every where around here. Never know where they lead.
---
Using a macro to buy something from a vendor definitely is not bannable
---
They only have a couple community managers, don't think the devs are actually gonna put work in to fix things.
---
I agree.
---
Back on the good'ol pservers there was no PVE servers for those losers, you had pvp or 300pop realms to choose from. And the faction balance was historically quite balanced.
---
Priv servers faced the same problem and implemented dynamic respawn rates, basically more people in the area = faster spawns. It wasn't ideal but it worked well and farming was enjoyable again. They definitely need to do something.
---
There are already efforts in place, namely the free transfers. What you want is to force these upon people. You either cannot see that that's a terrible solution or don't care because you'd be benefiting from it, and you thing "the greater good" justifies your selfish desire. On top of all this, youre talking about facts and proof yet you've shown none. Go back to your cave and rage and dying to horde pls
---
I rarely have problems with aggro in dungeons, even with using VE and MB. If you're competent as a spriest (and the tank is competent) you just have wait a few seconds for the tank to establish a little aggro then fire away no worries. If you're having problems with that just tell the dps to wait a second or two.
---
My healer guidies also always try to get me to come along on end-game dungeon runs because VE makes their job a lot easier.
---
As for DPS shadow priests are totally fine in dungeons. This is the "i read it on the internet" raid mentality seeping through. In raids the debuff slot limit is really what hinders shadow priest damage (and mana issues too in later phases). In dungeons it's not an issue so we can DoT away and do DPS just as well as anybody else in there. 
---
The *real* reasons I see that people have to not want to bring spriests are the no AoE (which sucks, I miss Mind Sear), and the mana issues. But again, if you're a competent spriest you just load up on water &amp; other consumes before you run anything so mitigate the issue, and drink / pop potions whenever you can.
---
There's way too much misinformation about spriests on reddit. They're absolutely playable if you know what you're doing.
---
What I did was look at the 100 top resto druids on Warcraft logs and in MC they mostly used rank 9 regrowth and rank 10 rejuvenate. Max rank regrowth probably gets casted 4 times during a boss fight and rejuvs get casted constantly. You should also have rank 4 healing touch out and rank 5 or 6 regrowth that you cast in between in while your hots are ticking. All these druids where the top healers in there raids. I tried it out myself for the first time last night and went for 11th place to 5the place beating every priest but 1. Hope this helps!
---
Yeah pretty much that. Thought about doing it too but essentially there are only alts. Did a few dozen low level dungeons no one needed bags that dropped.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, new player and all.  Guess next time I‚Äôll know better.
---
So...you believe they went out and bought 91 servers to support the game?
---
Jesus....
---
it's exactly how they always operated in Vanilla.
---
It's same guild master and a few of the same people.. from Skullcrusher
---
Which downrank would you suggest? I agree that you need to let tank down to 25% to get full use out of GH4, but GH1 is too weak when tank takes a lot of damage. Right now I have gh1, gh4 and heal3 on my bar.
---
Undead priest who smokes to much concentrates chiming in to say thanks!
---
You could make an argument for that since in beta, they were effectively testing phase 2.5, since honor, BG's and vendors were all in for testing.
---
However beta didn't have dire maul.. so the same thing that says Honor isn't a real patch says that Dire Maul is, so kind of a weak argument to make.
---
That could be easily solved by having the leader stream his game showing how much gold he has and how he had a distributing it. I would love for this system to catch on Classic for pugs.
---
Well done, 10 sentences and not a single point made. Please name one issue that is bigger than the game being unplayable when 2 raids or more fight, I am truly curious about your answer.
---
They are Blizzard's servers. They should make sure they are healthy and capable of doing what they are supposed to do. They can't just say "please move to another server". It is same thing if I put red button on the wall and insert "please do not press" text above it.
---
They haven't done stress test. Ion said in one Q&amp;A that servers are capable of handling even more players than what they are letting it and limiting players is made only because world hasn't been planned to have 100k players. So if they have made proper stress tests and say that servers will be fine then why they are not fine?
---
Hoping to hop into Classic now that my classes are dying down. I've asked before about classes, now I'm wondering what realms are good to join? Seems to be a lot of drama about faction balance and dying realms. I'm not crazy about PvP outside of BGs, just want to enjoy all parts of the game pretty casually.
---
a big ass company can't be fucking bothered to give us enough servers and somehow it's my fault for not transfering away from my guild and friends?
---
shut up bootlicker
---
For MC? I wouldn't be offended, but I would reevaluate if it's worth playing with a group min maxing so hard for easy content.
---
I need to hit 60 still. Lol sitting at 41. Warrior. Stranded in stv lololol
---
We were looking for a tank and I didnt know it would make that big ofa Difference
---
Lol you don‚Äôt have a threat addon and you are going to talk down on the warrior?
---
Is there a place people go to talk about guild recruitment and stuff? Trying to move into better progression stuff but can't seem to find any guilds looking to take people.
---
Why are you undead on a bengal tiger mount in a group full of Alliance?
---
Are you model editing...?
---
How much hit % do I need to never miss yellow attacks (Sinister Strike/Backstab/etc.) vs raid bosses?
---
300 Weapon Skill: 9%
---
305 Weapon Skill: 6%
---
315 Weapon Skill: 5% (but you generally should not aim for 315+ Weapon Skill)
---
This is total hit % required, so if you are playing a regular Combat raiding spec with 5/5 Precision and 2/2 Weapon Expertise, you will not miss yellow attacks with just 1% hit from gear.
---
Then all hit % beyond those values is useless?
---
No. This only applies to yellow attacks. Your white hits will still have a large miss % due to the Dual Wield penalty applied from wielding 2 weapons. What people commonly refer to as a "hit cap" is more accurately the absolute minimum amount of hit % you want to have. Hit % above that still improves your overall damage since it will cause more white hits to land, and white hits tend to be ~50% of your overall damage (depending on gear/fight length/and so on).
---
You also know that BGs are cross realm, right? So unless there is massive horde overpopulation across the entire game the individual distribution of H:A per server won't matter at all.
---
&gt; Remulos has one Horde guild with an MC clear on warcraftlogs.
---
How do you filter by server?  I'm on warcraftlogs right now and can't find that option anywhere.
---
#memetoo
---
Race is human, sorry for missing that. I have +3% extra hit on the items in my bank: 2% from Voone's Vice Grips and 1% from Bloodmail Boots. I didn't equip them because doing so would mean losing even more strength from dropping Gauntlets of Valor and Sapphiron's Scale Boots. Do you think I should do it?
---
On the Valor set: I can get to 4 pieces if I switch Golem Skull Helm for my Helm of Valor. Is that a good idea?
---
One noob downvoted me but it's still the best way to xp with spellcleave in dongeon at 50+.
---
Uh, Perception OP Rogue counter! Shadowmeld also improves Stealth, giving Nelf druids/rogues an edge anywhere where stealth counts. 
---
Also, Blood Craze? I think Berserker is the one you're talking about.
---
BOO
---
Is there evidence that people could take 3 full raid groups into another factions city on vanilla and not lag?
---
Oooo! What made you pick a shaman over a druid? And how are you dealing with the shaman‚Äôs insane amount of buttons?
---
Why does it matter if i have 1000 gold from farming 20 hours or 1000 gold from buying from a seller? 
---
You don't get to judge where I spend my time.
---
I play on the biggest German Server and for me its very profitable
---
Yeah, they‚Äôve always said next patch and we assumed a patch would be with a phase but they can just ‚ÄúLoL button‚Äù it all.  Who knows when it will be needed.
---
never pve to pvp
---
Are you able to not have the game affect your life or your family negatively? If so you are a functioning addict. It's good to know yourself. I need to limit myself too and realise that my job and relationship should always go first no matter what. Whatever time is left I can play.
---
The grace period should only be 30 seconds to a minute. No more.
---
For random d/c only. So, people sitting at their computer actively playing can reconnect immediately without the need of a "timer" to keep track of grace periods.
---
Im the opposite irl i just dont spread my toxicity in chat
---
I mean i could see it being a benefit for pug groups but not guilds.  You do get something with standard dkp guilds, you're getting dkp.  Which arguably is more valuable than gold.
---
The issue with GDKP is like the op says, it encourages people to farm gold outside of the raid and then pay for their upgrades.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing in pugs but in guilds this seems pretty damaging to me.  I mean for example imagine your guild had someone with lionheart helm plans in it.  That person is going to get all the loot because they're rich as fuck after charging 100g+ fees for crafting this rare helm which is BiS pretty much till naxx.
---
It's called iMorph. Technically against the TOS but blizzard kinda ignores it.
---
Head over to the wowhead page of the pattern and find the buy macro in the comments. I followed that guy‚Äòs tips and got it after 30 minutes (and bought 2 of the other patterns before the bag pattern appeared).
---
I transferred to a low pop and its now high pop.
---
It doesn't matter honestly. They can change it whenever they want, and they do as clearly evidenced here (unless you are completely wrong, which is probably the case). 
---
The system removed someone that wasn't playing to allow people in that are waiting to play, but can't, because you're sitting afk not doing anything but taking up a spot. 
---
Working. As. Intended.
---
Spoken like someone without family, kids, friends, or any other commitment.
---
Back in the day, I'd do a few BGs per week and reached Stone Guard (rank 6). So probably right around there.
---
This is exactly what I'm talking about. You reject the solution to your problem once again. It's not the same as a "please do not press" button. They are literally telling you to press it if you don't want to experience these problems. You'd rather stay on an overpopulated realm and complain than escaping it.
---
Like, the reason why the servers lag with 200+ players in a condensed area has been explained a hundred times and it always gets downvoted. You don't want to be happy with the product. Just admit it already.
---
Same with skeram
---
Hang on, you have 2 level 60
---
priests in classic? Please explain.
---
Some people are just really slow in dungeons. Healers drinking when on 75% mana crying oom.   
---
DPS lagging 10 seconds behind the tank every time because they seem to spend forever looting bodies.   
---
Tanks just generally slacking about doing ready checks before every pull.
---
Silithus*
---
He probably didn't train it.
---
Had an analogous experience in the same dungeon where I kept telling a lvl 24 mage to decurse party members. After asking him three times in three different ways he finally spilled the beans that he didn't have it. 
---
Remove Lesser Curse is a lvl 18 spell. You can't tell me he didn't train for 6 levels. And didn't bother to train one of the most important spells in the game. Might just have been a new player I guess.
---
No. They have no obligation to invite you to a raid, especially if you aren't bringing what they need. You should find another guild that needs what you have.
---
I don't think even 10% of fairbanks guilds are there...not even 5%
---
except for huge queues every evening.
---
This also wasn't at 8pm, I would have been sitting afk in the wagon.
---
I'm a HPriedt and I'm farming the Lashers in DM:E, which nets about 30-35gph with Herbalism.
---
You need around 6.1k mana for this to go smooth tho, I just bought some Int greens off the AH.
---
When I'm not doing that I'm doing Trio DM:E Jump Runs. Those are hit and miss tho as they heavily depend on getting Crystals off the Thorium veins. Jump Runs range from 20-100 gph in my experience (Crystals are 40g on my server).
---
Otherwise I'm fishing Wintersquid in Aszhara which would be around 20-30 gph if I sold the squids. You could also get Golden Pearls from there which are 60g on my server.
---
&gt; Ranged DPS are generally preferred
---
Tell that to the hordes of fury warriors in every raid. My experience is that melee dps dominates
---
That‚Äôs just a macro. You have to smash three buttons repeatedly in this sequence: interact (to open the window), buy-macro, escape (to close the window).
---
That's not the macro we talked about. See where he mentions keyboard? That's a reference to software that many keyboards have that can string together many actions into one button press.
---
I wasn't talking about the game when I said "bigger Problems than that in 2019" I know... Most your life probably is the game. 
---
But not everyone lives in the world of warcraft.
---
See for example the trade war between China und USA that is certainly a bigger Problem.
---
also:
---
The Point I made was that People now suddenly feel like it is a Problem that Phase 2 Comes closer. 
---
and
---
My relatives don't work at Blizzard
---
That is actually a couple of Points made. I just wonder that I have to rewrite them for you to understand.
---
Hope this makes it easier :*
---
&gt;Edit: just got in after queue and got killed multiple times by a lvl 60 mage outside gadgetzan. can't even go try and get giant eggs to get my artisan cooking. Looks like I'll pass for WoW this week until the pvp action dies down
---
I found that the drop rate for the eggs on the Tanaris vultures was relatively bad, plus there's not too many vultures. I got my eggs relatively quickly on the Hinterlands owlbeasts.
---
An outright ban might be an overstatement, but you could definitely get penalized for it, and would almost certainly lose all the gold you stole.
---
Blizz doesn't like scammers. Their policy is that they will probably not return stolen goods, with some extreme exceptions. But they definitely punish the scammers if they are reported.
---
Are you having a hard time holding aggro? If not, keep the mitigation gear. If yes, then pick up some threat gear. 
---
I tank as bear and I have my mitigation set as well as a threat set. I mix and match according to the occasion. In MC I'm wearing straight mitigation. While my initial aggro is not as good, once I get a few hits on me I'll never lose aggro and the dps know they must give me a moment on the pull as everyone will know who jumped the gun after whatever they ripped off of me puts them in the ground in one swing.
---
However during our guild UBRS runs, I'm often the only true tank and I solo tank until trash before The Beast when the heartiest dps warrior puts on a shield when needed. In that case I know my healers can keep up no problem so I swap to my threat set. The reduction in mitigation combined with holding more mobs on me results in more rage and even more threat.  Yes I take more damage, but the healers can concentrate on me alone and things aren't as hectic, resulting in a smoother run overall.
---
Tl;dr 
---
Por que no las dos?
---
Someone suggested it be 30 seconds.
---
I realise it now.
---
These replies are coming from a group of people with literally no family, friends, or other things to take care of.
---
Are you hearing yourselves? 30 seconds??
---
World is already so crowded, there are no good farming spots to farm alone, bots shouldnt be running like they are right now.
---
Warlock! They control so much of the battlefield it's uncanny, fear, seduce/spell lock &amp; dispell, curse of tongues, curse of exhaustion, DoTs to annoy people, mega Shadow Bolt crits, healthstones, nice burst with shadowburn.
---
Disclaimer: I haven't played a mage but they're super strong for  high damaging spells and good burst. Sheep to pyro &gt; fire blast is pretty good too.
---
Imo, warlocks for world pvp survivability and mage for less survivability but higher vurst.
---
The fact that he immediately died makes this 1000x funnier
---
Alot of us are in the same boat. It's hard not to feel that you need to rush but you really don't. The en game will be there when we are ready and there will be plenty of people at the same stage.
---
i really like the way it always seems to have 2 or 3 globetrotting quests chains running simultaneously and will either weave them in with regular quests or while grabbing flight paths that you'll need later on.
---
When do I need to switch to sword and board for tanking dungeons? Once PvP goes live I'll be doing a lot more dungeons to get to sixty (at 53 right now) and I wasn't sure if using a 2 hander is viable anymore.
---
Honestly I just let them die. I don't feel like having to drink more and having everyone wait for just me to drink, because I have to throw heals to some shitty lock who doesn't know how to life drain and cost me time and money to drink.
---
Not the kind of macro that's being talked about here
---
Yeah it's super annoying.  A number of times I've been stuck in combat because someone's killing a mob that I never even touched because I buffed the guy *before* he was in combat.  Buffing before someone enters combat should not *sometimes* put you in combat with his mob.  But it seems it does, intermittently.
---
So your commitments that require you to afk (and trying to avoid the queue by 'creative use of game mechanics') should override other players' commitments that are patiently waiting in the queue for afk dodgers like yourself to disconnect so they can actually use their limited time available to play the game?
---
Spoken like a true selfish player.
---
Druid was fun for me until mid twenties when I realized that I didnt havea  need to go get any cool weapons and my weapon was essentially useless / a stat stick. I dont have a problem with that design wise its just not my flavor. I like upgrading my weapon and that changing my playstyle.
---
How I deal with shaman - I have a Razer mouse with 12 buttons on the side of it and have a decent amount of hot keys. Most of it is down ranked heals etc my normal rotation including buffs and totems is maybe 5-6+ totems? I dont use a ton of macros.
---
Its not too bad tbh once you get in the rythm of where your interrupt is etc and the burst damage is nice. At level 41 my chainlightning crits for over 650 and my lightning bolt crits over 400 so I can deal ball park 1200 damage inside of like 3-4 seconds fairly easily its super fun. 
---
and up until then I was rocking windfury which is HELLA fun.

Work Work Work Work Work

Ah, yes. Priests. Good thing they're good at what they're supposed to do.
---
Bet he was the only reser too lol
---
Ah I see. Missed that part where he specifically maps that to some keyboard action.
---
You could have said something or traded it to a melee. Dont be a number in a guild, speak up your mind within reason, makes for a healthier guild and if they dont like it time to move on.
---
The best possible timeline
---
Nah, it's the fact that my group don't have their hearth set to kargath, so I get to brd early, and don't want to just sit inside the instance, also if I don't kill the alliance they'll sit outside the instance and kill my group I'm waiting on. When my group all gets there we go inside and when we leave dungeon there's normally an alliance group there. Gotta group up and clear em out so we can reset in peace.
---
How many runs will you need with another system to get mageblade though? I think it's pretty contested, so rolling will take a while and if it's loot council I doubt you will be given loot priority if you aren't one of the hardcore players.
---
Or you "eat me" eat a certain type of fish ;-)
---
Tank strat live and reserve first orb or flask recipe... or both ;)
---
me2, pocket tank best tank.
---
I want you to be my healer.
---
I prefer not to, i'd rather save my Global cooldown on an emergency shield.
---
A grace period is fine. 30 seconds is ludicrous.
---
It's called 'grace' period for a reason. There HAS to be some allowance for personal things.
---
This 30 second thing is legendary, lol.
---
I've seen the term "gold bid" also used, which I think is more fitting
---
Good to know. A few IRL friends will probably group on and off for the first week while the hype is up, but beyond that I'm sure my play will be much more casual.
---
Imagine being so shit you try to bleed a stone rather than smash it smh
---
Not understanding how you have unlimited mana.
---
Hunters can get rhokdelar from Ancient Petrified Leaf so they dont care about that afaik.
---
It's always been this way, no one wants to leave massive pop servers, they want OTHER people to leave.  If you are on a server with 20k, no one wants to go to one with 6k.  The people bitching just want about 3k OTHER people to leave so they can stay.
---
These are also the same people who specifically roll on already huge servers and bitch about how many people there are.
---
Gnomeregan üòØ
---
It's one of the funniest instances ever created.  
---
I could never find any hordes who wanted to go so I had to roll an an alliance alt to experience it again.
---
It was the best solution at the time. They gave ample warning ahead of launch. You should have organised beforehand in such a way that you'd transfer or reroll if they opened new servers after launch. That's what I did. YOUR FAULT.
---
Surely cath is better?
---
I bet mages like that system. Also great for alts that still need gold. For endgame raiding charakters what is there to buy with thousands of gold anyways? I would prefer to get loot based on me showing up.
---
The Flays definitely help shorten that! Might be a bit over 3 minutes but even so, the drops are worth and it‚Äôs dead easy. SW:P and flay when he‚Äôs running away. Not much to dispel from this boss, or not much worth dispelling!
---
I used to think you had to pull that pack of imps to the right of his area, and that made me want to skip him. But once someone showed me how to do it without pulling any packs, I never skip him. (I do still need my Hide mats though so it‚Äôs extra worth for me)
---
BRD and onwards IMO, things start to hurt.
---
Healer here.
---
Because the goblins in gadgetstan are really far away from thorium point. Hence the stretch joke
---
That's a sick Pi cluster.
---
There is no other capital city with all the main stuff so close to each other. Anvil - AH - bank - mailbox - Inn within seconds.
---
A few 1v1s for 15min isn't 30+ people vs only me hard camping enterance for hours on end tho
---
Exactly:)
---
In our guild we dont do council and use dkp and hunters didnt even need the bow because they can get rhokdelar easily.
---
pvp servers are great when you can play 13 hours a day. if you work 13 hours a day, not so much.
---
Mobs hitting me after I Cheap Shot them - is that a Vanilla bug, or new Classic bug?
---
But you can buy from them.
---
It takes 14 AP (that's 7 strength) to increase your weapon damage by 1. Hit % will increase your damage and threat by that much %, roughly. So the question is which is greater: 3% dps (from the 3% hit) or the flat weapon damage from losing the strength.
---
4 pieces of Valor will give you the 40 AP bonus, which is \~3 weapon damage.
---
oh, did baby get ganked?
---
What spec you running and what weapon are you using? I am pre-raid bis except for couple of pieces, orc fury warr with DW + BoneSlicing. Do you go Arms with a 2h? Do you full clear or just skip as much as possible and get to the boss? Thanks for the answer!
---
I think there are two variants that I can see. If you were going with the shadowcraft way, than it takes into account the 4 piece set bonus, which is very similar to what you could get with the mismash of other items in those slots. I personally would still go after the non shadowcraft items, but shadowcraft is more easy to obtain.
---
Yeah, love my lock. Great farming and little gear competition as well.
---
Druids suck in the sense that if you go in by yourself and don't group up you'll have a sucky time. If you're good at the class it won't be THAT bad but it'll still be sucky. If you come up against a good team that can PvP well it'll be shit.
---
Druids shine in groups - pocket heals with good mobility. If you end up PvPing with others then you'll have a blast.
---
I'm on US-ateish.   being 30% ish horde pop i feel your pain.  trying to get 2 yeti horns? just muscle past the 30 ally farming the yeti.  need to kill a couple of pathfinder fubolg.  ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.  drop the quest. you're never complething it.  moving on to western pleauge lands? quest kill x undead to get x tokens? oh wait 3 mages camping each farm aoe farming em ... well shit i guess i'll have to go find something to grind my last 2 levels.
---
Warrior + any healer works fine.
---
Hell warlocks can solo jump runs.
---
I wish I knew, but honestly if you ever seen the usual Alliance slaughter around BRM it kinda makes sense. It's hard to judge these things solely on perception
---
True, I had sm dagger until witchblade because I couldn't be bothered running Mara for the sword, but yes you are correct.
---
Must be really hard for your to understand that people have different preferences
---
&gt;GIVE US FACTION SPECIFIC QUEUES
---
YES!! This guy knows what he's talking about..  
---
&gt; **AND ENFORCE A 50/50 concurrent online balance** 
---
Oh.. nevermind.
---
Not really smart of OP to post a video of him using model editing software ON WoW's Sub-Reddit, good way of getting banned.
---
Heal me oh wise one.
---
The community had the ultimate day through a survey we hosted a while back. That is how we formed the level of rules enforcement we have not, and what has led our decision making.
---
60 + some gear.  The more gear the better, but I wouldn't try duo without at least both being near full prebis or better.  But you can trio quite happily without good gear.
---
Cool, thanks for the detailed description. I think ill try jt although prices are lower in my server
---
I can't say this applies to every server, but one of the last census data showed pve servers largely alliance biased and pvp servers largely horde biased.
---
This makes sense because people who are aiming to be more pvp oriented are more likely to go horde as they have better racials for it   Those people who care less about pvp probably go alliance and don't want to bother getting ranked so they go Alliance pve.
---
Get a high pop or full PvE server then in your timeZone

China farmers were very inexperienced in Vanilla, as most people were. They had no real clue how to play the game and played mostly hunter because it was the easiest to play.
---
Nowadays, with all the guides, tutorials and general knowledge, china farmers are way more skilled than in 2006. And no china farmer would accept getting ganked over and over and over because it completely screws with their gold/hour ratio. They wouldn't necessarily fight back but they'd change their location for sure.
---
It's mostly just bots running around nowadays. Way more effective than hiring people.
---
Also, China Numba Wan, Blizz did nothing wrong, Hong Kong is fake news!
---
Heartseeker is heavy on the Alliance side but I haven‚Äôt had trouble finding PUGs or people to quest with. I‚Äôve heard that horde guilds have been transferring in to even the playing field. Most alliance here are pretty bad at pvp and the few horde here are ruthless. 
---
Despite the fact that I‚Äôm on the dominant alliance side, I still get ganked daily in contested zones
---
I made a lvl 1 orc, came there (he dinged 2) and logging it before work in early morning on weekdays. Sometimes there‚Äôs some sickhead spamming it, so I just logout. Sometimes I can just casually rightclick a recipe without any macroses.
---
So I had one for me, one for a friend of mine and sold over 10 during last month. 
---
Sometimes people kill me there. Sometimes they aren‚Äôt getting killed by guards after that, so I just report them. This way of making gold is too easy to ignore )
---
Firstly, Im a combat, sword weilding rogue. Still dump on hoes.
---
Secondly, this is Vanilla wow. If you are on a PvP server and you keep making excuses about your gear or spec not being suited for PvP, then idk why you're on a PvP server.  You can have a PvP spec and still down bosses in Vanilla wow. That's what people had to do on a PvP server. If you are on some RP server then i really can't speak to that because those are for boring jabronis. 
---
To your point about, "don't plan to get hit", I was just in UBRS last night and a leather wearing, epic weilding fury warrior was still getting out dps'd by a level 58 rogue, then when our tank died while the final boss was at low health he taunted (like a warrior should) and got two shotted lol.
---
I brought it up and he left on the final boss. Said, "You got two shotted in your dumbass leather, but hey at least you can optimize your dps and still get outdone by this 58 rogue.". He rage quit lol
---
You need decent gear to be effective.
---
It's hard to quantify exactly, but each level will make you \~5% stronger than the level before, and every 5/10 levels makes an even bigger jump, due to reaching a new tier in your talent tree.
---
No sleep until you bind your abilities.
---
healing logs are pointless but you can still compare your dps to other guilds.
---
Mages have shields and ice block to help with survivability though. Warlocks feel more like a support class and seem to work better in group pvp?
---
Sounds like you need a guild with better raid times for you then.
---
Any other dungeon grind that are worth it or should I continue questing?
---
This is classic, it's not Vanilla
---
Thiccccc
---
...and when people do not interrupt the Arcane Bolt casts by those bloody Dwarf casters (arcanists?). Rule of thumb, interrupt every arcane school spell cast in any dungeon.
---
That's why you have a WeakAura that shows your mana gem cooldown when you can't.
---
You said minimalistic, people are giving you advice on how to do even more and you dismiss them lol
---
Saying WA is ugly/horrible/unnecessary is short-sighted. It can do whatever and look like however you want it to look like.
---
It shows you the reset of raids you have completed or been saved too.   MC is every tuesday.   Ony is every 5 days so that varies.   Not sure what your question is...  ZG and AQ will be every 3 days, so that will vary too.
---
14 years of blizzard having a hand-off approach. They need to get their hands dirty and do the needful.
---
You still fail to understand the core problem. If you get stranded on Island for 2 years that 30 day stockpile is not going to keep you alive. 
---
Intelligent people like to consider future problems before shit is in the pants.
---
actually yes, but I honestly wonder why you know since we call DPS "DD's" here :P
---
No, I can handle managing a video game, gambling, alcohol 
---
...But I wish you well watching TV or whatever you plan on doing for fun from now on!
---
Can you link your Bearform&gt;Bearform macro? The issue with mine is I exit bear into human and then back into bear, it's bad
---
Depends, it's not uncommon for RL to take that for himself since managing a GDKP run is a pretty big responsibility.
---
I take this as a compliment. Thanks.
---
Grob has free transfers away as well
---
The point of the post is you can‚Äôt take that option if you are on the underpopulated faction. It is disabled for alliance on horde favoured servers such as Stalagg.
---
So you get the queue but have no option but to wait.
---
I expect my healers to dps
---
no IIRC guards doing shit at LHC didn't get added till the naxx patch if at all
---
I get these whispers all the time without posting anything
---
I enjoy that you probably died for fucking off in chat and making fun of your own typos while you are typoing to not die while playing. Lmfao. That is the story of my entire WoW career.
---
Keyrings are too confusing for new players.
---
Don't call yourself intelligent. It's a never ending resource in a never ending game, it will always be available. God forbid you played the game when black lotus was bop.
---
Sure if they only let *you* do it, I'm super down! But Heartseeker is a bad server with heavy alliance dominance. If a lot of people left that server, it would be tons of alliance with a lot less horde, which would absolutely hurt Faerlina's faction balance. The alliance presence on Heartseeker is actually quite large at this point. Believe there are almost as many alliance guilds in MC on Heartseeker as there is on Faerlina with both factions combined.
---
Flying mounts negates faction imbalance though because there is no world pvp.
---
Fair enough
---
My bro rolls full plate, arms warrior, and just rolls around dropping allies all day in Burning Steppes and Un'Goro crater. He laughs extra hard at other warriors in leathers and some with MF daggers! 
---
ON A PVP SERVER?!?! lol
---
Dang creepy rudy and his fakes
---
Mograine is pretty cool
---
Your absolute best exp would be a spellcleave jail area farm, besides that you could maybe find a quest group for the beginning area which would be worth it once. Otherwise, you are better off questing or aoe grinding.
---
I just wish someone had had timestamps on because that would have made it even better. Lol.
---
If you kept up with the game during development at all you knew there were changes. Hell, even playing the game you can tell things changed so don't cry about "no changes" when changes happened before you even started playing
---
It depends on your +healing total and your healing style. Experiment and find one that fits your needs. I almost exclusively use heal3. GH4 for big dips and anything in between means I toss in a renew between heal3's. If I get more +healing from raid gear, I'll go for heal2 in dungeons.
---
I look at my quest log and work out a place to go quest. 
---
I fly to that place. 
---
I decide I don't want to quest there. 
---
Fly to another quest hub.
---
Time is up, log out for the day.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
You want to set up mouse over macros so you can just click portraits to cast your heal spells. Clique is good for this too for your mouse button binds
---
Did you not read all of it?
---
Shoutout to Exiles/SoA! How are you guys liking Deviate Delight?
---
You can start doing BRD Cell farms at 52, you could do 52-60 there. It's about 80k xp/h and really afk.
---
I did not know they drop tyvm
---
Hello mage here i just hit lv 60 yesterday. I am on a pve server and i am tailor/enchant. I looked online to find gold making guide using AoE but id like to ask here if anyone could share a nice place i could  farm with a decent gold/hour. Thanks!
---
That's even worse because if they used a 1-4pc Expose Armor, you can't use Sunder because a 1 stack is considered a less "Strong debuff active", so you'll never be able to reach 5 sunder. And since they used a 1-4 EA, everyone loses DPS.
---
I don't think it matters what original vanilla had back in the day. What I know is that these dead servers like AR, EF, etc. are bores to play on. Difficult to find groups, bare auction houses, few guilds. Tired of people on these servers trying to get people to transfer to them so they don't have to re roll.
---
*BLEEP BLOOP BLEEP* "I REQUIRE OPTIMAL GEAR TO PERFORM IN GAME." *BLEEP BLOOP BLEEP*
---
&gt;This part makes sense to put with the regular functions of the bag,
---
We can all armchair quarterback their code. and say what makes sense to us a developers. 
---
But having seen "contractor code" in the real world, and having seen Deadlines being hit via "fireman coders" I've personally seen a ton or crap get "grandfathered" into production, with no management willing to spend the time to correct these issues instead they just pay the maintenance tax every time the code has to be touched again, eventually they morph into a gigantic mess that everyone dreads touching.
---
**Fireman coder**, Like a fire fighter, they come in spew stuff everywhere to put out the immediate fire, leaving behind a gigantic mess that a pain to clean up.
---
If only Activision was a game developer and not a game rehasher. You guys remember the golden days, there was a company named after a severe snowstorm, they used to make games. Those were the days, fellow boomers..
---
I don't think it's worth going out of your way to find BIS for non-60.  You cna use Atlas Loot to check for potential upgrades.  Same with gearing for PVP, not worth it unless you are making a twink.  Just focus on getting easy upgrades and leveling imo
---
That's not my face your licking. ;)
---
then its oceanic players that are to blame.. not enough of them!
---
*loads up in stam...dies anyway*
---
Well read again all your posts on this matter. You very well knew the issue but wanted to milk attention and boast about your stockpiles as if it was your son graduating college. 
---
I play this game more than most but I am not arrogant and close minded enough to think that what happens to suit me is good for the game in general.
---
There are some, yes. I got a 70 on one of the popular ones, but it's quite disgusting. Random idiots are running around with glaives or full t6/arena equivalent gear, because they can simply buy it with real money. It kind of ruins everything.
---
Wait, so is the fishing tourney in the game now?  You two are contradicting each other.
---
Conspiracy time: the Hunter class leader or an officer on the loot council with a hunter friend wanted to give you the bow, in order to lower your priority for Rhokdelar.
---
Fem troll priest, also usually stoned.
---
Wasnt that around the same time that the keyring was taken away, though?  I could have sworn the word at the time was that they removed the keyring to use it for extra bag slots.
---
Look up zf graveyard farm
---
From the blue post
---
&gt;Guards will now correctly be more willing to assist players in PvP combat who have Friendly or higher standing with them. However, they will continue to not assist players with Neutral standing.
---
which means he's spending huge amounts of gold on the gear and then that gold is split with everyone in the raid and everyone else waits just a little longer for their loot
---
honestly, even with my guild's DKP system, you're better off getting some of your loot last anyway, by the time no one else needs it you spend almost nothing on it
---
I see what you did there
---
Classic is the journey but for me The Burning Crusade is the goal
---
I'm a pocket healer/(bad) pocket tank. When not in dungeons, I play cat a lot. I'll switch back to healer if needed, or bear if I'm playing with another healer. One of my favorite things to do as a druid is the heal random people when I'm walking by them. Oh this low level is having a hard time and pulled a few mobs? I'll just heal you and stay nearby to make sure you don't die. Oh I'm just questing alone and someone died in front of me? Rebirth my dude, no need to corpse walk. Walking by? Mark of the Wild for you!
---
Finding spots inside of a town that outranges guards and allows you to farm players was against TOS, this is a fix to help prevent that. Outside of city walls doesn't matter, fight all you want. Devs just confirmed in that list that the intention of goblin cities is if you PVP inside, you either kill, die, or escape. Never "oh, nobody saw you so no crime" this isn't red dead, this is WoW
---
GDKP is standard in Korean servers !?!?!??! Time to pick up Korean!!! GDKP on feenix was by far the most fun I ever had in pve, you could literally make crazy builds like shockadin by grinding gold for zandalar hero charm, or actually get gold for raiding which was super fun. I tried to make gdkp in a few private servers but nobody in EU likes it. It's such an amazing system!
---
Because priest is op af. Unless we're doing it wrong, it's easy.
---
Thanks a lot for the advice. I'll pass it along to our melee!
---
I know this will take us down the slippery slope of QoL improvements to what retail has done to itself but a key shouldn‚Äôt take up the same bag space as Onyxia‚Äôs Head.
---
I didn't do many so I don't have a good average and I still die sometimes. About 22-25 gold. 16 minutes for a run + 2min to reset the dungeon.
---
I don't know if I'd say it "didn't age well" so much as that it wasn't clear from the start. They clearly were using their internal jargon and that leaked out, as patch to them means something very different than it does to most people.
---
Good to use b4 the pull but priests have similar buff so no need to keep it going entire fight.
---
They are just silly to me. They look like an entire subgroup of wow players that chose the wrong character. Like a hunter who never summons their pet and just rolls in and melees. lol Like, dude you should start a warrior
---
Yeah pretty much same.  It's not this game that's the problem it's us.
---
Yeah damn those prices are crazy compared to my server, wouldn't be viable here. Squid and eel both only go for 15s per 1, essence of water is is like 8g...
---
LMFAO pet dies in 2 secs in group PvP . They‚Äôre useless in WPvP unless solo 1v1. Even then they‚Äôre brittle AF.
---
1-3 are all personal preference. I use ALT+ for all my healing spells. 
---
4. Set a mouseover macro for all your healing spells, makes switching heal targets a breeze. 
---
5. Yea that‚Äôs about it. 60% throw your big heal and chill for mana regen. Then do it again at 60%.  Any decent DPS can be kept safe with renew.
---
I abandon mine without second thought like a sociopath
---
Don't want to discourage you but I'm still waiting for that magical night where my daughter sleeps through ...
---
She's 16month old.
---
Keeping my thumbs pressed for you though ^^
---
Sell tanking service. You might need to be pretty geared and skilled for people to buy it though.
---
It had nothing to do with layers. Faerlina was at 2 layers before and after the spawnrate changed.
---
People just thought they were related because both changes happened to several servers at the same time.
---
No, it got queues.
---
Get herby/mining or find a healer/tank with it and start jumping or be a real hero and solo it as a crit chicken we gather 90 dreamfoil 60 groms ans 30 ghost 4 crystals on average for an evening jumping.
---
It‚Äôs not limited to games
---
No we aren't they said it should have came sooner, I listed the reasons has for delaying it.
---
Saw someone else say that everything but PvE to PvP was available, yes you should be able to escape the gankfest that is coming...
---
You blame me, but not the horde deathsquads that like to camp 40+ zones with the purpose to stop people from lvling, or the lvl 60 allies that dont do anything about it. /shrug
---
Standing next to guards didn't matter, what mattered was the attackers position and level. If they're 60, they've got plenty of space in there that out ranged the guards and allowed basically farming of players.
---
That's reportable actually
---
Blizzard said even the lowest ooo server is like a vanilla high pop server
---
But they did spend the time and money to fix it and only initially released it to people using authenticators.
---
The work around they used to add additional backpack slots was a major hackfix. It doesn't actually increase your backpack size, it literally adds an invisible bag with 4 slots and then adds these slots to your backpack visually. But for the sake of the games code, those slots are an entirely different entity. The game desperately needs an entire rewrite but doing so would cost money and activision blizzard isn't about to spend resources on anything that's not actively making them more money.
---

Thanks that‚Äôs what I was thinking. Just weird how recc it is in the cookie cutter builds. Was it stacking multiple times at once? Cause yea, 3% of my current 4.5k health over 6s is 22.5hp/s. That‚Äôs sooo lame
---
&gt;they have bad PVP racials (compared to the Horde)
---
alliance has better pvp racials imo :x
---
fearward escape artist and stoneform are S tier in every aspect of the game.
---
i think the horde bias stems from a favoured race fantasy elements.
---
Here are a few tips 
---
1. Down rank spells, the reason behind this is making sure your not overhealing and causing unnecessary agro because threat will be an issue enemies do not like it when you crit a heal.
---
2. Get a threat meter addon, and get situated with using fade at the right time when you get it.
---
3. Spirit will be your top stat ‚Äúat least for priests‚Äù
---
With spellpower and intellect, mp5 ain‚Äôt bad either but def go for spirit.
---
4. The five second rule. If you stop casting for five seconds you‚Äôll gain more regeneration so learn to take advantage of this when you can
---
5. If your pugging be prepared for bad groups in which players are going to die. Dont be too hard on yourself
---
*glares at fury warriors in stratholme*
---
unfortunately you dont even have to try to get the recipe while hammering those three keys with your fingers. i did that too first but its exhausting :D
---
Not at all pointless. You can catch inefficient mana use, overheating, check for proper down ranking, CD management, etc.
---
If you get your guild in good habits during easy content, as content gets more difficult they will be better prepared.
---
Brd aoe runs
---
The T1 gloves give a +2% hit chance bonus (same as the devilsaur set). I get more agility and attack power from the T1 gloves and T0 pants, but I lose about 1.5% crit.
---
The inside of the cage is for PVP. What people were doing is position to attack players outside the cage from inside the cage. This has been fixed....I hope
---
I started playing classic a month after release because I heard rumors of BC and WOTLK. 
---
I think it would be a good idea to keep classic and be able to copy your character to BC. This way you can still have both.
---
But how come the servers were fine before? They remove layers in skeram weeks ago and I never once experience a queue. Last night all of a sudden I had to wait 45 minutes to log in. It doesn't make sense unless of course they lower the server capacity across the board to make people xfer but if this is the case why don't do this weeks ago? Blizzard is shoving phase 2 down on us but they have no preparation whatsoever. They should relay delay this.
---
yeah but u need a shitload of int for a small amount of crit so it's not as important.
---
I was in the same guild for since Vanilla and we used zero-sum tier-specific DKP. (Which was fairly good but had its own issues.)
---
Not to mention that Azshara is generally a highly contested zone for resources. Obviously YMMV.
---
In Wrath, this happened all the time. You'd bid on items and highest bid wins. All the gold is split at the end.
---
It was great until Blizzard started banning the raid leaders due to suspicions that they were bots. Trading to much gold sends an alarm off.
---
So it died off after that
---
It's a good pvp racial because it helps you avoid pvp? ü§î
---
Interesting, I had heard of it and wasn't sure how it worked.  I can see the advantages.  Probably nothing goes to waste.  Not sure I like that it probably promotes RMT.
---
I picked the newest server that was available on launch day. I reserved a name originally on Herod, and then I deleted those and reserved names on Skeram because I was told that Herod would be a bad time and then I moved to Incendius day of launch because I was told Skeram was going to be a bad time. I made several changes of my committed server prior to launch. I just don't understand how people can view Blizzard as guiltless in this. I did what Blizzard wanted up until I created my character, the problem was they totally botched the number of servers prior to launch. If Blizzard had launched with 15 or 20 US PvP servers to choose from this problem would be totally different. 
---
I'm not refusing to transfer due to fear of dead servers or because of spite directed Blizzard. I'm not transferring because I don't want to see the raiding guild that I've spent two months building regress or fracture. I don't want my second raid team to end up 20 members short and resort to PUGing to fill.
---
And this is coming from the perspective of a server that by all accounts has it pretty good compared to some others.
---
There *are* players that deserve more blame than on this others, but this was ultimately caused by Blizzard's mistakes.
---
Also I apologise for making my first post as accusatory and aggressive as it was. It's just very frustrating to me that so many people are blaming the players for this when they're being offered a crappy solution to a problem that was caused by Blizzard's lack of foresight. If adequate options were given at the start and people were still complaining because they went out of their way to choose the streamer server I'd agree with you, but that isn't the case for many players.
---
A lot of those sites aren't actually selling gold they are trying to get you to input your credit card information into their website.
---
First off, I‚Äôm not one of these people you‚Äôre claiming are desperate for Classic to fail. I love it, and hope it succeeds. So kindly lick my taint, you overreactive shitbox.
---
Second, most games go through a ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù phase  where they see very little drop in player activity, before any issues players have settle in. However, that timeframe is a little vague, as it‚Äôs different for each game. Some games have practically zero (fallout 76), some last until the first major update (Destiny 1/2), and some fall in between.
---
Classic is hard to tell due to it being a re-release and the weight it carries. Most players are still working toward level cap or are freshly capped, so they mundane grinds/farming hasn‚Äôt really hit them. We may not see the drop off for a few more weeks, or even until P3. This isn‚Äôt moving a goalpost for the expectation of failure, it‚Äôs simply waiting until the sharp drop in activity (this doesn‚Äôt mean crippling to the game, just a drop. All game have this, before you get defensive).
---
You also assume many players have played private servers since vanilla went away. But with the numbers of players given by those servers and the numbers that can be safely assumed came back for Classic, most didn‚Äôt play private. Even with that, private servers had massive spikes in concurrent players with sharp drop offs, which Classic hasn‚Äôt had. So private servers, as usual, are fairly crap to use as a comparison to real Classic.
---
Alright, great. Thank you !
---
Yeah I have to recant all my comments about it being in phase 2 as well. : (
---
That's okay!  I was just wanting to make sure.
---
Yes, you have to trade the items first. There's no other way to do it, but Blizzard would also punish you if you tried to take the items, as that would be a scam, with proof in the logs, so no one's really dumb enough to try it. It can feel kinda weird though - anytime someone asks me to make them an Arcanite Rod (150-180g in mats) I'm a little nervous, and I'm the one receiving the items.
---
You have separate tanks on garr and adds, and the adds don't actually hit that hard as long as tank wears mitigation gear.
---
Losing melees on those stupid elemental trash packs would certainly suck, though.
---
Threat meters are weird because everyone needs the same one for accuracy. So if you get one and its not working as you want it to this would be why.
---
LBRS is 56, UBRS is 58. They're the same entrance/portal. When you walk in to the portal, there are stairs on the left leading up, blocked by a gate; this leads to UBRS. There are stairs leading down on the right; this is LBRS.
---
The change was implemented yesterday. I've already heard some people saying it no longer works but I haven't been in WS so I do not know
---
nah you would just use some macros and addons to make it a bit easier. For example you could make Q your "earth totem" button. With macros you can make it so:
---
hitting Q drops 1 earth totem
---
Shift + Q drops a different earth totem
---
Control + Q a different one
---
Alt + q different from that.
---
So for 1 button you could bind 4 spells to it. For me - I use bartender so I have all of them individually mapped on a bar but use the same bind method (I literally use that Q set up for my earth totems I just dont use macros to do it).
---
its honestly not to bad!
---
How does paladin?
---
You're not thinking about it logically. All he has to do is click a couple of buttons and the item will be converted into an epic BoE that he then does equip. Just because someone else can equip it without clicking on any extra buttons it doesn't mean they're a more worthy recipient.
---
What gear have you got? My warlock his 60 two days ago and has a few preBiS blues/shadoweave green. Not sure if I'll be able to handle the last boss yet..
---
They don't have financial support from Activision, they create financial support for Activision. They have spent as little as possible on classic wow and it shows.
---
Salad bakers didn‚Äôt have their top melee dpser for their speed run. Wonder hw big of a difference if made on time.
---
None of what I said was misinformation. It was an opinion based off experiences and game mechanics. They have no aoe, their main nuke has increased threat, and the healing done is also a lot of threat.  I didn't say it was unworkable, I just said it's annoying to deal with as a tank. I'd rather not bother if I have a choice.
---
I have some honour still sir I‚Äôll play my UD mage to farm for my pally glory
---
Keyring is from vanilla. And guard behaviour was bugged, just like DM mob behaviour is bugged and so was Onyxia. This type of patch is np.
---
I was mocking but for example a hunter with prowled pet &amp; shadowmeld can ambush any solo player that tries to ninja WG, AV, AB flag.
---
It's not like 2005. Its patch 1.12 it's more like 2006 the final stages of vanilla where everything had been figured out. 2005 was fresh newbs everywhere you could actually find a black lotus on the ground and nobody knew what the heck a tiny crimson whelping pet was. Totally different atmosphere and community from that of 1.12.
---
1.12 is where everything started to me min maxed from leveling to dungeon runs to gold farms. Everyone had to do everything in the most rushed efficient way possible and you didnt have the option of playing at a casual newb pace. You didnt do a full clear of brd at 60 you just farmed arena. You didnt full clear DM you could only find groups for DM east. If you wanted to level an alt you paid a prot pally to spam SM runs over and over again and then at 45 you spammed alterac valley over and over again. 
---
We have a version of classic wow here but its definetly not the most ideal patch to play on.
---
tbh I'd rather play with that leather wearing, low dps warrior than someone like you.
---
if ur talking about 1v1s hunter are pretty good. locks/spriests u essentially have no chance against, frost mage can be difficult but every other class hunters are probably favoured
---
Warlock at lvl 56 what dungeons should I run for bis and xp?
---
I wouldn't know, I don't spend time actually investigating the people spamming me.
---
Attendance, then performance.  
---
  
---
No point in benching people who are on time **and at the location needed with the required consumables** when the people you are bringing are either logging on seconds before or need summons a minute or two after the raid should have started.  
---
If the people you're bringing are constantly going afk, dying to easy mechanics, or are just generally having a negative impact on the raid environment, then swap them out with someone who is riding the pine and is willing to be an active participant in the raid.  
---
If you have more than 40 ppl who are showing up ready and staged for raid and all of them want to be there with no distractions/afks/etc., then I think you have a first world (of warcraft) problem and I don't know what else to say about it.
---
A ring with hit for pvp? Any green ring with 10str and 7 stam would be better
---
It's good for the game because it gives players a reason to fucking go out into the world. You don't just do two laps and have a full sack of herbs. You have to look for resources and fight over them. 
---
That's the point of the game. That's why they're on a four hour timer. That's why flasks are so powerful. To make you want them. Remember when they made flasks easy to obtain? Alchemists profit went to all time lows. Ontop of the crippling elixir changes in tbc, you were a transmute bot.
---
yikes
---
Lol that phrase is at least 15 years old
---
That‚Äôs just racist -_-
---
So it makes sense that the hunter sitting in DM farming gold all day and not helping out with guild activities (e.g. attunements/dungeon runs) can get whatever raid loot he wants while the guy doing his 20th jailbreak clear gets last prio? Sounds like dog shit to me. Loot council over everything.

I came across it 2 times.
---
I'm a tank myself, but I enjoy doing dungeons as a DPS (furyprot)
---
1) was my offtank in mc. Bound taunt to EVERY of his skills with a macro and always taunted bosses off me, also corehounds and stuff. Told him to remove taunt from his macros for 2 hours, then got him kicked from the guild cause he didn't
---
2) was a druid tank. strat living. First few trash pulls. Didn't start of on a good foot with her, you could tell she was annoyed b4 the dungeon started. Charged in (for those who don't know: Druid charge consumes rage rather than generating, so a big no no) and ignored the range mobs, letting them go loose on our priestess. When I inquired wether I might give her some tips for tanking after the first 2 or 3 trash groups she responded with something like "STOP THIS SHIT I TANK FOR 16 YEARS I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING JUST STFU AND LEAVE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT".
---
So... I put on a shield and proceeded to tanks. she left. we got a dd. her guildmate who was also in the group was like "well... she is in a bad mood, sorry 4 her" and we continued to clear strat without any further issues\^
---
Thats how pugs did it in wotlk when I played. They were usually made by trusted people from good guilds who didnt get spots that week.
---
I think the bigger consideration for BGs are interrupts/stuns, and if you can get a Regrowth + Rejuvenate off then escape with travel form then there‚Äôs nothing to interrupt outside of purges.
---
**candidates for the cut list**
---
People that show up less early.
---
People that didn't bother to sign up.
---
People that showed up less prepared. (less pre-bis, no potions, no flasks, no food, no knowledge of the encounters)
---
**candidates for the save list.**
---
People that helped get others prepared (attunements, gear farms, resources to learn fights, flask runs)
---
People that provided chants, potions, flasks, food, water, mats, recipes etc.
---
People that bring a class and spec needed for the fights expected to be encountered.
---
People named Rofo.
---
On PVE servers you can have chars of both factions... \^\^
---
You sound very fun to group with. And very angry at warriors
---
For weeks on my server horde camped this guy. Alliance hunters wept
---
MUCHOS GRACIAS TED
---
This would be a good alternative to getting zero fucking loot cause loot council, fuck loot council.
---
1. Does some1 skip the mandatory consumes
---
2. Does some1 trick addons like exorsus with consumes?
---
3. Setup
---
4. Attendance
---
If benched and online (Rdy to join if needed) during raid 50% of assumed dkp
---
Sounds good. Thank you! I didn't want to make someone nervous by doing it that way but couldn't think of how else to.
---
If the margins are there, I'll certainly buy the mats myself when I can. Just trying to figure out how all this works!
---
I appreciate the tips too. I will look into that as well! Thank you!
---
Senjin represent! Played ally there from vanilla through cata
---
0n 100 frostbolts you'll see 12 spelldamage outweigh 1% hit as 1 resist out of 100 isn't too much in the grander scheme.
---
On 10 frostbolts 1 resist is disastrous.
---
This makes Hit a more consistent (and possibly valuable) stat for shorter fights.
---
no 14 AP is 1 dps, So weapon speed as weapon damage.
---
14 AP would only be 1 weapon dmg with a 1.0 speed weapon.
---
I was not on this type of server and idc about this "problem". It really isn't one.
---
Renew isn‚Äôt that mana efficient but I haven‚Äôt had any issues using it so far, I‚Äôm 34 at the moment on my Priest. I only use it to top off DPS. 
---
A mouseover macro allows you to cast on whatever target your mouse is hovering over so you never have to change your current target. Simply move mouse to a player frame you want to heal and it will go to that target.
---
Feel like they changed "won't" be able to raid with "will". Alters the entire meaning if you do that.
---
I don't think it incentivizes gold buying as much as gold farming. I would imagine if I was the type of person that would risk my account by buying gold, then I was already looking for an excuse to do so.
---
That was my first thought and why I wouldn't do it.  Back in the day I was shocked when I got to know people in my guild and found out how common RMT is.  We weren't super hardcore but we cleared end game content.  Probably 1/3 of them bought gold, that I know of.  The first time I found out was the epic mount conversation came up once.  People all started sharing how much they paid IRL for the gold to get their epic mount.
---
This. You only need 1 Winters Chill speced mage to increase the crit chance of any frost based spells. While they might sacrifice their own DPS, they boost every other mages significantly.
---
That is exactly what I just thought xD
---
I guess it is difficult for rogues (or whatever he is playing) when warriors roll on your gear. You Kind of have this small hatred growing larger and larger inside you until one day you destroy a warrior so hard he will never want to wear leather again.
---
For this guy - that day was yesterday :P
---
That poor warrior probably still bleeding tears out of his eyes :-(
---
3 days played since launch... yeah I work alot (;
---
What build are you running?
---
Some of the best pre-raid bis pieces for fury warriors are leather and mail. What's wrong with using leather? Fury warrior doesn't tank and the class ALLOWS use of cloth, leather, mail and plate. I think you're just butthurt because you lost some pieces to one.
---
Haha yeah some better servers and decreased respawn timers would be great in my opinion.
---
If you do a DM Tribute run for the buffs, how long after it's completed can you come back for the buffs without having to do it all again? Can you come back the next day and grab the buffs real quick if the dungeon wasn't reset, for example?
---
Thats weird, ive never seen less than 20 energy, but have seen more very often on my druid.
---
idiot
---
Ahh...so you're just an good old fashioned asshole then? Nice
---
I prefer gh1 to heal3 in dungeons, I feel it's perfect for dps (weak for tank).. my reasoning is that the less I cast the more time I have for mana regen. Heal3 is good for topping off though (from 90% to 100% hp situations), but that's hardly needed.
---
Boo, long live Zul‚Äôjin ally
---
&gt; what dungeons should I run for bis 
---
The ones on your BIS list.
---
&gt;xp
---
BRD and LBRS.
---
r/MadLads
---
I think Windseeker is actually a good pop at the moment. In the mornings I can farm without competition, and in the evenings I can find groups without a problem! Only issue so far is the Auction House is a little light, but you can still make gold.
---
Died.
---
I personally dont do it. When I do dungeons I wanna have an experience with a group, not just being baggage that is drawn along.
---
S
---
Wow you‚Äôre an asshole
---
Thank you for the tip. What spec are ya running by the way? I was running necro set for the stam bonus but i do habe archmages
---
Herod was always going to have a queue. My friends and I just waited for new servers to open and hopped on rattlegore. Any server open pre launch had a queue because everyone had their names. You had options to say hey guys maybe wait and they'll pop out new servers in an hour.
---
People who pick horde are usually people who only PvP in advantage, racials are op.
---
I guess which are available to run at 56 is a better question
---
I mean Humans get sword spec, 5% spirit and perception. Orcs get axe spec, blood fury, and stun resist. I never said sword spec is boring, it‚Äôs much better for rogues, but overall Orcs have the best racials.
---
If you are not the tank you can do ubrs before 60 np.
---
Funny cause perdition's blade is actually bis tank item
---
You narrowed it down simply by saying you want to tank.  Druid is a great class. I leveled one to 70 back in the day and it took true restraint not to reroll one for classic. Keep gear for off spec and you'll be able to heal or tank any instance until 60.
---
yikes... darnassus the vacant.
---
Did it make your dick wet to put someone trying something out of the box, down?
---
just do /who druid and ask any druids level 45+ offer some gold even. Druid can solo him easily.
---
the /r/classicwow way
---
People always have an incentive to buy gold. You can just pay a guild to carry you and buy items you want.
---
&gt;Back on the good'ol pservers there was no PVE servers for those losers
---
What the fuck are you actually talking about? There are SHIT LOADS of PvE private servers.
---
&gt;you had pvp or 300pop realms to choose from
---
Oh right. Yeah. You are one of those "F.R.E.S.H" losers who thinks you need 10k players otherwise a server is "ded".
---
Use multiple ranks of Healing Touch (I use ranks 8, 6, 4 and 3. Rejuv rank 8 which I keep active on the tank. Regrowth is only used as a panic heal, since the cast time is short.
---
My server is 70% alliance. Thankfully, it's PVE.
---
Perfect - thanks! Exactly the answer I was looking for.
---
Really the only two things that I would change are your Gauntlets and your legs. 
---
For Gauntlets, I'd use Voone's Vice Grips - they're almost irreplaceable in my opinion for an early tank. 
---
For legs, I'd switch to Warmaster's Legguards, from UBRS, for the added threat stats. Other than that, I think you're basically ready for MC. 
---
Don't worry too much about Savage Gladiator Chain or Chromatic Flight Breastplate - both of those require a lot of farming. Obviously they're both great, but you can't really count on those due to their low drop rate. It took me 47 UBRS runs to get the Chromatic Carapace drop, just to give you an idea of how long it can take.
---
Yes, exactly, just feels kind of weird. Thanks for the response! That's what I needed to know!
---
Note to self, if it disappears, stopmacro might be an option. If Spellstone equipped, stop macro, otherwise, equip staff.
---
I tried this but my game crashed? Is this because it's a hack?
---

---
What a beyond idiotic idea.
---
Did you actually think of that for more than 2 femtoseconds?
---
&gt;PVE servers should not be apart of Classic.
---
Because they were a part of Vanilla. Why would they not be part of Classic?
---
Floppy taco.
---
A legend? I know, it's a lot of pressure.
---
Link to the ranking please?
---
Then a hunter should outbid them out of general principle.
---
Never have actually. lol
---
Someday I will post a comment on this sub that doesn‚Äôt get downvoted!
---
Later on they unlocked PvE to PvP but in vanilla you couldn‚Äôt do it. Stands to reason if we do get paid transfers in Classic it will be the vanilla iteration. 6 month cool down and no PvE to PvP transfers.
---
Just dinged 53 as a SPriest, I was able to heal ST but i was struggling a bit by the end. Do i need to switch to holy for BRD?
---
Be druid, win druid gear for 5g bids because there's maybe 1 other druid. Leave raid with full T1 and 300 extra gold, ez.

The Zeppelin guards are also Goblins, it's possible they buffed them by accident.

I doubt they wanted to stop people from raiding Grom'gol.
---
Alot of the top guilds on all servers are currently either Retail guilds or Private server guilds with many players that have already been playing together for years.

Frost
---
&gt;  But they definitely punish the scammers if they are reported.

Has this actually happen? I'd like to see some examples. I have the feeling people just repeat what they heard and that blizz wouldn't do anything.

Still nice to have a 10 slot in your bank
---
Thank you :)
---
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
Okay thank you.
---
I had a BOE drop for me last night, and I'm left with 1.5k gold now.
---
What should be my prioritization in spending it? I'm a fury Warrior.
---
What I was thinking:
---
Epic Mount
---
Lionheart Helm
---
I am not a fan of faction-specific queues, and simply due to it not being the fault of the player base but Blizzard for the dumbass way they implemented free server xfers that made this such a problem. I don't think players should be punished because the company looked at their wallet first and what was good for the game second.
---
Im gonna roll around in cloth and get mad whenever someone calls my character trash.
---
 "HEY MAN! I'm just playing out of the box. You hurt my feelers."
---
On the TOS the naming rules are listed
---
As son as BGs were released there were faction based BG queues and people still stayed.  It led to the battlegroup clustering to improve queue times.
---
That‚Äôs good advice for someone with +healing gear.  Without that gear, you‚Äôre being less mana efficient that way.
---
He sounds like his main spec was fury/prot (dual wield tanking) and he just happened to be wearing DPS gear because his tanking was not required.
---
Otherwise it is definitely very curious that he would choose to wear those particular weapons.
---
I mean the weapon won't make a difference in dmg taken, but could you imagine how bad is dps would have been if he was in plate? This isn't an example of why warriors shouldn't use leather, this is an example of a bad player and apparently if your healers couldn't keep your tank up on the last boss then that's not the dps warriors fault. Also you are a tool bag
---
In what world is any human being incapable of doing a FREE transfer? My entire guild transferred together! lmfaooooo you're just mad that it actually is your fault and you didn't make the correct decision.
---
You need to determine what products people actually want. Idk off the top of my head what‚Äôs good from tailoring from lvling. Certain items may seem really great, but there‚Äôs an equal or better alternative from some easy quest. Another item may have no comparable with a unique use effect. You need to figure out what tailoring crafted items are actually selling and not just make anything expecting it to sell.
---
Who knows, a fury warrior using Quel Serrar is bizarre.
---
Plus you can make up the lost crit by having one mage with Winter's Chill which gives frost abilities 10% extra crit.
---

It's hard to get on the zep in the first place because you'll get punted all over the place once you reach the top of the tower.

---
It's fairly lax. Just don't reference real life people or places and don't have a bunch of real words. Your name could still be something like "Potroast" and the RP element is that you were a fat baby or your parents loved pot roast or something.
---
I'm alliance on a server that is outnumbered by horde. I'm happy with the change because I like the server and wish to remain here, but I also dont like the faction imblance. If this new faction-transfer will make some horde leave and balance it out, then I'm very happy with it, and im sure alot of others are aswell.
---
Nothing personnel kid
---
From what I understand, GH1 starts becoming the defacto best heal when you get the set bonus that gives it an added renew effect (tier 2 I believe?). 
---
Heal3 works fine for me to keep up the tank in most dungeon fights, except certain enrage bosses or encounters like baron where I have multiple things to heal. If it doesn't keep up, the tank will eventually dip low enough that I weave in a GH4 and he's back up to full.
---
Like I said, use what you prefer. Being comfortable in your rotation is more important than pure efficiency because it allows more consideration in emergency situations like bad pulls.
---
Both of those items are your BiS for the entire duration of Classic, so I think those are the obvious answers. I'd go Lionheart Helm first, but it really depends how much time you spend in the open world versus doing jump runs or something similar.
---
Don't be mean. We will not go down this road again. We dont want to end up as in retail, where everything is about speed. 
---
Have fun and educate the poor dps instead of kicking them. Make the world (of warcraft) a better place. üòÄ

---
Kind of like announcing how "cool" you are.... If you are indeed you don't need to say it, or get any praise for it....  It just is.....
---
For Phase 1 with the gear available, between 11-13% is usually best
---
There isn't a solution Blizzard can do though.  The players choose to roll on super high pop servers knowing there will be a queue and everything farmed to shit and BG queue times will be terrible.  They know this and do it anyway.
---
Blizzard gives them the option to transfer away and they don't leave.
---
Blizzard opens paid transfers AND MORE PEOPLE GO TO THOSE SERVERS.
---
Unless they forcefully move people, which they never will, there isn't a solution blizzard can implement which solves the problem.
---
Add faction specific queues and you got the ball rolling.
---
I'm pretty certain we've already had at least 2 patches, actually, judging from the client dates in the lower left corner when logging into the game.
---
Because they do it all the time. If you're crafting a lionheart helm, you can't just dc with the mats and never return them.
---
The death of player expectations and hope?
---
I got oneshot in booty bay as a level 10 by a rogue and the guards killed him. Also his vanish didn‚Äôt work, lol.
---
Literally me
---
I would do OSRS but damn if that isn't an endless amount of grinding to do all over again. Think questing is what really holds me away the most. Hated it when the game came out and hated when it became EZscape. But I did love the old game much more than what it has become. 
---
The lotto thing they have is just an abomination to everything the game was. The items it spits out endlessly that can also be bought with IRL money just undermines any accomplishment that can be had.
---
&gt; Blizzard have pretty strong monitoring and logging systems now compared to 2004-2006
---
For sure. There's no way someone can make level 1 characters that spam gold channel invites without being insta banned. Yep. No way it could happen. Any competent company would have a way to detect a level 1 account sending spam messages for sure.

Noice!

MUCHAS GRACIAS TED
---
Suck you are being downvoted, you're not wrong it's just what they added later so wont be in classic.
---
I started a shaman to roll with my girlfriend who is playing a feral druid. The toons are exclusively to play with each other, we have other toons for time alone.
---
I was thinking I should be a healer shammy to complement my girls tanks.
---
But I'm finding that, even with all int gear, my shaman pokes things with a stick hard as hell!
---
Like wow. I have int stacked, but my auto attack still does way more damage than a lightning bolt!
---
We're talking low level, so I imagine things will even out, but I can't help but wonder if I should put my points in enhance just to leverage the already strong physical attacks.
---
I died before Gheddon and lost world buffs, so basically half the instance I lost a significant amount of DPS.
---
I completely missed the Gheddon fight, not sure if that's calculated as 0 dps for the boss average.
---
I remember back in vanilla the goblin guards got added because back then alliance was the zerg faction on most servers and would camp the zeppas a lot to kill lowbies n stuff.
---
I guess they didn't reciprocate the guards for alliance boats because it wasn't needed before they became mostly irrelevant in TBC.
---
I recommend googling Dives Drain Tanking Guide.  Makes Warlock farming and leveling way faster and more efficient, especially starting around lvl 30.
---
the 8/8 can proc the mana surge
---
Ah sorry, I thought you meant they are ignoring the faction with the same name.
---
why am I thinking of south park stick of truth
---
all the aliens go "moo moo moomoomoo?"
---
&gt; I see half green half blue mages beat out almost full purple mages.
---
Because mage itemization is trash and greens will almost always have more damage than purps.
---
&gt;I'd put Ulda as the #3 worst thing in classic WoW.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;1: Horde Onyxia attunement  
---
&gt;2:Gnomeregan  
---
&gt;3: Uldaman  
---
&gt;4: Sunken Temple
---
I actually love the ST dungeon. And i just finished the Horde Onyxia attunement a few days ago, and found it fun. Long, very long, yes. But it was fun.
---
good point
---
I got so lucky finding this pet, I only checked one time for about 5 minutes and there he was!
---
*three shots fury warrior*
---
You say, sum‚Äôn?
---
its called iMorph. :)
---
I don't know what you want. Obviously your solution doesn't work. Go to a different server if the queue is that bad.
---
The biggest factor are worldbuffs ,just as example a fully buffed rogue has like 40%crit while no buff rogue has like 20ish with same gear 
---
So same goes for hunter
---
&amp; even then at least you make gold
---
Thalnos Alliance - not sure of exact faction numbers but it is absolutely terrible. Has to be the most frustrating server there is.... Im guessing it is around 8 Horde to every 1 Ally.
---
Now adding to my point on why it‚Äôs so bad, the faction part is only the tip of this iceberg.
---
Thalnos server is a US East server and at least Half the population speaks broken English or no English at all and getting pug groups going is a nightmare... finding a solid guild for partying up and raiding is also quite tough.
---
I think we have maybe 3-4 English speaking raiding guilds that are clearing MC right now on ally. The rest are... well.. no idea because I don‚Äôt know wtf they are saying, haha.
---
To the Faction imbalance point ‚Äî‚Äî Last night was a normal night trying to get to UBRS. It took me 11 deaths to reach UBRS and only then did I reach it because the 5 rogues and 2 druids that were camping me were currently after other passerby victims when I respawned, so I had an extra few seconds to move. 
---
BRD is always worse. Some nights it can take 30-45 minutes just to get to BRD/UBRS from the FP. And it hasn‚Äôt gotten any better, pretty sure it‚Äôs getting worse. 
---
Definitely nearing the breaking point between the language barrier and the Horde constantly outnumbering and camping. I have legitimately never had a 1v1 fight and I have 20 days played.
---
If you intend to end game heal I would suggest BRD is a great time to switch to full heals. I dropped all shadow talents at 51 and healed the remainder of the way though to 60. I had 80% pre raid BIS when I dinged and was ready to raid. Final note - if you are short on time and can‚Äôt run dungeons consistently consider finishing as shadow.
---
Vanilla PvP is all about resets, and getting a CC into eat/drink &gt; shadowmeld is a game changer. Against a rogue or warrior, they have to physically walk up to you to stop you now, instead of shooting you. It's an extremely useful tool.
---
If you do most of your grinding in dungeons/PvE, grab the Lionheart; it's BIS pretty much forever and it will help you grind out gold for the epic mount.  
---
If you plan on doing a lot of PvP or you use a gathering profession to earn your money, get the epic mount first; you'll get around the world faster for more honor and herbing/mining.
---
Have you seen mobile games? there's always someone willing to spend obscene amounts of money for pixels.
---
Did the first macro I posted work for you? Curious if the `[equipped:spellstone]` condition works.
---
It‚Äôs a thankless job, but someone‚Äôs gotta do it. Thanks brother.
---
you sound like an awesome player to play with. Its UBRS, not Naxx. Level 57 can run it easily enough. Maybe he likes the warrior class, and doesnt like the rogue class? 
---
I'd probably prefer to play with players who arent so judgmental and allow folk to play the game as they like, rather than how you'd like them to play!
---
Wow dude, like 3 other people already corrected me you can chill out.
---
&gt; But now they're saying that the phases aren't a real patch... like what.
---
I mean, they're not. They're turning honor on later this week and they aren't shutting down the servers or pushing a new version of the client to do it.
---
No, I didn't respec until I hit 60. Just make sure to take advantage of the 5 second rule to regenerate mana during combat (wait until tank is half hp or so then cast 1 big heal instead of lots of little heals all the time). BRD you should be totally fine, and there's a lot of good healing gear in there for you to scoop up. UBRS, Scholo, Strat....you may want to respec before running these just to save yourself the anxiety.
---
I'm getting sick of other people here making simple suggestions to complex problems. But at the same time I'm now learning a lot. Thanks for the info
---
With phase 2 coming out, not having an epic mount is a pretty bad idea if you ever leave town.
---
Dinged 37 on my hunter went to quest in bad lands. Right as I walked in I saw BT snatched it up. Couldn‚Äôt of been happier. Lol best luck I‚Äôve had in classic
---
At least a tool bag is useful. Unlike leather wearing warriors.
---
Most people dont like being blatantly lied to.  Shocker.
---
Druids come out on top of all loot rules, but no one as much as gdkp!
---
Yeah for sure. If i'm the type of person to spend obscene amounts of money on a game, then that was probably always going to happen anyway.
---
the gameplay on these servers is fucking fine you weenie  
---
not having lag in IF because baldmongold is hosting a guild meeting doesnt make the server 'dead' lmao
---
Found the future school shooter, guys!
---
Are you fucking shitting me
---
if they want to enjoy the game, yes, for sure
---
My boyfriend is the one who posted the original post. I thought the comment was about him. He would never say or think that killing low levels is fun. I‚Äòm sorry, my mistake/misunderstanding.
---
A raid is only as good as the tanks unfortunately. It's why people struggle with Onyxia because tanks aren't able to generate enough threat to keep aggro from people trying to do max DPS with no regard to threat
---
What is RMT?
---
It doesnt hurt to spend 10g on a couple fire protection potions and a damage elixir.  Makes it easier on the healers and everything goes more smoothly.
---
Doesn't seem to work, I did modify it a bit but it doesn't do anything, is equipped even a condition with other items?
---
\*/use \[equipped:spellstone(greater)\] Spellstone(Greater)
---
/equipslot 16 \[equipped:Inventor's Focal Sword\] Zum'rah's Vexing Cane; Inventor's Focal Sword
---
/equipslot 17 \[noequipped:spellstone(greater)\] Spellstone(Greater)
---
Honestly that's why I tried out retail. The pitch that you can do raids casually seemed worth checking out. But LFR was a fucking joke of an experience and the higher level raiding was even more grindy than Classic thanks all the dailies they love so much now.
---
There's fancy Ghost Saber from cat statues at ruins of Mystra, north from Auberdine.
---
You're letting Blizzard play you my dude. Classic does not demand the consistent time investment that Blizzard designed retail to demand of you. You have literal MONTHS to progress though phase one raiding. Sure, when I hit 60 I had a few binge sessions and spammed so dungeons. It was great but now I pretty much raid log on my main since I've gotten my epic mount and play a bit on my Hunter alt. 
---
Limit yourself to like 2 hours a day. Make an alt, read the quest text, leveling professions. Play the game like an RPG and the tedious boring stuff will balance out the exciting fun stuff enough for you to actually want to put the game down for a bit until your next session.
---
wasd lol I cant move!
---
Click on an auctioneer &gt; sell the item &gt; buy Warden Staff with gold. He's just turned the item into his BiS weapon.
---
Based on it disappearing, you could try this:
---
    #showtooltip [equipped:spellstone] Spellstone Name; Staff Name
---
    /equipslot [equipped:One-Hand,noequipped:17] Staff Name
---
    /stopmacro [equipped:One-Hand,noequipped:17]
---
    /equipslot [noequipped:spellstone] 16 One Hand Name
---
    /equipslot [noequipped:spellstone] 17 Spellstone Name
---
I _think_ this could work, but don't have a way to test it. This could be updated to support your main weapon set because a 1-hand + off-hand as well since I didn't include any 2-hand type conditions. I tried to base all conditions on the spellstone.
---
At 52 you can run BRD til you hit 55-56 then you can run LBRS as long as you want or until you get bored. Personally I find LBRS and Scholo the best dungeons for exp to hit 60 the fastest, you just have to be level 55+ to run them. BRD should get you there pretty quick though. I wouldn‚Äôt bother questing as you‚Äôre a warrior and the quest pool at your level is pretty underwhelming. Obviously tanking will get you groups quicker, but if you‚Äôre looking for scholo make sure the group is comfortable with a lower level tank. LBRS is easy either way though.
---
I enjoy doing dungeons with groups. Low level, high level, doesn't matter, I just enjoy the group mechanics of WoW. And I like to look good doing it, I have been known to pass on better gear because it doesn't match what I'm wearing. Or spending hours/days grinding mats to craft a matching set, which isn't the best I could be wearing. But in dungeons it doesn't really matter that much.
---
Im standing on OG and selling +30 spellpower, +55 healing and crusador entchants.
---
&gt; The reason it wont happen is because blizz knows that there's a lot more horde than alliance - so if you start queueing horde only, where are those horde going to transfer to? There's not really any (or at least enough) servers with majority alliance to transfer to to take the excess horde.
---
Sure, but there are plenty of pvp servers that don't have queues at all (and therefore won't have queues for Horde).
---
Seconding this, but for mages. Any specific class guides would be great.
---
Thalnos Alliance - not sure of exact faction numbers but it is absolutely terrible. Has to be the most frustrating server there is.... Im guessing it is around 8 Horde to every 1 Ally. 
---
Faction ques would be huge and seem like the only answer for world pvp...
---
To the Faction imbalance point ‚Äî‚Äî Last night was a normal night trying to get to UBRS. It took me 11 deaths to reach UBRS and only then did I reach it because the 5 rogues and 2 druids that were camping me were currently after other passerby victims when I respawned, so I had an extra few seconds to move.
---
BRD is always worse. Some nights it can take 30-45 minutes just to get to BRD/UBRS from the FP. And it hasn‚Äôt gotten any better, pretty sure it‚Äôs getting worse.
---
Hunter solo tribute runs
---
Elven rings, Magi rods, and druid mace sell for 25g
---
Buffs sell for 5g
---
If I can't find a buyer quickly, I vendor everything for a nice chunk of gold.
---
With buyers and efficient runs, hunters can make 100g/hr
---
I don't think they realized that they would be better when they made them. Also, in reguards to his specific examples at the bottom of his comment the boots and bracers from tier 1 are bis for phase one alongside the helmet for the 3 set bonus (+18 spell power) which makes them add more spell power than the of frozen wrath equivalents. Without the set bonus they are worse though.
---
imagine even remotely caring about this.
---
wow I can't believe people still writing these comments. I get how there can be flat earthers and antivaxxers.
---
what does the stopmacro command even do?
---
if you played a mmorpg in 2004/2005 , you would in general not be on dial up.   (unless you lived in the middle of nowhere in Montana, USA or so)
---
Paladins also make things a lot easier on everyone. Salvation alone is a hardcoded advantage.
---
I ignored the dense stone, the azerothian diamonds, all the other rare gems from thorium and the not so rare gems from mithril.  If solid stone is truly 25s (never more than 6-10 on Rattlegore) a piece on your server, that sucks and maybe it is in your case more valuable to get a stack of solid stone.
---
56+ in group of 5 for LBRS  
---
58+ in group of 10 for UBRS.  
---
Same instance, but someone from group need to have Seal of Ascension to open door to UBRS part.
---
Ok I'll take your word for it, no matter how triggered you seem.
---
i dont live in a dysfunctional country that produces murderers at such an enormous scale. so no.
---
more like tukui - but yes 
---
one addon compared to the list of op - for nearly the same result
---
I am sure it will look cool for a hunter but warriors and rogues are gonna cry..
---
Not really. Logging is really only used to compare epeen sizes, so I would say it's pretty cultural. Some servers are filled with people who just don't care about that kind of thing, so they don't log.
---
Shamans are more fun than Paladins.
---
No she's apparently a different devilsaur to the far south.  Not gonna even try the King.
---
True but it's a lil more complicated for Ony since she has numerous threat-drop mechanics (knockback in p1 &amp; p3 and fireballs in p2)
---
Either way, pulling out all the stops for tanks getting threat helps tremendously.
---
So letting people who want to go back to faerlina from heartseeker, even if they limited it to just alliance, would hurt both servers? When most people that left faerlina left because of queue times or streamers/twitched communities would some how magically hurt both servers to let those players go back to faerlina? Why would you think the server would be ruined? Most people that left wouldn't be going back not to mention heartseeker is made up of multiple servers not just faerlina. Also I didn't "dodge queue times" I still had to sit in them and still do when I currently play.
---
It was called t0.5 before the epic version came out, at wich point the blue was called t0
---
For shamans the best leveling spec is enhance by far. Keep an extra set of healing gear and you will be able to heal any dungeon as well.
---
You cannot compare MC healing with other raids when a boss dies in less than two minutes. Take a look around the Priest Discord. There is a TON of resources and a healthy discussion.
---
https://discord.gg/cKqjPY
---
I needed to reboot to fix a mouse issue, got hit with a Windows update and then a 3 hour queue. Missed ony :(
---
BRD to 55-56 and then LBRS to 60. LBRS is pretty ridiculous XP, and has some pretty good drops for tank warriors, some of which you'll use into MC.
---
Yeah it is, the rough life of being on Herod where everyone's prepping for pvp
---
Are you ok?
---
you cant preclear trash. as soon as the first pack is engaged the timer is started and it doesnt stop till rag is death. but you can also see the full run here: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/507656763
---
Brd first half, do prison for those quests and start the shadowforge key quest. Then go back in for arena angerforge and golemlord, kill fineous for the key quest and swing back around to the arena bleachers and exit up there to complete the key quest. All of that will take awhile to find groups and do the runs. You want to get to 55 ish to dps the last few bosses and be 56 or above to tank them. 
---
Outside if brd do green quests like the ones feralas or tanaris if you haven't yet. And then start looking to run dire maul. 57 or so you can start looking at all of the endgame dungeons including brd, dire maul, strat, scholo, lbrs, ubrs, 
---
You'll probably also want to do some mauradon princess runs for the Blackstone ring
---
I know, there‚Äôs no rich thorium in Searing Gorge. If you had farmed Burning Steppes instead, you‚Äôd have an absurd amount of crystals.
---
The post isn't negative in tone, imo.
---
But this guy said what me.
---
but the whole idea is that they promised to get rid of layers before  phase 2! 
---
I guess they expected the population to have shrunk a bit more by now
---
The Devilsaur Queen was a quest objective added likely in WOTLK. The first comments on wowhead regarding "The Ballad of Maximillian" were provided in 2010 around patch 3.3.5.
---
It is incredibly out of date. Maybe not now, but who cares now the initial 60 rush is over? When I was levelling my char at release, there were numerous errors on every single section.
---
It includes stuff from later phases all the time.
---
You don't need to do it for every fight, but you can do it for some.
---
For example, my guild's raid leader looks at Details for decurse/dispell counts on the first MC boss to look at who's slacking.
---
At some point, your raid just has 40 competent people, so it doesn't really matter if you're killing the bosses quickly anyways.
---
there is normally a gold floor. So even if no one wants the gear, you still have to pay, 250g gold for a guild I know that is using GDKP. Else it will be disenchanted.
---
Nasuki?
---
it was an option for everyone. and my friend group of 9 people rerolled together on one of the new servers on day 4. If we hadnt we would have transfered.
---
    /cast Frostbolt
---
Yeah forgot to click "Classic" in wowhead. My bad.
---
thanks for understanding =)
---
Have seen 0 ques on whitemane for months besides on Tuesdays. It's really not a big deal.
---
Limited to just alliance would be good for Heartseeker but would be terrible for Faerlina, yes. How can you not understand this?
---
How come someone doesn‚Äôt just invite a bunch of horde on an alliance dominate server? Wouldn‚Äôt it be ideal to communicate instead of feeding this info? Sorry I‚Äôm new and never realized the game isn‚Äôt balanced between horde-alliance on most of the servers. Why is that
---
Thought I'd follow up here.
---
Vuhdo was the winner. Thanks for recommending!
---
What do you guys do with raid gear that's not better than a BIS dungeon drop?  No one bids and it gets vendored/sharded?
---
This is the same rule i still use with my kids (both almost teenagers now) only problem is their bedtime js 21:00 and often later and i need to sleep at midnight, but atleast its no more waking up at night.
---
Some people are just selfish.
---
Dal rends are two of the derpiest swords ive seen in this game lol what are you talking about
---
You say your second sentence as if the Epic Mount is not best in slot. Both Lionheart and Epic Mount are best in slot for many many phases. I do agree with your logic though.
---
You could clear BRD jail that's better XP, but not anything crazy like SM or ZF was, you may as well AoE grind or quest in the world. Once you get another couple levels you can do full BRD, which is more XP and will let you complete all the BRD quests.
---
And now instead of only having 1 person with the incentive to buy 3000-4000g now you have 10-20 people with the incentive to buy 1000g
---
happy cake day!
---
All of the pve servers were always garbage with the only exception of nostalrius PVE.
---
300pop is dead. 3k pop is not.
---
Never heard of 'em
---
Except for those saved names we logged in weeks before to get the ones we wanted. Our fault though.
---
Idk what I said to make you think I'm triggered - take a couple of deep breaths &amp; calm down lil bud ‚ô•
---
I'm currently running a Hunter as my main (not 60 yet but getting there :) ) and I'm looking into starting an alt, especially sind in Phase 2 I fully expect there will be moments when I won't be able to keep leveling my main.
---
Ivm a bit torn between Druid and Warrior. 
---
On the one hand warrior scales really well with gear, and as an alt to a hunter I should have little issue in getting the gold for said gear. It's also probably a more fun PvP experience at 60.
---
On the other hand however I've always wanted to play a Druid, and versatility is a plus. However, I'm worried by what I heard, that the Druid has a pretty high skill requirement to do well in PvP with (much higher than either Hunter and Warrior that is), skill requirement which I will likely struggle to reach on an alt.
---
This is the most notable downside of the DKP system.
---
FWIW some greens (frozen/shadow wrath specifically) are better than a lot of MC loot, too.
---
It's because the flash heal is beating other priests due to cast time.  If fights last long they would probably go oom and then downranked heal will likely shine.
---
Your explaining the cons of the system. Just how it is my dude. You can introduce dkp decay but then your opening up a can of worms.
---
dont worry mate you dont have to worry about him abusing it in pvp, theres no alliance left on shazzrah to fight :)
---
Don't be a wuss.  Stand in your capital city and spam general and looking for group channels.  LFM XDungeon  PST.  I am a rogue and literally form all groups for any dungeon I want in under 15 minutes, sometimes under 3 minutes.  I must have run 100 dungeon groups by now, and only 1 night at like 4 AM could I not get a group started due to no tank.
---
If your group seems to be stuck finding a tank, or healer etc.  Then do a /who warrior 58-59.  I find the level 58-59 players are still able to clear the content and really want to go since questing sucks.  I whisper ALL OF THEM.  Not even one at a time.  I copy and paste  "Hey we are ready to go to Live Strat, just need a tank, interested?"  I and I spam literally 25 warriors.  Same thing for healers.  If someone hits you with that "oh but I'm fury or I would."  I just say "play the class not the spec, you can do this, do you have a shield?"  and take them anyway.
---
It really is just a matter of being determined to get the thing going and not getting discouraged.  I've been told no by literally every warrior on the server before, they don't want to tank, and I ended up finding a druid tank instead.  I didn't quit when 40 players told me no, and I had been spamming LFG for 15 minutes, I just started asking druids.
---
Most of the time I just spam LFG and general in Org for a few minutes and have a group ready to rock.  Keep in mind you have to not quit.  I've had 1 person join, realize it was just 2 of us so far, and leave, then 10 minutes later rejoin when all I needed was 1 more person.  I did not get sad when he quit, I did not give up and think to my self "Oh I can't do this, see people just won' group with me!"  No, that's some boo hoo bull shit.
---
If you want something to happen go make it happen.
---
Last Friday I started doing pug MC.  Not joining, hosting one.  I got it full on friday at 7 and a monday at 6.  Full 40 people joined a pug raid.  We got down 6 bosses.
---
This game is about determination and effort.  It's not even 25% about skill.  No items in the game are really gained due to skill, it's all effort.
---
What if they also only play during peak times lol.
---
Great! Thanks for including your item names. The `[equipped]` conditional works with item slots (like we are using for 16 and 17) or item TYPES (one-hand, two-hand, shield, etc). You wouldn't put the item name in the equipped conditional. So, with your item names, try this macro and see if it does all you want it to.
---

Damn hunter, why? I play a hunter and I'd not roll for those, it's every rogue/fury warr's dream.

Learn your place, hunters! Get a 2hander!
---
I started a campaign in Iron Forge to ban everybody above 5 feet in length from the city.
---
Quel Serrar is a main hand weapon, you must be mistaken, you cant dual weild it.
---
Yes but there is a lot more to MC than just the 20 to 30 second boss. I would be pissed off if people in my raid were caring more about that than caring about the entire raid (mainly trash that takes up the majority of the time). Like no one gives a shit you hit 10 out of 10 frostbolts compared to missing 1 if you are doing less damage overall in the entire clear.
---
I think it‚Äôs just people new to DKP. I‚Äôve been rolling on every upgrade and am rather ‚ÄúDecked‚Äù compared to say, our mage who hasn‚Äôt spent a single lick of DKP waiting for the big ticket item. 
---
I‚Äôd rather be wearing full tier and go back for weapons when they don‚Äôt cost all of the DKP. It‚Äôs silly to hoard
---
Why should the legal name matter? I don't get it.
---
I mean everything seems obvious in hindsight but for one, my friends didn‚Äôt start playing til several days in so there were already a bunch of those new servers. 
---
For two, I figure Blizzard had better estimates than me on classic interest so the very few servers was a little worrying. I figured more servers would be added of course, but more like... 2-3 extras. Instead it went from 13 servers to 41.
---
Sometimes I try to kill a mob while kiting it and it runs back to it's spawn at like 50 yards away, other times I just brush up against a mob and they chase me to Hellfire and back.
---
PvE (normal or rp) servers were never allowed to transfer to a PvP realm. 
---
The reasoning was that you could level a toon quickly and gear up and then go PvP with none of the hardships or risk by levelling on a PvP server.
---
PvP to PvE servers were possible, don't know from when, haven't heard if you will be able to.
---
If you're that bothered, start a new toon on a PvE server.
---
Ok but Firemaw has 8000 logged raiders, under 100 is still relatively dead
---
We added a decay of 10% every week.
---
Oh! I see, thank you!
---
M.C. Escher
---
The same argument applies to PvE that classic forces you to spend time in the world. Flying mounts allow you to ignore choke points with strong mobs, learning the nuance of the maps.

The Chinese gold farmers run a Warlock taxi service on the server I'm on. Can get summoned to Diremaul, Winterspring, Gadgetzan, or Scarlet Monestary as Alliance for 2-3g.

Huh... from reading his posts and yours, it looks like the job responsibilities are vastly different.

It sounds like your hard work and dedication gets rewarded. The harder you work the more you get rewarded. I'm not using the generic "you", but "you" as in the person I'm talking to... just to be overly clear. And I'm happy for you, honest. 
---
You clearly have no clue how lucky you are though. This NOT the case everywhere, or even a great majority of places. The typical story I hear is "Wow that dude worked his ass off, they gave him a ton of responsibility, but not a raise? WTF?" If I was a betting man, I would put good money on your hard work not being the sole reason for your success. It plays a large roll, but it isn't the determining factor. 
---
As far as people getting pissed about you getting raises, and not them... Why do they know? Keep that shit personal. I know you were stoked at the time, but it's just not cool to brag about it. Even the "entitled peasant class" has it's uses, so maybe consider not being an ass to them? 
---
Overall, I suggest to chill and only focus on things you can change. Politics and the work ethics of others are out of your control. Your health in 20-30 years will be much better off. Which will allow you to fully enjoy the fruits of your hard work.
---
/xgen'er out
---
You can do it in BiS but it's very RNG.
---
Or... you could unequip some pieces, requip them, loose sime life in the progress, prehot yourself and then cast starfire on the main target or a range mob, moonfire on a range mob and then LOS the group, go bear form and have the 20 rage, intital aoe aggro from the self heal and some good single target aggro on 2 targets. 
---
At least thats how my trusted druid tank goes about it. Dropping the prehotting from time to time.
---
Yeah, yet another great point. With no mages, they only had 2 decursers for the whole run. And if you have to bring another decurse player, it's clear that the drood is a better fit for the comp than a mage.
---
I am completely new to the game so when I do get lumped into these groups like ‚Äú hey my buddy is going to run us through ‚Äú or ‚Äú I‚Äôm bored I was nearby so I will help ‚Äú or ‚Äú I need 320 gold for epic ‚Äú it does provide a different experience; however, I like to take it as a learning experience. The run allows me to see how efficient the dungeon can be actually done and the route a party should take perhaps. I usually ask questions to gain some knowledge. I always end up doing a dungeon atleast more than a couple times so it isn‚Äôt a bad situation. I get how it can go bad but the game is unforgiving in many ways and some help is always welcome especially to a new player like myself. If you don‚Äôt wanna run through it fast then leave the group?
---
What "upgrades" should they spend dkp on then, when they have dungeon/crafted gear better than most that drops.
---
In 2 months the next raid might be out with better weapons. I think the rogues in full T1/T2 will be happier than the guy waiting for Viscag
---
Ah, tis a rare and brave thing to see someone admit they were wrong on the internet. You are a true pioneer!
---
Any good place is great if they are empty. Elementals in fellwood, elementals in elp, fire elementals in arathi.
---
No, "this step" is the step mentioned in the post itself, setting realms to one layer. 
---
It is possible that other factors, like people getting excited and logging in for phase two, or a decrease in the number of players allowed in a layer, ALSO contributed to queues. If that even happened.
---
But in the end, we have direct confirmation that layering affects queue time, and fundamentally you are just pretending that Blizzard doesn't understand what it is talking about.
---
assuming it's true...
---
all the armor in the world won't help you against drak conflagrate, which is the main source of damage.
---
Nah bro, melee consumes are fuckin dirt cheap. My 20g per 3 days LW trasmute is enough to raidlog now. You just really need mongoose, firewater, juju power and 1-2 greater fire pots.
---
Oh I've raided tons from vanilla to WOTLK and now in classic. My numbers are middle of the pack for our healers and my gear is less than the other priests. I've just kinda tried to figure it out myself but I wanted to see if there was some super nerds who have number crunched and gotten super granular.
---
You're very brave.

Read my reply to their follow-up comment.

I haven‚Äôt kicked anyone from my group yet. I usually tell them nicely first, if they still don‚Äôt listen attack something other than my skull mark or aoe when they shouldn‚Äôt, i just let them die. There is no way for me to hold 5 mobs on me when a crazy mage just run in and arcane explosion everything. It works pretty well, after couple death, they usually stop doing stupid shit.
---
No they said that the step in which they removed layers also increases queues. That step involves decreasing realm cap which is why non layered realms got queues
---
Yea because I really want to transfer from my friends I jumped on the realm with

I read your whole post. I forgot about dancing with the ghosts to drop aggro. Thanks for the reminder :D

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d3chdf/how_would_you_guys_like_classic_to_progress_in/
---
Literally on the front page of the most upvoted posts of all time on this sub. All the top comments with thousands of upvotes and gildings all asking for Classic+
---
Well, for hunters I take the point.
---
No I don't claim warriors should stack int, i claim warriors should be buffed int during leveling in dungeons.
---
Most mages will wipe all night long before giving up. They are bugged af. Even if you managed to stay alive after ice block they still running weird paths, so you lose cc on some of them very often.  Not impossible but very bad advise to lvl up on them :)
---
Playing whack a mole is the exact feel I have when healing.  You don't contribute at all.  You are just filling up empty bars and not engaging with bosses or dungeons.  I like classic healing just slightly more than retail healing, because the numbers are small enough to be deciphered.
---
I'm a druid tank. When I join an instance I copy two sentences in chat:
---
1. I mark skull, this is your primary target. If you touch any other target and you gain aggro, "you spank it, you tank it".
---
2. My only task is to keep aggro on the primary target and keep the other targets from attacking the healer.
---
Mostly this is received well, except for the one occasion I got kicked right after I told this. One minute later "the rest of the group" begged me to come back, they disbanded and reformed without the guy who kicked me.
---
&gt;In the end, it made me be a little more deliberate about my combat exit strategies. Gouge then vanish, for instance.
---
And that's exactly how it should work, IMO. If someone is mid swing and you disappear, it doesn't change the fact that your body is still going to be in the path of the swing.
---
&gt;We had many tier pieces get disenchanted
---
Are you disenchanting epics before they turn into Nexus Crystals? Ouch.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for - thanks man!
---
NEWSFLASH.
---
ok.
---
My bro where‚Äôs plate and it worked for him sooo...yeah.. dude it‚Äôs a vanilla wow, crappy ten man. You talking like this shit is black temple lol
---
So ninja looting is okay?
---
People who have been hoarding are gonna be pissed off at a DKP Decay if it wasnt already in place. Your comment is a thinly veiled "*my* guild never has this problem, how could other guilds *possibly* have this problem? xD". It's not hard to see through.
---
This is a good point.
---
A miniscule point though in my opinion. "Learning the nuance" of hugging the walls of darkwhisper gorge isn't exactly what I would call neccessary otherwise its a "dead world".
---
wow really? that's a lot of gold for classic right?
---
Gonna link a source to those numbers?
---
The good thing about this is that it will create a balanced horde/alliance ratio just by having different separate queues.
---
If a server is near full (which is where random ganking gets truly annoying) the queues will automatically balance the sides.
---
Lol I love how impossible it sounds to you.
---
Yup, my time as holy priest in dungeons is waiting to heal the tank, giving everyone a low rank renew when mild group damage goes out and if shit really goes south just cast one prayer of healing.
---
Heh. You should see retail.
---
have you tried it? Because ever since they changed it, I cant leash a single mob out of multi-pulls and Im talking about random roaming mob being ninjapulled with my target, not even stationary mobs close to each other...
---
Your removing the borders ability to horde. Some people don't like the little bit of power there given stripped from them.  I've heard main damage dealers leave cause they get salty af. Human nature kinda thing.
---
I was drunk last night tanking ZF and I‚Äôm just glad that I was able to do anything at all. I gotta stop drinking and tanking.
---
To the last point, rotate who's on the bench.
---
4 nelfs with the same hair.
---
You think you do, But you don't.
---
Still way too many people that dont understand what layering is and what it does. 
---
Turning off any layers or adding layers never meant increasing or decreasing player capacity of one realm.
---
To many "QQ now my realm has a queue because less people fit in my server" threads and posts everywhere
---
A Haimoo. Missed opportunity.
---
didnt that other video from yesterday talk mad shit against these guys? ha-ha
---
Because people will just try to game the system "Oh no one wants these, can we free roll?" every time because they dont wanna waste their DKP on items that are good, but arent BIS.
---
The herbs cost more than the pots on my server. It's weird.
---
The fact that there were no queues over the weekend (nor in the past month ever) means the player base was below the cap enough that fluctuations due to peak times never hit the cap.  You're suggesting people got excited on a Tuesday before a patch rather than the weekend to a point where the playerbase reached a significantly higher number than any time in the past month. That's highly improbable.
---
&gt; There is an elemental Patch spawn there, the respawn time is between 1h and 3h so if you stay there for a few hours you'll see at least one, you can fish Essence of water in it.
---
Where is the elemental patch by that island?  I've spent hours there and never seen it.
---
I‚Äôve been playing an ele shaman and for the life of me I don‚Äôt know what to do when an MS warrior is on me except die. 
---
I find myself pretty resilient to casters and even rogues (still unfavorable but possible) but warriors are just something else.
---
And even then it still breaks stealth 10% of the time.
---
whats your avg dps on those bosses?
---
Im interested!
---
What would be the chance according to both calculations, why are there two different ways to calculate, and why are they both valid giving different results eg. Where are they applicable and whats their output signaling, in comparison to each other?

Blows my mind how little self control and how easily addicted some people can get. I don't blame him, I know a lot of it is genetics, but damn. I'm just happy I'm not one of those people.

((This may or may not be from personal experience.))
---
Not at all, they‚Äôre green casters to a lvl 60 so they die very fast. Sap the closest one to the wall and solo the other one, then either vanish or solo the sapped once it breaks. I was able to do it as a fresh 60.
---
What are your professions?
---
How‚Äôs horde/alliance balance on gandling?
---
If your warrior needs the int to level his weapon skill in the dungeon you should have someone else tanking.
---
Not denying DKP is shitty, but:
---
Loot council has been totally not the system for me, and the time I tried it the officers gave items to their friends most of the time*
---
FTFY. Just cause you had a shitty experience with loot council doesnt mean everyone has.
---
We got 15% mana regeneration in combat, I rarely have mana issues in dungeons. I'd rather spam lower ranks to proc inspiration.
---
AFAIK combat rogues can't Sap+Vanish either because when they Vanish the Sap drops. 
---
With Improved Sap do you get put in combat after you Sap and stay in stealth?
---
What other guilds? :D
---
^^This.  You let people know the first orb (or w/e) is reserved. People respect it, or if they "accidentally" need you ask for the orb.  If they refuse, you boot them from the group and move on.
---
This is why loot council is shit. DKP all the way.
---
They have a chart somewhere that has at what +healing what spells are most efficient. BiS lists for every phase. The FAQ and resources are huge.
---
Yikes, sounds like you‚Äôve been in some shitty guilds. All of mine have been a meritocracy with limited politics, even when I‚Äôm outside the clique. (Granted this time around I‚Äôm the MT, so I‚Äôm as inner circle as it gets)
---
The hunters were not there for damage at all, they are there to pull and keep the pace up.  There are times where one hunter isnt dpsing at all on trash and looking for the next pat to pull.
---
So neither you nor your warrior friend understand that warriors do more damage in leather.  Cool.
---
BTW: Nexus Shards aren't in the game yet, so disenchanting items from MC has literally 0 value.
---
why?
---
how is that bad or affecting other players in any negative way?
---
Why quit the game, when gquit is a much better option. :D
---
...fuck those guys, you can find a better group of folks.
---
According to the damage charts they struggle doing more damage than a 58 rogue in full leathers lol.
---
Stay in yo lane hombre
---
Cya
---
Lol, this guy lost a piece of gear to a warrior while leveling in ZF a month ago and he is still crying about it.
---
Okay what about lionheart helm, edgemaster   gloves, or one of the other high end boes that are BiS and go for $1000+ gold
---
You sound toxic as fuck
---
Oh, interesting. So a literal patch not just ‚Äúturning on‚Äù content. Interesting
---
He did, a month ago in ZF
---
Join a guild with rolls or DKP. This is the risk with literally any loot method that isn't transparent from the start. 
---
Some people shit on guilds doing rolls with MS&gt;OS+1 but while the only content is PUGable shit like Molten Core, not being at the mercy of these systems is a blessing.
---
You are making up things that may or may not have happened and pretending that Blizzard didn't mean what they said, they actually mean this completely different thing because it helps your argument.
---
Queue time is affected by the number of layers. It has always been affected by the number of layers. 'Realm cap' is the number of layers cap (which is now 1) times the max number of players per layer. The number of players in queue is: (Number of players logging on) - (number of layers)*(players per layer)

You can do it in any gear , the more gear the faster it is ofc. So when i started with little gear, here was my strategy . Jump down , kill the three big flowers one by one (green are melee and easy to kite , red are casters and  you have to heal a bit) so only boss remains. Then you kite the boss (bring anti-venoms for mana drain) , at 50% imps will rush through the door , which will open the way to thorium veins. Reset the fight using the branch to pillar . Jump back down and kill the imps , they dont hit hard and have about 800hp so use a grenade or holy nova if you have and go mine the veins. With more gear you are actually able to kill the boss, but i think its easier / faster to just skip him and go right for that arcanite so you can cram more resets.  
---
Both bosses in DME are killable without taking a single hit so you should be good in any gear.
---
Totally feel you. My wife is pregnant with our second child. Games are my hobby. They bring me joy. And especally WoW (it brings back this nostalgic feeling where I was just a teenie with no responsibility but for myself). My solution is to play in the evening/night when she and my daughter are asleep. 3 to 4 times a week. I really don't want to miss this.

Pet Pathing. I was in UBRS the other day.on the stairs to the balcony before Rend. My pet next to me. Send it on a mob 2 yards in front of me. And the pet just decided to run back into the previous room. I manged to get it back on time before it pulled all the trash from the previous room. But the pathing is ridiculous sometimes.

Great time to use Retaliation as well.
---
He's just being aggressive to everyone over nothing, must be having a bad day :P
---
That sucks man, as a GM myself, I can‚Äôt see how someone, especially a GM, would think that‚Äôs a good idea to take gear his alt over mains. It shatters morale, and you‚Äôre proof of that. 
---
We do a hybrid of ep/gp and loot council. It‚Äôs worked really well so far. EP/GP for 99% of things but loot council steps in to assign things like resist gear (leather shoulders off domo for example) or legendaries that may drop.  If there‚Äôs a tie in priority, the tie breaker is /100. It‚Äôs worked well so far. 
---
It‚Äôs better to keep loot regulated to as impartial a system as possible imo. 
---
Besides, it sounds like that GM was just a greedy lootwhore. Not someone I would want to run with. 
---
On a side note, I‚Äôd love to bring my alt into MC eventually, but not until a little later after we get more people geared up.
---
I have a feeling you were born around then if you think that.
---
It closes the gate that makes a path for you to run to General. When it‚Äôs open you have to do some ledge jumping shenanigans to get over to the General side.
---
If ya say so bud! Looks like your post got removed... again :(
---
Trolls have bow specialization, not NE. And since ranged attacks don't suffer from glancing blow damage penalties, +weapon skill has less relative value for hunters in comparison to melee classes.
---
Zero proof, just some inane circlejerk reddit post.  I don't believe you.
---
I think my real question is did every single person really do less than 200 DPS on Rag? Or am I misreading something here.
---
I feel this. I like to joke sometimes about how DPS don‚Äôt know how to act, but 9 times out of 10, they aren‚Äôt doing anything in a pull that I can‚Äôt course-correct on the fly. If anything it gives me a bit of a workout. Shitty attitudes are so much harder to work around.
---
I don't say that you should always use this, but you realize when you have a warlock that can assess the situation and use other demons and when you have a warlock thats 100% imp and damaging abilities. 
---
Usually it is enough to just run imp / sac, but a warlock that pulls out a succubus on his own for hard trash groups can be incredibly helpful. I had one warlock on the group in DM:N who did a better job on succubus cc than any mage, while beeing top dps. loved the guy.
---
My bro rolls in plate and just crushes mofos all day, goes into 10 mans landing in the same spot as the dude in all leathers.

Claims to not rely on game for friends, regularly comes to forums and stirs shit to get attention. Sad boi.

Gotcha thx!

Yeah totally... that guy plays in some shit guilds.
---
Everything is relative i guess, also got epic mount/edgemasters and consumes to last me 4-5 months.
---
My goal is to farm another 2-3k so i can chill and pvp in p3
---
I‚Äôve clicked that several times and nothing happens.
---
You have got good Points there I didn't think about.
---
You have to think about Blizzard as well though. Structural wise they have to have dedicated Teams for each "Version" of WoW that exists. 
---
If the playerbase splits up too much - I'm going to go over the top here but lets say they would do:
---
Classic, BC, WOTLK, CATA, WOD, MOP, Retail
---
That would be 7 Versions at the same time to maintain. Which at some Point would just not be feasible anymore to the Point they actually loose Money because the dedicated Teams would become so expensive.
---
Then again a restructuring could take place which would allow a couple of Teams to maintain every Version.
---
I defenitely think that there is a way this can be handled but given Blizzard is Actiblizz I think it will take time until we get there.
---
Having Classic be a success is a great start I'd say. Maybe they will continue the trend of re-releasing old expansions and then I'm quite sure we can have both because the community will fight for it :)
---
Could just say: Hey guys, we will implement DKP decay in 4 weeks. Now is your time to get some juicy upgrades until your DKP will start decaying.
---
I mean is that really a good way since you are putting your money generation on a 15% chance ?
---
Still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs totally not needed. Rolling is the most fair. People just accept loot council because they don‚Äôt have alternatives. Besides DKP I guess.
---
And you report them for ninjaing. Blizzards ToS states that if loot rules are clear (and it's very important that the are clear) and someone breaks that intentionally they are breaking the ToS.
---
Yes if you don't do your drugs in moderation you die. The tip doesn't say that anything in moderation is okay, just that everything should be done in moderation including bad habits like heroin and videogames.
---
So I assume this also means that auction house prices are absolutely insane and the server economy in general is super inflated? It sounds like if every guild is doing this, then it sort of negates any benefit to having a lot of gold.
---
You gotta think about gearing and motivation. Finding 40 druids who all want the same tier set and tank/dps/healing gear to raid every week long term would probably be impossible.
---
Awesome, your officers can enjoy wasting their time, because that sounds fucking atrocious.
---
Most of the people are in a guild so they might get the mats and let it craft in the guild. Especially arround lvl 40 every coin matters :D
---
Not affirming anything just stating the facts which you seem to be....jealous of?
---
Really, entire game?! Wow, thanks for the tip.
---
oh no someone is having fun in a game, so cringey! what losers amirite???
---
Well you see blizzard enables only transfers for one faction on Stalagg. So as alliance, I‚Äôm stuck in queue and stuck being farmed mercilessly by the 80% horde. Fun times.
---
When BGs come out, is there a 50-59 bracket , or is it 50-60?
---
I really don‚Äôt understand the reasoning but it kind of made me laugh.

---
Dont talk shit about my thorns trinket of rag! It's *amazing* in many scenarios, however maybe not raiding.
---
Hello there, Alliance friends. We Horde players have those same bush eyes but ours are a lot earlier on in Tirisfal Glades.
---
I farmed the 600g I missed for my mount in about 5 days in BRD (not full time, real-life days). Route optimization definitely is a thing, and I'm not sure if it is worthwhile to skip some areas and reset instead to yield more gp/hr. You just gotta do what works for you.
---
My route was:
---
1. Open the 3 gates, pickpocket dwarves in this area and left side of arena.
---
2. Go to the pyromancer Loregrain. I tried killing him several times, but I died more often than I succeeded. I decided it was not worth the potential corpse run and skipped him. If your gear and talents are good you can kill him for easy money.
---
3. Pickpocket right side of arena and go to the bridge over the gate.
---
4. Jump out of the window and climb the wall to run across the bridge.
---
5. Pickpocket Angerforge &amp; Golem area.
---
6. Pickpocket grimm guzzler
---
7. Pull mobs around Plugger with ale, pickpocket Plugger and then kill him by Line-of-sighting him whenever he casts a spell.
---
8. Open the door and pickpocket the balcony, jump down to the fire elementals
---
9. Pickpocket Fineous Darkvire's area. Mine the dark iron ore if you have mining by sapping a guard (not all spawns are obtainable).
---
10. Pickpocket everything up to the vault, open and loot all vaults except for the one on the left closest to boss. I buy coffer keys at 25s each.
---
11. Jump down to the fire elementals again, go back to entrance of the dungeon while pickpocketing all of the elite dwarves on the road up to Bael'gar.
---
This way you don't need an alt or other logout-reset trick. You simply walk back to the entrance portal and jump out to reset. Pickpocketing the grim guzzler and arena is good because there are loads of mobs. You may think pickpocketing the elite dwarves such as those on the road to Bael'gar is not worth the trouble, but they yield better lootboxes so higher chance of getting good loot. 
---
I found with this method I earned 30-40g/hr on the bare minimum including one or two deaths. This does not include the money from selling superior healing potions, blinding powder, goblin jumper cable patterns and other stuff on the AH.
---
On good runs I could definitely rake in about 50-60g/hr, so those youtube guides aren't lying you just shouldn't assume you will automatically obtain that amount.
---
WOMP WOMP amirite? lol
---
Rip I'm dumb was conflating salad bakers
---
Don‚Äôt worry. The only zone to appreciate is Ashenvale (and Teldrassil I guess) :)
---
Depends on your play style.
---
Feral druids can shift in and out of cat form to regain energy so the 6 piece set bonus isn't as valuable.
---
You also miss out on hit chance, and if you're going to raid it makes upgrading really awkward because you have to choose between equipping an item with better stats vs losing the set bonus.
---
Yes in theory, but it's very uncommon since you'd be farming early parts when you're too low level for emperor, and once you're high enough you don't want to do prison area again. Although you'd have to backtrack a bit to turn in the key if you don't have a rogue or someone with key already.
---
Something like prison -&gt; houndmaster -&gt; ring of law -&gt; pyromancer -&gt; stigliss (coffers) -&gt; fineous -&gt; incendius -&gt; baelgar, then open two doors and shadowforge lock and do the second part the normal way, angerforge -&gt; golemlord -&gt; guzzler -&gt; flamelash -&gt; seven -&gt; magmus -&gt; emperor.
---
Gratz!
---
As a tank, that‚Äôs my spirit animal.
---
Pff, and now you have to level him up from 37 to 60. Do they get XP from end game dungeons? Or because the mobs are to high lvl they don't get XP?
---
Your own statement contradicts itself.
---
"Theyre delaying content to keep people playing, that's why they release DM early" 
---
Wat?
---
Ah you found the Agent Smith of wow
---
So many of my guildies are doing this and I just can‚Äôt justify it. The entire 1-60 experience I told myself I‚Äôd stop binging once I was raid-ready. Now that I am I just log in for raid and if I want to.
---
My buddy is right back at it with an alt. I guess he enjoyed the first 1-60 lol

I wish i had DKP in my guild, rogues getting their 5 set and here i am in full blues. I wish i left my guild earlier. Fuck loot council, i dont want to suck ppl members for loot.
---
why 50% of dkp? They show up and sacrifice their time but don't get to join in the fun. TBH, I'd even consider giving them more than 100% to keep them invested.
---
Nah miss me with that shit, stay muddy boy.
---
I don't think you understand plain numbers but that's really ok, have fun not understanding very simple ingame facts.
---
It literally is, though.
---
Even at 50gph, that's only 50 hours, or 2 days /played. 1-60 is 4-5 days for faster levellers, sometimes double that for casuals.
---
The problem is that most people don't really put their mind to goldfarming seriously, as they A) expect it to be boring and B) expect it to be hard. In reality, it doesn't need to be either - there are so many options to choose from, everyone can find one that works for them. But the stigma sticks.
---
Ahhh! I understand now, I was very confused! I'm a big fan of PVP, but killing lowbies is not PVP.
---
Doubt you‚Äôd use the Disk on earth elementals lol
---
Windnotfound.
---
WSG is P3 content though, isnt it?
---
You get pretty good XP, just need to know how. I boosted all my alts through SM (from 30 to 40).
---
For sure. I would much rather have a dps ass pull an extra pack by accident than one intentionally trying to fuck up our rhythm because it‚Äôs not to their liking. The ass puller is usually embarrassed enough that they pay more attention from that point. The mage trying to set his own pace is much harder to deal with.
---
"Later this year" will get delayed to "Sometime in Q1 of 2020"
---
The advantage you get as a warrior isnt just being able to wear plate. The advantage we get is being able to wear anything. The advantage we get is doing the most dps in the game thus getting prio on the best melee gear, leather or not. Sorry you are salty about that little rogue. 
---
We still put on our plate for pvp and dunk rogues.
---
Idk what you even sayin lol
---
His damage sucked. Low damage is low damage.
---
I believe 60 is its own bracket.
---
Wrong, your calculation does not include the related talents and your bias ignores CoS. Lifetap with the talent restores more mana than just to compensate the regen loss. There is absolutely no reason for a lock to have any gear other than intellect/stamina. Drain life is affected by gear as well, while the wand isn't. Have a look at the gear that a lock can get from warlock quests by lvl 38, and the loot table of instances available by that level, to fix your broken approximation.
---
&gt;Honestly as long as they don't fucking ruin it I'm a happy camper.
---
Source?
---
The new census site based on wclogs gives Gehennas 7k raiders and Firemaw 8k, and some Chinese server has 9k
---
you wear your consumables? Other than PMC's on feral druids, how does that work? :P
---
Can confirm, I am a horde on Grobbulus and love doing wPvP, but it just seems the alliance players go all out on it. In the time it takes me to form a single full raid on a city attack, the alliance has 5 waiting for a counterattack. I'm hoping to change the ways of the horde on Grobb, we WILL have our revenge, you pesky alliance scum.
---
I'm sorry for your loss. I think we get about 5 per full clear I think.
---
true but you know what he's talking about
---
He actually spelled the word pretty well. He only switched a /b/ with a /v/, which are in fact very similar sounds to each other, phoneticslly speaking.
---
aaah, Fuck
---
I did the same and we definitely had to kill some guards on the docks.
---
Honestly, as much as I love WoW Classic, you're going to be the better off of the two of us at the end of the day. I'm going to dump thousands of hours and like $100 into this meaningless world and will never have anything to show for it but perhaps a couple vaguely pleasant memories that I could easily live without. You're absolutely making the right choice.  
---
(Of course I'm lying just to make him feel better, shh!)
---
I pick a piece of gear from the internet and then go get it in game.
---
The joke was that WoW is like heroin, but ok. I guess I can see how it would read that way.
---
It's aight thats why i need on two handers
---
It works fine.
---
Who said I was trusting anything? I'd rather take a shot in the dark than leave.
---
If classic progresses into TBC, that's not a game I want to play.
---
Since they release DM prior to Phase 2 as originally planned. I would not be surprised if BG's would be released before Phase 2. It would also work as a server stress relief in many ways. 
---
Maybe they would first only add WSG or something. But all 3 at once would not surprise me either.
---
That's true. Just saying some classes have bigger incentives to save dkp than others. Luckily I'm in a mostly fair loot council guild so I'm not worried about it.
---
you can absolutely do that. but healing tree isnt that wrong for it either. 25% less totem cost is great for every shaman and 3% hit for spells and Melee is great too.
---
but you can also just go into enhance. im a shammy tank with 0 points in restoration and can still heal decently well with just a secondary healing gear. just have to drink more frequently
---
He was likely SM, so it didn't cut his dps down by 15%, you should read up on lock specs.

Drunken Parrot was originally founded back in 2007 on the Stormrage server. We played the crap out of BC, WOLK, and Cataclysm ‚Äòtill most of us moved on to different games, and different life pursuits. A small core group of RL frainds have returned for classic, and we‚Äôre looking to fill our ranks with other awesome weirdo‚Äôs to share this experience with. We‚Äôre mostly middle aged with families/jobs/responsibilities and varying levels of general dysfunction (but in a fun way!). We don‚Äôt take this game (or much of anything, really) too seriously, we take our time, we level our fishing, we /dance and /cheer, we don‚Äôt much care about efficiencies or leveling guides, we make a lot of corpse runs, we level alts, we play solo, we play in groups, we make bad jokes, we make good jokes, we quote dumb movies, we are silly, we crack wise and act a fool. We are Drunken Parrot.

---
keep jerking yourself off.  its kinda hot.
---
Into a version of the game where it doesn't exist?   It's not trivial.   Don't underestimate the complexity of items and bag rules.  
---
Off the top of my head here are just some of the things needed to be done:  
---
The bag size needs to expand with each new key.  Needs to shrink when you remove a key.  Needs to intercept looting keys to move to bag.  Needs to have a constraint that identify all keys.  Needs to stack keys and not alter bag size if the key is stackable and already exists (coffer keys), but is not a full, and that the stack of keys your moving also fits and not makes it full.  Figure out what was done for keys that aren't keys, like the UBRS key and the mardaron scepter.  Multiply that by interactioning with the bank instead of player bag (banks have different rules, including range checks).  Adding UI to notify player of new key in bag.  Add DB checks to make sure items going into keyring bag fail if they are not keys.   Logic for non-keys in keyring bag to be auto removed and safely returned to you if that mistake occurs...
---
What spec are you running? There‚Äôs a Regrowth spec for that just curious.
---
&gt; nto a version of the game where it doesn't exist?
---
it was in the fucking beta
---
Well unfortunately there is only one guild available on faerlina alliance and thats Olympus - asmongolds fanboys run that server
---
Survivalist isnt that good lol
---
He was a warrior tank who was forced to dps because of people who get butthurt over warriors needing the same dps gear as rogues. Then one got mad at him for that, no pleasing people as intitled as you man...
---
Take your DKP system, figure out what the average earnings are and develop a decay that puts those earnings into a checkmate soft cap.   Then introduce a fixed value for DKP spending.  You said it's hourly so we can look at this example as raiding 3h a week, which is probably averageish for most guilds with many faster and many slower including both raids.
---
The example below will basically cap DKP at 120, with being on time to the raid the only way to get above 100, and this advantage will then cap based on whatever that number is.  Eventually the decay will stop any further collecting.
---
Example: 10DKP/H, 30DKP Max, 10DKP on time bonus with a 33.33% decay.  Players are required to spend at a minimum 50% of DKP to bid for item. 
---
Why: After about 3 weeks of no loot, any hording advantage they had is gone against others.   They cannot horde enough points to take any more than 2 pieces of gear in any one raid.   This will create incentive for them to spend DKP as by not spending it, they are not benefiting any more.  You want the cap to be achieved quickly, but not so quickly that brand new raiders suddenly take what the older raiders have saved for.  Additionally, it's makes being on time to the raid exceptionally valuable to DKP totals, meaning raids kick off smoother than previously.
---
Armor doesnt help against magic.
---
other than that, thanks you for your meaningless reply.
---
The ones in Darnassus are beary good too
---
And if they're male night elf priests, they're usually autorunning into walls and fences
---
Again, queue the dominant faction and the option for a free Faction change and this problem will go away. It will balance the servers. I do not know why Blizzard does not do this.
---
I found the issue with my previous macro! I learned something about `equipslot` that I didn't know before. We have to specify the slot after each break; So it should be like this:
---
    /use [equipped:spellstone]Greater Spellstone
---
    /equipslot [equipped:One-Hand,noequipped:off hand] 16 Zum'rah's Vexing Cane;16 Inventor's Focal Sword
---
    /equipslot [equipped:One-Hand,noequipped:off hand] 17 null;17 Greater Spellstone
---
Also, it doesn't look like `[noequipped:17]` will work. It looks like the `[equipped]` conditional wants the slot name so that has been changed to `[noequipped:off hand]` and it seems to be working now for the testing I can do on a warrior anyway.
---
What exactly are you spending your rage on?? Just spamming sunders?
---
Its in tiristfal too I think
---
 &gt;doing so would cost money and activision blizzard isn't about to spend resources on anything that's not actively making them more money.
---
And they will be surprised Pickachu one day when their stock stops gaining and shareholder value is gone.
---
Alright, weird
---
I ran two GDKPs on Mal‚ÄôGanis in Wrath and like many have said if the raid leader isn‚Äôt a greedy SOB and also puts the work in to find that perfect balance of pure purchases and carries you can achieve a lot with it too. 
---
We were up to 10/12 Heroic in our GDKPs increasing the pots by a lot as all the gear could be BiS.  I think our largest payout was in the 20k per raider range. We hit good cap quite consistently and has to split the pot(this was before gold cap was drastically increased)
---
Tericoti and Friends GDKP was what is was.
---
what if you just leveled during the dungeon? just leave a train that weapon skill? Should the rest of the party wait a while?
---
Agree 100%. I‚Äôm looking for casual raiding and then mostly PVP. But as a war I NEED a legit wep. And would gladly bid that 500+ for spinal or bone reaver
---
Shield slam, shield block, revenge. I don‚Äôt get much rage because I‚Äôm at 46% avoidance
---
in a world pvp environnment, pretty much nothing beat a druid. Even a bad or average druid is frustrating to deal with, much more than a good warrior. A good druid that isn't hilariously outnumbered or outmached can escape from pretty much anything.
---
Just did that yesterday lol. Tanaris to un goro to Tanaris to Felwood. Get ganked. Spirit Rez. Hearth. Log out. Very productive.
---
To put him into context, Alkaizer was so fast to paragon 100 (a feat that took hundreds of hours of grinding), that people refused to believe it could be done by a single person. He was so far ahead people just "knew" he had to be account sharing to farm 24 hours a day.
---
Once he started streamed you saw why. The concept of going fast doesn't exist for him. That's just how he plays. He can keep blasting at max speed for 12 hours without slowing down.
---
Did the boss die? Yes? People are performing fine then.
---
Exactly
---
Well it‚Äôs not wrong
---
&gt;The bag size needs to expand with each new key. 
---
Keyring size is fixed in vanilla. 
---
&gt; Needs to have a constraint that identify all keys.
---
Just like all the bags need to do with all items.
---
&gt;  Figure out what was done for keys that aren't keys,
---
Being a key or not its just a DB value.
---
Also oof
---
yeah they're inputting pvp but they're delaying a keyring in the hopes of you paying longer to wait for a keyring... that totally makes sense.
---
Sort of, but you'll need a key. You can go left from the entrance to the giant boss, then down the paved pathway (Dark Iron Road? or something like that) to the fire elemental boss; follow the path back up from there through Fineous Darkvire to reach the coffers/spawn the Dark Keeper (his location is random) and walk through the Dormitory and cross the bridge to Pyromancer. Jump down in to the Ring of Law, circle around the outside of the caves to grab the houndmaster boss and the roaming earth elemental boss, eventually ending up on the jail side. Complete the loop to end up at the wench to open up the way to Angerforge/the bar, and it's pretty straight forward from there.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why you are wearing so much avoidance gear
---
I've been doing Strat Live runs (orbs/schems/patterns freeroll). Pickpocket everything before opening. 
---
It's not the greatest gold per hour but it nets you cash, and allows you to resupply your poisons, blinding powder (I got 26 powders in one run, never buy fadeleaf again), food, bandages, anything else I might be forgetting. 
---
I'm full combat sword raid spec so I don't have the extra stealth talents.
---
They've already patched the client multiple times...
---
Because I‚Äôm not threat capped
---
I'd expect it to be the second part, as it hits most relevant bosses with minimal backtracking.
---
We recently did a "full run" with 4 people from guild raid geared (had to learn dark iron bar recipe) and grabbed one random mage for aoe, I specifically listed the bosses to avoid confusion but we decided to go back and clear the rest afterwards anyway because it was fun dashing through that place at crazy pace. If it's a group that needs two hours to reach emperor, they're probably happy to get out of that place by the end.
---
Ohh
---
Their DPS heavily depends on crits which is RNG based. Basically if all mage casts the same number of bolt it will usually be the one that crits the most that will be first.
---
Of course gear impact the end result but RNG can be a fact changer as well.
---
No. I knew the first grandmasters when the original pvp system came out. He was a rogue and his method was to kill level 51-60 horde on zepplins. It was easy honor farming once the zepplin left the station. If there is a goblin guard on the boat, this isn't possible anymore.
---
I was going for The Rake because of swag value actually.. the lion mane is cool looking to me. Where can I find other maned lions? There is Humar the Pridelord which is my #1 choice so far but he is rare and contested. Ghost Saber is awesome too, thanks for the tips people :)
---
Any other cool cats to tame?
---
Who bothers with keys? -rogues
---
Yikes, I‚Äôm deeply sorry you‚Äôve had to deal with that. I can‚Äôt imagine being ‚Äútoo proud‚Äù to admit I don‚Äôt know the dungeon. Hell, I haven‚Äôt left BRD in weeks and I still asked the group to let me alt tab for a sec to make sure I was remembering the phalanx encounter correctly. I‚Äôve gotten through a few dungeons only because someone else had better knowledge they were happy to share. Team effort. Go fast or go far, etc. Hope you find some better tanks bud.
---
I have no experience in this realm at all and have done very little raiding, but why not split the group in two and put together two PUGS?
---
Maybe I‚Äôm overestimating how easy it is to fill a PUG.
---

Those are extremely well known though...? Your title should be "What do people who known nothing about their class miss that could be useful". If you're going to wallow with the pigs, expect to get some mud on you.
---
I'll throw you an interesting tidbit I've yet to meet someone who knows about. Shamans can use their purge to purge npc mind control off a friendly player. Because the player is considered an enemy, the NPCs mindcontrol is treated as a positive buff.
---
Haven't been able to test it in PvP but I'm curious.
---
Faeiri fire and leader of the pack.
---
True except pants, its cold!
---
&gt; learn what triggered the ban
---
as in human players observing botting behavior?
---
Not for rogues.
---
Look, come back to me when there's thousand person ques tomorrow. I have zero time or energy to argue any further. Both of you responding to me are delusional. 
---
Classicwow is bursting at the seams, setting franchise records from popularity and we're going to see constant server migration for the foreseeable future.
---
Gun specialization is awful because guns aren't as good as bows / crossbows. The only time it's useful is that it puts Dwarven Hand Cannon (a 250+ gold BoE) slightly ahead of Carapace Spine Crossbow (a high drop rate blue from Strat) in pre raid BiS. But all hunters almost immediately get Rhok delar from raid since it's a 50/50 drop and most raids have few hunters so you're probably going to benefit from your dwarf gun racial very slightly at the cost of a ton of gold for 2-4 MC runs. After Rhok Delar you will never use a gun ever again.
---
Listen man I like the cat, I think he‚Äôs cool
---
The top 9(!) comments on one of the most popular ppsts of all time are all asking for Classic+ to some extent. That's a pretty far cry from "Everyone I've talked to about classic + vs TBC have said TBC because blizz would fuck up classic +. Who are these trusting ppl?"
---
Lord Kazzak sends out shadowbolts to everyone, and heals any time he kills someone, but shadow resist isn't really needed. The only resists that will be worth anything are Fire, Nature, and Frost, really.
---
i rate this cat 11/10 he or she is perfect. look at that wide little nose ;o;
---
(looks like his back claws could use a little trim, though!)
---
Depends on the BG. WSG and AB have 50-59 and 60 as their own brackets, AV has a 51-60 bracket
---
U r gud dorf. 
---
Wen peeveepee begens u wil die last. 
---
                                                                       - A Mankreek Orc
---
I remember getting tokens from battlegrounds (3 for a win, 1 for a loss) that you turned in for rep and even xp prior to level 60. Was that in Vanilla and will it be in Classic? I can't remember.
---
Yeah, high pops with Mega-Guilds will have kills going to the same Mega Guilds week after week.
---
You only switch to threat gear if you *gasp* need the threat. 
---
Otherwise, you‚Äôre just straining healers for no good reason.
---
The same can be said about mages not learning lvl 55 water or warriors refusing to get defstance at level 10. Takes time, you need to invest.
---
WSG 2.5, AV 3, AB 3.5 is probably the way to imo
---
Paid for my mount pretty quick, you can fit in 5 attempts in 30 minutes. The worst part is deciding to run out or getting naked and corpse running back.
---
This is my tree, there are others like it but this one is mine
---
Also high end weapons you‚Äôre aiming for as a hunter are mostly not guns
---
Genius
---
Looks like I'm just misinformed then. You think it's better XP than running with a group?
---
Could‚Äôve been justifiable if 15 agi was in the game but now it‚Äôs just a dick move tbh
---
We had some 200+ person battles at BRM without issue.
---
I suspect part of the issue with cities is all the random players just hanging out.
---
My plan is to just prep for TBC and Wrath as they are almost guaranteed to come out at somepoint.
---
If i end up enjoying classic endgame then so be it. Worst case im already prepped for the expansion and resub when it comes out.
---
As your time is also wasted.
---
So the regrowth spec is what all those top druids were using which makes sense. I am actually 30/0/21 which is a balance pvp spec. Moonglow lowers the mana of all my cast making it viable. I have around 5k mana and 300 plus healing. I was honestly surprise how well the strategy worked. I would precast rank 9 regrowth right before the main tank went in so they get healed ASAP and Druid a rejuv in the batch. Worked like a charm. Do you want the link to these top raiding resto druids? I don‚Äôt mind providing it. You can see what they cast overall and on every boss fight. It made a worlds difference from me.
---
NA REPRESENT!
---
Just the queue numbers. Since launch Gehennas has had the largesr queues and still seems to have during primetime.
---
Apparently although technically we've already had patches implemented since before even Dire Maul came out.
---
I think it's more they're just having issues getting it added back in correctly.
---
It is likely due to one particular pedant at blizzard, who gains sexual pleasure from correcting someone who tries to use patch/phase interchangeably.
---
I dunno I think we need a couple more
---
And I‚Äôd be willing to bet *gasp* that your threat generation isn‚Äôt good and your dps are probably having to hold back
---
I'd like to add that boomkins pair great any aoe for dungeons. Can easily top the dps charts while dungeoning. Have tank pull 4 or 5, blast a moonlaser at everything then hurricane.  All the armour you have lets you go balls to the wall on dps.
---
He probably got hit by 20 lightning bolts at the same time and never recovered
---
He said, describing what needs to be done for a homework assignment he did 15 years ago... We‚Äôre throwing millions of dollars at these guys. With the amount of resources blizzard has at their disposal, writing this code isn‚Äôt difficult enough to be delayed (to my estimation) 3 times.  Give them more credit than that.
---
The rest I understand but I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone using flasks in MC. Why do you do this?
---
It's populated by a bunch of cry babies, who want to think that the person who killed them in PvP was a "hacker", instead of realize that they are playing a game with limitation like aggro ranges.
---
I talk with all of my dps to discuss that. No one is holding back.
---
Knockback drops aggro by 25%. It's really easy for a geared warrior to pull aggro if they go all out in p1.
---
Yeah, on some bosses that drop aggro, it's a PITA to manage. 
---
I'm a healer in raid situations. I'm nearly full healing pre-bis finally! Got the damn Robes of the Exalted at 3am last night.
---
As a warrior I don't care about a Hunter's CS. My rage generation from Charge is vastly more important.
---
As a pre-bis rogue, could I solo farm [Ribbly Screwspigot](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=9543/ribbly-screwspigot)
---
Cept when you get melted when you have no stamina
---
"citation missing"
---
That server was claimed for the Latin American guilds and countries. Has nothing to do with time zones as they go vertically down the world and hit many countries.
---
Ditto
---
I mean maybe if alliance didn‚Äôt transfer in droves off of only marginally unbalanced realms (Kromcrush went from almost even to approx 60H:40A) we wouldn‚Äôt be having this problem. Instead of faction-based queues maybe we should force transfer all player characters back to their realm of origin?
---
You need rules in place for things like this. I'm not a fan of DKP for a bunch of reasons but you need things like:
---
 - Forced upgrades. If nobody wants an item, but it's useful for someone, force it upon the person who needs it most and charge them a set amount of DKP for it.
---
 - DKP Decay - people lose a set amount of DKP Per week. This helps with hoarding because they can only keep so much and will hate losing DKP each week so they'll start spending it.
---
Shaman!
---
Except your a Druid, so you don‚Äôt do anything. Griefing lowbies is part of the game. It was done before me, and it will be done after me. I was griefed. And I never came to Reddit to complain about it? If your level 60 is on Herod, come duel me and I‚Äôll clap dem cheeks
---
How can I see if the hunter clipped a auto with his aimed shot, or if the fury delayed his blood thirst by 2 seconds?
---
Scatter &gt; FD/trap &gt; get range &gt; aimed &gt;multi
---
Bone slicing hatchet exists.
---
Manastorm is a solid upgrade for shamans and paladins if u have nothing better
---
65% attack speed for 10 min
---
I went full pvp spec and the trap spec is the most amazing thing. Had a fury warrior rooted for about 20seconds
---
We used to use a similar system to DKP, except much more complicated. The point is, we had the exact same issue.
---
They eventually swapped out the system for a modified /roll system.
---
Or if you're collaborating with other guilds which is common.
---
I think different people just have different definitions of shitty. I‚Äôve done some slow runs through BRD with groups that struggled, but they were friendly and took criticism well and for all the struggle, I know they came out better players who will have a better understanding of the instance going into their next group. Hell, I felt like it made me better tank because it gave me a better sense of problem spots, things to call out on future runs, etc. Granted, not everyone wants to do that, and I certainly don‚Äôt want all my runs to be that way, but as someone else said in here, there‚Äôs no correcting shitty attitudes. There‚Äôs no learning or growth when a player ignores you, or pretends problems are someone else fault, or just decides they‚Äôre gonna go ahead and pull whenever they damn well please even when you‚Äôve asked politely that they hang back a bit. 
---
TL;DR: I believe shitty is a mindset more than a skillset. Come as you are, but your goal should be to come out of the instance knowing and understanding more than you did when you walked in. I‚Äôll keep those guys around.
---
Wait, there was a version of wow where you needed a torch?
---
I think the game's stat assignments are often just fine, but I've found that people immediately ignore half the equation and just use +Healing as their standard. You can see it in the BiS lists, so I just wanted to clarify that there are actually a lot better options in some cases.
---
Nah ur overthinking this. It‚Äôs a fucking key ring dude
---
How is this an empty city?  It's not wall to wall alliance, so what?  You also don't have the time posted, so are we looking at prime time, 2am?
---
Rule 7... Google it.
---
I can somewhat speak to this, I was MT in BC, I was OT/DPS in late vanilla, and I healed/ranged dps in MoP so I've pretty much seen all aspects of raiding.
---
Very very few fights are fights that everyone just tools up, stands in one spot and goes HAM. Patchwerk is probably the only boss that does that. 
---
I just did an onyxia where I was third dps, despite being melee and not damaging anything during phase 2, and forgot to unequip my shield in phase 3 until 5% and I'm in all blues (with some greens sprinkled in). So I also run into this currently.
---
The main thing, is knowing the fight, being conservative and smooth with your damage, and knowing your skills and WHY they should be used when they're used.

Really the main thing is that positioning as melee is huge, you have to know when and where to be and when to dps, you can't just dump abilities right off the bat, many players want to do that and then the boss or add turns and it fucks things up. Also for casters, they need to know their top sustained dps rotation, and bring mana consumables. If they just dump things then sit for 70% of the fight at 0 mana then it's no good.
---
While leveling my buddy and I saw a ?? ‚ÄúMage‚Äù mining a mithril ore I wanted. So he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a mage, we can kill that‚Äù. So I Ravaged. And was greeted with DEATH COIL NDJCNDNC death.
---
That was not a mage :(
---
I really felt useless, the worst part is that I got really lucky on greed rolls‚Ä¶.
---
(\*\^$(&amp;%98$%
---
WTF
---
Yeah, i guess some people have jobs and relationships outside of the game, unable to find time to keep up with the leveling. crazy i know lol
---
Fucking BOOOOOOOO. Why does this piss me off so much?
---
But then you're still looking at very slim chances to get anything. Basically everyone should pretend that Azuregos/Kazzak loot isn't in their BIS lists.
---
Like the other guy said both dreamweave gloves and circlet should sell. The + frost dmg and + shadow damage greens also tend to sell in my experience. Do you have enchanting as well? Last time I leveled tailoring I mostly crafted the cheapest greens then disenchanted. When I could finally make runecloth bags I sold dozens of  those.
---
How many full spec healers do you have, though? My current guild is a bit lower on healing so stuff dies quickly and the raid in general goes fast, but I spend a lot of mana keeping people alive because the amount of incoming damage compared to the amount of healing available is high. However my last guild had a ton of healers so I was lucky if I could get off a rank 2 Heal without getting sniped and it was mostly brainless.
---
So my point is, your MC experience is *very heavily* dependent on raid makeup.
---
mmmmh no.
---
Yes there are a lot of healers, but SP is not on high demand to farm dungeons. Need to regen every pack, no real AoE ..
---
Or people will pass on items, horde their DKP for the rare/coveted stuff and pick up everything else on free roll.
---
There are plenty of guilds. Just ask around in trade chat or whisper people you pug with. The notion that Olympus is the only set of guilds on the server is just plan wrong.
---
They merge like with like.  RP-PvE with RP-PvE.
---
That's what I realized, guess it's a learning experience.
---
If you can't handle it, then yes its the right decision.
---
Work on your own discipline. You should be entitled to enjoy playing the game and also being able to fufill the rest of your responsibilities. There are lots of fathers/mothers who play this game in a healthy way. Realistically, what does the game look like for them?
---
Only playing for an hour or two a night, maybe thats three quests and some professions, or one dungeon run. It will take them months to get to 60, and thats ok. It is what I do.
---
*hello darkness my old friend*
---
Wait that might means that if I swap thr staff condition with the noequipped off hand I can save myself from mistakebly clicking and activating the reset on the Spellstone
---
*vendors two-hander*
---
You still here?
---
This gives me hope. 
---
I'm still pre raid at lvl. 53 hahahahaha 
---
I haven't even been on a raid yet
---
No, you stay on the bottom floor, use your key to get to the Dark Iron Highway or whatever it's called, and fight your way to baelgar.
---
You don't HAVE to go upstairs from the arena. The tunnel that you walk down to get to the arena from the bottom floor is a circle; it mirrors the tunnel on the Jail side.
---
Well thanks for the post anyways, trying to get people to think by themselves instead of looking at dubious lists is a good fight.
---
Found the horde player
---
Are you sure you checked with the one in the hut and not the regular master engineer who stands outside? If so, I believe you might have fucked up in the order of things. 
---
&gt; Afterwards took the "soothsaying book for dummies" event. I then dropped engineering and re leveled it.
---
This should have been reversed. You should have leveled to 200 (225 to be safe) and *then* used the book to pick goblin. This is what I believe went wrong, I'm not an expert so keep that in mind.
---
the amount of healer you bring is based off the number of cast you can throw per unit of time.
---
IE: gear doesn't matter, you still need X people to dispell, or heal 4-5 target at once on garr/domo, or spread people around on rag.  Going under 6 healer just bring risk without much gain... nevermind that at this point 4 out of those 6 healers are DPS'ing on magmadar  or golemagg.
---
more mana / mp5 has no value at all in MC.
---
This is what happens when you basically try to run an emulation of a game through a different engine. They aren't just opening an old version of the client for us they are trying to emulate the game. Because of the way Legion systems work with keys, mounts, pets, etc all no longer being items and being apart of collections, hunters no longer requiring mana, pet maintenance, dead zone etc. You begin to have all these odd issues pop up that weren't in vanilla. They cut corners to save development costs and time and it's causing issues that now are taking forever to fix.
---
 That and I have a suspicion that they still aren't being provided adequate dev team for Classic since Activision thought it be a self-running money maker. Don't see any other reasons why months go by with no big patch and only 2-3 are hot fixed a month.
---
Get rid of that cereal box PC
---
Yeag guess it's a learning experience.  Group was very nice but we were flying.
---
Awesome, thanks for the reply! It sounds like I‚Äôm doing everything you‚Äôre doing. I have 3/5 imp mind blast, between any movement and latency, I never noticed that extra 0.5s - mind blast seems to always be up after two flays for me. I‚Äôll look into down ranking mind flays when I starting low on mana, I always forget about down ranking as dps...
---
 Most of my gear is a mix of BiS and optimal BiS, like crimson gel hat vs Felcloth hood. I only have one raid epic (the belt from major domo), but I‚Äôm lacking two good trinkets (reed and mindtap) and a wand. Hoping to break 300 +dmg soon!
---
But if you already have the key you could just use the route I suggested, which has no backtracking.
---
As others have said, there's the issue that most MC fights just don't need that much mana, so it's largely wasted. But the other counterpoint is that you aren't counting the added efficiency of mana pots and mana regen that +healing brings.
---
+healing effectively gives you more healing per mana. Assuming your mana regen is going to stay pretty constant in a high int vs. high +heals fight, you're effectively getting more healing throughput per each MP5 on the +healing build. On top of that, in BWL you'll get the T2 3 piece set pretty quickly; which means you're looking at 30% mana regen continuing in combat on top of MP5.
---
With pots, again you get effectively more healing out of a major mana pot with 600 +heals vs. 400 +heals. More int, on the other hand, has zero scaling with mana pots, runes, or flasks. And once you're looking at mana pots, runes, and flasks; you realize it's pretty hard to justify a larger mana pool when there are tons of consumable options that effectively double or triple your mana pool already. So an extra 1k mana, while that might look like a 15-20% increase, is actually only 5-10% in any fight that actually matters.
---
I mean, shield and plate help with their auto's but my memory is they had a pretty nasty earth shock type spell which was the real killer with multiple adds tanking if they all popped it at once.
---
I‚Äôm in Grobb and have a blast in WPVP. It feels very even. Control of areas constantly rotating. That being said, any time there‚Äôs a post about MASS wpvp battles, Ally seems to win by a landslide. I haven‚Äôt taken part in them so I wouldn‚Äôt no much about it, just what I‚Äôve seen. I haven‚Äôt really noticed many PvP focused horde guilds but I figured you only notice them when they‚Äôre the other faction killing you
---
&gt;When you want to farm plants or anything in wow vanilla you have to face wpvp. Same going to dungeons or raids. I think that wpvp died afterwards. Classic makes you spending more time in the open world.
---
Well, I guess some people would enjoy that. I don't. I'm not interested in starting a 30 minutes fight with various other people over 1 grom's blood or dreamfoil or whatever. I'm also not particularly fond of having to ride for 10 minutes to reach a flightmaster, so that I can then fly for 6 more minutes from A to B (think Undercity-Kargath). It's not a lot of fun to be on one continent and to then have to get to Orgrimmar so that you can wait for a zeppelin to get to undercity, so that you can then fly to wherever. It's also not fun to have to swim for 10 minutes to get to a specific place, because the only other option you've got (unless you can stealth) is to try to ride through 100 mobs in your way.
---
Like you said, Classic does make you spend more time in the open world. The only problem with that is that I don't have a lot of time on my hands. This isn't 2004 anymore - a lot of us now have jobs, families and various obligations. It's not "fun" anymore. I also don't find it too rewarding to do that anymore. Have you ever spent 20 minutes fighting your way into a silithus cave for a rich thorium vein that gives you 3 x thorium ore and nothing else? Not what I'd call fun.
---
I used to enjoy spending that amount of time back when a playing session meant 10 hours. That's .. just not the case anymore. 
---
Other than that, if you really think that WPVP died with flying mounts, I'd say you just haven't been to the Elemental Plateau in Nagrand. That place made STV look like a peace conference. Skettis dailies (I generally hate dailies, but those weren't TOO bad) and the primal mana farming spot in that haunted village in Netherstorm were also (in)famous for WPVP.
---
There's also the buff factor. Take a look at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIeiuS9NyNw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIeiuS9NyNw) . I don't know about you, but having to farm 20 different things for buffs is just not OK with me anymore.
---
Then you've got the fights. Heroic Shadow Labs (second boss) is probably 20 times harder than any boss in classic. It's all an endless stream of tank and spank fights.
---
Then you've got class viability (yes, there were elemental shamans, prot paladins and moonkins in BC raids).
---
Then you've got a bit of balance class-wise with blood elf paladins and draenei shamans in BC.
---
Then you've got...a lot of other stuff. But I'm not here to trash classic. I sort of like it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's just... foreplay and I'm waiting for the real thing. 
---
To be clear, I don't want classic to go away, because I'm sure a lot of people prefer it. I just want BC/WOTLK servers too.
---
To follow my friend who wanted to transfer off but he quit shortly after anyways. So now I'm stuck on a server I didn't really want to go to anyways.
---
Dungeon 2 hander? Go ahead I have bonereavers edge lil bitch.
---
Point of the GDKP lead is to balance the raid so there will be comp for gear and not to have item get wasted/min bid along with making sure enough gear people balance out the undergeared. That's part of the work in forming these.
---
LOL I love all the people posting these screenshots of their ques that also have the character migration button. I'm just over here laughing because your solution is literally in your screenshot. You are complaining about a think with a screenshot of the solution to your complain...and somehow they don't see the irony...
---
Who bothers with rogues? -everyone
---
But at-least you got invited because you are a mage! That's the hardest part of the gearing experience for us druids.
---
Yea it's a very long process for night elves to get to eastern kingdom.
---
And if you do quests waiting for someone to send you there you will be waiting until maybe like level 16+, probably even later, although I think there is a quest that sends you to talk to a dwarf in IF, although I haven't played alliance in a while.
---
Essentially, the only way night elves have to get to eastern kingdoms is to take the boat from auberdine to wetlands. From wetlands you have to either run all the way to ironforge, or use an "exploit" (though it's not really an exploit) where you run along the coast of wetlands and die in a specific area, I forget where it is now but there is a guide on youtube that will explain it better, and when you die in that specific spot it will send you to a graveyard in the dwarf starting area. Then from Ironforge you need to take the tram to Stormwind and you'll be ready to play with your son.
---
But yes. it's probably the worst run that any race has to get to a different capital. 
---
If you do the run do NOT forget to pick up the flight paths in wetlands, IF, and SW. You could probably even get the one in the loch.
---
I‚Äôve already bought gold because I just don‚Äôt have the time to farm. For me, it makes way more sense to spend $500 buying 2,000 gold than spending a week farming it myself. As for getting banned, I‚Äôve seen bots in Sithilus farming non-stop for over a month and they have yet to be banned. If they‚Äôre untouched I‚Äôm pretty sure the people buying have nothing to worry about.
---
Horde is just the more popular faction for PVP servers / players.
---
Almost all servers are horde favored so not many want to go to the one alliance server that has an alliance favored population.
---
I understand that and I agree with faction based queues as an idea, but I think that the current message and policy will bring more balance to the server.
---
Getting people to transfer off, and getting people to transfer off in a significant enough number to make an impact are different things.  The end result is and always has been the same, the original server continues to skew more and more toward the imbalanced faction.
---
This is a big reason why they started doing sharding, which was to counter a lot of the faction imbalances on servers.  Putting a bunch of low pop servers together in the hopes it would solve something, which it largely didn't.  They started doing it with the world to force more balanced zones.  The result was to make the effect less pronounced out in the world.
---
The solution blizzard made for this problem was sharding, and people have decided they don't want it.  People aren't transferring off big servers in a large enough amount to make a difference.  The lower end factons aren't getting support because less people are interested in being on the 30 end of a 70/30.
---
This has always been the issue, people would rather be on a super populated faction/server than on a lower populated one.  They would rather complain about queue times and overfarmed economy than take solutions given to them.  I understand why they do it, but solutions are offered but people don't take them.  Blizzard implemented sharding to largely counter the effect in the open world and people have bitched about that too.
---
There are solutions, people just don't want them.  The only solution people want is for people who aren't them to be moved off the server while they remain.
---
I did Teldrasil then boat to Menethil, ran to Ironforge and Deeprun to Stormwind at lvl 10/11 on my druid. Died to crocs at least once in Wetlands. But bear form helps a bit! Remembering to remove thorns for running helps too haha!
---
really? that could ne fun..
---
Okay and?  The point of a loot system is to distribute gear based on participation.  That would still be happening.
---
Ah yes, the Porkefir, native to Dun Morogh iirc.  It's said that the wood smells of bacon when burned.
---
Correct. This should ONLY switch back to your main weapon set IF you have a one-hand equipped but your off-hand is empty. So you will never switch back to your main weapon set without first using the spellstone.
---
Its server lag not my computer
---
Problem is that private servers offloaded a lot of checks to the client so the server didn't have problems... That is a big no no. 
---
Stop comparing the 2 as if private servers are the epitome of the vanilla experience when you dont even try to think of reasons that one runs smoother than the other.
---
Priest T1is BiS pvp gear at the moment.
---
Sure, cats are cool, but what's the connection to wow?
---
Apes actually has a token boomkin (at least had) because the buff cap causes hots to drop off people and you need at least 1 druid in a raid. They're mostly offhealing though from what i've heard.
---
yes it's easiest that way
---
Overall i think mages, way more flexible. But hunter can do solo DM tribute and you can sell the items for a lot of gold.
---
Bro, I'm in Sulfurus and Horde. All I do is PvP. I'm almost 60, though, and my bro and I just wreck in Un'Goro all day.
---
Taking my time is chill and fun in retail. I'm in no super rush down. Which is great!
---
5 points... that‚Äôs not a big deal in a dungeon and not worthy of the int buff. 
---
Leveled recently in a dungeon and before we even got to last boss my skill was maxed.
---
This is what I want haha, I might just tough it out on Sulfuras for a while long since I playing horde.
---
The warrior asked the druid if he has battle about. I‚Äôd bet money that warrior was taking out of his ass and the threat meter showed the Druid just fine.
---
Sorry to be a colossal mansplainy asshole douche right now, but 27 : 1,000,000 is equal to 1 in 37,037, which quite far off from 1 in 1,000,000. :D 26 times farther, in fact.   
---
To put that in perspective, you'd need to get arcane crystal 3x in a row 27 times to reach what 1 in 1,000,000 feels like.  
---
Or you could get Arcane Crystal 4 times in a row, which you would have a 1 in 1,234,567.9 chance to do.  
---
If you were picking up a friend who was 27 miles away, and you'd only driven 1 mile, you probably wouldn't say "I'm basically there now for all anyone cares."  
---
No one's listening anymore, are they? I profoundly apologize, I don't know why I'm like this.
---
in this comment chain u proved that you have much to learn. 
---
how alot of mages fight hunter ? polly the hunter, kill pet, kill hunter. 
---
How warrior fights hunter, if hunter opens on them? Hit the pet while moving to hunter, if you can, kill pet.
---
Rogues ? Sap hunter kill pet kill hunter. 
---
 For BM hunters pet is huge part of dmg its always beneficial to kill pet first, if you can cc hunter, or for mele who are getting kited. 
---
mele on you and you cant fet away ? FD + Ice trap move to max range and kite him.
---
I have full time job im just not a scrub loool.
---
It doesnt take 4 months to hit 60 and have a life dude.
---
It's not though. Grabbing pizza is never wasted time.
---
Because they need to keep making cute new pets to sell us in retail to keep up with fortnite instead of actually improving the game. Priorities, man.
---
Damn man, you beat me to it!
---
Yeah if your crashing or lagging just from a bunch of people standing in an area it‚Äôs your potato not the game
---
Deathcoil into fear and full dots followed by aggroing two mobs and fear still lasts full duration and you die.
---
That is not true. Most guilds are not like that. Never been in one and I played wow since launch.
---
i'd like to see a video of a good bot.
---
People were bitching about queues even with new servers.  So you have an overpopulation of people who are determined to sit in queue while there are enough servers for everyone to play now, without any queues.
---
You did this to yourself, reddit.  You told everyone to sit tight because the new servers would be dead and as a result of no one transferring, they will die.  So you get stuck in your ongoing queue while you spit on the ways to mitigate the problem.
---
Hm. This all makes sense. Thanks everyone.
---
I one shotted it last night using only 2 bandages and 1 holy water. I was very aware of the 5 second rule. I wanded down multiple waves of dudes and made sure I had renew on mid health targets and a low rank flash heal on low ones. Dispelled diseases. I only used holy nova a hand full of times when the waves were stacking up. It doesn‚Äôt heal the wanderers so it‚Äôs really only good for clearing. I‚Äôd try rank 4 or 3
---
I think you‚Äôre mixing up exactly what he did. So he can‚Äôt Blind you 4 times unless the fight was just extremely long, but he can blind you twice if he resets it with Preparation.
---
He can‚Äôt hurt you in a sap but he likely sapped you into stun then started DPS. Without break trinkets right now rogues can basically kill anyone in a stun aside from tanks / mages
---
And he said hunters have pets. I belive i fount huntard here.
---
As a War?
---
[I think this is my spec](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=paladin&amp;t=HBHCHDHEHFHcHdHeHgHfIUHtHuHvHGHhHiHjHkHlGJGKGLGMGNGTGUGVGWGXHVHWHXGrGsGtGuGvGYGZG0IaHnG8G9G.G~G-HaHbIb), at work right now so not 100% sure but this sounds right. Basically all you're missing is 5% crit as a healer. And you've got pretty much everything in the prot tree.
---
this.
---
I roll for every upgrade because the item you're waiting for might not even drop
---
It was a thing of awe
---
Lying
---
Going to blow your mind here: What is true today isn‚Äôt necessarily true for tomorrow and next week. Good isn‚Äôt always going to remain at today‚Äôs price. It was 3$/1g near launch and it‚Äôs 1$/4g now. How about two months from now?
---
Are you even aware of phasing lol? Its not the same realm players all together, its a mix of many realms
---
Fusion
---
Bring oil of immolation to deal with skeletons. I also brought a Thornling seed from DM and popped that bear the cave around phase 3 and that will tank and kill a lot of skeletons
---
If your healers aren't running low on mana than the raid can afford to have some of them go DPS to increase clear times.
---
Oh shit... you're supposed to spend time with your kid? Play with them? Give then real life experiences? Man I'm so glad you, random redditor, taught me how to dad.
---
Notice I said "when" she wants to play with toys. Shes gets bored of us and it's good to not hold them all the time. We talking here and there homie. Not hours on end. Lordy. I wouldnt post it here in public if I was being actual shite. But thanks!
---
The thought behind this is really cool, but coming from Everquest and Dark Age of Camelot over the years, the torch concept sucked. Especially in Everquest.
---
That sucks. I'm fine with 60-40 though. Once it gets to that point though they should start restricting transfers or queues to make sure it doesn't get more lop sided. 
---
Faction based queues are a proposed solution because it is a less jarring way to try to balance realms. 
---
Sure, forced transfers would more quickly balance things, but its a much more drastic measure. Don't you think? Splitting up friends and guilds without any consent or choice from the players sounds terrible.
---
I'm not saying faction based queues are the perfect answer. Just a possible solution. There's no easy way to fix massive imbalances. Some people will be inconvenienced.
---
Why the fuck did you roll healer then?
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to do what the sole purpose of my class is and then bitch about it.‚Äù
---
Do I believe Blizzard when they said that the removal of layering would increase queues (which actually happened), or do I believe this guy on Reddit that says Blizzard is lying?
---
This is such a ridiculously bullshit hypothetical.
---
If the "hoarders" are getting stuff "for free," then it's because literally everyone else has it already.  Which means the non-hoarders are getting geared much more quickly.
---
Basically, it's quantity v quality.  The Non-Hoarder will pick up 3-4 pieces of Arcanist/Netherwind, while the Hoarder waits for his ToeP or Mageblade.  Now that the Hoarder has his coveted item, he starts going for Arcanist/Netherweind.  At the same time, now the Non-Hoarder is able to pick up the next ToeP/Mageblade for much cheaper after having already collected multiple Arcanist/Netherwind.
---
People are still getting geared.  And over the span of a few months, they'll both be equally geared with fairly equal investments.  One just prioritized something over the other...WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE ENTIRE FUCKING POINT OF DKP.
---
For reference, I'm a Non-Hoarder.  There's only a couple items that would be upgrades that I would pass on, like Sapphiron Drape for example - it's just somewhat shitty relative to other easily obtainable options.  If an Arcanist/Netherwind item drops, I'm bidding on it.
---
Mooncloth bags are really consistent. Buy mooncloth when it is lower. Sell bags when the prices are higher. I make 3-6g per bag on my server. Crafting mooncloth yourself will net you some easy income every 4 days as well.
---
Awesome thanks mate - wasn‚Äôt aware this existed. I actually think it‚Äôs pretty cool they have that in place to try and keep RP realms in keeping with their nature

---
For level 60 yeah, but you shouldn't really use different ranks of heals while leveling because you have no +healing so it's not mana efficient. Use max ranks while leveling.
---
Lmao what great reasoning.
---
186 minute queue for me last night.  Really sucks to be excited for a fresh week of raiding to find out that you'll not be playing at all that evening.
---
At least I worked on my guitar skills for a bit in Rocksmith.  So I have that going for me.
---
Once got ganked in STV but the third time I managed to run them into a Gurubashi Guard behind a tree. Enjoy your repair cost losers
---
Sounds like my average Strat UD run.
---
Down rank your healing spells for the peasants to preserve mana. Oils of immolation and Stratholme Holy Water are also pretty handy.
---
That's the trade off when you choose to spend all your DKP early to get those epics first. You lose buying power later on.
---
Who the fuck is DE'ing a Vendorstrike at this point in the game?!!
---
Guy below me got to it first, so there was no need.
---
No different than other systems effectively.
---
Under other systems fully geared players are still expected to keep raiding to help other players gear up so they can tackle harder raiding content in the future.
---
Dont forget to pick up the quests in burning steppes for LBRS, there are like 3 I think and give little pets
---
nah, the way we do it is each player prepares two items they want in order 1. or 2., then if your item drops you either get it or roll against whoever else shares it. however if someone has ur item as 1 and yours is 2, its theirs.
---
some people do three or four item lists we do 2 to keep it simple
---
theres a bit more nuance than that, and we have a cap on items per week
---
in practice, its basically led to our guild self-organizing loot drops and it leads to a clean run with no drama
---
That'd be the one! 
---
Sorry you're having trouble understanding what the developers of the game intended and are looking for any possible way to easily farm honor without retaliation. It really sucks that you're going to have to actually pvp on fair grounds now. Who knows, maybe you'll actually improve!
---
Hopefully my other reply to your comment helps explain exactly what the developers intended. It's quoted in the actual post but you're having trouble understand that for whatever reason.
---
No we‚Äôre waiting for bwl, just a lot of
---
Bank space. Notable last night was tier
---
2 Druid pants
---
Yeah I know it by now... OP postet a link from a pvp video where the druid is using noggenfogger and stay all the time a skelett...
---
I‚Äôm a rogue and this is way too real lol
---
Ya, for every set of rules there's almost always some that are ignored. The will of those being regulated has always determined what rules actually get followed. If people overwhelmingly ignore a rule it's enforcement becomes virtually impossible.
---
What did you end up using? Bite or claw?
---
We are this much closer to skynet.
---
I have a question about the class specific warlock trinket you can get by doing the quest in Dire Maul North. 
---
You can get this quest by looting a book. This starts a quest which you turn in in DM:N. The book goes for 70s (SILVER!!) on my server and there's plenty of them on AH. The quest itself is super easy and you can just do it yourself by hugging the wall and entering the library... 
---
Why are these things so cheap on the AH? The trinket itself is quite good (20 or so shadow spell damage?). Should I buy all these books and put them on AH for a couple of G's?
---
Consider waiting till lvl 10 to make the trek. Just for the fact that some classes (druid, hunter) have some important class quests at 10 that you dont want to skip. Unless you enjoying not shapeshifting or having a pet.
---
they said due to spaghetti code, they couldnt change it, proceeded to change it some months after.
---
Where did you find this out? I'm interested
---
I did the starting zone, ran to Darnassus, flew to the boat that leads to the wetlands, walked to iron forge, took all the flight points I encountered, took the train to sw and quested in the human zone since I like it more. And yes, it was worth it since I main a druid.
---
To add to this (though idk if they‚Äôre required) but save some/look into what‚Äôs required for sulfuron hammers, especially if you have multiple people going to craft Sulfuras,hand of rag
---
I always dies when I types dammit
---
That's good info. I knew it scaled well, I just didn't know at which point it did. Now I do.
---
Tomorrow shall be glorious. LOKTAR OGAR!!!!!
---
I know.  
---
I don‚Äôt even really have to pay attention now as I just instinctively hit my cds on time ( your mind just knows that when your eyes catch that icon hitting the end of its trail that it‚Äôs time to tap)
---
Many people who rely on stealth and surprise actually talk about how much they enjoy the addon because they're able to watch the enemy scramble around and pop cooldowns trying to find them when they're just hiding on a rock.
---
IKR, was being sarcastic about it. MCP is also BIS consumable for the brand new spelladins
---
If you're planning on just going straight tanking build and never dps or doing any PvP then just stick all the points in primal fury and feral aggression. That's 7 points right there. The 8th point doesn't really matter I guess, nothing obvious comes to mind. I guess being able to throw insect swarm on a mob before shifting into bear is the most utility you could get out of the point, but I'm not sure if you'd bother doing that consistently (I wouldn't).
---
Well you just confirmed your retardation, you are in the wow subreddit discussing in a wow matter. Your life will not end just because you admit you were wrong, try it next time you run out of ammunition in a discussion, promise you will feel better.
---
To rave*
---
For some people the game just isn‚Äôt a priority.  It‚Äôs not a big deal. I just prefer doing other things sometimes. If farming nodes is what brings you joy in life I‚Äôm not gonna stop you from being happy.
---
Whoch bugs do you mean? I know ot's harder to feign and trap but I havem't seen sources from actual vanilla about how hard it was.
---
Other than that I haven't seen amy huge bugs.
---
I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about how much spaghetti code could there possibly be, and the idea of "just spend 2 months rewriting it". It's sometimes that simple, but usually never that simple.
---
Like others have mentioned they ended up doing some sort of work around hack. Which just further complicates it. It's a vicious cycle.
---
Having no baseline CC means any CC you can get your hands on will not DR with your baseline CC though. Mortar and grenades are not hard to get. You can get a Tidal Charm as well. Then there's rocket helm, magic dust, although yeah you wouldn't use those all the time. Still, grenades are cheap, 1 minute cd and give you time to heal to full or setup a burst combo.
---
You can only transfer to PvP servers right? Bigglesworth is pretty 50/50 Horde and Alliance and there's never a shortage of players online at one time. I really like it
---
Whats that pic from?
---
believe it or not the zeppelins are extremely useful for leveling alliance to get from STV to SM. I always love bubble dropping in front of my group heading to SM, this will be more difficult now
---
Fuck you Blizz!
---
The easy thing with dps is every is simply math.  Yes, there is a way to figure out relative weights for the various stats and how they affect you.  The issue is they are dynamic based on your other stats.  The more spell power you have, the more valuable crit becomes and the more crit you have the more valuable spell power becomes.  There are general rules you can follow where the breakdowns can be "close enough", bu they are going to sway back and forth over time.
---
Also casters don't have a crit cap on non-binary spells like shadowbolts since they use two rolls to determine if they are resisted or not before rolling the crit chance.  You can only really crit cap on binary rolls, even then casts aren't going to hit it.
---
My server looks like this , when its late at night...
---
Most top servers have a pretty even distribution, one side being slightly favored than the other, but that's natural. Some of the dead servers are probably completely unbalanced, but in reality that is a lesson to not play on a dead server.... After all this is the classic experience and we know they are not going to change anything, because then it would not be the classic experience, so this whole argument is mute anyways, because we know nothing will be done. The bottom line is you should not choose a dead servers when you first started, who wants to be looking for a group for two hours just to find 4 people. If you play a pve server then again this argument is mute. This problem affects a very small percentage of the wow population. The real gamers all picked a popular pvp server so they can show off their skills, the casuals all picked a dead server that is now heavily imbalance, but in end whos fault is that really? The players fault that is who, it's also never too late to start a new character, after all the whole point of the game is to level up. Once you hit level 60 there isn't jack shit to do but jerk off to rag once a week if you can even find a group in your dead server.
---
I asked some guildies for help and they said sure, when their dungeon was finished in like an hour.  I posted up near him and started fishing.  Along came a random hunter who asked if I wanted help before I could finish typing out asking for help.   
---
For most group quests I've found just going to where it happens yeilds others trying to get it done too.
---
We defi itely know that Ion at least reads the forums.
---
18-20 gold?! What server? They barely sell for 5 on mine.
---
Nope, you can even use 0 weapons skill and still hit another level 60. More weapon skill will slightly improve your crit chance.  It's not worth focusing on for PVP.
---
Mostly Restorative potions since the price spiked after the honor system announcement. Although any raiding consumable will sell well, such as Elixir of the Mongoose, Elixir of Shadow Power, and Major mana and health pots. 
---
Since I'm only level 52, I haven't been able to get my hands on any flasks at all, but I have found that other recipes can make just as much money. For instance, the regular fire protection potion can sell really well on raid nights, as a sizable amount of people dont want to pay for the greater fire protection potion. Also, buying arcane crystals, transmuting them and then reselling them nets you anywhere from 15 to 25 hold every day and a half.
---
Queues are necessary in times where population is too high for the game to support, especially without layering.
---
That can only mean troubled run
---
Shadowmeld is an amazing racial dafuq
---
You clearly have never been hit by 20 chain lightning's at once :D
---
Ah yeah fair. Definitely were low level and easy to handle.
---
Most efficient honorfarm for a party of two rogues and one druid? 
---
What zones do we move to when getting overrun? Any extra good flightpaths to camp?
---
You're welcome to represent your opinion as fact however you choose- it doesn't change the reality that your opinion is indeed not fact, nor does it constitute the meaning of terminology regarding the ToS and safe spotting. You've been conflating your own wants with the historical/current ToS throughout this thread, going as far as to place the onus on the player to be attacked by guards or else be violating some non-present clause. Nowhere in my post did I say that the dev's changes were an issue- just that your posts constitute a gross  misrepresentation of the ToS and safe spotting, which you've been conflating with out-ranging guard aggro. Safe spotting has never been the same thing as simply out-ranging guard aggro on open terrain, never will be the same thing as such, and nothing you have to say will change that fact.
---
They absolutely need to put faction specific caps.  So say 2000 horde and 2000 alliance can be logged in at a time.  This immediately balances the logged in number on the servers and encourages players on servers that have a heavy skew towards one faction to transfer to other servers.
---
&gt; Just for the fact that some classes (druid, hunter) have some important class quests at 10 that you dont want to skip.
---
Well, crap. I'm a druid. I wish I had known this before I did the long run.
---
No druid trainers in the Eastern Kingdoms?
---
I have felt the joy of taming it on my NE hunter and the despair of a mage killing it before i could tame it on my Orc Hunter...
---
They are at 6-8g on whitemane
---
Wow, that's hilarious.
---
Not.
---
Who finds this crap funny?
---
I've played a shaman healer in dungeons and it's great. Not only do you have great heals but you also have really good utility with your totems. If you want to be formidable out in the world you can go ele/resto, and you won't lose much early on, but will be able to stand your own in pvp. 
---
I personally think shamans are really fun with all their totems, but if you need help organizing the totems just let me know since they can be a bit overwhelming.
---
Horde druids are strictly better than ally at pvp it's quite a massive difference actually. I still rolled Ally druid to enjoy instant wsg queues but I can't even play the most meta pvp spec because no warstomp.
---
&gt;This tells me that you dont even use details outside the dps meter Lmfao
---
Weird flex, but okay. I definitely don't use details outside the dps meter.
---
Except in this instance, it wasn't Blizzards bot detection system, it's the players detecting and reporting the bots. 
---
Ban waves make sense for the more advanced bots that you have to pay for. They're programmed to avoid being detected.
---
But with these shitty free bots that are super obvious, what's the point? The devs aren't going to spend time reworking their shitty free bot for free.
---
Plenty of gear for mage in scholo/strat, especially in scholo with the necroset which is good for pvp, spamming those two will be the fastest.
---
The change is pretty horrific to be honest. I don't know who thinks this helps the theme of "kill, escape, or die".
---
The guards spam shoot you with a heavy knock back associated with it. If you get more than 2 guards on you the knock back is enough to keep you in the air until your knocked over one of the walls.
---
You do realize that‚Äôs it‚Äôs only a top Rachel on of guilds downing bosses in 20-40sec right?
---
There are still guilds in MC that doesn‚Äôt even have pre-raid BiS and don‚Äôt have 40 people that minmax or know their class rotations inside and out. Those guilds benefit from logs for progressions sake and correcting deficiencies.
---
&gt;  finding early morning runs is impossible
---
The solution to this is planning ahead and rolling on a server in a different time zone.
---
Most raids run evening/late night, when people are out of class and out of work. I have seen some guilds/raids built around shift work (as in, they work GY and want to raid afterward), but they are relatively rare. 
---
If you decide to stay on your server, you may want to start your own run and advertise it as being accessible for shift workers.
---
So you are going to switch from one of the most balanced servers, to a dominant one, because you corpse walked once?
---
I've been dungeon leveling a rl buddy in brd for a few days now, we spent an hour total corpse walking yesterday evening, horde followed our corpses from syria gorge all the way to brd entrance. We still got in, and just continued on.
---
Maybe you should find a PvE server.
---
Multishot is just your autoshot damage + like 180 at Max rank so it scales with AP and crit.
---
Shhhhh....
---
Sure of course it would lag in Vanilla, but not this bad. It was playable at least as long as the server didnt crash....
---
That was using server technology from 2006 but the point is that Blizz does not seem to have put together the network infrastructure necessary to have a playable experience with large concentration of players doing world pvp.
---
Shandala
---
Chad‚Äôs unite!
---
Can you please send me that I‚Äôm 29/0/30 but I would much prefer moonkin lol
---
I have about 5300 mana and 500 plus healing and I can honestly say in my guild I wasn‚Äôt  near the top and I kept max rank hots rolling on mT and would cast rank 5 Regrowth and rank 8 rejuv on dps while spamming rank 4 HT. I am nowhere near the top either as the pallies and priests are just such big healers. For context my rank 4 HT hits for about 900 non crit. 
---
So much heal-snipping taking place too which is tough.
---
&gt; And yes, it was worth it since I main a druid.
---
Coincidentally, the person who posted at the same time as you suggests doing this run is a bad idea for a druid. My elf is a druid, now in Elwynn Forest.
---
Congrats!
---
Darkshore &gt; SW total trip time is like 20-30 minutes
---
Regrowth till lvl 50 is just an emergancyheal (big heal, short cast but very mana intensive).
---
You basicly never use it (only to preheal the tank with a long lasting hoy before a bossfight and drink after)
---
Do nexus come out in p3?
---
I didn't have to, you clearly have not read the original post. I've already posted my reply to you in another comment, you seem to still have trouble understanding it. No worries, though! You seem to think this is WoW Vanilla when it's clearly WoW Classic. I don't need to track down Vanilla devs when the classic devs are who is maintaining the game. What the classic devs say is what goes, doesn't matter what your Pserver allowed. 
---
Enjoy pvping in the world or dying to guards in town. Those are your 2 options at this time.
---
BRD is the only real answer here. Omnicast Boots off of Golem Lord, Banthok Sash from Arena and the robe off of Emperor are the standouts. Most Lock gear is in Strat/Scholo
---
Anything "of Shadow Wrath" is great though. You essentially have infinite mana as a lock so you can afford to sac int for spell damage unlike other classes.
---
this has absolutely zero to do with safespotting, can you read?
---
I sat through 5-7 hour queues in WoD. I am glad I picked a less busy server for Classic.
---
Sup
---
Get a thorns buff, it helps a lot with the skellies. Otherwise the usual downranking. Pop pots as soon as you derive the full benefit, don't wait for oom. Be sure to have dark runes too.
---
I preferred holy nova to oil of immolation, just because I felt immo took too long.
---
I respecced into disc for 10% more mana. Didn't worry too much about increased healing since I had good healing gear already and was downranking.
---
Biggest thing is cure purple disease asap, and remember that when your last group has reached the exit, the next wave has already started. If you wait for them to disappear you'll be in trouble.
---
The removal of talent trees wasn't to make the game more casual but to support player choice. Most players just used cookie cutter builds and there wasn't much to do with talenta because of that.
---
They also made them too deep in wrath which meant you basically went just 1 tree but they tried to fix that in cata. No clue how it worked out cause I didn't play cata.
---
What sort of setup do you use to multibox? Do you have to alt tab, or do you have keybinds setup to control both chars at once?
---
If you only have one item that would go int the keyring, it doesn't really matter.  When you need the keyring to hold 10 or 15, it makes a difference.
---
*sigh* they did *not* "change" anything, which you would already know if you listened more and spoke less. They added an extra invisible bag with 4 slots, then made that bag appear only with the backpack. The backpack did *not* change sizes, and continually adding invisible bags that display as part of the backpack is not feasible, so we are back to where we started: the backpack cannot increase in size. This has already been explained elsewhere, and I resent needing to repeat and paraphrase it because people like you are so quick to write scathing comments without bothering to know anything about the subject at hand.
---
tl;dr: you are the sort of person who enjoys being loud, and doesn't care if you're wrong while doing it.
---
Or Scottish haicoo. Coo is the Highland cattle.
---
it's funny because your condescending post is riddled with statements that are bad or just outright wrong.
---
10/10 if funny le trole
---
0/10 if you thought for even a second you were a decent player
---
Lbrs has to be my hated dungeon due to the wipe fests.
---
Horde character models are just disgusting to me but that's coming from a biased alliance player. Orcs are really the only one I like.
---
If I can‚Äôt log onto my server in time for raid after work because of faction based queues because of a bunch of ally complaining about getting PvP‚Äôed on their PvP servers then I‚Äôm essentially being split up from my friends and guild.
---
that is not true, you still need to be on the ground to kill stuf, so it only takes away the transfer between places pvp and wind rider camping
---
Private server players are the only reason you have Classic WoW.  Also, I'm half tempted to go back to a Private server if someone wants to launch another F R E S H!
---
Since when do business devs even _talk_ to eng teams, let alone value their opinion on margins?
---
....what?
---
Are you missing the "IN CITY" part of the whole post? At this point I feel like you're just trolling because there is no way you really think pvping in the world is against TOS because city guards didn't aggro.
---
Stop being stupid, don't like the changes, don't play the game. Super simple stuff.
---
Isn't it just 1-2 locks per raid? Not like every lock out there needs to do that.
---
&gt;that extra 600 mana's worth of heals is basically an extra pot
---
Huh? Major mana pots are 1350-2250, and dark runes are 900-1500. 600 is nowhere near an entire pot.
---
&gt;Uhhh I don't know about doubling the mana pool lol
---
Flask is 2k, plus 1 major mana pot, 1 dark rune, and then either tubers or nightfin for more mana regen/int. That's about double right there.
---
Yeah I definitely missed some points, but your numbers are still way off. Buffed (not including flask) I'm already at 6.5k mana, before any consumes, and I'll be using dark rune+major mana pot in any fight where I'm remotely close to going OOM; and you need to take into account regen on top of that. Including second win and not including mana regen (because I'm not at home and can't pull up my MP5 or spirit) That's already 9800 mana. With regen, on long fights like Rag/Domo, I wouldn't be surprised it if was over 12k and again this is not including the 2k off flask, expecting fights to last long enough that I'm able to pop a second potion and rune, mana tide totems, or innervate. So I think that 8k number you pulled is *way* too low, especially as any kind of over-estimate.
---
I also think that +400 healing is a little low, and your efficiency gets better as your +heals scale. This means that you'll see scaling benefits from even higher +heals, and you can get it way higher than 400. There are people in my guild already pushing 700.
---
On top of that, let's look at some of the items you listed: Trindlehaven gives you 39 less +heals for 25 mana, that's 1.56 +healing/mana so it's still better than your low "over"estimate, and when compared to the *actual* BiS hammer of grace/scepter it's significantly worse. That's why so many lists highly prioritize +healing; you can just get a ton more +healing than you can int, and +healing scales efficiency much faster than stacking int does.
---
Expect a ton of people to misunderstand your question as the banal "how do I get..." rather than the "when would I get a breadcrumb quest..." you're actually asking.
---
The answer is Stonetalon Mountains, [this quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1075/a-scroll-from-mauren).
---
Chilling photos taken seconds before disaster.
---
no botting needed. you use one macro that sets it so that everytime you interact with any vendor from that point on, it will buy the 30th item, then close the vendor.
---
Then you just press interact with vendor.... over and over again.
---
That's how people snag the Qia patterns. That's how I did it. It's boring AF tho I think the hardcore people bot it.
---
I actually find ashenvalr to be a bit much. The more subdued forest zones like elwynn and silverpine are nicer to me.
---
Oh wow youre still butthurt?
---
At low levels, Healing Touch is a fast spell (only 2 or 2.5 sec), heals more, and costs less mana than Regrowth. Thus, at the lower levels, you'll ignore Regrowth for healing.
---
Eventually Regrowth will heal for decent amount and Healing Touch will become slow 3.5 sec spells, so you'll use Regrowth as your emergency heal. You start to notice this around level 40, and by level 50 you'll start using Regrowth more often. 
---
You'll know when to switch over during your leveling. Everyone gets in situations where you pull one too many mobs, and the typical druid response is bear it up, stomp when half health, cast a heal, go back to bear. At low levels, it'll be Healing Touch, but in the upper-40s, you'll start using Regrowth instead, as Healing Touch will be so slow that it'll get interrupted, sometimes interrupted often enough that you'll have to spirit res.
---
Not true! They brought a lock for Curse of Reck :P
---
Nah.  I personally gave them 6 months myself.  Unfortunately, we're almost 3 months in...
---
Tanks that don‚Äôt tank facing away from the party...seriously. Wtf
---
Rogues who argue that because they aren‚Äôt backstabbing, that they‚Äôre fine to attack from the front ...this annoys the living hell out of me. 
---
Mages, just cause mages.
---

You can also learn a lot about different optimal builds and general Druid knowledge in the Druid discord https://discord.gg/cNaWNB
---
I try to precast and predict dmg as much as I can and batch max rank regrowth and rejuvenate together. If they‚Äôre getting hit hard you can cast rank 4 or rank 7 healing touch while your hots are on them. Always try to have both hots on them even if it‚Äôs rank 6 regrowth. Max rank healing touch is more mana efficient than max rank rwgrowth so don‚Äôt be afraid to nature‚Äôs swiftness a max heal every boss fight. It makes a big difference
---
What to do best as a hunter if I send the pet to tank the mob but another mob joins the fight, endangering to kill the pet?
---
How do you sell all the items after every boss? That requires you leaving like 8 times and coming back non stop!? Does that not slow down progression? That‚Äôs a lot of time spent isn‚Äôt it? If you‚Äôre horse the closest ah is UC? 
---
Or do you mean people spend gold to buy the items and then you redistribute them back out?
---
What do guile‚Äôs do with all the fiery cores etc all the drops from various trash etc?
---
Yeah ez to put on Netflix or something or good music and just chillax and get into a groove.
---
My friend has been playing for 1 hour a night, not every night, and he's level 40.  It can be done.  Not by me, I have a 50 and a 44 and a 19, 2 bank alts, numerous maxed professions... but  some people can do it.
---
I think p5, I don't believe that there are any enchanting recipes for them until AQ.
---
*haimoo
---
Not many shadow damage dealers?  I know on our server, warlocks are pretty rare.  Not sure about shadow priests though
---
This tier of PvE is not what needs analysis. You can throw together any mess of stats and heal just fine in MC and Ony. It's BWL and beyond when you have to start optimizing your stats.
---
Thanks for ur help
---
I just started this week and I will have a similar amount of play time.  I plan on dodging zones notorious for ganking to maximize my time spent leveling.  In addition to that, I will heal dungeons when there are too many horde in a zone I need.
---
Are you using a bidding system or is it a fix price per item? Getting an item for 5 dip might still be interesting for some people
---
I agree that it opens a door for abuse, which is why I don't like "original intent" arguments (because that's far too open to individual interpretation). I instead prefer the "violation of the ToS" (then and now) point of view that the patchnotes present.
---
It's undeniable that there were a number of exploits that existed in vanilla, that were either undiscovered or scarcely known. Unfortunately, as they are rediscovered in classic, they risk becoming absolutely meta if they are not addressed, (this especially true given the greater spread of information). For example, we could imagine a widescale meta developing in Warsong Gulch, around flag carriers abusing terrain exploits to hide in unreachable locations that were little known about in vanilla. Alternatively, imagine if an easy duping exploit were discovered and highly popularized, but left unaddressed because it potentially existed in vanilla.
---
I *could* tell you that these sorts of scenarios would ruin the classic "experience" (whatever that is). But for exploits of a certain severity, we **don't need** subjective interpretations of the ""true vanilla experience"" to know that they clearly violate the letter of the law established in the original ToS, and thus should be amended on that principle instead.
---
The big asterisk here, however, is that any changes made (to fix the exploit) should obviously be the least invasive possible. Or in otherwords, should be completely unnoticeable by all except those who deliberately attempt to abuse the exploit in question.
---
Urgh I'd love another 6 or 7 slots in my backpacks. This is a feature I actually like
---
whats your spec and gear look like? It looks like your gear is nearly identical to mine other than the sp trinket but i dont crit for nearly that much! 2600 is my highest.
---
You can do it with just 1 click. You're working way too hard.
---
Has nothing to do with "needing" consumables to clear the content. If you are raiding and aren't using basic consumables like everyone else, you are likely getting carried and are causing the raid to take longer than it should. Getting consumables and buffs is part of the raid experience, I think it's strange that people want to show up to raid and willingly perform worse than everyone else just because they didn't want to spend 1 hour a week getting some GFPP's and a few mongoose.
---
tried that when it was really expensive, killed 19 times and never dropped. Now it barely sells since most people have it so I don't even bother and stick to other gold farms
---
Nah, roughly 40% I take from a 2ish minutes encounter is physical
---
they were horde.  thinking on it again, i thought that gadgetzan was a rep separate from ratchet rep.  so a level 30 really shouldn't have been friendly.  and i was friendly yeah
---
I think it's the best solution to keep everyone happy. They may have to eventually merge servers if population falls.  
---
I'm also assuming an expansions would be free (like classic), so the need to push people to purchase something isn't there if their goal is only subscription revenue.
---
I think there are reasonable arguments by reasonable people both for and against flying mounts, even though I myself have a strong preference for one of the sides
---
Stamina is often too ignored as well. If you're wearing all green +healing gear (as an extreme example), you'll often die making you useless.
---
It's difficult to provide a base value there, since once you exceed a certain threshold stam matters less and less.
---
All of which is to say that +healing isn't god, other stats matter. Especially when you factor in overhealing.
---
Yeah but he is talking about using fury anyway. Plus sweeping strikes and whirlwind don‚Äôt even need a 2h. The overall point of this is not what does the most damage it‚Äôs what generates the most rage to use your threat abilities. If you‚Äôre using a 2h on higher levels good luck using MS at 30 rage and building threat.
---
Horde on netherwind. Seems like a good sized pop with both factions. Econ on horde is middle of the road as compared to other servers. Guilds are getting rare recipes like lionheart now. My guild for instance has 3 full raids going
---
And, if that is the case, Battle and Berserker stance have a 20% threat reduction built in.
---
Most if not all of druid T1 is garbage. Much prefer the pieces I've gained from DM. Obviously varies for every class.
---
I think they‚Äôre referring less to skill levels and more of willingness to learn/adapt - a shitty dpser is more likely to be someone who doesn‚Äôt pay attention to anything besides trying to be #1 on recount. 
---
Some players may not be as skilled at dealing damage itself but are better team players and therefore are conducive to faster progress because they focus damage at safe levels and protect the healer.
---
Fixed it. Thanks again
---
Now fellate me immediately, DPS peasant. Know your place.
---
&gt; it better enforces the authentically intended consequence 
---
Let me know when Blizzard doesn't do expansions and releases all the planned Vanilla content for Classic then, Thanks.
---
Wow great vid and excellent song!
---
I had to watch a neck piece get DE because I was 20 dkp short ;_;
---
My main is Warrior and I'm considering starting an alt that would be good at solo farming and battlegrounds, since I want to keep my Warrior focused on raiding. Whatever I pick, I probably wouldn't raid on, so the gear I would get is likely pre-raid BiS at best. 
---
I'm considering: Priest, Druid, Mage, Warlock. I've heard good things about each of these, but which will give me the best bang for my buck for both solo farming and BGs? I know Mage can farm ZF, Priest can farm lashers, Warlock can farm mara, Druid can farm... I don't know. Are these things doable with modest gear? Which would be the most effective in BGs?
---
Why would they lose out on Cauterizing Band? They need that, too and they're only competing against other healers for it (who also have other pieces they need to get) so it's a weird concern to have.
---
Wow, this comment must be a timetraveler from a long gone past.
---
 As no one ever does this anymore.
---
You‚Äôve never had a meeting with people from outside your team? I constantly have meetings with people determining if it‚Äôs worth our time to completely rework something that‚Äôs pretty much set in stone. Most of my meetings aren‚Äôt just devs either. Usually our ‚Äòdirector of software deployment‚Äô makes these decisions for us. I‚Äôm sure blizzard has multiple people who determine what‚Äôs worth spending development time on and what isn‚Äôt.
---
I suppose its fair to make that distinction. Could work on your delivery a bit, but I'm betting you grow tired of "people like us" being garbage at explaining math, and as much as it may hurt my pride, I'd rather be proven wrong than live in blissful ignorance.
---
What I find ironic about this whole situation was that my personal experience of mining 75 RTV without an arcane crystal is actually far more likely than his experience of getting 3 in a row. So I suppose I'm not all that unlucky after all.
---
riding the pine? never heard that one before
---
Good to know, thanks man!
---
This equation can be used for any situation. If you want to add spirit to the equation, you just add it to the "M" variable as part of your "total in-combat mana" and take another partial derivative.
---
Most fights don't really have much resting aside from Ony though. I'm not sure what BWL will look like.
---
Dessert has two ‚Äús‚Äù in it. Think of it like asking for an extra Scoop of ice cream for dessert, as opposed to a desert with no ice cream.
---
Pretty much, there‚Äôs one werewolf that has a bubble and becomes immune to magic for a short time witch makes them a lot harder but once you get past those it‚Äôs pretty easy.
---
Wow, you even stuck the landing! So now the goalposts have moved from "This isn't Vanilla- it's Classic!" to "The Classic devs know exactly what the Vanilla devs intended and are doing that!" Combine this with the delusions of grandeur that you seem to have, in conflating your arguments with having some inner knowledge of the Classic devs' design goals, that obviously seems to range far beyond their post on this matter, and you've got some grade A narcissism going on. Congrats! You win the "please get some help!" prize.
---
Damn not enough people play druids to even have people bitch about us.
---
&gt; constantly makes me feel like I have to perform well - and I just can‚Äôt
---
In a group, tank and healer are much more demanding of good performance than a DPS class. The tank is expected to be the leader of the group and make all of the pulls and know the dungeon. If you don't, people will give you crap. Also, if you lose aggro and someone dies for it they will blame you. It's a very high pressure position in the group.
---
The healer is the same way. If you lose concentration for a second and the tank dies, you're blamed. If you don't pay attention for a pull its a wipe.
---
If a dps doesnt pay attention for a pull, the group might not even notice. The only thing you have to worry about is pulling aggro, but the worse you're playing damage wise the less risk there is of that in the first place, so it's extremely forgiving. Many groups will drag a completely useless DPS through the instace with no complaints... a bad healer or tank ruins the whole run. 
---
If you want to chill and support the group then you should play a DPS class that has support utility. Mages have good crowd control abilities to help the group, and hunters can do cool stuff with off tanking mobs with their pet and trapping. Shamans are the ultimate support DPS class, I would suggest looking into ehancement shaman or elemental shaman.
---
From your description of how you want to play the game it sounds like tank and healer are very much not for you. Not every dps class is about always topping the meters, and most of them are very easy to play once you get the hang of it. Healing and tanking are almost always both harder and higher stakes when you don't play well.
---
Haha fishing for downvoted with that one
---
Regardless how you feel, you started on a PvP realm, in a game where it's horde vs alliance. I only kill people 10+ levels below me when they are in the wrong place at the wrong time (don't come running by a battle cuz I will go out of my way to hit you with a sw:p) or when a guildie/friend is questing and gets killed multiple times by the opposing faction. I don't care that you're level 35 and you're just PvPing. You've killed a guildie multiple times now you face the consequence. I'll even bring 5-6 people with me and have multiple people ready to deploy in case of a huge war shaping up.  
---
  If you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen. PvP server means you're free game, it's like leveling on hard mode. You could have easily on PvE and PvP'd when you wanted to. This isn't me being a prick, it's the reality of the issue.
---
Basically there are 3 paths.
---
If the class has no level 10 quests.
---
Its usually Starting area ding 6 -&gt; Darnasus -&gt; auberdine -&gt;menathal harber -&gt; drown in Dun Mrough cove rezz in karanos -&gt; walk to Ironforge -&gt; take tram to Storwind -&gt; resume leveling in gold shire.
---
If the class has level 10 quests. (e.g. Hunter, Druid, Priest).  Starting area -&gt; level 6 -&gt; then tedrasil quests to 10 -&gt; class quest -&gt;  Darnasus -&gt; auberdine -&gt;menathal harber -&gt; drown in Dun Mrough cove rezz in karanos -&gt; walk to Ironforge -&gt; take tram to Storwind -&gt; resume leveling in gold shire or west fall.
---
If they are following a leveling guide e.g. Azeroth Autopilot. Starting area -&gt; level 6 -&gt; then tedrasil quests to 12 -&gt;   Darnasus -&gt; auberdine -&gt; Quest in Darkshore  until level 15ish -&gt;  auberdine -&gt;menathal harber -&gt; walk through wetlands to mountain pass-&gt; loch modan for FP -&gt; walk to Ironforge -&gt; take tram to Storwind -&gt; resume leveling in west fall.
---
Aww you deleted the thread. But i thought you were so proud of yourself.
---
No, it wasn't; they didn't know sap doesn't work on mobs that are in combat. The way around aggro is to run away; tank picks them up as with a sheep pull.
---
&lt;Absolution&gt;
---
As WC mage, is my best bet just to cast fast rank 1 to get stacks up and then max rank frostbolt spam? I'm not *too* concerned about my DPS since I'm basically just there to survive and keep stacks up on the boss, but I do want to make my parses at least *okay*.
---
But it also shows how it removes their ability to hoard.
---
That would be a great Undead model
---
Besides a NE priest mind controlling you, who are you trying to surprise? Druid or rogue with their own stealth? A warrior whose already charging into every fight? A hunter that already outranges and kites everyone? I think you‚Äôre overvaluing the element of surprise for Night Elves...it‚Äôs not like they can PoM pyro like a mage, or melt you like an ele shaman quicker than you can react.
---
Let me know when you actually raid so you realize how this works in practice and not theory.
---
tbh as long as an item has a lot of healing or a lot of int or a mix of both if you are lucky you are doing fine 
---
mc bosses last 1 minute in our raids so i dont even down rank on bosses anymore , and i have mana pot but i never need them
---
i do use a mana pot on ony though
---
i do downrank on trash though
---
Ye thanks for that lol ,but here is the door, remember to bring all your private server mates with you,
---
Chin says ‚Äúmeh‚Äù, I paid for playing, not thinking...goes onto to keep trying while you gank him more.
---
about half of my wand damage without 5/5 wand spec.
---
woohooo.
---
amazing trinket to farm SM cath... dropping off the end boss of the current raid tier.
---
ZF is best if you are selling boosts
---
DME is best if you are solo with herb but really good at farming
---
ZF is best if you are new to aoe and don't have that much gear.
---
bring some lube
---
Ask in general chat if anyone has a quest you're on, do it together. Two 49s can beat a 60 depending on classes. 
---
Buy swiftness potions, if you get ganked, cc them, pop a potion and run. If they don't have an epic mount they won't catch up to you. Or get a nifty stop watch and or skull of impending doom.
---
Everyone gets ganked, even minority faction sometimes. Just part of a PvP realm. There will be imbalanced fights all the time. Don't get too tilted, you're almost at the finish line. Once you're 60 only roll to dungeons in groups.
---
If you're not having fun maybe take a break from the game or level an alt on a pve realm. I'm leveling an alliance alt in STV at the moment, on skeram, and just log off when I'm ganked, and take a break or play a diff character.
---
Stalagg had a 2k queue last night
---
That's not true though because it's random and rare. I fall to the same spot run after run and maybe 1/10 times I get the 10 second cooldown over the 5s, the rest of the time it's just 5. If it was consistent either way I could see it, but this is totally random.
---
You're the only one delusional by thinking farming players in a guarded town with no consequences was what was intended in the game. Enjoy pvping in the open world or dying to the guards.
---
I was Ally on Sen'jin too! I am horde now on Mankirk. I don't care for horde even now, but most of the peeps I know know are horde, so there you have it. I do have a Sosumi human rogue on Mankirk. LOL
---
Okay I can see that. I‚Äôm not familiar with that game so is that game all about large scale battles? Because If so, just doesn‚Äôt seem like a fair comparison. I‚Äôve played games like that and it makes sense if the game is about territory control and large scale battles. 
---
Idk I don‚Äôt really care lol just asking questions.
---
For the long game, you'll want to start working on getting your Axe Smith to exalted with the TB. You need exalted to get the plans for Nightfall, and that's a long, hard road.
---
In the meantime, we're using them for a few more fire res pieces and otherwise stockpiling them until we get the patterns that can use them.
---
Dear Stan, I'm going to be a new father too. If you can't moderate your playing of the game, It's best to drop it all together. I play about 20 hours/week and anticipate to play much less than that once the stork stops by. Unless you're ok playing like 1/10th the amount you currently do, you might need to kick the habit altogether. P.S. We should be together too.
---
Can you account for overheal?
---
I'm not a healer, but the proposed benefits of crit, I believe, are lost in comparison to plus healing.
---
The flatter distribution of total health per cast allows for smoother and more predictable results. A crit with a heavy cast is huge, but only if you are in the situation where that heal is required. Equally so, a drought in crits leaves you vulnerable when life pools drop. You likely will be reaching for big heels much more frequently than a plus healing geared healer.
---
For crit to outperform plus healing I'd argue you have to be in a position where you cannot afford the heal not to crit. This scenario would be low health target, no chance of overhealing. This is a position a competent healer proactively avoids.
---
Plus healing allows for more control over the fight. Overhealing and situational healing parameters are factors that reduce the efficacy weights significantly.
---
Gearing for crit only outperforms in theory, not in the practice of healing.
---
grob is based. we need more horde tho
---
Both at below 3g last night @ mograine
---
Wtf, I didn't even know I  commented until I saw these weird replies.
---
Raided for years using this system, everyone was happy with it.  But don't worry, your ad hominem fallacy is noted.
---
I was being a little bit hyperbolic. I very often have meetings across teams, and my job requires it. But marketing people almost never ask me how they should market something I've worked on, and sales people/business dev don't ask me how to sell it or what it might be worth. They try to tell me how/what to write occasionally since everyone thinks they can write (I'm a technical writer), but I rarely see people ask engineers to do anything but code, plan, and explain.
---
Haikmoo you mean.
---
Problem is your going to fracture an already fractured community... right now we have trial and classic then you want to add another fracture to have esp√©rate BC?
---
and here we are demanding Classic+ :))
---
Yeah, but stuff like this:
---
&gt; Finally, this guy is geared to the core, but he wasn't even the best mage in the raid
---
&gt; He reminds us he's had more viewers on WoW classic than anyone else.
---
&gt; He laughs at us on stream while his braindead twitch viewers cheer him on. He does everything to make it more content and rub it in our face.
---
&gt; Lastly, Joker is a member of the best organization in WoW, Method. Which includes a ton of sponsors and should be a group of people who care about their reputation in WoW.
---
Makes the whole story sound fishy.
---
What's a patch in the context of a 15 year old game? After phase 6? Phase 2? The very first hot fixes? It was in the beta so theres obviously a decent amount of confusion for something so simple.
---
Sounds heavenly
---
From what servers I have played on show 
---
Horde: 
---
-better racials for pvp
---
-More people que for battlegrounds thus increasing your que time
---
- pug almost all battlegrounds since horde loves to pvp, premades cant really exist easily due to the que time 
---
-most honor gained from wpvp while waiting for que 
---
-mostly faces alliance premades with some pugs in between 
---
-shaman need to play at a high level to be able to make appropriate plays/when to go aggressive vs when to heal/purge
---
Alliance:
---
-worse racials for pvp
---
-less people que for bgs since alliance generally doesn‚Äôt pvp all that much=no que time for bgs
---
-few alliance pugs but mainly premade alliance groups for easier honor grinding , no que times make organizing premades a lot easier than horde 
---
-most honor gained from battlegrounds due to no que time/racials suck out in the world 
---
-faces almost entirely horde pugs while playing, so majority of the time it‚Äôs alliance premade vs horde pug=free wins 
---
-not being mean to Paladins (I love playing mine) but you can be the most mediocre paladin and still make a game changing play via bubbles or freedoms, low skill threshold means there is a lot more game changing Paladins then shamans (shamans have to be played by someone who knows the class well, then they really shine)
---
TLDR: horde dominates wpvp, does quite well against alliance pugs, but mainly faces alliance premades and loses. Shamans are hard to play well
---
Alliance loses wpvp, most pugs(again only in my experience), and usually premakes for easy honor farm. Paladins are easy to play well 
---
This is all from my time playing vanilla wow
---
Could I do this running BRD for items like Ironfoe, Savage glad chain etc?
---
I feel you dude, I was super addicted to WoW retail during BC/WotK era. I came back for Classic and gave myself time limits on when I could play. Pretty much I turned casual (coming from a hardcore progression player) and made sure I stayed that way. I'm still leveling and haven't reached 60 yet lol. But every now and then I just want to get to 60, join a progression guild min/max everything etc etc.. it's just a habit you have to fight. GL OP hope you made the right choice.
---
It was a lot of fun! The top 2 were within 2% xp halfway thru 16! Undead Priest won, followed closely by Undead Warlock so I guess that goes to show Tirisfal is a pretty good levelling zone.
---
For sure, my new goal no doubt.
---
Wlogs shows you this. You see how many BTs warrior used, you see for how long he was in combat, so you can easly calculate it.
---
Mages can do other things besides frostbolt for single target dps. Fireblast works on most trash and bosses, along with cone of cold. These instant cast spells can be used in between frostbolt for more dps at the cost of more mana consumption.
---
Is Blizzard banning users who are streaming to a cellphone? I read that cloud computing was getting people banned and while streaming from my home PC isn't typically what you would call cloud computing it technically is. I talked to support and he wasn't sure and said to error on the side of caution and don't do it. I would like to do some crafting and AH work though while I'm on the road and mobile would be perfect for that.
---
Months back when servers were announced. A large group of Brazilians and Latin Americans said they were going to play on that realm.
---
Its almost never worth it to grind gear while leveling. If you've overleveled an instance you should just move on.
---
No, *no*. Lord Illidan knows the way:
---
Illidan Stormrage: "There is no cure, young one. But there are ways to feed the hunger."
---
I remember way more than 3-4 on my old server by name.
---
I just don't think the way you calculate things makes sense, you're making it way too convoluted. Spiritual healing adds 46 healing to a heal rank 2. I'm closer to 6k mana with AI, so I'm getting 600 from mental discipline. With my 600 +heals, I'm getting 4.83 healing per mana on Heal R2.
---
4.83*600=2898 extra healing. So, I'd need to cast heal R2 63 times in 1 fight for it to be more total healing output than the extra mana. That would take 12,900 mana; and would be over two and a half minutes straight casting, with no cancels.
---
As you can see; the total healing output from the extra mana is in most cases going to be better than the extra base healing. And, it gets better once you get even more +heals, whereas the flat 10% boost to base doesn't scale well with more int. 
---
And this is where the issue with healing calcs goes awry. People like to try and boil it down to flat equivalence numbers, but it just doesn't work like that with healing. It works for DPS; but heals are waaay more weird once you get to real-world applications. Healing is about hitting the minimum bar of "people aren't dying", and then having large factors of safety to account for unlucky burst, other healers dying, overhealing, etc... And a lot of that is poorly captured by straight efficiency calculations.
---
I want to level a caster. All signs seem to point to mage but I have this yearning to play a shadow priest. Only problem is I have a shaman main and don‚Äôt want another class where people assume you‚Äôre a healer for every group.
---
I was a rank 12 warlock, he was a Naxx geared hunter. It was one of those tranquil 1vs1s you got in AV midfield, hell of a fight, scatter, trap etc. It felt really good to beat him and was quite close.
---
It's talking about faction balance on queue times on PVP servers.  Faction balance is completely irrelevant on PVE servers.
---
So a player could be totally unaware of the space they are standing in, a space normal trafficed by hundreds of players daily, being out of guard aggro range, engage in PvP, then be handed a ban for ToS violation? Am I correct in stating that this is a situation you would be fine with occurring?
---
me too pls?
---
To this guy, you‚Äôre just a random side quest NPC and he is the the main player character. Sorry you joined a publicity stream...
---
Alright, so you understand the basics of weapon skill but not the specifics. Basically, if an enemy's defense rating is more than 10 higher than your weapon skill then you get a 3% hit penalty roughly.
---
So, since raid bosses have 315 defense, if you only have 300 weapon skill you get hit with the 3% penalty and your hit cap is 9%. However, if you get to 305 skill then the difference is only 10 and then penalty goes away, making the hit cap 6%. Not that this is just the hit cap for yellow hits like sinister strike, not for your actual melee attacks which have a further 19% chance to miss because you're dual wielding.
---
Enemies in PvP are not raid bosses and only have 300 defense, so the extra weapon skill does nothing and I believe is ignored in pvp anyway for the most part.
---
If you're a rogue, you probably get 5% hit rating from your talent tree if you're combat specced. If not you have to find 5% for pvp.
---
He's their guild's main tank
---
Sounds like most of the top streamers are scumbags, and it helps their views.
---
You have no ability to put yourself in the shoes of the opposite faction. 80-20 server balance isn't PvP.  
---
No point in trying to convince you on a solution to a problem when you don't even agree there is any problem at all.
---
Thanks for the info.  I was actually thinking Nightfall may be the best choice for the long game.
---
Yeah 50 FR and a bit of stam is pretty nice on one slot, but it's only 10 more FR and only like 140HP. So it just doesn't seem like a big enough benefit since we can already kill Baron/Rag with current gear. I wish the other Revered recipes were not gated behind phases. Would make getting revered a lot more enticing if you could make more than 1 thing.... :(
---
Ah yes, the classic fantasy naming convention PlayerXSQDD. If people reported me enough for that to happen I'd keep that trash name just out of spite.
---
Wow, that is a close race! Glad you had fun with it! :)
---
No you can‚Äôt - we aren‚Äôt dps. We can‚Äôt just spam max ranks. Our output is finite and defined by health missing. 
---
That is the flaw in trying to theorycraft healing with math. It will only take you so far.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the lifespan of a mageblade shortlived as it will be replaced as soon as bwl is cleared with the staff? There are other bis items for casters that will last to aq40.
---
Tell me more about this FD+Trap business. I'm a new hunter and wondered if that should be possible.
---
Theres a place to repair in DM where you turn in the quest for the trinket. Even a place to sell stuff.
---
You have no world view, and no concept of branding/image. 
---
Imagine being so ignorant you post that comment.
---
Alliance has a FP in Nethergarde Keep
---
Huh, that's almost exactly what I did. I have defensive/battle stance on E though. (use A and D to strafe)
---
&gt; But not that long after this statement they somehow extended it for people using authenticators lol.
---
...and it did indeed result in various bugs cropping up for a while afterwards.  I wonder why you omitted *that* little tidbit.
---
Was it epic?
---
PHAT LOOT
---
Yeah, post BWL will likely be a limiter for a lot of adults with jobs+families.
---
3-4 nights a week of raids/farming will be too much for any casual to semi-casual.
---
Now imagine being a Paladin. I need the blade AND the band.
---
This.
---
Blizzard said years ago on the official forums that vanilla wow wasn't possible because they don't have the server code.
---
Gaming companies at the time did not utilize code versioning and thus would essentially erase a previous game state whenever they implemented a big patch. This is what happened at blizzard.
---
Blizzard only has the code for the very end state of vanilla wow. This is why they "chose" to do a 1.12 version of the game, talents, gear, and all. They don't have vanilla data older than this and are afraid of the backlash if they admit it.
---
Why do you think we're getting the shitty newer version of Alteric Valley despite the fact that everyone agrees the original is what we want?
---
It's because they simply don't have it, and won't admit it.
---
Gnome racial is amazing for everyone in pvp, not just melee.
---
Was against another warlock, I killed him barely he SS and quickly killed me, then I SS'd and we fought again, I barely won.
---
I don't see fishiness. He gained exposure achieving his world first 60. Any feat like this will result in a some degree of a cult following. I have no idea if he was in Method prior to this, but even if he wasn't, he'd have a fast track in the gearing process strictly based off the contributions of his following. Free gold, gear passed to him, you name it. This all seems genuine to me.
---
&gt; I'm not a healer, but the proposed benefits of crit, I believe, are lost in comparison to plus healing.
---
Crit is better if you down rank because it reduces the chance of overhealing. I tend to cast heals that don't quite top off to account for crit overhealing.
---
Keep in mind though, in my analysis it shows that the current crit rate cancels out for +Healing and int; critting on more spells (int) is just as effective as critting harder (+Healing). I also completely ignore the added crit from the `dM` equation because it's assumed negligible both in magnitude and effect. I made quite a few assumptions in favor of +Healing specifically to show that int is still a heavyweight.
---
I still recall that time I got Living Bomb right when Baron died.  I then proceeded to run right in the middle of all the healers/casters and sit down amongst them while they drank...best -50 DKP eva!
---
Never been a huge fan of the elf zones, but I used to love the game for its scenery and immersion back in the mid 2000s. Always liked Dun Morogh and Westfall
---
You are correct, it is not a representative democracy. 
---
Extremists (passionate people who post, up/downvote a lot) 
---
And Populist movements with easy to digest emotional demands. (Good to get neutrals on board or not get downvoted by others)
---
Will always dominate the conversation due to up/downvote feedback loops.
---
(And other effects like people being sick of getting downvoted)
---
Tactical mastery is your #1 priority imo because of charge and mocking blow
---
1.25 is a trash conversion rate though lol? Look at the items you pulled up. *There is just way more +healing on items than there is int*. You don't see items with 75 int; but you'll find items with 75 +heals. You're right, int has a higher weight that +heals point for point; that doesn't mean it's better, at all. You don't understand itemization in Classic if you don't get that.
---
How necessary (or beneficial) is engineering for pvp as a mage? 
---
I went skinning for income while leveling for some fairly passive income and wanted to reroll to alchemy, but I plan on doing a lot of PVP and feel like not having engineering might be detrimental.
---
Also, is there any downside to doing alchemy on an alt instead?Other than having to level one to 35?
---
&gt; Why suddenly extend it for only people using authenticators instead of the general population?
---
To encourage people to attach authenticators to their account.  Is this an actual question?
---
Is this the same guy? His name was jokerd not methodjokerd and I thought he deleted the character
---
For sure. I didn't mean to imply that it is fixed in it's current state. Only that they should keep the "abilities, etc that hit basically at the same time as vanish, should register" aspect while they are trying to fix it.
---
I've never played a mage, so I think I'm going to go for it on classic! Best spec to level?
---
I guarantee you every single horde person here would be throwing a fit in the inverse happened. you're just a garbage person with no empathy
---
T2 head, Anastari Heirloom, T1 Shoulder, Chromatic Cloak, Robe of the Void, T1 Bracer, Rod of the Ogre King, Stormrager, Gloves of the Hypnotic Flame, T1 Belt, T2 Legs, Omnicast Boots, Eye of Orgrimmar, Flaming band of the Eagle, Eye of the Beast, Talisman of Ephemeral Power.
---
I think the problem is you would split the fans ... so starting at retail.. half the guide is excited about classic so they reroll... now they stay in classic and enjoy it... now BC comes out and you get an option. Well maybe half them want BC and half don‚Äôt. Now your guild just split again... friends will disagree... you only have a finite amount of players and fracturing the community isn‚Äôt really a smart move ... RS and old school RS had their fair share of problems when it split.
---
Pretty sure the epics dropping now won't give nexus crystals later. Only things that drop after nexus crystals are in the game will give crystals. That's how it was in vanilla.
---
We make Kilbabi. Those motherbitches make keelbabi.
---
Ever thought about limiting yourself to one character?
---
At 60 you can easily raid log in Classic. I literally played for 3 hours last night and now I don't NEED to log in again until Onyxia resets (although I probably will, to do some farming, but still).
---
I don't care about what you don't care about, what now, genius?
---
Let's be real here, people are people and the fundamental mindset about engaging other dudes isn't really different whether you play horde or alliance. 
---
Is it a function of how many allies you have around? Of course it is. Are horde players psychologically different from alliance players in the 'red is dead' mentality? Of course they aren't, they're the same gamers playing the same game.
---
Go do brd runs solo or mara solo
---
This was hugely apparent when bloodlust came out in BC. If the boss doesn't die in 40 seconds then you have to spend time plinking it down
---
No there arent.
---
It's been pretty well known that Jokerd is pretty garbage at any aspect of the game besides leveling. Turns out he is a garbage human being as well, go figure. Who gives a fuck? Stop watching and paying attention to these man children and this shit will cease.
---
I have no world view? I understand that somebody's ability to feed themselves and possibly their family is much, much more important than pixels
---
This was reported by at least 5 people that I am aware of. The only problem is that he had Twitch fanboys pulling the group together and explaining the loot rules. I don't think Joker explicitly explained it himself, despite admitting that he Ninja'd the staff. I think it's up in the air whether or not Blizzard will do anything because he wasn't the one typing it in the raid. Hopefully, they do. Appreciate your comment!
---
I think he's saying 'you didnt get world first staff of dominance', because you know, he can't read.
---
You can barely tread water with a few hours a week.  Don't kid yourself that you're progressing playing 3 hours a week.
---
it's not just capital cities, it's also grom gol which is legitimately useful for alliance to sneak into to reach SM which will now be harder/impossible. you're a cunt dude
---
All that cloth disenchanted, my soul

Yes indeed, to each their own, but the point is there's a shitload of stuff to do - they're just choosing not to do it.  Those that *do* choose to do it will progress further than them - therefore the premise of playing 50 hours vs 3 hours being no difference in progression for raid loggers is entirely false.
---
Ok sub lvl 60 boomer
---
Reminds me of the ICC Gunship encounter.
---
We have dedicated raid position per player but it‚Äôs mainly first come first serve. 
---
Simple example - someone who isn‚Äôt raider status is in the raid. They will be asked to leave for a raider ie myself. With that being said if said raider was late as fuck they will sit it out. 
---
But myself averaging 600-700 dps as a warlock so 99% of the time I get prior.
---
This is the same guy and his stream will verify it. He was banned for abusing layering on his main and rerolled with Methodjokerd.
---
I leveled shadow and healed dungeons. I was molded by the drinker's attitude.
---
Unplayable. So tired of this
---
It's still shit being the Hunter who just Viper Stings all the Mages on the other side, so there's that.
---
I tried for 2 hours to get into a Rend group yesterday without a single invite. I‚Äôve been trying to get the MH for 4 weeks now.  Sigh
---
ah gotcha, thanks
---
I read a comment that epics saved from MC won't turn into nexus crystals due to blizzard not wanting the market immediately flooded with enchanting mats. I would double check that before you fill your bank with epics to be DE'd
---
Well it also depends on what your notion of sacrifice is. Over and over on this very sub, people seem just as addicted to saying "this game doesn't need that much time", "I dinged 60 within a week, totally casually playing", "got all pre-BIS in day" so on and so forth.
---
If it's one parent taking care of the kids, and the other just really always on the computer after work isn't really sacrificing anything, then sure OK. I'll agree, naw that's not really big sacrifice or anything. Yeah you'll miss the soccer games, the piano recitals, the little moments because well those events overlap raid nights, then sure.
---
There's always that one parent to take care of all that stuff, meanwhile we're playing WoW in lieu of these other things.
---
Queue queue.
---
Your anecdote =\= the majority.
---
All dungeon content is trivial. If you're struggling at all in dungeons you have to work on the fundamentals.
---
ive never even heard of this scrublord
---
Damn did we really? I was traveling last night.
---
Bit harsh to say such things
---
Mad season is ace and chill
---
Yep, me too. I think  I will go up to 8g/run as pvp system is on thursday here :)
---
absolutely genius response. I'm sure that saves you the embarrassment of realizing you lack basic reading comprehension
---
Ok boomer
---
I agree. Whichever faction is dominant at the start of p2 will snowball and the losing faction players aren't going to sit there and get farmed for 6 hours a night with a smile on their face. They'll leave.
---
If you're level 48 - 59 now you have to ask yourself "can I be bothered to get utterly destroyed on sight in a totally one sided unwinnable fight and then camped until I log out?" That's what happens now when you're worth nothing, imagine when you're giving then their bis gear the more they camp you. 
---
The pvp in classic is trash anyway (coming from someone who exclusively pvpd in retail and got glad) its rock paper scissor/who can spend the most gold on consumables
---
Tldr: I rerolled alliance on a pve server and I'm having just as much fun. I dont feel like I'm missing out because a skulled horde player hasn't oneshot me over and over.
---
Your math isn't wrong. Your model is.
---
You're imagining a surface in 3-space with dimensions of mana, +healing and total healing performed. What you're observing is that the slope is greatest in the direction of mana.
---
What you're not doing is observing that there isn't just one surface - there are a multitude of intersecting surfaces with very different slopes involved. To shift from a surface with a slight slope (in any direction) to one with a greater slope (in any direction) requires +healing. So even though +intelligence might have greater returns on the surface you're on right now, +healing will get you to a better surface (via downranking) whose gains outweigh the losses you incurred by not gearing intelligence.
---
There are also boundary conditions mentioned elsewhere in the comments. To briefly summarize, Intelligence is useless in short fights and it's directly inferior to Spirit in longer fights. So there's a very narrow window where Intelligence is actually a stat you'd want - indeed, this is why you Priests who start a fight with 'stat sticks' (pure Int weapons) and then swap them out 20 seconds into the fight. Once they've consumed that top-end mana, they no longer need the Int and just go with pure +healing on their weapons.
---
Intelligence is also useless in 'gear check' situations. Having piles of mana you can spend in the future is not worthwhile when you need raw healing now.
---
You also have to take into account the Five Second Rule. Greater Heal (Rank 4)  is about 7% less efficient than Heal (Rank 3) with +400 spellpower. However, the actual healing performed is twice as much. That means the interval between casts is twice as large - and that interval changing is very often the difference between getting ticks of out-of-FSR regen and not. Since even a single tick of out-of-FSR regen shifts the efficiency equation dramatically in favor of Greater Heal (Rank 4), it often pays to drop large heals rather than small one.
---
In terms of +healing what this means is that every point of +healing has some value in terms of mana return. Modeling this is somewhat difficult without making quite a few (perhaps unrealistic) assumptions, but it adds to the notion of 'ties go to +healing' - and just the phase shifts I was discussing above tend to make it a 'tie'.
---
Also, I remember even in tBC, I as shaman was attacked from the roof in neutral town, lightning shield procced and damaged the attacker and guards went after me instead of him. Is this still happening nowadays?
---
How do I find a hunter that is selling this stuff?
---

---
Most prestigious isn't the same thing as best.
---
Hey, hello kitty world might be a fun game as well! You never know.
---
I swear pathing is worse now than it was then. Sure dungeons were always sketchy, Gnomer being one of the worst, but even out in an open field my pet runs around like a little nut now.
---
Bit harsh to say such things Mad season is ace and chill
---
Its not 1v3 if the first one is dead a few seconds before the 2nd and 3rd even come into play tho!
---
Everyone is concerned about the stability of the servers, not the ratio of horde to alliance on select servers. This is to point out how smooth pservers were able to handle triple digits of pvpers.
---
Also: if you are a druid and scared of the boats, since someone always camps there (like it‚Äôs the case on my server) just always have your hearthstone in the eastern kingdoms. Then you always can use transport zu moonglade and hearthstone back. It‚Äôs a nice trick to avoid the ships (which I tend to try)
---
Hmm, must vary based on server. All mages on my server in the 50s are always looking for the Gor'shak spams.
---
They're pretty easy since it's an enclosed area. Biggest thing is maneuvering so you don't get smacked by the mobs. 4 mages, 1 priest. Precast flamestrike as the first mobs surround Gor'shak so it hits just as the second wave come in, then establish a nova order and use CoC and Arcane Explosion to finish them off.
---
I joined a guild around the time of classic beta. I knew i wasnt going to be the fastest to 60 but i knew i wanted to raid. We had 2 full clearing raids about 6 weeks into classic. Its a respectful environment with very little drama aside from our mt leaving. I made it to 60 and got to run mc for the first time last week and came home with a couple pieces of loot.
---
Dang. Unfortunately I‚Äôm not in a position to really make money off investments. Was hoping I could make 10-20g off the craft.
---
what are we 8 years old?
---
Ehh yeah idk. Like I said, I was able to listen to their officer meeting (not an officer) and the way they portrayed an "issue" with some members was extremely questionable and a massive overraction and demonstrated a lot of power tripping. Basically escalating to Gkick without even trying to have a concersation or communicate effectively. Definitely is gonna change my approach with the guild. Just had an offer from a new guild to join up several days ago, and had this happened before then, I would have taken it.
---
just the first orb, or all orbs
---
Sit in dire maul and wait for it to come across general, or ask in general yourself
---
Most useless thing I‚Äôve seen uploaded lol mages destroy warriors take your downvote.
---
Good call. Life is more important, especially with kids. The wife and I are playing but are perfectly fine chipping away a couple hours here and there after everything else is taken care of.
---
Getting to a stable place and prioritizing family is the right move. Especially with a baby, the first 1-2 years are hard to make time for such things. I‚Äôll forget about WoW and not care the instant I decide to stop, but missing out on family time I would always regret.
---
Maybe if you have sponsors, you should conduct yourself in a respectful manner? 
---
Maybe if you act like a jackass you deserve to lose your sponsors because you're a public figure and that's how sponsorships work?
---
They aren't taking away his ability to feed his family, they're showing his boss they have a shit employee.
---
Why are you so COMPLETELY one sided on this? You really can't see why a sponsor would want to drop a toxic public personality?
---
&gt; The downranking trend is stupid and ironically wasting a shitload of mana.
---
I mean, that is absolutely demonstrably false, but we'd have to use the original total efficacy equation to show that. We will ignore overheal and just look are pure healing potential. I'll compare r2h with modest +Healing vs insane mana pool and greater heal rank 4. Let `Mb` be a massive mana pool for a fight, including all the stuff you generate. Let `Ms` be a much smaller one due to more casting.
---
&gt; `r4hg = Mb*(1916/710)`
---
&gt; `r2h = Ms*(475 + 0.86*400)/175`
---
So how much mana do you have to generate to be equal to downranking?
---
&gt; `Mb*1916/710 = Ms*(475 + 0.86*400)/175`
---
&gt; `Mb*472 = 819*Ms`
---
&gt; `Mb = 1.73*Ms`
---
So you'd have to generate 1.73x more mana that my current max (5k) in the span of 2 minutes to compensate. My current mana is 5k, so you need to generate an extra 3650 mana. Priests regenerate spirit according to this equation:
---
&gt; `Regen = (13+S/4)/2` mana per second
---
Let's say in a 2 minute fight, you spend 50% in 5SR (60s). The amount of spirit you need to compensate is the following:
---
&gt; 3650 = 90*(13+S/4)/2, S= 434 spirit
---
Good luck grabbing 434 spirit and managing to idle in a raid for over half the fight.
---
well when you need your quest or neck from the last boss, and there are 0 tanks willing to go unless they get all the orbs you have 2 choices
---
1) give them orbs 
---
2) dont run the dungeon
---
Genuinely at the edge of my seat waiting for the guy to try to explain how a bunch of pserver players on welfare are a more important institution in WoW than Method.
---
If you're talking about just classic then APES, easily.
---
&gt; Also Method isn't the best organization in WoW, not by a long shot. Fucking lol.
---
lmao, who is then ?
---
If you‚Äôre the only WC mage in the raid that might make sense, but if there‚Äôs more than one you may as well just go full blast.
---
‚ÄúMeme‚Äù and ‚Äúsatire‚Äù have lost all of their meaning here on Ruddut
---
I'm actually an extremely handsome man, thank you.
---
False. It prepared you for the next fight. Which might be right on top of your ass in a BG.
---
I healed (as feral) all thru SM without issue using primarily Rejuv and Regrowth and HT only when feces hit the rotating device. 
---
Generally speaking, it went pretty smoothly as long as the rest of the group had a smidgen of discipline.
---
&gt; I should use aoe fear abilitys b4 facing a boss that can mc me? 
---
Hadn't considered that.  Good tip.
---
Thanks man I‚Äôll check it out
---
Can confirm, stoned as fuck when running dungeons and healing
---
Amen
---
Lots of hardcore neck beards out there my friend.
---
No idea! Classic.live lets you chose race and Clas though, and then adjusts accordingly with class quest and such
---
damn, if only Blizzard gave players an option to transfer to a lower pop realm...
---
Don't. Plain and simple
---
Yeah I'd say normally only one especially for Ony - last week we had two since the other was split out to our other 20 man Ony but that makes sense.
---
Badass move. Respect gained
---
&gt; I work a full time job and do basically nothing other than play this game
---
There you go. That's why you are able to do all the things that you're able to do. That summed it up, right in a single statement.
---
Many new parents here and people in general aren't going to be playing the game like that. Don't you think it's just a little out there, to say "I put 10-15 hours a week" then you say "you don't need to continuously put a ton of time into this game".
---
Those two statements aren't compatible with each other, don't you think? "pre-raid BiS doesn't take *that* long" OK, then let's take a new parent - many of who are in this very thread - who can only commit maybe an hour of playtime a night. And oops their newborn might wake up crying in the middle of the 5-man.
---
They're not in a hardcore guild, and when they post in guild chat "LF tank for X dungeon" when the rest of the guild is either fatigued after a raid, or they've farmed those places to death and just don't want to do them anymore...tell me again how long that'll take. For a super casual who blinks in and out of the game.
---
First need to know faction and server your on.
---
Im horde on kromcrsuh and dont mind helping out newbies. Im always looking for ppl to play with üòÜ
---
DKP is not a good system. Especially with the cancerous BiS mentality that the majority of players have now. "Why would I waste my points on non-BiS? When BiS drops I might not have the most points then."
---
The only unbiased, fair loot system I've seen is MS&gt;OS 1-100 rolling. If you want a piece you roll, can't "save your roll" for next week when BiS drops, and you can't cheat the roll RNG. Loot council is a close second but finding enough trustworthy people that don't play favorites is its own challenge.
---
Tbf, they are about the only one of consequence. So the prestige is by default.
---
I‚Äôm horde Sulfuras. It‚Äôs a pretty even balance. The horde community is awesome and very helpful
---
Wow +22 int is huge
---
Sure, I've just never heard anyone describe pre-bis as "geared to the core" before. 
---
&gt; He's a social member of his guild, meaning he doesn't actually raid with them.
---
This makes sense, though.
---
Make F key ring!
---
no he wasent lol, he deleted hes char on mograine EU cause hes a speedrunner, this dude is just salty af
---
a feew days ago, I'd say Silithus mining, but after removal of layers... I don't see any open world activity being more profitable than BRD
---
Agreed. Madseasonshow is a solid dude. I actually wish he was on my server, even though I dont play Alliance.
---
I feel like the community in the game is quite similar I think the community here, however, have thinner skin than an amphibian
---
Lmao, he only used layering level 58+ to level cus he was getting camped so hard, let's not make up shit.
---
&gt;Forced upgrades
---
That just sounds like loot council with extra steps
---
They don‚Äôt sleep like bricks until all of their teeth are in, and then give it a while. Usually 2-2.5. Then it starts getting easy.
---
Source: Have 3.
---
basically mages get to fund the raid
---
insane how unfair farming gold is in classic wow
---
Please read definition of Ad Hominem Provided in another are of this chain.   Also, decay systems are well established in DKP.  It's not a new concept, though apparently a hard one for people to understand from the replies here.
---
I'm not completely one sided, for the record I don't like the fact he's ninja'd a sub par item but I really don't get going as far to email his sponsors
---
When you PUG in wow classic, you are choosing to give masterloot to an unknown element, regardless if they are streaming or not
---
If you really don't want the item taken and for you to have nothing to do about it, join a guild run instead
---
&gt; At which point am I being hyperbolic?
---
Idk, literally the entire thing? Jokerd was a nobody before he got world first.  I guess his imaginary family you made up was starving just a few months ago?
---
Aren't there guards on or near the docks?
---
Well I mean it's the same as when osrs released in 2013. People take the game more serious as most are grown adults not as opposed to kids
---
I've been using tankmaps website. If I tell a group it's my first time there and I need help I'm usually replaced
---
This is what I was thinking and I could see maybe a little queue increase, but Stalagg has been on one layer for like a month and we haven't had a single queue that I've seen since. The reasons exist for the queue to come back some, but how does it go from zero to almost 2000? Something fishy about it.
---
I have a video of this guy chasing me all the way to the Ironforge gates, where he was mercilessly killed by the guards
---
This guy is hella obsessed with roided-out sweaty dudes in the gym... and he himself is a scrawny little out-of-shape shrimp 
---
gay af... not gonna lie.
---
You gain respect for someone screwing over people as long as it‚Äôs not you lol. What an amazingly short sighted outlook.
---
Wondering if somebody knows more about it, because the eyes are such a cool detail that I haven't noticed before
---
Hate to be the owner of the place...
---
*WHADDA HELL HAPPEN IN HERE?!?!*
---
I have family members like this...
---
&gt; [You think you do, but you don't. You don't want to do that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1o3koTLWM)
---
Streamers are cancer. Glad I picked the server I did.
---
&gt;The downranking trend 
---
Yeah, that pesky 15 year trend.
---
&gt;ironically wasting a shitload of mana.
---
it's 'probably' better for pvp than mageblade. Lots of stats and good sp/crit. It's worse spellpower for raiding though with a decent off hand.
---
There is no correct answer... look up the materials that are needed in the ah and add a "fair" tip to it. Thats the price you should be pay. Prob 5-15g as tip...
---
If you're spamming Flash Heal in a raid outside of a few quick heals for AOE damage like Rag's explosions you're doing something very, very wrong. It's only good for PVP. The 5 piece meanwhile affects all your direct heals and is huge for tank survivability, especially if you're Alliance and don't have Shaman helping with Inspiration uptime. And then the 8pc is shit because of how few times you're ever going to be in a situation where PoH is better than a few spot heals.
---
Ok meme         /s
---
Yeah.. just because he doesn't show his family life on stream means he hasn't got one, right
---
Wheres your proof to show he doesn't have a family he's supporting with the money?
---
Great i got 27 via normal greed
---
lmao are u serious with this?
---
You can't peel off mele without it you either need nature's grasp talent or stomp. And even then nature's grasp is inferior. Shadowmeld is even worse than usual because druids have stealth too while tauren get 5% hp
---
They clearly suck srvuubuubly
---
There are currently 20 PvE servers across all regions, and 53 PvP servers.  If you look at ironforge.pro,  the highest population NA PvE server(Pagle) is the 8th most populous NA server overall.  The highest population EU PVE server is Everlook at 13th most populous in the region.  There are nowhere near the amount of PvE players as there are PvP and pretending otherwise is disingenuous.
---
Would also like to hear
---
I would share my secret but then I'd have to kill you
---
The new client is miles better. I don‚Äôt have to use an add on for every single aspect of the UI and it‚Äôs designed to work with modern hardware.
---
Forced upgrades are a sure fire way to start some guild drama...
---
"Mage rotation". I lol'd. Frostbolt x 29 = top dps!
---
Okay manlet.
---
I was a terrible Alliance Warlock named Urthwyte on the Gurubashi server. I had no idea how to play the game. I joined an AB premade hosted by the guild that carried me and proceeded to fear/seduce everyone in sight (insert Ralph I'm helping meme here). I had no idea what diminishing returns were, therefore I had no idea why the other team was laughing at me on the forums after that game ("Hey Urthwyte, you should seduce more often"). Fun times.
---
Does anyone know how I can get the add-on "Details" to show threat as a healer.
---
I want to see how much threat I have on say the tanks target.
---
Right now I have to click on the monster to see it.
---
Interesting... That's what I was wondering about. I guess they added the eyes in for that specific reason, since they'd obviously look more scary in real darkness.
---
Best version of moderation is to set up rules and not follow them
---
Gezuz I watched the second clip.  Someone needs to do a wellness check on this guy.  He's not right in the head.  Looks like the kind of guy you see on the news....
---
And fck Method.  If they dont act on this and permanently ban him, they're basically endorsing it, and are no better than this subhuman.
---
I hate when people can‚Äôt use the word literally correctly &gt;&lt;
---
This is a fair point
---
I'd checkout the silithus thorium run, it's pretty hard to mine those hives unless you have stealth.
---
Newly minted 60 priest.   I forgot how sensitive some folks are about loot at 60.  A good chunk of priest pre-bis comes out of BRD and having run BRD heavily I have most of that.    Tier0 devout isn't pre-bis for any slot except as option for bracer.   I kinda like the look of the devout set and wouldn't mind having it for aesthetic/nostalgic purposes even if it isn't better.  Is it cool to roll need on devout drops even though they aren't the best (and not necessarily an upgrade)?
---
Or if they fixed their servers to accommodate hundreds of people in one place, like the pservers being ran out of 2 dudes basement.
---
It doesn't, but I can't speak to your experience and won't argue with you. The rewritten version on his website is a smooth, faster than average, journey to 60. I found no major issue with it.
---
At 33 desolace, hillsbarad, arathi, upper STV should all have appropriate content. Are you finished with All of those?
---
They're absolutely without a doubt the best. Nobody has anywhere near the achievements they do. They have extraordinary Mythic+ teams, arena, and raiding teams. WoW is more than classic.
---
Congrats, you have caught a grammatical mistake.  It makes you the automatic winner of any and every argument or discussion.  Take care.
---
 Streamers are cancer. Glad I picked the server I did.
---
It was very early. Day/night cycles were distinct-- and nighttime was quite dark. A lot of people ended up complaining that they could only play at night and couldn't see wth they were doing, or appreciate the zones because it was dark. So the "dark" got lightened a bit.
---
"Very impressive" - Nobody
---
This...
---
It's not easy to cast a spell while thinking about the spell you just cast AND the spell you're about to cast, okay? Even if they are all the same spell.
---
Don't pug with a streamer that has master looter lol. This should be common sense by now. Blizzard already stated that they aren't meddling with ninja looting.
---
My point was mostly about chinese gold bots.
---
Update: It took 25 minutes after turning in the quest before the buff got refreshed, lost most of my Songflower and WCB üòÖ
---
Sweet Jesus I'm glad I am on a PvE server this time around.
---
Healer staff?
---
I was in discord yesterday someone asked which races had the best racial for guns.
---
Someone said, "Lemme check \*audible typing\* uhhhhh according to IcyVeins it's black people.".
---
\*LAUGHTER\*
---
Suddenly in discord, several people were like, "WHOA WHOA WHOA HEY HEY HEY YOU CAN'T"
---
Black guy in discord went, "Haha! I think recent news suggests you might want to reroll as white."
---
And we all laughed again, while the triggered just went silent.
---
Like, dude, chill, we aren't trying to start some alt-right start-up in discord while we're farming nodes out here. We're just fuckin' around, chill.
---
But it happens ALL the time now. Chat back in Vanilla used to be RUTHLESS and it was hilarious because most understood we were just playing a game and no one is being serious.
---
In the details panel, look for the "plugins" option and select tiny threat
---
Trouble with selling most engi items is that anyone who can use it can also make it. I‚Äôd say buying the Sniper Scope schematic and selling those might be better.
---
Because you're promoting your channel to get more viewers? Impressing people with your work is one way to do that. Winning world pvp as a frost mage isn't really impressive to most people.
---
I don't understand the concept of cutting something you enjoy to do off entirely because you can't moderate your time. Perhaps practice self-control?
---
Try playing half as much, and then 1/3 and 1/4 until you find a the right amount of play time per week to split times with other hobbies and responsibilities.
---
Dude, it's an illness.
---
I'm sorry that hurt your feelings. I meant from that angle. Previously only saw it after I'd stepped through a portal or flown there.
---
Id give you more upvotes if i could
---
But then how will people do dungeons that no one is going to tank? 
---
Economically speaking there is a demand and I have supply so I charge for it.
---
I looked it up and it‚Äôs DME. Got it...
---
But why
---
did all alliance ditch skeram?
---
if so you're lucky that you're only 33. you can get that in a week on a different server
---
Druids are the king of hiding and running away.  I had success leveling on in Vanilla after honor system release on a mature server (lots of 60s while i was leveling).   Granted I wasn't a powerhouse on killing folk, but being able to pick your fights is handy.
---
They don't need a 2h but they deal significantly more dmg with a 2h than a 1h since they both directly scale with wpn dmg. Also you can charge blood rage sweeping strikes, zerker stance berserker rage, demo shout whirlwind. 100% of the time regardless of the weapons you have on if you charge more than 1 mob higher level than you. If you only have 1 mob charge+blood rage gives you enough rage to MS right off the bat. And if you are only fighting one mob you can stance dance taunt so threat doesn't actually matter.
---
How does dw produce more threat than 2h all you've said is bashing 2h but not actually giving solid reasoning why...
---
While I agree in general that melee are better, the reason that the speedrun comps have no ranged dps is because they just ignore a lot of boss mechanics since they blow up the bosses so quick. The vast majority of guilds, as an example, don't just run their melee into the Shazz aoe, they let the ranged dps take care of the damage.
---
I don't mean anything by it, just a joke. Good video.
---
I think you're missing the point. The HPS you get from down-ranking and +Healing can be equated to int and higher rank spells. If you have mana left over, both situations are overkill and nothing matters.
---
Haha yeah, that‚Äôs why I used annihilation in title, they fought back but was nowhere near close (ended at 97% hp). Thanks and I‚Äôll check it out! :)
---
I also find this mildly disturbing.
---
Heeey I beat a couple lvl 60 warriors in a row on my lvl 53 mage! You know what?
---
No one cares because mages should always destroy warriors in the current state of the game.
---
I'm having a hard time writing this to get my point across so this might be missunderstood, but I'll try anyway.
---
Why would they make the game laggy (500 ms is way to much) for everyone today when the speed and technology is good enough where everyone is on pretty much equal footing, when the issue was only relevant 15 years ago?
---
Making it laggy for nostalgia reasons is not a good enough reason when spells are getting broken because of it. If it's so important to keep it like vanilla was for people with slow computers and internet why not go ahead and fps lock Major city to 3 fps too since that was also vanilla like for some people.
---
Made bank back in Wrath running GDKP's.  Groups I ran I told everyone I took 5% off the top of the pot at the end before divvying it up as my fee for organizing (and people were cool with it), did most of the bosses on heroic, had some stupid large pots where I had to have other people holding gold for me since we'd cap out.  Good times, now in classic I'm poor AF because I don't have a ton of time to play like I did back then.
---
Yeah I agree. It feels balanced enough. I really have enjoyed it so far. Had a que last night for the first time in a very long time (obviously the layers are gone) but it was only 5 minutes.
---
Meanwhile apes is competitive with their whatever comp lol
---
My friend and I were both playing locks, early 30's, and had a 60 rogue jump us in STV and we kept chain fearing and curse of exhaustion until we killed him. It was so much fun
---
Thanks for the thought!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs gonna lose everything for taking staff of hot garbage in a random MC pug.
---
Seems to have affected the queue a litte bit, my server had a queue last night for the first time since the first week of launch.
---
Why I can't have kids now &gt;.&lt;
---
What server are you on?  Who's your toon?  If you think it's so badass, then let people know.  
---
Yeah, that's what I thought.  If you did that, you would need to reroll because people would avoid you like the plague.  Clearly there is nothing admirable about what he did.
---
Stallag has had queues before on a few other Tuesdays around raid time. It hasn't been as bad as it was yesterday, but I'd imagine a lot of people didn't get the memo that P2 wasn't live and logged in to pvp.
---
That being said, as an Ally on Stal, I fully support faction specific queues. Waiting an hour to get on just to find BRM is camped out the ass by horde is pretty painful.
---
Been also looking for this, I think something said its weak auras with sime wago.io string but I dont even know how that would work,so..
---
Bump
---
I agree there‚Äôs a problem, but I didn‚Äôt cause it and I‚Äôm not about to wait in a 500 player queue every time I want to play to make it better. The only reason there is such heavy imbalance on those servers is because a bunch of alliance got sick of getting pvp‚Äôed on in balanced servers and wanted to flee to servers such as heartseeker where they now enjoy a massive majority, when in reality those players should‚Äôve just rolled PvE from the jump.
---
Apart from the notable streamers aren't they likely just a bunch of retail players on welfare?
---
He has no way of not knowing whether he wasn‚Äôt not surprised.
---
this is a two part question:
---
1. does anyone know if the combat text here that says stuff like &lt;corruption faded&gt; , and that shows the damage that I am taking is a setting or an addon? (if an addon, which one is it?)
---
2. does anyone know the add one that shows the DoTs on top of the targets health bar?
---
thanks in advance!
---
because its automation. and automation is not only against the eula (not that blizz cares because $$) it‚Äôs also cheating and only absolute twats cheat in miltiplayers games. If he moved all those 20 chars in place manually by alt tabbing jnto each one its fair game. But he didn‚Äôt. If tou think multi boxing is okay then botting is okay as well.
---
I just get around it by being in coms with my mage and healer so the other two dps don't matter so much
---
If you want something to really happen, post the clips to LSF and watch the drama ensue.
---
Engi is absurdly strong in pvp even for a mage. Whether its sappers for even more aoe dmg vs raids, reflectors which win the mirror, death ray which makes your opening burst absurd (mine does 1700 non crit), rocket boots for chasing and kiting, world enlarger to make you harder to see, rocket helm for 1v3 (helm one sheep one kill 3rd), grenades for aoe stuns and peel.
---
Engi just makes the game more fun full stop.
---
Super creative mate. Let it die already...
---
It‚Äôs funny because you can actually abuse this now in everlook and gad now. You kill people near a wall and the guards far away will start shooting you. If you jump at the wall they will shoot you out of the city and you can run away for free. No more annoying net spam
---
Nesingwary camp for alliance and grom'gol surroundings for horde, although the problems I've encountered on Flamelash is that Horde doesn't camp the Alliance base, but the Alliance does that in Grom'gol.                    
---
Might be a biased answer, but I haven't encountered anywhere so many ganking assholes in the form of gnome mages. May be because there's so many playing the class, but no other race/class combination with the exception of dwarf priests gank lower level players but cower at the sight of lvl 60s.
---
This is the thing that I got blamed for saying just merely a few weeks ago. I'm gonna say something right now and it's going to be big truths.
---
And that's many men don't like it when other dudes come in here to just vent or *just talk*, the way we are about our feelings. They simply don't like that. They want guys to stay within the walls of strong silent types who keep their emotions bottled up. They resort to name-calling, insults, all that childish stuff.
---
I say, well too bad. We're gonna talk about it, because it is relevant. What you felt right now, I felt exactly the same. Many weeks ago I saw all these 60's ahead of me in MC/Onyxia raids and I'm nowhere near 60 and only had a very small inkling of the enormous road ahead of me to even get anywhere near where I wanted to be(with them).
---
When I missed a raid night, I was informed that tons of loot dropped, all of which were for my class...which got off-specced to someone else in the raid. That definitely gave me the case of temporary FOMO. But last night's raid definitely made up for all that.
---
In short yes I know exactly how you're feeling and my case I definitely powered up to shoot myself to 60, just go ape on dungeon grinding(I tanked them as a druid, I was not going to be struggling to find a tank, no way jose, even though my end goal was to be healing as resto).
---
The only thing I can offer you for now, is to just do what you're doing, with the time that's given to you. Try not to open up that guild tab and feel out in the cold when you see a huge list of 60's in Onyxia's Lair.
---
[Here's a couple of screenshots from inside Org tonight...](https://imgur.com/a/YNHPQ4L) this is the first raid night that Firemaw is unlayered and we're feeling the effects. Can't imagine what it's like over on Gehennas which is even bigger than our realm.
---
I started those areas earlier than I should have and those wrists got me to 33, but now I have altered mount quests and arathi quests are all red except one.
---
Sounds like OP already has drama and a ton of wasted gear. If needed epics are being DE'd or sold, that's a problem.
---
Go to details options and create a new window. Then mouse over the cog wheel and go up to raid add one and click Tiny Threat. The second window will be for threat. It will show the threat for your target though, not the tanks target. I don't heal in classic, but when I have healed in the past I have always had the mobs as my target, which I think is the way most people heal. You shouldn't be actually targeting players you're healing and you should be using mouseover macros instead. At least that's how I understand it.
---
I don't see why not. Especially if you mention something before run and/or roll.
---
Construction workers are cancer. Glad I picked the server I did.
---
Your class doesn‚Äôt really apply. Your gear drops regularly with a reasonable drop rate. It‚Äôs different for melee. There are 2 good 2h weapons with a 5% drop rate each from Ragnaros.
---
Player A sits on all his DKP and gets first (and maybe only drop for MONTHS). Eventually he gets everything else too, by default.
---
Player B rolls on upgrades. He gets ring and gloves and ranged marginally faster than Player A, but he didn‚Äôt horde his DKP so he probably won‚Äôt get a weapon until phase 3. Why even show up to raids anymore? Why spend all the time and money farming buffs to show up when you have 0% chance of getting what you want? Especially if there are 2-3 hoarders ahead of you.
---
Yea I‚Äôm on fairbanks and we log every raid yet you can‚Äôt find a single person from our guild on that website.
---
The text is in normal combat settings. An addon for dots would be neat/tidy plates.
---
What if half of them quit and unsubscribe because they become bored with classic, or half of them quit because they don't want to play BC?
---
It's a sports term, I think football, for on the bench. I see it a lot in fantasy football talk.
---
Bro, can you read?
---
I‚Äôm not entirely sure what the alliance did but I looked it up and there‚Äôs only 30 percent alliance compared to 70 percent horde
---
This is so very true, I kid you not, I got like 7 resist on Gehennas yesterday (yes I have my +hit gear), this had never happened so badly before, I did 28 DPS on that fight. 28 DPS. I believe I landed a single shadowbolt on the entire fight.
---
I have had multiple guild members stop playing because irl &gt; game. It is a hard balance and I have trouble time times myself. Wish you a happy adventure in life.
---
The burden of proof here is on you jackass.  But I wouldn't expect you to know this considering your lack of world view
---
Unless your guild/raid leader asks you to do so, No.
---
I'm sorry, what is LSF?
---
I am sad. I thought that guy is chill (or better i hoped it) he started to greed some moones ago.. not first time. 
---
Someone knows a cool guy (would be cool if he is mage) which makes good wow content?
---
And what does that have to do at all with looking at logs to get better if it is a gear check?
---
And his reason for mentioning method was because it made him feel more secure that a high level, well-known member of their organization was hosting a raid.
---
No where did he or anyone say that method was the best classic guild. He was always talking about the organization.
---
He using force reactive disk and just gets all the heals basically
---
The guy is an actual full blown loser. Total ruined mind internet kiddo. Kind of guy who will get punched in the face walking down the street because he can't keep his mouth shut. Not surprising.
---
Agreed, Mal"Ganis &lt;Goon Squad&gt; has all the world firsts that matter.
---
I was going for more of an authentic classic feel, but I guess at this point I won‚Äôt get that
---
I was a level 29 orc warrior soloing some mobs in Ashenvale. Got jumped by an alliance rogue while at about 1/2 health and engaged with a mob. Figured I was going to die anyway, decided to ignore the rogue and finish off the mob for more exp / quest credit. Kill the mob and level up to 30, get a full heal ... proceed to bash the rogue‚Äôs face in. I would have loved to see his/her real life reaction :)
---
I have literally tried this in a duel with a druid. Doesn't happen. When they go bear Viper Sting wont drain anymore
---
Only if you want the ability to make goblin sappers instead of buy them.
---
Your "respect" is worthless.
---
I kill them because their health bars are red. Red = dead.
---
But honestly, its because I got ganked by the alliance first. When I was leveling I left allies alone. At around lvl 35 some rogue camped my body for a good hour. Truce over, GG allies.
---
You have to forget Engineering completely and relearn it, after that choose the other specialization. No other way.
---
I'm thinking about the stuff you couldn't get: Scarab Lord, Hand of A'dal, Raid mounts (assuming they do Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion, BFA servers).
---
A lot of people would pitch a bitch.
---
Plus, there's the additional server resources to be kept tied up in the 'older' expansions.
---
If you have someone for sappers save your time
---
Quite simply the effects of bots on the server economy does not spoil the experience enough for most players that Blizzard deems it worthwhile to pay people to actively stop bots in real time.
---
If you're a gaming company, it's in your best interest to not sponsor people who are ruining a game's experience for others.  
---
I take a professional approach to my job. If this is his job, then he lacks professionalism, and if it hurts him, that's his own fault. If it's his income then he needs to act like it.
---
Only blizzard engineers know why the servers lag.
---
It likely cannot be fixed in the near future. 
---
There are no more layers.
---
Ok then. Since you missed the point entirely...
---
This is like arguing about whether a traffic jam started because of the accident or because of the people rubber necking. 
---
It's like you're just looking for something to argue about, when there is no argument in the first place.
---
Try to find a leveling / social guild. Alot of groups happend outside of LFG. Also 33 is a borderline low for SM, so you might have more luck around 35 or taking the tank-role.
---
Is there only T1 Druid gear for healers only? Im leveling a Druid right now as a tank, not sure how much fun I‚Äôd have healing
---
The private servers had a much larger impact than I would have thought.  There have been years of testing the min/maxing specs/gear/etc so there are clear best options.  And beyond that, now there is organized collusion between Horde and Alliance on some PvP servers in order to monopolize some content.    
---
And Blizzard is too inept to deal with the server population issues let alone methods that violate the ToS.  They fired their best customer service agents last year and now people have little faith in the new group- and given the examples of horrible CS that have been shared, such as the guy who reported roof top exploiters being penalized by mistake, it's right to have so little faith in them.
---
My guild has had 3 of them drop, we only have two 2H users in the entire raid, one of whom prefers their earthshaker. So it's either shard now or wait for nexus crystals to come out and shard then.
---
I've reportet 2 very obvious hunter bots at Deadwind Pass Ogres... they were still around days later.
---
Speaking with his voice down so his mom won't wake up lol
---
Got it. It‚Äôs mostly the tip that I have no idea about. Is 5-15g pretty standard, or does it vary based on how rare the recipe is?
---
It‚Äôs a lot higher damage but you can die way easier without ice barrier and ice block. I‚Äôd go with deep frost at first until you get geared. It‚Äôs way easier to stay alive. And you don‚Äôt really need winters chill because usually another mage in the raid will have it but it‚Äôs your choice.
---
And for CDs he probably meant the arcane build with arcane power.
---
Yeah imagine thinkin mc raiding and retail mythic raiding are the same... kek
---
I don't agree with streamers taking items but in that last paragraph you really come off like a childish dickhead. Who are you to tell if somebody has mental health problems. Being a part of the stigma is honestly worse than taking some pixels in a 15 year old game.
---
So funny how people like you think that because it‚Äôs a 15 year old game that makes people less ‚Äúhungry‚Äù for loot. 
---
First of all that‚Äôs now how it works. People will always want loot. Secondly, the ‚Äú15 year old game‚Äù argument is a bad one because the game itself was different 15 years ago and how people played it 15 years ago was ESPECIALLY different. It‚Äôs basically a different game now. But keep on trivializing it because it‚Äôs a 15 year old game‚Äù and you‚Äôve already played it right?
---
ret is a shit spec in many ways but the dudes problem was that hes an asshole for attacking a player based on their class, not that he's wrong about ret being flawed. not important but yes holy is a much better and often preferred spec for PVP, but hybrid players still deserve to enjoy the game. no one wants to heal and only heal forever. all that said ret still has some very powerful dispels, freedom, bop, sac, buffs, and you could do much worse than that. even a paladin with 0 talent points can be a really powerful healer, it's just that often the ones you encounter that aren't specced holy aren't thinking about much beyond crush crush crush
---
44 warrior, same boat.
---
I plan on finding quiet places and grinding, and when found, fight tooth and beard till my demise.
---
For Khaz Modan!
---
Just remember, you will meet horde along the way that aren't pricks. I've actually emoted to an alliance to slay a dishonorable horde who was on the arena in tanaris ganking people. We bowed after he slayed him.
---
I heard if you stay in any horde main city you get passive honor and it's the fastest way to ran up.
---
The meme was basically that a bald lone gnome 'won' over Method in the race to world first 60
---
In the end no one comes on the internet to have their mind changed, just to find other people to echo the same opinions... So there‚Äôs really no point to these posts because the ones doing these things literally don‚Äôt care about you or anyone else, just the same as me not caring for their version of fun.
---
Lmao, what a prick with no RL.
---
Also an original Sen'jin Ally! Guild was called Fudge Dragons - Old char names were Dynox and Draevax. It's been a long time.
---
"Leveling a warrior..." "offhand weapon...".
---
As a warrior main,  I died a little reading this.
---
People are just as equally stupid, and equally cruel as they were back in 2006. And people are just as easily offended. The only difference is that back then most people weren't as entitled and understood that life isn't about having your feelings accommodated to.  More importantly, if they did, they were usually called out for acting like a whiny little bitch. So long story short, the younger players who complain are a bunch of pussies and the older generation that complains were always pussies but had hidden it until it became acceptable to be a massive pussy.
---
Mulgore has been my favorite zone ever since I made my first tauren. I don't play any tauren....but I like the zone
---
In the options under combat you can change the combat text to arc and that how you get the damage number and aura fades
---
This can be done using either the floating combat text setting in the game or by getting the addon miks scrolling combat text(msbt).
---
Doesn't Blizzard also employ ex Method players for raid design or use them as an inhouse test team?
---
Always good to be rid of dummies early though
---
I don't think that they're afraid of any backlash for admitting anything. They have openly admitted everything you have said here about not having previous versions of the game because they erase them on big patches.
---
And a known troll in Jokerd. Blizzard is mostly leaving ninja looting in classic to the community to deal with and that‚Äôs the right way to do it, don‚Äôt be dumb and fall for shit like this.
---
And there is a 1500 queue right now ...
---
The thing w/ Titans is that very few guilds feel the need to use one for MC/Ony. There will be an uptick for BWL and then a surge for AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Unfortunately that is a timeline of months (at minimum) so you may not see a large need for those on the AH.
---
However, the amount of gold in the game will really only go up so people may be willing to splurge on that kind of thing more often going forward.
---
But you‚Äôre in 1k
---
Druid population is too small for that to really matter
---
‚ÄúPlayers, in order make sure everyone has exactly the experience they want, we have decided to add an in-game experience vendor, the great Izzy Fizzcashbucket. Izzy has some great items he wants to bring to Azeroth, including the beloved keyring. Izzy will be the first ever currency plainswalker, and can accept both in-game gold as well as your local, real world currency.‚Äù
---
9 of the top 15 raiding guilds on the server are alliance, and onslaught (top horde guild in the world, and currently ranked #1 overall) has recently had to resort to running into the mountain far in advance of their raid in the middle of the night to avoid getting killed and losing their world buffs by the assembled alliance coalition that would otherwise be waiting to wipe them at usual raid hours.  The overall population is heavily skewed in favor of the horde,  but so far the alliance has proven to be much more competent and better organized when it comes to endgame PvP.
---
Don‚Äôt worry man I‚Äôm not trying to say you specifically have a sad life, just giving my thoughts on many others I personally know and happen to act in a similar fashion in regards to other people‚Äôs feelings.
---
Stuns don‚Äôt break from damage.
---
- Stuns don‚Äôt break from damage
---
- Slows don‚Äôt break from damage
---
- Fear has a damage threshold 
---
- Immobilization has a damage threshold 
---
- Incapacitate breaks on any damage
---
- Charm breaks on any damage
---
- Sleep breaks on any damage
---
- Disorient breaks on any damage
---
- Banish cannot be broken and makes the target immune
---
I think I got all of the CC types. Could‚Äôve missed something. There‚Äôs also special exceptions like Blind is a poison and can be dispelled, Hammer of Justice is magic and can be dispelled
---
THE MASTER HAS SPOKEN
---
u/OblivioAccebit On the other hand mageblade has  the offhand for PvP purposes like aquamentas for more DPS, skull for CC break, pouch for heal. 
---
In the end it's more like Spinal Reaper and BRE in my opinion. Spinal Reaper is rock solid, an axe and overall a good PvP item; an arcanite reaper on steroids basically.  The sheer OPness of BRE makes it such madness that nobody really talks about SR, although it's not a bad pick.
---
That‚Äôs literally completely untrue he just reroofed in Faerlina.
---
The real classic experience baby
---
Is he better at spamming frostbolt than the rest of the world?
---
This is more true than some people think.
---
I myself leveled to 60 very quickly, because I have played a lot of private servers like Kronos, Elysium, Nostralus (spelling..).
---
I played a lot of private servers but never really raided too much or did anything at 60 really.
---
I am a leveling genious but a level 60 noob...
---
You can configure questie to only show you where quests are available and not show you where you progress or turn them in.
---
Or If you want a true "authentic" experiance,  you can just ask for advice in your servers zone/global channels about which zones you should check out.
---
It is his fault, and everyone else in that raids fault, they didn't know he was a shit bag?  GTFO of here.  Common fucking decency is something you would hope for out of everyone.  I wouldn't have known had I joined. Do I need to google and research everyone in a pug I join?  Because that makes sense.  Maybe that troglodyte shouldn't do that, and hopefully Blizzard bans his account.
---
I believe that since backstab and SS scale with weapon damage that the math overall works out that the +5 damage will give you more damage in the end than crusader.
---
I mean, I don't think I have as many hours as that guy, but I'm probably at about 15 days total. I work a full time job, am married, and leave my house plenty. My biggest thing is I work from home and have a job I get a lot of downtime in, so I play a lot during work hours. It's time I have to be available to be contacted during and, in general, be at my computer, so filling that time with WoW makes sense and makes the day more enjoyable.
---
awesome thanks!!
---
Are you using OmniCC?
---
If you're having issues with the addon report the issue on the luf github page.
---
It's for PvP vs casters. Every hit lengthens enemy cast time. 1.0 attack speed turns into .77 with frenzy, really punishing for non instant cast spells. [Petopia attack speed list.](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php)
---
A lot of people care about the raids, the raids are pretty good and I like mythic+.
---
And you are by far the least played class. Raids should be picking up 2-3 druids anyways.
---
Jeez way to try and ruin the guy's whole career over an item drop...
---
Just proving how pointless your comment is, don't worry about it, genius
---
Its totally okay to be gay, but being in the closet is kind of funny.
---
Fair enough, I guess it's possible to world first the newly released retail raids without poopsocking the game in between?
---
Besides reed and eye, what would be bis?
---
So that guild of twats who I tried with later did some stupid things too.
---
They decided to reform the guild but didn't tell the members. So you saw this:
---
Notable officer gquits.
---
More officers gquit.
---
Members begin to gquit.
---
If you're saved you get whispered and ordered to gquit and ginvited to the new guild.
---
GM makes a statement later saying *it could have been executed better*.
---
Stupid thing 2:
---
Conflict between two members escalates. GM gets messaged from an apparent friend of one of the members that they were in hospital after a failed suicide attempt from medication. GM doesn't believe the story and story hits close to them so gkicks the member and their alts. I try to keep playing with them but I feel shit due to how that member was treated. I ghost the guild. That member and community are back together and I don't know how they got over whatever.
---
But you don't think the specific lists of quests, carefully ordered and compiled and then delivered in a programmatic fashion that took easily scores of hours of work - isn't a "product"?
---
By your logic, then, I can copy the text of a book and give it as a text file to anyone, yes?  Or record some music I hear and give that away as a free download?  Nothing tangible is being lost by either producer, it's just their hours of work that's being shortcutted.
---
My dark horse theory is they are adding guild vaults as well which will require patching
---
Yeah getting to level 15 over a 3 month period is really rushing it
---
The most fun part, is people pretty much stupid thinking that streamers actually good guys, and not complete dumbasses
---
Some real insider info right here
---
Yeah, seems like an inadvertent change to all goblin guards
---
Now a bunch of shit tanks are going to act like their the shit. Thanks asshole.
---
The current batching is even worse than it was in Vanilla with regards to "impossible" events occuring. Case in point: While dueling a mage earlier, I fake cast a flash of light, cast a renew, then got counterspelled out of Holy. Wat. Maybe I was just lucky, but I never had that happen to me in Vanilla, nor do I recall ever hearing of such a thing happening.
---
Sounds like a server merger might be the best option for ones like these?
---
what a wholesome feelgood story
---
In that scenario both answers are kind of true. In this scenario either layers are a fixed size and realm cap is just number of layers√ósize of layer OR realm cap and number of layers are two independent variables. One of these is true and the other is false
---
What an absolute disease this guy is.
---
&gt;we're getting the shitty newer version of Alteric [sic] Valley
---
No. No no no no no. Don't say that. 
---
Is it true? Are we getting the shitty ticket system?
---
Botting and multiboxing aren‚Äôt the same thing. Did someone hurt you? Did a multiboxer camp you? So much built up anger.
---
I can lasher farm effectively at 57? and its good enough XP to be worthwhile doing over spellcleaves?
---
‚ÄúI have a fine selection of women‚Äù
---
&lt;Not Today&gt; for sure and ive heard guildies say &lt;SoV&gt; but i haven‚Äôt seen it myself. some of them were controlling the devilsaurs almost entirely at one point.
---
Ah the Chad Method raiders who day trade between pulls vs the Virgin pserver welfare kiddies huh.
---
Don't believe it for one second.
---
Posting there has the possibility of causing massive shitstorm and since you seem to hate this guy (He does come out as total asshole) it's possibility you can explore.
---
Well as someone leveling warrior when you're solo it kinda sucks
---
Which metrics are you using to rank guilds?
---
Every mage gold farming in the game does.. seriously?
---
Hedeleted the mage why people make stuff up wtf
---
Try cutting the umbilical cord.
---
"Loot skating", forgot about that.
---
Max rank Flash Heal costs 380 mana. 60 of those in a 90 second window would cost over 22k mana. Even with a base pool of 7k, that's 15k mana in 90 seconds you're having to make up for, which is flat out not possible. So none of what you said is true, at all. You're either downranking heavily, not actually "spamming" and getting quite a lot of downtime, using mana potions, or some combination.
---
Everyone forgot
---
Fix'd
---
yea, MSBT was the only thing i found that seemed to be what i was looking for. but then i saw that it isn‚Äôt compatible with classic and that you had to do some stuff to get it working and i‚Äôm kind of new at this and it seemed kind of complicated
---
Now they finally reach the first intended patch, they have lied.
---
Worse for pvp than mageblade as well, you can‚Äôt use offhands like the cornerstone grimiore. It‚Äôs not bad at all for either raiding or pvp, it‚Äôs just not the best option.
---
Haha yeah probably.
---
A fair point about offhands. I have the ancient cornerstone grimore from ony and it's incredible in 1v1 pvp
---
Your argument doesn't even make sense on a fundamental level. If you have 5-6 people that need a 2 hander, 4-5 people are going to have to wait. It doesn't matter what your system is.
---
If I really want to get one ill circle a zone, usually silitus, until it spawns and get my first timer going. And while I'm waiting on spawn I do run around and get herbs. 
---
My main thought is I want to control one zone. After i get the silitus spawn Ill either herb in un'goro or port IF and check the burning steppes (takes 5 mins or so with epic mount) then port over to moonglade(druid) and check winterspring. Herbing as i walk to each node spawn.
---
Sometimes Ill have 3 timers but given the wide spawn on the lotus, there is too much overlap, which is why I focus on the one spawn.

Nice, so you know he wasn't constantly layering until level 58 or so. Nice that we agree.
---
What an idiot.
---
Anathema for sure but not crazy like 60a 40h
---
Most WoW streamers have mental issues, avoid them like the plague
---
Just make sure the kid doesn't break his arms...
---
Sure there exists counter play. But same as I need to be able to cast the stuff the shaman needs to be in a position to purge it. And at least from my experience even a few seconds of uptime usually make my GCD well spend.
---
In the end a shaman can shut down a paladin fairly good. But he himself can't do much else when he does so. So both players are out of the fight. Sometimes this is to your benefit, sometimes it is not.
---
Blizzard - "WE NEED MORE HAMSTERS! Can't let the server crash!"
---
&gt;positive sides are more than negative here actually. at worst you end up with some gold in your pockets.
---
That's really funny considering I saw and participated in these in Vanilla. When it was current content.
---
It was a way to -  
---
1 - get into the instance and get a particular item that you might need  
---
2 - it was a way to make gold for say... an alt.  
---
3 - it was a way to get gear for an alt if you were swapping mains and had the gold to do so.
---
4 - it was a way to get to know more of the people on your server outside of your guild if your guild wasn't the one doing the run and to see some fantastic displays of what we can do as an individual that can figure something unique out about the game.
---
In that case why wouldn‚Äôt swords also go superior striking?
---
There was an addon like questie in Vanilla.
---
Alternatively. You can use a guide or wowhead to figure where to go for the quests
---
Assuming the same number of herbs are produced by actual players and not bots as there were in patch 4.3, 5.4 and middle Legion then yeah the price would raise dramatically. 
---
That's the point. Prices would raise so much that gathering professions would be worth doing because of the price of the mats and the crafting professions would be way more profitable because of the scarcity of mats reducing the amount of crafted items relative to demand.
---
This might not be the best metric, but MC clear speed. Demonstrates organization both organization and skill.
---
Which guild is that?
---
Partially correct, DW is currently better due to the HS feature where your OH's never miss.
---
Nature resistant, they like to resist my faerie fire
---
if you want to be an optimal tank, this is not a good build. A pure tanking build would go [something like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5550201303020151-05002)
---
What I did, as I play a fair amount of kitty DPS in raids, is move some of those tank points into DPS increasing cat talents. The whole thing is very flexible for a feral druid, think about it as moving stuff on a scale, where one side is DPS and other is tanking. That's how you should perceive the Feral talent tree, nothing is written in stone.
---
What I think is your must is going for Omen of Clarity and 5 points in Furor.
---
Anything to stay relevant, I guess...?

Not exactly an enemy encounter but one of my most vivid memories is seeing this night elf rogue decked out in the PvP set in darkshire and being completely in awe at how cool he looked. I was a rogue too and he gave me a few tips and we chatted for a while. It was the first time the game opened up a real sense of wonder in me.
---
Yes and no. There will be cross realm battle groups. So it queues won‚Äôt be based on a servers faction balance. However, Horde outnumber Alliance across all PVP servers in general. So all Alliance should have better queues for BGs.
---
Being a shitshow person is part of the branding for many streamers like this. People watch to be amused by their behavior, not to support a good player. They encourage the streamers to be assholes because they find it funny to watch people "get mad over a video game".
---
This type of behavior will never stop, because they have entire throngs of viewers actively demanding it. THAT is the product Jokerd and his type are selling, not gameplay footage.
---
Man fuck this guy!! Anyone who takes a game so seriously that they treat other people like shit and literally make fun of other people is pathetic af.
---
What's even worse is the fact he's not even that good at the game. These fucking streamers I fucking swear....
---
No, that's not it at all actually. More like "that sucks, but like how didn't you know what he's like? I thought everyone knew. I don't expect blizzard to do anything".
---
Let warriors tank
---
I'd recommend you grow a pair of balls and stop whiny like a little bitch. If he wanted to ensure bs like that doesn't happen make sure it's set to group loot, other than that you're just trusting a scummy raid leader at best. Winter's  chill is a shit talent anyways. Pop cooldowns!? This is classic news flash... there ins't any dps cool downs besides defensiveness ones for the mage. This whole post is a whiny shit feast. You are literally witch hunting a player by this thread, which is against Reddit's TOS, you can not witch hunt a person because you're a salty moron who trusted people. Jokerd may be a dick, but everything about this posts tells me you're the moron who got a well deserved lesson in trusting strangers, I mean you had to learn it one way or another. It's best you learn it in the video game rather than in real life where you could end up in a lot worse of situation for doing the same stupid mistake.
---
/r/unexpectedBryzgalov
---
How brain dead do you have to be to 1) play on the streamer server and 2) think this wouldn‚Äôt happen pugging MC with a streamer than is a known troll. You get what you deserve.
---
Method is the best in the most difficult parts of the entirety of World of Warcraft. You might think it's irrelevant, but that's your opinion.
---
I regret not choosing troll, cause I wanted to try different racials on my shaman.
---
You can complain about the cause of the problem, but going forward how does that help? We're talking about proposed solutions here. 
---
What is your proposed solution that is better than faction specific queues? I can't think of any. 
---
Forced transfers would cause mass chaos. Not a good idea.
---
Most likely blizzard won't do anything impactful enough to help and the servers will continue to get worse and worse. Horde transferring by a large community effort is the only realistic way for realms to be better balanced. We'll see how that goes.
---
So he effectively have bis pve weapons throughout p3. People just hate the idea that good melee weapons are stat sticks
---
Anyone have a twitch link of Joker that isn‚Äôt busted?
---
I won't cry over spoiled milk... but I might cry over missing keyrings.
---
If you do this shit, you‚Äôre literally such a loser I can‚Äôt even put it into words. I think it‚Äôs a great peek into someone‚Äôs character. Selfish, unapologetic, and otherwise just scum. Sometimes you see the worst in people, and then sometimes you see people brag about being the worst people. Hope he spills his gamergirlbathwater on his PC. Fuck this guy.
---
Cool. More profit for me
---
Fairbanks is pretty good, little horde sided but alliance are usually the one grouping up and doing shit while all the horde just watch, at least from what I've seen.
---
This and threat control went away in Dungeons during Wrath. I was super disappointed at the end of BC when people just AOEd the mobs down. I kept telling myself it was because we were at the end of the expansion, and everybody was OP as hell. I was looking forward to Wrath where we could return to CCing mobs and taking them down one at a time. But it never came. This was one of the biggest losses of the game.
---
 that window moulding seems like it was made for a gnome to stand on
---
imagine missing the point of the thread, how daft can you be
---
Thanks!
---
Does crusader always beat fiery in shorter sessions?
---
The background here is that I have 4 rogues multiboxing for certain dungeons. I can handle most 60 dungeons with a healer already. However, most of the encounters on trash and bosses are short, bosses especially being generally no more than 30 seconds, 15s if I pop cooldowns.
---
Given that, fiery has been pretty consistent in damage output and proc rate, it fires off ALL the time especially on 4 chars. 
---
If I were to switch to crusader, would the variance in 1ppm be too inconsistent?
---
It is profitable
---
Jokerd is the embodiment of arrogant streamer asshole
---
How salty can you be about 2 poopsock guilds killing Rag.
---
as one of my heroes would say, "If you ain't first, you're last."
---
But seriously. It is a race to 60 for world first mc/ony. Unfortunately, 30 monkeys could clear that. The upcoming world first BWL and AQ clear would be mildly interesting.
---
It's means all hype, but nothing substantial.
---
Or Asmon ninja'ing Perdition Blade
---
Time to find out where he lives and beat him within an inch of his life. Thatll show him.
---
Maybe. I dont have the experience with the very very top guilds like that, but I was in a guild that got some server firsts and it was really awesome.
---
I guess that taking that step from really hardcore to famous attracts shit human beings.
---
Username checks out
---
Man; wow really attracts one of the worst and pathetic ppl out there
---
No. The master looter has full authority to decide where loot goes UNLESS other loot rules are stated in chat. If Jokerd said something like "loot is ffa, nothing locked", then this is a ninja and Blizzard punishes for that. If nothing was said, he will get away with it.
---
Sit in IF all day. Game over.
---
All this stuff to a non-wow player sounds super weird, even in context.
---
Yes indeed.
---
Hubs said he had enough fire resistance for BWL.
---
Not enough warriors tanking right now, and there is a shortage of tanks on my server.  I just wanted to help at least with dungeons.
---
Even at a month in, most players are not terribly casual
---
Sounds like a win-win
---
So why don‚Äôt they secretly contact a PServer guy and borrow the AV code?
---
Same for me to find a group after 8pm is so hard and exhausting
---
I‚Äôm a thin noodle guy myself, spaghetti is as thicc as I like them
---
I‚Äôm waiting for them all! Haha. I joined wow in Cataclysm so I never got to experience either of those expansions. I was super thrilled about classic, I‚Äôll be excited for BC or Wrath servers as well
---
It's an old twitch chat joke.
---
\*pvp
---
Are you finding you have trouble tanking 5 mans with your current build?
---
I would think that build would be ideal for what you want to do.
---
Why do you?
---
Streamers are **way** more accountable for their actions than regular players. Everything they do is under a microscope. They won't lose their entire fan base for shitty behavior, but regular players don't even have a fan base to lose in the first place.
---
Why lie like this?
---
Lolwat
---
Nice
---
Or just has no other actual priorities.
---
‚ÄúExploiting‚Äù paths? Lol it‚Äôs game mechanics
---
what a fuckin loser. The guy gets a modicum of fame and loses his mind.
---
I remember when people said Vanilla was about community and ninjas would get punished. Now it is "Who gives a fuck"
---
that's honestly really cool. I wish we had that
---
Having a GM that caters to the wishes of his friends(which are usually also officers in these scenarios) and bends over backwards for them is what causes drama in guilds. It is better that you and them are in lesser positions of power in the guild structure after the merge. You being an officer and having a voice, but not ultimate control, sounds like a much better fit.
---
Not really sure why your friends would be miffed about you guys not leading the raids unless they wanted special privileges on loot or something?
---
Well the question is: how many players should be able to be on one functional layer fighting at the same time. 
---
If world pvp should be a functional part of the game with world bosses the number needs to go beyond 80 right?
---
In alteract its easier as players are mostly spread out on an elongated map and players are not joining and leaving the zone randomly.
---
But is this realistic? How many players can be together in an open world with current server technology in wow?  
---
(Also blizzard always planned to get rid of layering until phase 2 but they expected player numbers to drop faster.)
---
&gt; pay off their guild members to take loot for themselves
---
How?  I thought you can't trade gear
---
Unless their paid rolls are counted separately, which would be bullshit
---
I started a guild (me as GM) with a few IRL friends that I got into Classic. Once we all hit the 40 range we all joined a bigger guild on my server because realistically there wasn't much we were getting out of the guild that we didn't get out of just a discord group. I'm 57 and they are all just hitting 50 now. They all have left and reformed as their own guild again and im the only one left in the raiding guild. 
---
Their guild will never raid and they are alright with that. We will stay in separate guilds but we all still hang in our small discord unless there is a need to be on coms with a dungeon/raid group. 
---
Personally I prio my IRL friends over guildies for just hanging out and ask them first if im doing Mara (or something their level) because we are friends. But I'm happy with my guild and the new connections I'm making.
---
Items are linked to a raid ID. Will get same items now or later
---
It is, but I wanted to get Holy shield for certain hard hitting bosses or hard pulls.  Just an idea I had anyways.
---
Answering my questions with another question. Bold strategy, Cotton.
---
It is possible to make "better" bots but the fundamentals stay the same as the base game is still the same. They go through the same steps in legion as they did in cata. Obtain fresh(in regards to use with WoW) socks5 or vpn, purchase license, level character, create or use path, move about it and right click herb/ore while running combat routine when agro'd, transfer mats inevitably to another account(be it yours or another). 
---
The raw generation of herb and ore is basically always going to be enough to filter the number of suspected accounts to a size that makes human processing of them manageable and/or makes it so a large amount of computing resources can be applied to said accounts to confirm. You also have what the character does aside from gather and if the account plays any other bnet games, the age of the account, irl identity to payment method, and all the game specific technical stuff like bot traps, speed and kind of inputs, etc etc to further filter the accounts down. 
---
I do see your point that yes the bots can get more complex but there is a limit there too because each bot still needs to cross break even to be worth using at all. What they do is make sure each account is profitable and then scale infinitely running many instances of the game on the same computer across many computers, often with 4-16 windows up on a monitor at a time and monitor them(or not). So the account must make enough money in gold to pay for the IP, WoW license and sub across however much time, compute and electricity, bot license/paths/routines and then profit to be worth doing at all. The more complex creation and maintaince of the bot software is the higher the break even point goes. All they have to do is keep it below that point. 
---
Lastly they can manipulate second hand market gold value in some ways via the WoW token. 
---
I really think its a problem they could reasonably solve for the game that basically funded the studio and all it's creations for like a decade.
---
Who‚Äôs the GM
---
That is awesome!
---
I'll give you part 3 of part 2 of my strategy..
---
Color-code sent documents‚Ñ¢
---
Fuck that dkp is so you don‚Äôt roll. You‚Äôre skirting the whole reason to use dkp if they just force rolls on items people need but don‚Äôt want to buy into they buy their weapon etc first.
---
In retail I buy pay people from my server lots of gold for drops that are BiS for my spec and not theirs if they get the drop, I feel like this is kinda the same and it‚Äôs fine.
---
I'd say hunter if you're planning on alliance. You are the only class that will wear mail so if your time limited you'll have an easier time gearing out. Warlocks need to compete with mages, priests and sometimes druids. Both are fun to play and will do well in raid and pvp.
---
And they‚Äôre still not as popular or as well known as the method org. There really isn‚Äôt anything to argue here. I‚Äôm aware that other orgs exist
---
They should check with my friend, the Prince of Nigeria. They can give him a small amount, like $5000, and then he can wire back the full amount.
---
Easy peasy!
---
I have not read more rubbish yet. It turns out monitoring agents and analytics software (which work on separate servers) affect performance. Only one thing is important, people pay money - but get mediocre quality. Actually, the ability to provide quality and competently allocate resources, build infrastructure or something else is their problem.
---
I‚Äôm not a layman in this area and I will say this, performance should always be tested (load testing) and if your code, your infrastructure, or its capacities do not pass at the expected tps, you should change this before selling.
---
Isnt ther any possible comparison to other mmo games? What are the largest real time battles of this kind out there? 
---
Is it technologically viable?
---
yea the +15 agi AGI enchant isnt in the game for a cpl more phases (phase 4 i think)
---
Usually people have to pay lots of money to avoid that.
---
"Genuine" Vanilla experience... but with Twitch..
---
How many of these speed runs have you all attempted?
---
yeah. check the price of the enchant of your server too. If you find someone nice you can get it for less. On my server 15g is standard but I get all my enchants from guilides so I cant talk about it too much.
---
Kirtonos
---
This was actually in correct, I was told by people I know he was banned for layer abusing, but this was actually another stream. He simply just deleted his character.
---
You make good points, Armin.
---
How the hell can you come to the conclusion that Stalagg imbalance is due to ‚Äúalliance carebears‚Äù? Alliance literally can‚Äôt transfer. Horde can. If they want a challenge to show how tough they are, go to Heartseeker.
---
If you get ganked, never rez immediately. Always wait a couple minutes. Most players will leave after after a few minutes but if you rez quickly, they‚Äôre likely to continue camping your body for a lot longer.
---
I love Frost's videos, never watched his stream though.  Seems like a chill guy
---
Grobbulus. Alliance generally win mass PVP currently but it‚Äôs as balanced as you can get. Entire server is a bloodbath :D
---
RPPVP server but you don‚Äôt see RP unless you look for it
---
That works temporarily, but the fact of the matter is anyone with most of their pre raid BIS gear is still pulling aggro off of a pally tank and either need to cut back on dps, or like warlocks have to continually stop dps due to having too much threat.
---
There is something seriously wrong with this dude.
---
Casting intensifies
---
I only watched him once during a drunk stream where he talked a bunch about how in love he was with some "Just Chatting" streamer chick. Was really weird.
---
My server was the 2nd most populated PvP server on the wowhead report from September while having that 33/67
---
If that is what you are getting from this whole comment chain, idk man. You started off this whole conversation about how superior looking at logs is and what not... and now you are coming at me for defending details and how you can use it LOL
---
This guy. All I said is I think you dont use it and thus undervalue it...
---
More accurately SS doesn't give a % boost at all, it does weapon damage + a flat value.  Ambush/Backstab give a % weapon damage bonus + flat value
---
It was not officially announced, but if you search this subreddit you‚Äôll find posts about it. 
---
Of course, I understand where you‚Äôre coming from! I made my first characters on Thalnos when it was one of the first three realms released before jumping ship to Stalagg. It didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense why they didn‚Äôt release BR/LA servers on launch. Then they opened transfers which I guess none of those people took.
---
Let's reach out to their sponsors. Thats the quickest way to fix this. Who can help compile a list of their sponsors and contact forms?
---
Wash yer back!
---
Really impressive! I am also in one of those speedrun guilds (Raid 2 since it's more comfy) and it made me realize how much money you SAVE from spending an hour tops getting worldbuffs, getting into MC and clear it in less than an hour. Only need 1 Mongoose, very few squids etc.
---
Everything is pre assigned a week ahead, loot is also distributed a week ahead and everything runs very smooth due to good leadership. It also made me realize how itemization isn't that bad in classic raids. I've got no loot for weeks (im full preraid bis so only get upgrades from MC and ony for now) and in the last 2 runs I was showered in them since the other people of my class (namely rogues) already had the pieces and now it's basically my turn.
---
We (R2 and other guilds we made a coalition with) also protect the main raid and escort them to MC to prevent alliance scum from sniping our world buffed raiders.
---
I've never experienced something like this on Retail and it made me realize that progressing on bosses sucks and it's more fun to have a rather simple raid but you just push it to the limit yourself.
---
method does have quite a lot of world firsts while world first ragnaros was killed 15 years ago ^/s
---
Would take bloodfangs empty server anyday over this shitshow. Jesus Christ
---
I'm not sure the details, but they could have procured another edgemaster's and gave it to the guy who was wronged.
---
Cool, glad I signed up for a streamer server and play in a streamer guild. I'm a nobody and i have 3 pieces of tier 1, 1 piece of tier 2, get any enchant for free with mats, guild members help get mats together for other guild members (not just the streamers) to get items (like I got 4 mooncloth for free from guild members for truefaith and I've helped other priests after I got mine), dungeon runs are constantly happening ship it's easy to find groups, we are usually at gurubashi every 3 hours, run wpvp events every day,  and more. 
---
Not all streamers or streamer guilds are scummy.
---
I mean, I dont know if this is entirely accurate.  I didnt necessarily go to sun well isle to pvp.  But I did fight every ally I saw.  Which I wouldn't have been able to do on pve server.
---
Once upon a time I played pvp. Back then I had much different priorities and my definition of "fun" involved a colossal amount of unchecked rage.
---
We're just getting warmed up.
---
Haven't even started yet.
---
So, you're still early.
---
This is just one of the pitfalls with a DKP system. It's inevitable. I've had the best success with a DKP/EPGP + loot council to keep the hoarding in check. Loot council for tier pieces and DKP for everything else, or in some circumstances loot council forcing a DKP spend.
---
No system is perfect.
---
Wow, yeah. I‚Äôd be glad that guy is gone.
---
I honestly don't remember how they handled that in vanilla, but I'm nearly positive they've done it before.
---
Oh shit really? Than I have been giving wrong information to people. When I get home I'll take a look at this page and see if I can understand fully. Thanks!
---
Rule 3?
---
Yeah but none of those guilds turned into massive esports/streamer orgs that expanded beyond wow into other games. Method isn't even a classic guild afaik they just had a few of those personalities playing it.
---
Method is trash.
---
What class are you talking about and what were they wearing? It wasn't specified in the comment. You just mentioned in general the idea of a level 35 green.
---
You Can transfer free on Thursday afaik so welcome to our empty server haha
---
same but with the layer change im expecting them to return during prime times. i only had a 20 min queue yesterday loggin at 4:30 server time but apparently there was a 2 hour queue at 6:00 server which i haven't seen anything close to in a while.
---
If he can only name 4 guild that is still super low pop, only 160 people.
---
Way more than that being newly formed every night from pugs
---
I dunno man, most of my time spent in open world is just travel because I dont have any gathering professions.
---
Level 23 warrior here, I'm leveling as arms because that's what everyone says to do but I really like the dual wield style of fighting more. Can I keep dual wielding and still put points into arms or get a 2 hander. I really want to respec my points into fury and commit to the style of play that I like but I don't know what to do
---
Spam email him jokerdttv@gmail.com
---
Right, I wasnt op. I was asking. Is the eye and reed better, or the reed and dm trinket?
---
Why is that? My lock is pretty fun, can solo stuff easily, free mount, lots of support spell. AoE spells are average to bad but against bosses i can easily be top dps. Weird
---
What a fucking douchebag this guy ninja is, I‚Äôve never heard of him but now I‚Äôll remember who they are.
---
Well technically.... he and a bunch of other people playing his account beat them to level 60.
---
It's the same on both sides, your situation on Stalagg was the same for Horde players. World PVP isn't fair.
---
Point to where he calls for action then.
---
It's best for pvp.
---
i was necronis on LB - HWL rogue, i remember entropy, unfortunately because AM ended up taking some of their tanks for NAXX :( but that's so awesome
---
I have two 60s on different accounts. I solo DM east on my warlock looking for herbs, cash, and the quel serar book for my warrior. In the other window my warrior camps a couple thorium veins to save up arcane crystals for my (fingers crossed!) hand of rag. Still having a blast helping my guild gear up for raids!
---
War stomp is free heal. It's NS leave strong. It's more versatile than NS, doesn't need mana and is aoe. Spend 10 levels with shadowmeld to realise its not great at all. Maybe one extra drink tick, it's extremely easy to remember where the elf just went invisible.
---
Are you?
---
if they can't pay for good servers you really think they can pay for employees to sit and check the activity of 50 people on each server?
---
&gt; it would require too much thinking on the spot
---
This entire post boils down to one equation with 2 variables, specifically to simplify figuring what what gear you should take:
---
&gt; `15*(475+0.86*H)/(M*0.86)` Int per 1 +Healing
---
The rest of the post was just showing how to derive those numbers, what they mean on a deeper level, and what kinds of misconceptions they can clarify.
---
&gt; Im a shaman... and pump either rank1 CH
---
Oh, then the numbers are a little different.  r1ch has a .7142 coefficient, and 357 base heal. I have no idea what your current +Healing or max mana is, but here's your equation using r1ch as the standard candle:
---
&gt; `15*(357+0.7142*H)/(M*0.7142)` Int per 1 +Healing
---
This post completely ignores HpS in favor of efficacy. HpS is at least as important as efficacy and in many situations much more important
---
They *encourage* that behavior. Welcome to the world of streaming. And you're contributing to it every time you watch their clips.
---
I can confirm your anecdote with my own personal anecdote. Also did the remote into queue thing, never heard of anyone getting banned for it.
---
I'm not sure what you're getting at. Do I think it would be extremely weird and odd if blizzard reduced pop caps on top of merging layers without making a post about it? Yes, I absolutely agree with you. If blizzard reduced pop caps on top of reducing layers for a server like Skeram as you claim, there should therefore be a blue post about it. The one you linked was just talking about merging layers, not reducing pop caps.
---
I'm not trying to be confrontational, I'm just not sure if we're both on the same page. What I'm looking for is a blue post that says "prior to Tuesday the 12th, the maximum number of players on Skeram was set to 19k. After Tuesday, it was lowered to 8k." Obviously they wouldn't give numbers, they'd just say they lowered it, but I wanted to be clear with what I was saying.
---
Honestly, what probably happened was way more people quit with plans to return when phase2 released than we thought, they didn't hear that phase2was delayed to Thursday, and all logged  in en-masse to try out the new honor system.
---
If blizzard actually did lower realm pop caps I'd be extremely interested to know, but as far as I've seen from following blue posts it never happened. I expect Thursday will be full of queues as well.
---
It wasn't in a raid, but I had hammer of grace stolen from the brd coffer.  I had screenshots to prove my claims that I had won the roll and that it had been ninja'd, but the gm didnt care. He basically said that sometimes mistakes happen and that I should start grouping with only people I know and trust.  I added the perpetrator to my friends list to see if they received any kind of ban.  They didnt.  They're still logging on daily.
---
This kind of thing is so weird to me - and I don't believe it's a bad thing. 
---
But back in the day when most of us were 15-20 year old nerds (aka losers) it was absolutely common to make racist/anti-Semitic jokes or be endlessly crude about women and no big deal. 
---
15 years later guilds have so many more women, transgender people, old people in them and guild/discord chat is much more self-moderated and tame. Clearly that's for the better, but I'd like to see the reaction of an edgelord teenager from 2006 to 2019s social environment - they'd have a fit about girls playing.
---
Or it does matter because he's a disgusting thief who occupies a protected position of power.
---
I think with herb dm east is better
---
Are Hunters that are doing solo Tribute runs able to sell Barb Blade to non-stealth classes?  It drops off the final boss rather than the chest so I doubt it
---
Well its the same people, so not much difference overall.
---
I do agree cookie cutter specs and min/max is more prominent than it used to be, but that's to be expected given proliferation of information.

Not when this is your first exposure to him. Fuck that dude.

We don't know that for sure.
---
If there were enough servers and no layering to begin with this wouldn't be a problem right now.  People would've migrated a lot sooner before hitting 60 and having weeks of raid gear on their character.  I get popular servers might still have a que but that que wouldn't be as bad since some of the people would've migrated when they got tired of waiting.  Dead servers could just be merged with other servers to fix the tourist issue as well.
---
Hopefully Method will get rid of him. He seems to be a shit person all around and shouldn't be representing them.
---
This is so beyond what I expected as a response. This is invaluable, thanks so much!
---
Okay boomer
---
A lot of them do, and have joined the guild and are integrating nicely. It's just a small handful of them that are feeling left behind, and I want to try and reassure them that things will work out.
---
Who cares lmao
---
This is the exact reaction he wants from you. Should be obvious he doesn't think in any way that ninjaing that staff would hurt his reputation a lot, which it won't because most of his fanbase doesn't give a shit.
---
Like 36/40 people in the raid didn't care. 4 people left and that's it. If you wanna use a public personality as a reassurance to not get ninja'd from, you really shouldn't use Jokerd, who absolutely wants you to get mad at him.
---
How do you deal with the last boss? Seems like it would be hard to 2-man.
---
And how is APES doing in retail? This conversation isn't isolated to Classic, nobody is going to call Method the best Classic organization because they're clearly not and nobody would dispute that.
---
And yes I realize this is a Classic WoW subreddit, not retail, but the topic at hand is a member of Method and how it should impact the Method organization as a whole. To be clear, it's about a Method member's actions specifically in Classic WoW (which is why it's in the classic subreddit) and how that might/should affect that organization as a whole (Which includes things outside of classic like retail).
---
Isnt it more about people passing on tier items so they can beat everyone else on weapons?
---
You guys really need to chill, this is just a game....
---
I don't even know that dickhead, never heard of him. All I know is that you're both mentally challenged. You trusted strangers and got burned, what a fucking shocker, I mean who could have seen that coming!? Like I said, glad this lesson happened to you in a worthless video game because if it did in real life you be bitching a lot more.
---
Not surprised. 
---
It is the usual behavior from these "memers" kind of dudes.
---
You're so full of shit it's mind boggling. Botters multi box too. Are you really trying to say that this guy with his 20 accounts that he's just leveling up together is worse than a botter with 20 accounts that are doing nothing but farming ore and herbs to pump into the economy while they're not even at their computer? The multiboxer is not affecting the game any differently than 20 random players would. Botters literally ruin the economy. There's no comparison.
---
I have no idea, the thing is I was never "in charge" in the friend group, so it might be a paradigm shift issue.
---
Edgemaster's with the correct weapon will reduce the hit cap from 9% to 6%, and also reduce the glancing blow penalty. If everything is exactly the same, Edgemaster's will give you more damage/threat. Period.
---
If you're not in discord during a raid you need to uninstall the game.
---
vanilla people are legit crazy damn
---
Anyone else just waiting for her to take her shirt off?
---
In before OP realizes the gaming market is literally saturated with high quality games that all have potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay. No temptation at all, right...
---
L'appel du vide.
---
Well, not really surprising.
---
The guy is the personification of twitch chat.
---
Yeah... I'm not the original dude you were responding to. I just thought it was funny that you were (what appeared to me to be) flexing your details skills on reddit. It just seemed like such a strange thing to do that I couldn't help but comment. Sure, I may have misread your intent, but to me it was like you were saying "do you even details, bruh?".
---
This guy. Gotta read them usernames.
---
But almost every online game bans in waves for this exact reason?
---
Exactly, this is like going to lunch at popular restaurant over the noon hour on their busiest day of the week, but then saying "This restaurant is ALWAYS so packed!!"
---
No, its not, but it looks that way for 1 hour a week. Wait 10 minutes after the head drops and then take screenshots, they will be sparse.
---
‚ÄúNo one liked this.‚Äù
---
Yeah, I've seen just one situation where that kind of healing throughput was necessary: someone living bombed almost the entire raid on Geddon. Otherwise, people would have to be actively trying to take damage to require that much throughput.
---
just fyi it is  8pm EST  (9:30 pm NT)   it was posted in response to other sever's players sitting in Queue,
---
I would love to have 5 minutes like that
---
Again yes, it sounds soooo simple. But if you have ever coded before, it‚Äôs never just that simple. People tend to attack blizzard the moment something happens which upsets them, but don‚Äôt bother putting 1% effort in thinking from the developers perspective. While I agree a faction specific queue is a good solution, stop demanding something new the moment blizzard does what we asked. They are human as well, let them have time to work.
---
Ty for this. Looks like I need to move my points around in the balance and resto trees. I did not take improved rejuv as basically every resto Druid guide said to avoid hots and use healing touch as the bread and butter. 
---
Also it looks like you prioritized moonfury over vengeance and I did the opposite. Prioritizing bonus dmg over the crit damage. 
---
What‚Äôs you‚Äôre crit percentage?
---
a warrior would definitely be faster than a mage. no downtime for mana, just pull pull pull
---
Method absolutely 100% has the most clout in WoW and has for several years. They have the best guilds in retail for both PvE and PvP, they also write most of the guides out there for Wowhead and Icy Veins.
---
I think the best advice so far is to rotate the people who get benched as best as possible.
---
When you are forming the raid, think about the composition you want the raid to be. How many healers do you want to bring? Will you have enough Decursing/Remove Curse/etc?  How many tanks do you need? How many warlocks do you want to banish elementals? Do you have hunters for Tranquil shot? Form you raid with those things in mind and then keep track of the eligible raiders who you sat for that night/week. Make sure that those raiders get a priority for an invite the next raid night/week if they have met all your raid conditions for that night (like being on time, etc).
---
People are more likely going to be ok with sitting out if the rules for who sits is clear. You can do a "fair" system like this and let people know that everyone will have to sit out at some point (minus the MTs) and that sitting out is not a punishment. Then just do you best to actually rotate your raiders and not allow biases (better dps or who you like more) to cloud your decisions.
---
Another option is to create a raid rank and make clear that raid rank players get priority and non-raid rank members get to go only if the raid rank players aren't there.
---
It‚Äôs a genius thing to do, everyone just wants to be on your stream because they are pathetic sheeple, so it doesn‚Äôt matter how many you take advantage of because there is an endless line of fools coming to give him their loot.
---
idk how thats an issue either. I gave a mage 600g for an item I wanted because he still needed epic mount but he had more Loot Council points. If he agrees to it whats the issue?
---
The point of the thread is "Streamer is a ninja looting scumbag who thinks being a streamer gives him priority over everyone else."
---
Smart people already knew that. Hence - "imagine doing a raid with a streamer"
---
Damn. Are you one of those private server guilds, who had your raid team assembled pre classic?
---
To be fair they never specified *which* year.
---
What points does he make?
---
There is a massive horde overpop generally in NA. So horde will have queues, same as in retail.
---
No, it is about passing on PvP and off-spec gear, and getting things for what you are doing in the first place PvE and for the spec they play. Guy just does not understand that purple =/= BiS or even close.
---
I spent a ton of my time in wotlk leading boe runs in ICC. Rings and other things that would sell for 5-6k, and I also raid led groups to the fourth boss for DBW, which I personally had to open the chest for and distribute (on a melee class). 
---
I know what it‚Äôs like to have the power to steal the fruits of 20-40 other people‚Äôs labor for myself. The thought never even crossed my mind once. It‚Äôs just not right man. It‚Äôs pixels in a video game and you‚Äôre thinking about ruining 8-10 other peoples days because of it? Not to mention having literally everyone involved view you as a scumbag?
---
Your OP made it sound like much more than a simple passing thought. You sounded unsure if you could do the right thing, and you said it was a temptation. Luckily the situation didn‚Äôt come up.
---
What a queer.
---
Method would never higher this guy as the owner of Method itself is very open how much he hates this guy. 
---
He literally went into method stream when he got capped had his whole stream go to their stream and spam "GET GNOMED" and a ton of aids and cancerous words during their race to 60.
---
Druid T1 is pretty awful outside of PvP. There are only a couple of upgrades for us in MC. This means if we were running a DKP system we would be way ahead on the band.
---
Oh come on all they had to do was just slap together the BfA client and just give us skinned WoW Classic on top.
---
Easy. **I'm just kidding guys, really**.
---
&gt;it's not a prerequisite to play 12+ hours a day for months at a time to fully min-max.
---
I'm not sure what game you've been playing but this isn't a thing in Classic either. I'm not sure if you've seen any of the Monkeynews streams but after the race to MC they basically finish off their characters and wait for pvp/new content. Playing 12+ hours a day for months isn't really a thing for top end Classic guilds.
---
Feel free to transfer to heartseeker and balance that out.
---
&gt;  wowhead report
---
Once again... Blizzard does not release real numbers. The numbers you get from wowhead are way off at best, wow head uses the 'community' to help form a population base. Think of how many people have never even heard of wow head, or better yet know of wow head but did not take part in their population survey or however they gathered said data. I am assuming they did a mass survey of some sorts.
---
I run with a guild so I'm not worried. Also I don't make loot rules for dungeons, so I know blizzard won't do anything about that.
---
My main point of contention is that having that kind of min-maxing outlook on character racials is not how the average player probably decides on what faction, class, or race to make.
---
I think most players just have a personal preference and go with their gut.
---
I'd have to say that when you look at the entire WoW population, there is probably a Horde dominance. I fon't think it is fully a result of slightly better PVP racials. 
---
It probably just has to do with Allies being gay as hell.
---
We need full logs to study this further, really hoping this a fake news
---
They way world pvp should happen. Objectives and resources are the best things to fight over.
---
Eye of the beast + briarwood is best 
---
Eye + DM trinket is next best
---
God I hope not, all of the people that were patient and made the right choice get punished by the shitfest that is paid transfers
---
For min/max I‚Äôd say troll but the undead just look better in cloth and have far better animations in my opinion.
---
I guess people are awakening up about streamers.
---
It means he's simple.
---
Layers being removed shouldnt increase queue times though....it really doesnt make sense to me.  I thought the realms had the same player cap no matter how many layers they were divided into.
---
There‚Äôs absolutely no reason to be struggling at this point. If your guild is having a hard time clearing, and they aren‚Äôt your close friends, just leave and find pugs because they can do better. Mc is ridiculously easy
---
Don't join raids with streamers.  Problem solved.
---
How do you get to the deeprun tram without first going deep into either SW or IF first?
---
Shadow priests who use Mind Blast on random crap while tank is still gathering up mobs should be castrated.  Go chase to taunt the mob then agro falls off another unit...
---
Why would blizzard do anything? Being a dick isn‚Äôt against the terms of service.
---
Who do you think is the best in wow if it isnt method?
---
That was a just a joke he was making.
---
&gt;viper sting ogre by my pet on king fight. Autoshot triggers quick shots which aggros the king while he is still close to me
---
OMG LMAO YES YES THIS
---
What did staysafe do? I am under the impression that everything he does/says on stream is 99% sarcasm
---
I was talking about OP being a huge bitch about it but people just want to shit on the streamer. If you just watch Joker's stream for 5minutes you can tell he's a childish edgelord who lacks any empathy.
---
I wouldn't be joining his PUG for the life of me, much less sticking with him to Golemagg. 
---
This dude went all out saying he doesn't care but he's actualy seething. He sent his sponsors an email describing the situation. Dude actualy wants to see this guy crash and butn because of this. Joker is a douche, OP is a whiny bitch.
---
Join a larger guild on the server? We have around 400 members and usually have players leveling alts in SM. I find it hard to believe the collective server has passed that zone entirely.
---
Yea good point about cycling offhands.  I was just unaware this even existed because everything is always about mageblade.  Appreciate the response.
---
Until you're capped, 1% hit will translate to about 1% more dps; slightly more because you'll be generating more rage. Glancing blows are complicated. The hit and glancing blow reduction from Edgemaster's will generate more threat and DPS than an equivalent amount of hit%
---
Edgemaster's are BIS for all of Classic for any non-human/non-orc warrior of any spec. You can find specifics and formulas about hit and glancing blows here:  
---

'I make image memes' -&gt; 'I make image jokes'

'For the memes!' -&gt; 'For the jokes!'

Thank you for the response! I know there was a census add-on, but I guess it hasn't worked since late September or something? I feel that it could be useful, especially after the transfers
---
That's hardly strange
---
You guys trade so people stop asking for the worst idea ever of paid transfers. You guys want classic to be classic right? Seems like you‚Äôre trying to kill it asap
---
If people are using RMT to compete against each other in a GDKP system, anyone who doesn't RMT is going to get a shit ton of gold compared to anyone else playing the game normally.
---
The only people who lose are people who aren't running GDKP runs with RMT people
---
Never trust someone who got world-first in a fifteen year old videogame, they haven't spent enough time around normal people to learn what it means to be a decent human being.
---
&gt; Do you mean couldn't give 2 fucks?
---
That is exactly what I meant.
---
Sounds like you just burned yourself out.
---
Since when do Night Elves have glowing eyes?
---
You can't be the "best wow organization" if you never even set foot on retail (you know, the real wow)
---
This. It's the complete opposite if what OP is looking for but I'm Herod Horde and can confidently say the Alliance needs you.
---
Do you big data bro?
---
Seriously, it is trivial to set flags for account behavior.  Someone is pvping 24 hours each day for multiple days?  Ban.  Someone is repeatedly logging in from two different geographic areas or addresses.  The distance between the two spots is too far to achieve in the time between relogs.
---
Or introduce a packet to data being streamed to each player that bounces back to the server.  Calculate the average time for the packet to return and you get a relative distance from that hub.  Any regular huge discrepancies get looked into.
---
There are so many ways to you can monitor millions of accounts it's not even funny.  Meta data is extremely hard to spoof and protect from discovery.  VPNs only get you so far.  Using various methods, you can determine small fingerprints that each computer uses.  So if you can determine someone is playing 8 hours in LA and 8 hours in Houston every day, you have a very solid case for account sharing.
---
They need to answer an email that got sent to original accounts email and person trying to log in has to enter the code not that difficult
---
Np amigo.
---
That may be true, but that's not how most guilds are behaving. Most are banking all BoP epics with their enchanting officers in case they do turn to nexus.
---
What a cunt.
---
&gt; No, it won't. That was the entire point of this post. I used an unrealistically efficient spell to illustrate this point, as well as made other assumptions in favor of +Healing (ignoring added crit from int, and the need to cast other stuff). People see that +Healing scales with your entire mana pool, but they don't recognize that Int scales with your +Healing by the same effect. More balance between the two optimizes your potential.
---
You're missing what I'm saying. I'm not saying that the new surface favors +healing over int. I'm saying that the entire surface (in both directions) has a greater slope - which is why you downranked to it. But to even reach that surface, you need to have a lot of +healing.
---
Essentially, once you pile on enough +healing to shift into a lower rank of healing, you gain an enormous efficiency bonus all once that isn't reflected in your numbers. It's not just a single continuous surface like your model suggests.
---
&gt; Most fights are constant casts.
---
Only in retail and trivial fights.
---
In Classic, the FSR encourages a style of healing for Priests that's dramatically different than for other casters. Because Priests get such a large value from dipping out of FSR compared to other casters, there's an enormous incentive to heal in bursts rather than spam-heal.
---
For single target, this means you generally pick a tank and cast a relatively high (but not necessarily maximum) rank on them. If, close to the end of the cast, the target doesn't have enough damage to absorb the heal, you cancel the cast and start over again. This keeps you in high regen mode the maximum amount of time.
---
Likewise, you keep an eye on the overall state of your group and respond with Prayer of Healing if enough players have taken damage to justify the PoH.
---
I think the reason so many people haven't learned this is because they're misreading sites like warcraftlogs. They look at the top logs to see how the 'pros' are doing - and never stop to realize that they're looking at extreme outliers operating under bizarre conditions. Most notably, they tend have to extraordinarily short times for their fight length which makes mana a completely irrelevant.
---
&gt; You'll find in raids that you can't just slam the tank with a GH, expect no overheal, and then get to chill for a couple seconds. You often need to keep topping them off so the next big swing doesn't chunk them into critical condition or just dead.
---
Bear in mind that you are not solo-healing a raid. You've got Paladin/Shaman who are constantly pounding away with light heals on the tank. All you need to do is momentarily increase the aggregate healing on the tank to stabilize the situation.
---
Im herod alliance and got stuck in a 2.5k queue.
---
I use steam link to check auctions periodically throughout the day as well as a few occasions where I used it to fish or sell ports/water while I was sitting in my living room. No bans so far.
---
Go respec fury imo. It fits with DWing much more and is fine to level.
---
I think the big reason people suggest leveling in Arms is so you get Tactical Mastery, which helps in early dungeons. It isn't necessary for tanking, despite what people claim. It does make getting threat on larger packs easier though.
---
Just being a whiney bitch. Getting the witchhunting going on when he was being corpse camped, was pretty douchey in the faerlina discord.
---
Well, I think that mostly settles it for me. Earlier in Classic, I definitely couldn't justify the cost, but now that prices are down to only 300g for an item I'll use for the rest of the phases, I'd be kind of silly to not pull the trigger. Thanks for the explanation!
---
Bot means he plays like an AI. We're not talking skynet AI where you would get dumpstered. We're talking Halo easy mode AI bots.

Tl:dr he's garbage at his class and his only skill is fast leveling.

i switched and while i've enjoyed it and love that i can make my own sappers its more of a quality of life upgrade than anything. if you do a lot farming for sapper mats (for instance mara solo runs have a lot of mithril) i've found it really helpful to just make your own and sell the extra (price have gone up a shitton on my server). i also planned it out so didnt spend any extra mats/recipes leveling up the gnomish, only the minimum to make all the gadgets i needed so it wasn't THAT expensive.
---
youll be missing out on the dragon gun thing (AoE cone in front of you that doesn't seem great), the goblin bomb dispenser which is basically a trinket bomb without the stun, and refilling mortars which seem like the best so far to me.
---
If the raid tells you the loot rules are in discord and ask you to join and then You doubt check them or join discord and complain about loot it‚Äôs your issue not theirs.
---
Unless you have Viskag idk why you wouldnt
---
You should be able to do DM east lasher runs as a deep frost lvl 60 mage even with bad gear.  If you need an explanation dm me. 
---
The cool downs are in the arcane tree.  Mostly just arcane power (spells cost more Mana but do more damage) and presence of mind (next spell is insta cast). So the idea is to wait until there are 5 stacks of winter's chill then arcane power and pom to get as many max damage frostbolt casts in as possible. 
---
I wouldn't bother Respeccing unless you were trying to join a raid group and they already had a wc mage.  Deep frost is fine/good for money in DM east
---
you‚Äôre clueless if you think thats a false equivalency. No human can alt tab 20 times and press a spell in a matter of milliseconds. They press one button and a program replicates it any number of times. Again, that is the definition of automation.
---
Do the queues balance horde and ally? Might be a good way to balance server pop.
---
Unanticipated queue. Not sure if that is 100% true. Me and my homies expected some sort of queue.
---
Yeah this guy is wrong. There was a queue ally side whitemane as well.
---
If it cant be used in combat thats fucking useless then lol yea its significantly worse than tauren then racial wise
---
Knew he was dirty the second I saw he rolled GNOME you cant tell me the red flags weren't there.
---
Any publicity is good publicity. Or so seems to be the case these days. I had genuinely forgot he existed until you posted this.
---
The gloves never sold on AH, Royson already had the money to buy his epic mount. Like the guy said, it was fake drama.
---
I'd say both.
---
The type of person who would start working at getting good at 'WoW Classic power levelling' is likely to have poorer than average social skills. (A mean stereotype about gamers, but unfortunately still fairly accurate).
---
But spending most of your life just playing WoW constantly would only have made matters worse.
---
This why I avoid streamers like the plague lol
---
Good thing the bulk of the retarded ones are on Alliance, makes that much easier.
---
What the hell, what happened to Jokerd? When he got the world first 60 he seemed like this super chill guy who laughed at the guys over at Method for being tryhards getting beaten by a Maltese (?) dude.
---
Now he's not only part of method but a huge asshole as well?
---
Really dissapointing. The fame did get to his head.
---
Nope
---
Oh no don't get me wrong. Merging layers one server absolutely should introduce a queue. If you can fit say 10k people on a layer at a time and your server has two layers, then you suddenly merge those layers, bam, you've now got 10k in game and 10k people in a queue.
---
Blizzard was very clear at the start they couldn't just increase the number of layers. Because when they merged the layers in phase 2, all the people on the excess layers would get queued. It'd be terrible.
---
But... that didn't happen to Skeram on Tuesday. It already was merged on the 22nd. So if it didn't already have queues on the 11th as a result of its merge, there should've been no queues on the 12th either. Servers like Herod and Faerlina getting their layers merged shouldn't have affected servers already on one layer before that.
---
So either blizzard silently reduced pop caps on already-one-layer servers, or, more likely, just a bunch of people coming back for phase 2, which they had thought was on the 12th.
---
It's still a deterrent. Each time either of them wants to play they would need to go through those steps.
---
Good idea my man, I had to do the same thing.
---
Yeah I'm not saying I don't understand how money and resources can help, just that it's a reductive summary. I don't think anybody is claiming Blizzard actually can't "fix" this issue, but what people think of as the resources to do so are wildly off base. Maybe Blizzard realizes they'll need to rewrite a large, fundamental piece of the game engine and that they can't even estimate the time required to do so.
---
Do what you enjoy. To play a warrior competently, you'll need to stance-dance, which makes Tactical Mastery in the Arms tree almost mandatory. If you want to dual-wield, go for it, but you should really really really really really get Tactical Mastery before dumping points in to the Fury tree.
---
Imagine the void inside him when his 5 seconds of fame are over.  Feels completely worthless.
---
On a side note, he hardly has any viewers on his clips hahaha.  This guy is a nobody.
---
If they say the rules are in discord.
---
And even then, is it so hard to copy paste them in ingame chat?
---
I get that you're obsess with your Manastorm pants but I don't care. You put forth a scenario whereby a healer is wearing level 35 green pants in a raid - why would such a scenario even exist?
---
Kill sharing isn't going to be an effective means of honor grinding.  The amount of honor gained from repeatedly killing the same 10 people is tiny compared from the same time in a pvp hotspot.  Each player has a diminishing honor return for the killing player.  So by grinding the same group of players, you are not 'hacking the system', you are running into the very system designed to circumvent said behavior.
---
Account sharing may be possible but there are means and methods you can use to detect it.  Play patterns are very easy to detect and flag for review.
---
Which "they," Blizzard or those players in the video?
---
I did not say any greens are better, you decided on that stipulation yourself, but I do have multiple examples.

DKP decay is also one way of people saving up DKP in one tier to use in the next. A bit of this happening is prob ok, a lot of it probably isn't.
---
What I would consider a dead server are for a few reasons.
---
1. Outside of peak hours finding a dungeon group for the dungeon you want is close to impossible. Even during peak hours you have to spend time finding a group.
---
2. Low population, also means inactive and skewed AH/economy. Less people in the world getting items means less items available. Sure this might mean some mats may be cheaper. But greens, blue, epics all those wont be seen cause not enough people have opportunity to get it.
---
3. Raiding throughout the 6 phases will need recruitment as most raiders won‚Äôt raid all 6 and may stop in between. Thus you will need to do recruitment. Recruitment is about numbers, low pop server makes this very hard. 
---
There are a few other reasons, those are the main ones off the top of my head
---
That's what i'm calling BS on, if no rules are stated in game then loot and you're running ML then the guy who has ML has complete authority to distribute loot as they see fit.
---
Whether or not the rules are stated anywhere outside is of no concern, you can video someone clearly botting right now in BfA and send it to Blizz and they'll tell you that they won't take the video into consideration but thanks for the report.
---
Same applies for loot rules, if you ever had an issue and it wasn't otherwise clearly state IN GAME prior to running then there were no rules. I had issues over the years where our loot rules were stated on things like Teamspeak and was told the same on numerous occasions, likely part of the reason they use personal loot nowadays.
---
I was a young traveler like you, until I took an arrow to the knee.
---
to be fair, jokes are 100% within the richard dawkins definition of a meme.
---
That's exactly what I said - if you want fast clears, you bring lots of melee dps. Most guilds are not *actively* looking for fast clears, and most healers cannot keep up with things like Shazz aoe. So most guilds just have the melee just sit outside the aoe and use their bows.
---
white knights be gone
---
&gt;I'm an idiot and an asshole
---
agreed, have a nice day.
---
You're still focused on this "anyone can stay on top of the game" for some reason. I never said that. 
---
&gt; You responded, to a thread that is about a parent who is leaving the game, because he has a newborn.
---
No - I responded to a *comment* which said this:
---
&gt; To get anywhere in this game you have to make some huge IRL sacrifices...That‚Äôs the sad reality of this game as you get older, it‚Äôs very demanding.
---
I guess I need to reiterate this: I never said *anyone* can stay on top of the game. Of course you can't raid in a hardcore guild if you can only play 1 hour a night. Lol. For some reason, that's what you think I'm saying. The only claim I've made that is similar to that is *anyone who can put in 10-15 hours a week after obtaining pre-raid BiS and level 60* can stay on top of the game. I can't argue with you, because you're setting up an argument that isn't mine.
---
Then they want to deplete the entire server population in the face of World PvP and for server stability. For my server, Skeram, it was definitely Horde only.
---
Try getting a /inv with that enigma
---
Appreciated.  I'm also curious about the whole logic of, "Don't transfer these servers will die soon" when you are sitting in a queue that could populate said server.
---
Welcome to classic did you forget ninja's existed? This is hilarious if he was such a dirt bag why was he raid lead :). Sounds like a bunch of lazys to me
---
World first 60 is mostly about no-lifing the first 48 hours. Once you've significantly outpaced the leveling curve you get to farm mobs completely unhindered with zero competition. That alone makes leveling so fucking easy.
---
Green Lens is how I‚Äôm making engineering profitable 
---
Shadow or frozen go on AH - the rest are disenchanted for Large Radiant shards
---
Mats cost about 2 g each and shards sell for 4g on my server.
---
TSM will help with determining profitable items
---
"Porcine" is now my favorite new word.
---
Wows largest streamers Warlock is named FreeHongKong. So...
---
My main piece of advice is that expecting others to be as invested as yourself or not as invested can cause animosity between friends. 
---
Set clear goals of what you wish to do in the game, the level you wosh to perform those goals at and inform your friends of those goals then you should have little to no problem with how you wish to play the game.
---
&gt;That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm skeptical of posts like these where the person claims they have downtime to watch Netflix on the clock. 
---
I'm not. Simply because everyone has different goals, different responsibilities, and different environments. 
---
The world is changing at an extreme rate... but it does so in waves. 
---
Those on the furthest edges see long periods of time between something becoming relevant and being implemented in their niche of industry. I haven't seen a windows 3.11 system in a while, but I see XP on a regular basis at customer sites.  Last week I had a customer show me a system that they just got in(not hooked up yet). I swear to god it looked like a mono-chrome monitor and there were boxes of 5 1/4 disks that came with it. My only response was to get me all the documentation on it. I'm not looking forward to dealing with that system.
---
So when I see an IT person say something like what OP said I have to assume they don't need to be on the bleeding edge. Otherwise they wouldn't have a job.
---
Why are you ignoring the comment of something putting words in his mouth to make a bullshit comment?
---
Horde on Grobb have picked up a lot on wpvp recently, noticeable as Alliance. Heard a lot of great things coming horde side as well. Either way it's a great community and I dont think youd regret the decision
---
Damn that‚Äôs so interesting on my hunter I was on my way to get the ghost saber in Darkshore and stumbled upon mazzranaches blue cousin the strider clutchmother as soon as I got to the edge of the zone!!  She was level 20 like I was, and had two level 11 babies that patrolled with her and I had just released my pet not realizing I needed one getting the ghost saber (I didn‚Äôt realize you could just abandon your pet right before you tamed a new one) so I had none.  Like an idiot I figured I could just freeze trap her and hopefully get the tame off before her adds could kill me, and I WOULD HAVE but she had a move that interrupted my cast and I was swiftly dealt with.  I thought I would never see her again but I rezzed and she was right there again, this time I tried again to trap her and thankfully didn‚Äôt get knocked to the ground by her ability and now am the happy owner of a blue tallstrider and a translucent spotted kitty I couldn‚Äôt be more proud.
---
I turned in a quest in Silithus that made me hit 60on my first character. I was feeling so good and excited. Horde sees and claps and cheers for me, then he face fucked me real good.
---
I‚Äôd like to wipe that shit eating grin from his face. What a sack of loser shit!
---
I've been leveling a tank alt and it's been mostly bad hunters + bad mages I've been grouping with. Lot's of upfront AOE, AOE after 5-10 seconds isn't a bad thing, but the upfront part is rough.
---
That said, I love grouping with competent hunters and mages. They sheep, they can taunt aggro off a healer with their pet. It's just rare to find so add them as friends when you can. Lots of mindless mages/hunters out there.
---
I think it's just people coming back to the game bc of the honor patch, not layers.  Layers were removed a while ago.
---
because they couldn't have modern servers, security, dynamic changes, hotfixing and layering with old client
---
I think the main flaw with this system is that it doesn't take in account for rewarding players who do their jobs well. It's very noob friendly and treats people equally but I don't see myself choosing it over loot council because I don't want the guy who died half the fights and contributed next to nothing to still have a chance to buy items over me.
---
Reading comprehension top notch.
---
Borelgore, ur drunk.. Go home
---
Gnomes have a very good case for having the best all around racial. 
---
2m cooldowns vs 5
---
+15 eng is insane at some twink brackets, even at cap it's as useful as water breathing. 
---
+15 int is significantly better than canabalize. 
---
It's the caster equivalent of what orc is to lock/hunter and melee but it also gives a really good cooldown.
---
What‚Äôs the ui/unit frames in there?
---
I don't understand the open more servers thing.  There are plenty of servers that have literally never had a queue.
---
They're farming for elemental fire, which sells for around 7G around my server due to fire resist stuff for molten core.
---
If there are people on your faction farming, party up with them, let them get their loot and just loot your quest items from their kills. That's what I did, worked well, and that robe is awesome at that level.
---
He was being camped by horde despite being way higher level than virtually every single one of them?
---
If anyone saw the clips of him trying to impress and set up an e date with that one chick streamer you'd know he's a dweeb. Can't imagine anyone praising or looking up to this guy.
---
I always forget, do i go gnomish or goblin engi first before switching?
---
DPS more or less were rolling just for the FR for rag
---
Well atleast that second one went a lot better than the first! Haha
---
Except maybe... you know... watching the tank die from 100-0 on baron. But as a healer main I‚Äôm just gonna pass blame to the tank for being to eager lol
---
I think the world pvp objectives should be added before WSG/AV.
---
There's little point adding them after BGs exist, and there may be a small point to adding them before BGs exist
---
Not my proudest upvote.
---
I mean pservers hosted bigger realms with way less lag, so it's possible. 
---
Either the issue is the host blizzard uses, or it's some issue with the client. Could be a combination of both. But running a working vanilla wow server with no lag at high pop is proven possible.
---
You seem confused.  I never claimed to be an engineer.p
---
I found that I‚Äôve only had to do it once with my brothers acc I have no issues now that my computer is recognized by the email.
---
Try Healbot.
---
Seems like a total scumbag just from those clips alone.   Also he's out DPSed by MULTIPLE Hunters, wow, total trash.
---
Time for CS Classic!
---
no layers is a tough time to farm as a low level. Buy them if you can or ask one of them for help with an explanation? wouldn‚Äôt expect that to go too well though
---
Taking over Refuge Point by having a bunch of warlocks summon infernals into the town. We waited outside and killed everyone attempting to flee.
---
Good times
---
yes def better to spread out the BGs than put 2 in one patch
---
Is Classic going to have all the class reworks as well? 
---
Is there a list out there that shows what will happen/when directly related to the reworks?
---
The server that's merging into the other has to rename.
---
I love MC speed runs man
---
He was just mechanically sluggish, very unsuccessful at kiting you but that's also because you did a good job sticking on him and keeping him slowed.
---
not sure this would help as much as people think it would. unless im mistaken the biggest problem is with PvP servers and the fact that more people want to roll horde and i don't see many people rerolling chars just before phase 2 and world pvp to go to the different faction to avoid a queue.  
---
maybe if classic had it at launch, but i think its too late in the game for this to do anything.
---
in the end when BG's come out this sort of happens with alliance getting insta-BG's and horde having to wait and people still roll more horde.
---
The `mod:alt` causes problems since that's blizzard's default self cast modifier.  I use `mod:shift` and have almost this exact macro, except I use the `[dead]` modifier to also cast a mouseover Resurrection.
---
Max rank HT with occasional rejuvenation is optimal until you are around fully enchanted pre-raid BiS gear level basically. Except for fights with very heavy damage where you want your HoTs ticking at all times for extra safety so you would use regrowth then.
---
When the "internet immunity" bubble bursts and reality comes a punchin, subs and fabois won't keep their teeth from abandoning the cesspools they call mouths.
---
Its pretty standard to go gnomish first to craft all the trinkets and gadgets, then go goblin for the bombs.
---
They did do something about ninja looting. The result is the garbage personal looting in retail.
---
But then you have to play a Druid, probably feral for LotP, and that pretty much a single slot in any raid group so good luck. Source: am feral Druid would not recommend, stance dance revolution
---
no lol they have the 1.12 code
---
They wouldn't be able to do classic without it
---
40% of your white swings glance against a raid boss, meaning they cant crit and do 75% (maybe less dont remember) damage. Getting to 305 reduces this penalty by about 10 percentage points, so if you do 50% of your damage from white swings, the glancing reduction is worth a bit under a 3 percent dps increase (.4√ó.5√ó(1-.85/.75)), and edgemasters is a bit more than this because of the extra skill. This is a lot for one item.
---
They did win though
---
There was some drama between him and another player during a high stakes streamer dueling tournament regarding the other player breaking rules in their duel. Regardless of whether or not he broke the rules, Ven was extremely spiteful and vindictive on stream and it really turned me off of him. Not sure if that's what the above guy is referring to, just my take.
---
Yes bring tidi to wow.
---
Can you imagine the reaction lol
---
Being on r/classicwow isn't very authentic, need to be on sites like thottbot
---
If you can find Alliance farming them, ask them for the quest item you need. I had this same issue getting the burning charms for the warrior quest. 2-3 days of checking at multiple times per day, always farmed. Found a 60 Alliance farming it one night and explained the problem. He was nice enough to just give me the charms I needed.
---
Did he post these clips himself?  Is he able to take them down after he monetizes them?  
---
I think he's underestimating the backlash lmfao.  Someone save these clips.  Guy is finished.
---
They have said they will not settle loot disputes anymore and that ninja looting will just hurt your reputation.
---
Gnomish first for the trinkets, helm, boots etc. Goblin for the consumables. If you dont want to switch it's not such a big deal, plus gnomish port to Tanaris is great (at least more so for alliance)
---
This is actually really interesting as I am not great with min/maxing and tend to assume the tier stuff is better. I've been actively trying to up my game as I've played a warlock since vanilla and recently learned about drain tanking so I will be investigating those greens! I do love a set though ;)
---
Undead priests: chill in PvE, evil in PvP. Mind controlling you and yeeting you off of high cliffs, boats, and zeppelins.
---
I didn't bother trying Dual Spec until my mid 30's where I was able to get Sword of Serenity / Vanquisher's Sword but although the faster numbers felt nice the performance was *noticeably worse*
---
*Especially against higher level enemies* where you glancing hit more, you really don't want to miss out on the extra damage that comes with a slow 2Her for special hits
---
My first 5 points always go towards the 5% crit talent, but one of the big benefits of leveling Arms is Tactical Mastery.  It makes DPSing and tanking *way* smoother
---
Damn. Keep acting like a child lmao. This kind of immature bullshit is exactly why you have to pug raids and deal with ninja looters.
---
When you say tougher, could you provide details? Is it tougher to hold aggro? Tougher to stay alive? What's tough about it?
---
not only they don't stack but it prevents the tank from using sunder for threat gen
---
The point of the post is to call out someone who has a relatively high profile in classic wow for ninja'ing an item from a raid. OP is just a messenger who is letting people know this happened. He's not asking for anything, just informing. So when your response calls out the OP for not knowing that this person is a shithead, it comes across as victim blaming. Which in turn makes you come across as an asshole. And he gives a clear reason why he thought it was safe to raid with that pug, the guy represents a major wow organization. It's reasonable to think that they would have some sort of rules or policies for the players they sponsor to not negatively impact their brand, which is exactly what this kid is doing. 
---
You were the one who came across as an asshole in your first post, don't get pissy at other people for calling you out for it.
---
&gt; But to even reach that surface, you need to have a lot of +healing.
---
Just plug in your +Healing into the equation using whichever standard candle (your currently most used heal) you want. It will change the stat weight accordingly. I used an unrealistic r1h because I just wanted to emphasize that int is still very important even under the most insane conditions.
---
&gt; Essentially, once you pile on enough +healing to shift into a lower rank of healing, you gain an enormous efficiency bonus all once that isn't reflected in your numbers.
---
Yes, it absolutely is reflected in the numbers! Read the damn post lol. If you plug in low H, you'll note that H is incredibly important. If you plug in high H, it shifts to int. That's the part that people miss; int becomes more important as H gets large.
---
&gt; Bear in mind that you are not solo-healing a raid. You've got Paladin/Shaman who are constantly pounding away with light heals on the tank. All you need to do is momentarily increase the aggregate healing on the tank to stabilize the situation.
---
I know... which is why I based everything off of down ranking...
---
What scrolling combat text add on is that?
---
I basically only know Method through Venruki, who seems like one of the most stand-up online personalities out there.  So I'm a little surprised when you say they **encourage** this type of behavior.  They encourage ninjaing and just being a complete asshole?
---
&gt; There is something incredibly insidious and unhealthy about twitch, streaming and their viewers.
---
Dont paint such a broad brush. The biggest streamers trend towards toxicity because they simply lose touch with their viewers who become nameless drone to them, but the smaller streamers are fucking great.
---
I absolutely agree. I think my main point in bringing up chicken or egg though is that he came out of the womb socially awkward. His lack of socialization is not entirely responsible for his current predicament, but it's making things worse than they need to be.
---
He said WoW, not WoW Classic. It's pretty cut and dry that Method is currently the best organization if you don't look solely at Classic. 
---
They are the best performers at the hardest content that WoW has ever had. It's hard to argue against them not being the best because they don't have speed records in the easiest raids ever released...
---
This guys looks like a fucking 100 lb rat
---
It's fascinating reading this thread as a fellow LC guild. They key to LC is fair, if it's been done carefully and honestly it's just drama free and chill - none of these pychological wargames the DKP users are talking about.
---
Org on Faerlina was completely packed from 5pm to Midnight last night. 
---
It‚Äôs not just Ony head.
---
Is there no breadcrumb quest that leads you to wetlands?
---
I suppose I can't really judge since I didn't witnesss any of the context. I have to say I wouldn't come close to putting him on a list of "streamers with bad character" as his streams are usually very tame and actually pretty informative.
---
Not sure if this is the right place to ask: what are my choices for Horde guilds on EU-Gandling? I'm currently level 47, played WoW in Vanilla (and was 60 then and raided casually) - would like a casualish guild who do raids and the odd BG/world PvP/dungeon/help if I'm getting camped (and vice versa if I'm nearby). I sometimes work late and travel for work at short notice so would have be tolerant with real life obligations.
---
Fairly regularly I get random guild invites but want to consider my options before blindly committing.
---
&gt;but you should really really really really really get Tactical Mastery before dumping points in to the Fury tree.
---
Might as well just level Arms if you're going to get TM early IMO, the mid level Arms talents (Sweeping Strikes / Deep Wounds / extra crit DMG) are way better than the Fury ones IMO
---
I don't buy the phase 2 hype causing queues. A couple reasons:
---
When servers like skeram were reduced from 2 layers to 1 back in october there were no queues even during peak times. 
---
It's been 3 weeks since thing and the classic playerbase has been shrinking.
---
I'd say most players don't care about what phase 2 brings. Even on the poll on reddit, which would be the more hardcore audience since they're actively participating in forums, many players said the thing they were most excited for was the keyring, which is such a minor change, and isn't even coming now. 
---
Among the players that DO care about phase 2, they're much more likely to know that the content wasn't being released tuesday. 
---
The average playerbase size on skeram is low enough that variations due to peak hours or other content releases (I.E. diremaul) have not caused queues in months.
---
All this means that for there to be a queue last night with no pop cap reduction:
---
1. players are more excited for phase 2 than they were for diremaul
---
2. players are not aware that phase 2 content wasn't released yesterday
---
3. the hype was so great that in not only exceeded all previous weekend server populations of the last month, it did it by a significant margin.
---
That just doesn't add up to me compared to "blizzard decreased the pop cap because servers can't handle world pvp"
---
Absolutely. The 5 weapon skill is not terribly useful for combat. But how do the core hound gloves compare to, say, tier 1 gloves for combat rogues?
---
Lookup a stat equivalency for the spec/class you wanna play imo, then you always have an internal oh 1% crit = x spell power in terms of dps
---
Yea ... I didn‚Äôt think I had to do much of anything to get it working
---
The client isn't the issue, it's the servers that are bunk
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt a guild want to clear MC faster.....so confused. So play a range class that‚Äôs objectively ‚Äúworse‚Äù because your banking on the fact that guilds ‚Äúwant to clear MC slow‚Äù?
---
Method is a retail guild that specializes in clearing hard content the fastest. Rag/Ony can be pugged by shmucks wearing greens. In actual hard content, Method is the best.
---
I love that the dwarf in the photo looks like when your mom tells you to stand next to you great aunt for a photo. And you just stand there awkwardly.
---
What you are describing is the biggest problem with DKP aside from the tank problem.
---
There are ways to mitigate this problem, but you can't get completely away from it as long as you use DKP.
---
To anyone who has watched this guy's stream it's pretty obvious he's bit of a twat.
---
Dont use renew. I tried 5 times using renew and failed. The 1st time I only used heal and flash heal (down ranked of course) I made it.
---
Making stuff up? Nice
---
Best idea yet.
---
Do you have a source indicating people are not enjoying PVP and only want to do PVE?
---
I‚Äôm embarrassed this guy exists
---
Perception is every bit as busted as WotF it is just different classes that it counters.  
---
Shadowmeld is the best base defense ability in the game.  a Shadowmelded hunter in the flag room in WSG is incredibly deadly.  
---
Escape artist is the best PvP racial in the game for warriors.  
---
And stoneform basically hard counters rogues.  
---
The racials for PvP aren't nearly as unbalanced as people say.  Hardiness is very good, but random.  WotF is very good against two classes(but not anywhere close to fear ward).  Warstomp is just generally strong.  But I don't think those racials on average are any better than perception, stoneform, shadowmeld, and escape artist.
---
the shamans ofc :smugpepe:
---
Nope, Morgraine itself is pretty balanced at peak (horde bias off peak IMO @50+) but for servers like Herod you're going to be joining a 3k queue and waiting to be outnumbered by 3:1 as Alliance lol.
---
[deleted]
---
Many abilities aren't on an exact timer,  but rather a window of time in which they can possibly be used(shazzrah's counter spell for example).  The DBM timers can be used as a guideline aren't always going to be completely accurate in such cases.
---
Sometimes they won‚Äôt even do that. Back in the day I and others had issues with DDoSing from someone. We knew who it was. One day he admitted it in chat, we thought that was going to be his death, but nope. Blizzard didn‚Äôt care.
---
This guy gets it.
---
aren't you actively working the Ignoratio Elenchi angle, diverting the argument towards a debate about the Ad Hominem definition instead of actually defending your position from the stated faults?
---
1. the Decay is too high, classes with tons of competition, Decay quickly over powers the possible gains for effort,  So if you miss a day, might as well miss a month and be right at the same spot as everyone else in a couple weeks.
---
2. The caps are too low,  doesn't take long to hit the cap, so long term raiders don't have any advantage over raiding for a few weeks members.
---
Basically you created a system that is basically a /roll with complications, no rewards for long time raiders who just need 1 more thing. No reason to be dedicated to raiding, Decay is so high, and caps are so low it's easy for First time raider to catch up to anyone that hasnt had a single drop in months.
---
Same here.  Never got it to load ever.
---
No. It's a spell, why would it check hit chance?
---
Where have they said that?
---
As a hordie on herod, plz stay.
---
This. Op if you already posted it. watch the comment section. LSF *hates* WOW ninja loot clips, they just say no one cares, or you're just looking for drama, which is ironic as LSF eats up all drama, take the recent Albert cheating case for example.
---
So you're advocating P2W? Nice, thanks for at least confirming you're a twat. You should try RS3 btw, seems like just the game for you.
---
Don't know man, wasn't the prize of that tournament like many thousands of USD? I would be spiteful and vindictive too if I were cheesed out of that much money. I'm very sure most people would be.
---
Played a mage with Knights of the Blackrose, I remember seeing you guys around a lot as well as some of the higher profile guys (Aedak, the troll who did Warcraft movies)
---
90 minute queue
---
You had some luck, believe me.
---
I usually game in boxers or shorts, sometimes with a t-shirt, because it's comfortable. Why do you prefer to game in spaghetti straps?
---
i think hanging out with john zerka rubbed off on him a little too much.
---
Imagine hoping his sponsors/org pulls support so he can possibly lose his job over him yoinking an in game item . Yikes bro u say u dont even care yet try to ruin him ur definitly hurt
---
Sure but your argument is that I have nothing I want to do in game because I only raid once a week therefore they should release BGs no? I just don't think that is a good argument and isn't a healthy mindset for making any content decision in Classic Wow. I love BGs and they are the primary reason I am playing classic but if the goal of classic wow is "no changes vanilla experience" then releasing BGs early does not fit the goal since Vanilla had a significant amount of time with world pvp and no BGs.
---
The point is to have the decay to be high enough that a long term raider cannot completely shutout any newer members for weeks or months on end for loot, especially when new content drops.   No person will join a guild to raid knowing that it will require at least 3 months of buying consumables to even have a DKP pool enough to possibly bid on an item, that they will still lose unless someone bids lower by pure chance.
---
  This system ensures that newer people do not get shunned for months, but older people do not get sniped by new people.  It rewards attendence, and still allows people to save for something specifically, but also promotes people using points on sub optimal items versus disenchanting them.  Even a sub optimal item will help the guild clear content faster than wearing a downgrade level green to just save DKP while they wait.
---
Then comes the content dilemma, where the first to gear are compiling DKP endlessly while others still struggle to get specific items.  Suddenly you have a list of raiders who effectively shut everyone else out on upgrades indefinitely until the points are spent, slowing progress again through the next raids.
---
There are a bunch of keys that do different things, really. Captain's Key only opens a chest inside one of the ships in Tanaris, and it's consumable. There are permanent keys that open doors to dungeons (like Scarlet Key), keys that start quests (like Blood Red Key in Felwood), etc.
---
They did it by cutting out a lot of security checks and balances that happen behind the scenes on actual blizzard servers. That's why it was so easy to hack on private servers.
---
I'm in the same boat as you! It's slowed a bit for me lately.. I was at 10 days before October 1 hit. Been going a good bit slower since then.
---
Do you even code, man?
---
Hire*
---
Fury warrior is awful is world pvp, now I understand what mages feel like when they say they are glass cannons. 
---
Basically that level of survivability minus all the tools to escape.
---
Wasn't that staff an upgrade for him?
---
It can be used to drink and eat from stealth. Its strong for BGs and prolonged world PvP.
---
Are those standard raid frames? X)
---
Havnt used standard in a while but smh they look very pleasing if they are the standard ones
---
I mean it's not like people were ok with ninjas back then lol
---
‚Äúfucking lol‚Äù is fucking cringe
---
Games are supposed to be fun.
---
Make the game fun and avoid drama.
---
same thing back in vanilla i think when horde figured out they could glitch on top of some of the buildings in darkshore.  many bans were handed out.
---
I'm from horde faerlina, there's ton of guilds that I run into that aren't from Olympus. Ones that we usually run into are AFK, Crusade, Dystopia, POWER, squadW.. Tons more that are smaller.. Just check out trade and advertise yourself for the type of guild your looking for.
---
I've said this on this sub already but it is 100%, in my opinion, the result of some pedantic asshole in blizz who hates when anyone uses phase and patch interchangeably.
---
Because if you do it right, when you cast a g heal + renew you're technically putting out more healing than the target's health cap, knowing they're going to take more damage in a few seconds to eat the rest of the renew healing; this gives you more time for mp5. Whether this is actually efficient idk
---
Same, I don't watch WOW or his stream but I've watched him on the Rajj show and he just came off as just really weird and selfish.
---
Weakauras
---
Why don't you adapt? When i got AOE Mages and Hunters (not loot stealing Huntards), I equip a 2 hand as a warrior and dish out damage for trash packs. When there is no mage for slow effect, I use piercing howl. Nearly always I top the charts while still wearing plate armor. To be honest, in the meantime this became my favourite way, since you clear dungeons twice as fast with decent AOE. One mob after mob is so incredibly slow and only the way to go, when you lack damage as a group or enough heal for the faster way, read gear and/or skill. Only exception to this right now is the second part of UBRS where you need a AT LEAST one dedicated tank and focus.

Sounds like people who are used to the retail 10/20/25 man raids, where making a raid team of just your friends is easy... Classic wow takes way longer to level to max, and requires 40 people. Merging is the easiest and best thing to do in your situation.
---
I don't really think they have fair complaints... Yeah, "the new guild is too big" is somewhat reasonable; some people just prefer smaller guilds. But you can't expect a group of 60's to hang around with no raid guild and keep pugging forever. And expecting you to set up pugs, which requires an insane amount of effort, sees rare drops getting passed to randos, and has wildly varying raid times and success is just not at all fair to you.
---
It sounds like they are whining about stuff not going their way and refusing to be flexible at all. They need to step back and look at it from other people's point of view.
---
I feel like having it as an array should make it easier. Just alter the string text for your key ring slots==0 to 32, or if it currently isn‚Äôt allocated, tack it on the end. UI implementation might be more difficult
---
Just start chugging down Oil of Immolation potions.
---
The grass is always greener. It's impossible to win this arguement.
---
Carapace is way better
---
Huh.
---
&gt;Sure but your argument 
---
It's not an argument for the early release of BG's. It's more like my personal testimory for I personally want them to be released - I like BG's and, as a resto druid, I'm finding there to be a lack of reasons to log in other than raid day.
---
A very large number of people refused to reroll sensibly after new realms were introduced 1 to 3 days after launch.
---
Totally agree. Take my updoot
---
Looks like the pink eye debuff. restorative potion should help with that.
---
I just dinged 48, don‚Äôt have time to play today. I‚Äôm Skeram Alliance, currently questing in Searing Gorge. Am I absolutely fucked?
---
idc about the ninja but this guy looks like he smells funny and has extremely low social intelligence and possibly aspergers
---
With his parents most likely
---
Monkeynews, the guy who always has multiple geared warriors and multiple R14 grinds, is your example that classic doesn't require an absurd time investment to play at the very top level? Really? The dude still frequently streams 10+ hours a day even while "waiting". 
---
It's true that your average player with modest goals doesn't need to put that time in, but we're not talking about that. We're talking about people at the very top. 
---
They are not "waiting" by the way. Do you think they maximize performance so much in raids so they can log off and go out? 
---
They spend massive amounts of time dominating and hoarding resources so they can speed clear raids, so they can PvP all day when it's time. 
---
Try to grind R14 for me while working full time. No account sharing. You can even take a couple weeks off to get started. See how that goes.
---
Yea let me learn to PVP when it's 5v1...
---
Wait a second. What version of AV are we getting?
---
Cane for PvP
---
Orb for PvE
---
Always go for +spelldamage for PvE, +stamina is amazing for PvP though.
---
Lol. Remember when you lot were crowing about how great the community was on Classic nowadays?
---
Yeah... how‚Äôs that working out for you? Same old shit as always.
---
Shhh! You are making sense... people here don't like that!
---
They guy that made this thread wanted attention. If the guy were a noname he would just report the guy and be done with it. Which is the only thing he shouldve done
---
That‚Äôs the point he is making.  Logs are much more in depth and objectively better for diagnosing gaps in performance.
---
I dont think he misread.  He is saying loot rules that are not posted in-game will not be considered either way by blizz, and as a result he does not believe the story of the poster above.
---
What a massive nerf to my bags :(
---
The Horde had me scared last night. It was a fun back and forth though.
---
Ah, yes.  The correct solution to the "problem" of DKP giving players agency is to take their agency away.  Unless you're pushing world 1st progression, (in classic, lul) then raider happiness is far more important than gear micro-optimization.  It doesn't matter if your mages do 0.01% more DPS due to a "forced upgrade" if they're doing it in another guild's MC run because you took away their ability to get the items they actually wanted.
---
Woah, fear can run you over the edge?
---
Jokerd, is that you? xD 
---
"bro"
---
Crossbow. The slow speed allows you to weave auto attacks and aimed shot way better that riphook. Riphook is too fast and less top end
---
WoTF isn't even that good. I just get re-feared immediately after and killed before the second fear pops anyways.
---
It's only decent if I get lucky and am able to burst them immediately following the WoTF pop :(
---
&gt; Venruki also exploits pathing to farm ZF on his stream.
---
Oh, like literally every other mage farming ZF?
---
Seen the exact same thing, always Dwarf hunters being Alliance.
---
Sorry to say but having a 3 way fight rarely ends up being balanced. Having played Guild wars 2 for the WvW, it mostly ended with the weakest faction getting shit on by the other two.
---
I just want the CSC to drop. Tonight.
---
That sucks I always thought this guy was chill
---
False, I have plenty of physical machines with just 1 VM on them that are kept because "business reasons" and have a failover cluster on a VRTX.
---
All I‚Äôm saying is, I‚Äôm not gonna sit in a queue for 30-40 mins a night to give alliance the EZ-mode treatment on a PvP server. Alliance-only transfers should be opened from Heartseeker and Faerlina to the realms with the worst faction imbalances and Horde only transfers should remain open to Heartseeker. If it comes to faction specific queues every night for more than a week I‚Äôm just unsubbing and lots of other players will do the same. It would be the death of classic IMO
---
The chart on the web is missing it. I haven't had any UBRS experience yet so I am counting on you :)
---
should get people from method to see this
---
Well he brought up the whole "do you even raid" thing. So naturally I clicked his profile and found out that 2 weeks ago he was crying on here about how his loot council guild screwed him over.
---
How much more hypocritical can you get? The assassination was warranted. He didn't even present a logical argument for why DKP is bad. The idea that one person can horde DKP and win every item is patently false. I'm not sure how someone could even believe that.
---
&gt; Kind of guy who will get punched in the face walking down the street because he can't keep his mouth shut.
---
implying this guy ever goes outside
---
Warlocks use 0pc of T1 for raiding.
---
while orb of forgotten seer may give you better overall damage, i'd say for questing cane would be better as the extra stats will mean less downtime. i really liked the celestial orb i got from the mage quest but it would be kinda tough to solo at 38, so i think cane is your best bet.
---
It‚Äôs easy to avoid them. Don‚Äôt play on their servers lol
---
Are you implying only joker uses the word "bro"?
---
I use default UI and it‚Äôs fine. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to heal, get HealBot.
---
Classic Castbars, Classic Aura Durations, and RealMobhealth are all good. 
---
Deadly Boss Mod for raiding if you do that. 
---
Bagnon is best for inventory management.
---
Trade skill master for AH stuff.
---
Questie for questing. 
---
WeakAuras if you‚Äôre willing to put in some time to create and tweak, can do most anything combat timer related.
---
I guess swing timer if you‚Äôre melee, haven‚Äôt used it personally.
---
Nah I‚Äôm just being realistic.  The world revolves around money.  This game wasn‚Äôt made for you.  It was made to make money you stupid fuck.
---
Have you experienced hunter in PVP?
---
he is back in malta
---
&gt;In the end, they‚Äôre not going to merge realms when they have the ability to connect them. They view connecting them as just as good.
---
I see you've just decided to make random stuff up, act as you know whats going on at Blizzards while ignoring the fact that Server Identity has always been one of the primary factors why people loved classic.
---
Not bad, a flat 3 for 1.
---
I didn't say "spamming". I said it's part of your toolbox, and an important part. Increasing your +healing increases your HpS cap, increasing your flexibility of what you can do with your toolbox.
---
Questie - Lets you easily find quests and how to complete them  
---
Luna unit frames - Great customizable UI  
---
Spy - Lets you know when someone is nearby  
---
Deadly Boss Mods - Great for dungeons/raids  
---
OneBag - Makes you bags into one big bag  
---
VendorPrice - Lets you see how much an item vendors for  
---
Auctioneer - AH addon  
---
Then you'll probably want a few depending on what class you are.
---
Yeah this is going to be a numbers kind of thing. Not everyone who talks like that will go shoot up a school but if you roll the dice long enough...
---
Should state if this is EU or NA Lightning's Blade, we both had servers with that name.
---
You can pick pocket in brd
---
You should complete this quest chain https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1953/return-to-the-marsh
---
and get the Celestial Orb, which will be your BiS until the aquementas  quest.
---
Until you get the Celestial Orb, use the Orb of the Forgotten Seer. Spell damage is king.
---
You have plenty of time before phase 3, but keep in mind for healers that can wear leather, Corehound Belt will become their craftable BiS then.
---
No I understand your point. I have always understood your point. You are so very much not understanding mine.
---
Neither of you has a good point because *nobody should ever enter MC with low level greens*. Manastorm being an upgrade or not, or worth spending DKP or not, is entirely irrelevant.
---
YOU DON'T ENTER MC IN LOW LEVEL GREENS. It's a shitty point to begin with and the fact that I've had to go through so many posts to get you to understand that is mind blowing.
---
Some issues come from our fury warriors, 70dkp (when you earn 40 a week or so) is pretty steep for offspec gear (normal tank gear but they get it as offspec for emergency tank situations) but them
---
Having to compete with rogues, druids and tanks for their bis as well makes them fall into a dkp hole.
---
The main difference I see is now we know exactly what is coming and tend to play in a way that anticipates the next phase, where back in the day players didn't know what the future would bring and played more in the moment.
---
Remulos discord lists another 7 with full clears, others showing 8/10 and 9/10.
---
Carapace. It being slower for aimshot is a big plus on top of it being overall just better because of dps. Am I right that for hunters, 4 agil = 8 AP and some crit? So it's 14 less AP, but you also get that crit and some stamina.
---
Same
---
i dont even watch the dude but i know not to cry over a ninja if you put him in master loot lmao get fucked
---
This has not been my experience in WPVPat all, nor has it been for many other I have played with.
---
Felstriker, OCE. LFG channels are pretty much dead after peak hours, either you find a guild or do solo farming.
---
just like scammers IRL they have their own little justifications to feel guilt free
---
Nobody uh
---
Nobody cares man. Don‚Äôt like it? Play a different game.
---
Not gonna lie, from the stuff I've heard about Method outside of being the wow's best raiders, they seem like a bunch of entitled scumbags.
---
They did?
---
I‚Äôve literally never heard of him. 
---
I‚Äôd rather watch paint dry than watch someone play wow. I‚Äôd much rather play it myself.
---
With your macro if you do not mouse over it will complain that there is no target. If you want to add extra conditions like @target and @self it no longer works. I fought with it for hours on end. There doesnt seem to be a solution a solution for mouse over or target or self casting of spells that support harm and no harm.
---
Lol üòÖ
---
I went for improved roots instead of max moonfury, I also have max vengeance which is important. I have 14% crit with no buffs. Nature‚Äôs grace helps with raid healing as well. 1.5 regrowth cast time is bad ass.
---
Had a guildie ninja fel cloth bracers so he can sell them in ah... a low tier lock than never contributed to guild in anyway. I doubt he ever summoned a single soul in one of our runs
---
As much as I really want this place to be Poppin again, I feel like BRM is going to be the place to go this time around (at least it is right now)
---
And to show just how little of a deal this is, you make this post and email Method in hopes they will kick him out. Right on brother.
---
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Never too late
---
Am I really gimping myself If I just go straight to Goblin? Solely doing engineering for PvP
---
organization
---
1.
---
an organized group of people with a particular purpose, such as a business or government department.
---
2.
---
the action of organizing something.
---
What a tool
---
I watched that, and I agree, it went particularly well in regards to lag. There must be a critical mass that affects things?
---
I have Blizzards self cast set to shift so that shouldnt cause conflicts.
---
You might like [mine from a little while ago](https://v.redd.it/n5hvmudcprm31).
---
That's the point my friend. You gotta grind it out. No one gets out of classic without grinding. Dungeons or in lvl appropriate areas, you just gotta grind.
---
The majority of my guild has been raidlogging in anticipation for phase2 specifically honor. I know it‚Äôs anecdotal but in my guild we went from like 10 players online around 10pm to 30 just last night. Extrapolate that figure and it would explain the que. For dedicated players who played a lot during launch, hit 60 within the first month, there really isn‚Äôt much content. Aside from farming gold or making alts, I think a substantial portion of 60s are just raid logging waiting to check out honor &amp; pvp
---
Let me give you an example of a trivial fix for where I work which is nowhere near the size or scale of Blizzard.
---
I developed a fix for a minor issue on one of our systems. Went through and tested it myself. Submitted pull request to merge the code down into our development branch where all new features added to when done. Did a code review with my boss on it to go through all the changes in case any cases were missed. Post review the code is passed off to another developer (like I said small team no dedicated QA team) to test and ensure it works as expected. Once done there the code is merged down into the development branch with other fixes and new features that have been approved. From there it will go to a test environment where more people will test it and every other feature in the next update and give feedback to us. Then eventually when all the current features and fixes have been completed, tested, and approved the code is then moved to release where the deployment guys schedule a down time at least a week in advance to push the updates to production.
---
All that to fix an incorrect link in one of our systems. Now imagine that at Blizzards scale.
---
Just wait until AQ when your job isn't even healing lol. I remember my first time in AQ20 with a pug. The RL got mad at me because I wasn't spamming my roots on one of the Mobs. I thought I was supposed to cast roots once and then go back to healing. Nope, my entire job was to cast entangling roots nonstop. Boring but easy
---
Ayyy Aculite fans in the wild
---
You can farm engi mats (e.g. fused wiring)
---
Honestly are you trolling. 1mage can't kill 5+ level 45s solo
---
This is perfect
---
Parts of BFA actually benefit from tactics but people seem to prefer to just over level and overgear. If you go into content at the bare minimum, it's actually a challenge - the first few runs I did of Mechagon, we were using lots of cc. Back in classic, we didn't really have the option. Either you were raid geared and raiding or you weren't and needed tactics. Even if new designs required it now, as long as they keep just handing out gear, it's not going to change IMO.
---
It was returned
---
the world is fkin small and I love it
---
That was hype
---
&gt;If DKP was as good as you think it is, there wouldn't be a dozen other loot systems.
---
If capitalism was as good as you think it is, there wouldn't be other forms of government.
---
If Jif was a good as you think it is, there wouldn't be other brands of peanut butter.
---
If WoW was as good as you think it is, there wouldn't be other MMOs.

Do you need more examples of your failed logic?
---
M8..., who the hell says m8... type it out lazy ass. Second, who says L, are you a freaking 5th graders fighting over the sand box in recess? Go take this L... like what are you even saying, do you need me to secert santa you a dictionary to help you learn some synonyms or maybe some actual English words.
---
This is very true. Look at some of the number 1 parses and you‚Äôll see 0 miss/dodge/parry and a crit % that‚Äôs 10-20 higher than sheet crit %
---
A good raidframe mod with macros is much better than healbot. Only issue I have with your suggestions  xD
---
Also, premade weakauras by player are available too.
---
If it makes you feel any better, his life is in the dumpster and I guarantee the enjoyment he got from ninja'ing this item will be incredibly fleeting. He'll go back to laying in bed at night trying to fall asleep knowing his life is going absolutely nowhere.

Lol OK kid
---
It's beautiful

Idk if I'll  even bother with that fucker; TF was bad enough, and I'd rather have my epic mount first

Are Edgemaster's BiS for humans or not necessary?
---
Part of the response also stated that "in keeping with the spirit of vanilla, classic gms dont have the same power that retail gms have".  The whole response really just sounded like a copout even though he stated 3 times in the response that they do investigate the matters. I mean..  I had proof.  What more could they possibly need.

üòÖüòÖüòÖ
---
LOL yes his button spamming is on point. 
---
I meant more in lines of PvE theory crafting, itemization etc. Also, I believe that mages have a lot more build options in later raids aside from just frost bolt spamming but this made my chuckle nonetheless.
---
streamers promote a horrible, toxic sense of a community in game.  The number of weird ascii letters just to have a name from a twitch emote like omegalul or one of their popular stream sub emotes is ridiculous.  Why would you want to see VapidMoronTTV guild running around in warcraft is beyond my comprehension.
---
People like this haven‚Äôt really ever interacted with society. His entire life is classic wow. They don‚Äôt understand what normal human behavior is.
---
Sont leave out that it does take a few hours of work the first time, if you want it really good xD. Then just copy profile :D
---
Ok, boomer.
---
You're entitled to your wrong opinion. You can't talk about QoL and then say the default UI is best. That's whack.
---
Great. So all we get is shitty world pvp for which the servers are definitely not ready
---
How is the horde/ally ratio on mograine?
---
Wow that is fucking pathetic, Method needs to take action against this. It's one thing to ninja the item, but then he says, "Fuck you" afterwards like he didn't just fuck all 39 others in the raid.
---
I expect more from an organization like Method.
---
How can people care so much about not getting a virtual item in a game? Do you have nothing better to worry about in your life?
---
OMEGALUL
---
I'd say it's a hoarding problem for BiS, rather than taking an upgrade when it's presented.
---
The fact that no one bid on the item kinda goes to show that. Items should still be sold even if there is only one bidder with 1dkp.
---
Grobb is a pretty awesome server, no regrets playing here and theres always pvp shenanigans happening.
---
How is the faction ratio?
---
The guy who exploited layering to get world first 60 is a piece of shit?
---
Wow, wouldn't of guessed. /s
---
Hahaha yeah I guess I‚Äôll just grind out instances to 60. I like the idea of not giving any Hordies the honor from killing me
---
Yes come play Alliance on Herod
---
Literally nobody cares
---
Your loot council is clearly more of a shit fest.
---
No problems with OUR DKP system. Possibly we just got lucky in avoiding bringing toddlers to the raids.
---
Thanks for your very helpful answer! I appreciate it üôÉ
---
Yeah, the type of players who are happy enough clearing rag at all don't really care about that kind of minmaxing.
---
You can do that without logs by the "feel" of an encounter well enough.
---
Blizz did merge some low populated server.. im sure if ppl are asking strongly for it they will not let Dead realms become more and more empty and merge some.. they will listen the community
---
Yes, but still BiS currently.
---
Add decay to disincentivize hoarding.
---
&gt;Just want to point it out to you that Vanilla was growing during the entirety of Vanilla whereas Classic will have a constantly dropping population. 
---
Right, because no one is ever going to join post launch day....
---
Should start contacting anyone involved with Method in general. They won't do anything about this cancerous tumor of a human being until they start losing everything they have. We need to turn Joker into a serious problem for anyone around him.
---
The game is 15 years old. People know the best gear and builds. Back in vanilla people assumed purple is best which is wrong and why people struggled on content like MC.
---
Your solution to ninja-looting is to predict someone is going to ninja-loot and not put him on master-loot. 
---
*Have you thought about running for president?*
---
Two wolves battle inside me
---
Make it unprofitable for them; range ahead of the direction they're pulling, and kill the mobs ahead of them (but leave a scrap here or there up so they can't just leapfrog you)
---
Don't the winterspring undead have an AOE?  Drag a group RIGHT on top of the hunter, wait for them to AOE them, and kite them somewhere else where you can simply keep the mob alive permanently while keeping the hunter in combat...  permanently.  They won't be able to eat, drink, etc...  And if their pet is defensive, it will come to the NPC to attack it with the player out of range; and the pet will likely die.
---
"Mmo type loads"
---
Wait what is this games genre again? 
---
Mhm interesting, so one could argue its just outside of gameplay possibilities. But then one could argue its a "bug" that the let more people than the server vacan handle into one "layer"
---
Ask his advertisers if they care about the reputation of the people with whom they affiliate themselves.

The red arrow may be pointing to the addon called classic aura duration. I hope that helps!

Yes they did.

Noone is selling it because arcanite bars cost 60-80g and noone wants to pay 600g+ for that trinket. There may be a few hardcore pvpers willing to drop that kinda gold but usually you would find one before crafting it.
---
I played on bleeding hollow back in the day. Can‚Äôt remember which I think I was horde then
---
Transfers to low pop servers existed in vanilla homie.
---
Like a few % horde favoured according to the censor app when I started and that ironforgewhatever website that was posted here yesterday.
---
I like your username :)
---
They don't. Their reputation is everything to them. Without that, they literally have nothing.
---
I honestly don't know. Obviously some folks are experiencing major lag issues when large scale WPvP happens, I'm beginning to wonder if it's only the 'mega-servers' (Faerlina, Herod) that have these issues?
---
Wait growl just increases threat generation and isn‚Äôt a taunt?
---
I am level 53 on a PVP server, since P2 is coming tomorrow I am guessing that most overland questing will be impossible. Thinking of switching to prot and just doing dungeons to get to 60. Now I know everyone says that switching to prot is not needed and that arms will do just fine, is it crazy to just go for it and to start soaking up those benefits now. You say imp revenge is awesome, is that due to extra threat generated from stuns or simply reducing incoming damage due to mobs being stunned? What do you think of imp shield bash?
---
I just did this a couple days ago and failed twice because I read a guide that said only worry about the purple disease not the green.  Third try I removed green and purple (obviously purple takes priority) and it was a cake walk.  Also another thing I was doing wrong was waiting to long peasants that reached safety before turning back for the next group.  As soon a as the reach the area of the quest giver run back to the cave.
---
The ninjaing is it's own issue, but I don't know why you would expect him to be a good raid leader or understand the raid, he has literally no experience. His vanilla experience is leveling to 60 and then starting over again.
---
that's what warlocks are for
---
They resolved the situation in game, with their guild leaders and everyone involved said they were satisfied with the outcome, why would blizz do anything?
---
I think you really underestimate how many players dont read patch notes and thought honor was out in yesterday.
---
You don‚Äôt need runecloth bag recipe to lvl it too 300.
---
Go look up higher lvl tailor patterns and craft those. I never even got it for my tailor, which was my mage ended up dropping it later anyway
---
There are green trousers with the same model that look especially fine on a certain shade of a troll.
---
That‚Äôs my point. They don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs just a game. It means nothing at all and to be this upset over a stupid ass game is ridiculous.
---
I always assumed that it tells you to gtfo early because if you start running out at 1 then you have a small buffer window to get out of range. Some people might take the countdown to tell them when to move and not when the ability is going to go off. Of course I would rather it countdown the actual spell cast, but that's my theory on the rag timer. Move at 1 second, and you should have enough time to get out.
---
Beast Mastery exclusive talent. 
---
Most 60 hunters in dungeons will be MM.
---
It has nothing to do with bugs. It's true for most MMO's that if all players in the game world were converge on a single point the game will become unplayable or the server will crash. Most of the time there's nothing preventing this other than the likelihood of it happening. The question is where the breakpoint should be.
---
if you focus too much on crit and not enough on hit then with world buffs you will be crit capped on white attacks

My personal opinion... cuz I don‚Äôt want recycled content! I played BC and while I played vanilla I was too young to grasp what I was doing. If all blizz is going to do is rerelease used content then I‚Äôm out... if they were using classic as a way to feel out the desire for an old school RPG to replace their shit excuse of an ‚ÄúMMO‚Äù today then great I‚Äôm in!

Get jeffy Kaplan off overwatch cuz he sucks there. Stick him in charge of WoW+ or WoW 2 ...

I think history has shown us that people prefer the path of least resistance.  I'd just reroll if I were you, I knew balanced faction populations were the exemption not the rule so I just rolled on a PvE server and I've loved it.
---
I have a limited amount of time I can play and I don't want to spend any of them corpse running / getting camped if it's unnecessary.  I prefer PvPing in BGs
---
&gt; Blizzard believes that pulling one lever corresponds to one action
---
This kinda contradicts this:
---
&gt; pulling one lever connected to four other levers is the same.
---
this implies 4 actions actually happen, and not one.
---
Also:
---
&gt; an actual multiboxing software merely mirrors the data sent to all clients
---
If you were a programmer you would know this is pure BS. There is no such thing as "mirroring". You can send Mouse/Key/Whatever events to a window and that is it. In fact bots and multibox programs use EXACTLY the same api calls to accomplish what they do:
---
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-sendinput?redirectedfrom=MSDN
---
From a technical perspective there is zero difference between a "bot program" and a "multibox program" sending input to a window. And imo, the same holds true from a gameplay perspective. Unauthorized 3rd party software should NEVER give you an unfair advantage over players who don't use it. (And this last sentence is almost exactly what the Blizzard EULA says as well, fyi.)
---
Because the French are known to be a bunch of pussies, so it would make sense they'd go with the pussy faction.
---
I'd say that'd do the opposite effect. It'll encourage the minority on imbalance serer to move even more.
---
they specifically say.. in the in-game help menu when you click on ninja looting... that they will not handle loot disputes anymore full stop... so stop spreading the rumors.
---
As others have pointed out, it may be viable in a sense but I do highly recommend leveling as the drain tanking affliction spec. 
---
Cookie cutter? Sure. But its insanely good and really fun as you have a lot of abilities at your disposal and literally ZERO downtown unless you aggro like three mobs at once. 
---
Definitely better if you are on a PvP server too.
---
Ok, i know absolutely nothing about WoW other than it‚Äôs a game that exists, and even **I** can see that he‚Äôs a massive douchemongle. Like wow.
---
yeah like.. didnt people signed up for this?
---
What do you expect from a irl gnome
---
Seems pretty obvious to me he doesn't care about the item but is just baiting livestreamfails or similar for content.
---
You don't do math very well do you?  The way this system is set up, it would take several weeks to cap out and hold on for just one item.  That's not how percentile depreciation works, this isn't omg we all equal week 2!!   
---
The cap doesn't matter, it could be 100 or 1000.   A 60 dkp bid is no different than a 600 dkp bid when talking about percentiles like this...
---
Literally just realized your perspective on this.  I'm not going to argue with someone who won't put thought into the other person's position.  Ignorance to a subject is not bliss, it's just ignorance.  Have a wonderful day, I'm out.
---
Wow what a lifeless idiot
---
Yo brother, nice name!

I‚Äôd look for any Emperor/Princess run. You have to go through him on that run. Avoid Lava runs as they skip him
---
Now do ashkandi

Hi, /u/Ryry975

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dvxno8/if_i_have_fought_2_60s_rogue_and_warrior_so_far/). 
---
Emp runs are generally lava runs and skip him.
---
When I‚Äôm doing him I call the run 7d+emp, 
---
Which is a route that goes Side door -&gt; arena -&gt; angerforge -&gt; bar -&gt; flamelash -&gt; 7 dwarves -&gt; emp.
---
Usually do vault after emp since it‚Äôs just a hop and a skip.
---
No idea who this person is, and I don't watch twitch, but just back list them and move.  Most of the time the amount of drama generated by stuff like this far outweighs the actual importance of the event. It's a video game after all, nothing of consequence was lost.
---
who cares lol
---
Tbh it looks like every other UI that everyone else posts.
---
What do you solo?
---
Gotcha. I thought I remembered lava runs skipping him but I've also seen people equating lava runs = emperor runs so I was getting confused.
---
&gt;Blackrock Depths Full (52-60) 1h30 ‚Äì 3h
---
Haha, yeah.
---
~cries in 5+ hours BRD runs back in vanilla~
---
Well if it's 6:41 am then yea most people are sleeping or getting read for work, not playing WoW.
---
I was on board with you until you said you emailed Method, chill the fuck out dude its pixels don't try to get someone fired from a sponsor because you're fucking butthurt nothing is going to happen to him at all anyway I'm gonna go watch his stream more often now thats funny as fuck.
---
Open a ticket, report him for scamming.
---
in 90 day's he'll have like...30 more mages to max level, lul.
---
Yeah I guess I asked a stupid question. I had the info to answer it myself I just got in my head about how I stole a bis item from warriors. Rogues hit cap is 9% and I'm at 8%. Just need that ring from DM and I'm there without striker.
---
Anyway thx for the reply I didn't even consider crit cap. Just hit cap.
---
if you're a mage, and you've got 2000g in your bags, are you going to let another mage take the mageblade for 150g?
---
It's a video game... Blizz can easily undo him buying the epic mount, deduct the gold earned from selling the edgemasters and create another one to give it to the rightful recipient.
---
Female Orc Rogue here.
---
I NEVER do PVP, only PVE.
---
I fucking LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE being a Female Orc, they are SO FRICKING SEXY!! Rogue helmets cover our ugly faces, so we're left with amazing looking tiers/gear!
---
I will NEVER regret bein and Orc Rogue, NEVER, its been 15 years since i had the ingame sex change and even in classic i rolled orc again.
---
\#nohomo
---
There were a few raids apiece A and H in BRM of Fairbanks last night and it was fine
---
Wild!
---
Do you think his sponsors are gonna give a fuck about this? Its really not a huge deal.
---
I don‚Äôt get the bitching tbh. Who is actually carrying anything but the Ony neck and crescent key with them at 60 anyways.
---
The next day he showed the gloves in his bag's proving he did not sell them for the mount. he already had the gold.
---
Did he actually get signed to Method? Wasn't that just a meme?
---
They‚Äôve said a number of times that the coding for the bags is extremely tricky and that they‚Äôre surprised it ever worked at all. Adding 4 slots to the backpack for authenticated accounts on retail was a huge undertaking. 
---
It‚Äôs still buggy, if you try to sell something on your yak npc as he despawns it Makes the item greyed out in your bag and can‚Äôt be moved or sold until you relog.
---
Nah but it definitely helps.
---
what a dick
---
Also he has method sponsorship codes in his bio
---
Actual psychopaths in this thread.
---
YOINK!
---
1 point in ISB for the ability to block 2 attacks.  Extending the duration is worthless, blocking 2 attacks and getting 2 revenge procs, priceless.
---
The asmong server
---
It's easy in hindsight to point to something and say "we should have anticipated needing to be able to scale that".  It's not so easy to tell the future.
---
But I can't fault the original devs for thinking that the *actual* bag slots they put in would be enough for their future inventory space needs.  They didn't know the game would be as successful as it was and would need to scale up to 15 years' worth of item count inflation; or even that not only would people want more inventory slots, but they'd want them in *this* bag instead of *that* bag.
---
At some point you have to put a number *somewhere*; and if it costs twice as much effort or more to put it somewhere where it can be easily changed, you have to make decisions about what's worth that extra investment.
---
Drama means clicks which means advertising and money.
---
Good point. If your group runs with a reliable shadow priest. Ours does, but we have 4 raid groups in our guild and pretty sure one or two of them dont have a SP... yet anyway.
---
I think that's where Hillsbrad got popular tbh, the place has two towns very close to each other with graveyards in them as well, so death isn't an issue at all.
---
Who cares?
---
TBH it‚Äôs your fault for trusting a streamer as your ML LOL.
---
Imagine calling someones entire being garbage because they stole pixels.
---
His stream isn‚Äôt about high skill. They watch because he‚Äôs a clown; it‚Äôs in his name.
---
I've found Kurinaxx to be a good high population, but I'm not sure about the faction populations because I just play my low level alt there with some friends, so never really cared.
---
The community aspect. Having people communicate. Not feeling over powered. Levels being meaningful
---
&gt;Gaming companies at the time did not utilize code versioning and thus would essentially erase a previous game state whenever they implemented a big patch. This is what happened at blizzard.
---
Worked at Id around the time. Version control, Continuous Integration, etc. Were all in use. Blizzard is just run by bad technical managers.
---
i'll give you some insight as an ex-botter as there are lots of people saying banning in waves is better than banning individually. 
---
that is not correct. i used to run 10+ bots 24/7, once in a while there was a ban wave and the next day my bots were up because that was financially feasible. when blizzard lets a bot pay their costs(game/sub money) it will be replaced by another bot almost instantly. 
---
no one gives a shit about ban waves, it's not discouraging or anything. just  after a ban wave is the safest time to bot.
---
Lava is just the fastest way to get to emperor.
---
Thanks! My pet is RidinDirty üòÇ
---
I use NugEnergy, simple and works great.
---
The players that don't read patch notes probably also don't really care about world bosses that are going to be nearly impossible to claim without being in a big organized guild, and pvp rankings which are nearly impossible to climb past rank 7 if you're anywhere close to casual.
---
1.12
---
That is absolutely not why people struggle with Onyxia.
---
I started out as destro but found out in groups I was doing too much damage and pulling aggro and was getting wrecked. 
---
I level with a pally mostly and he was losing mana healing me over and over. So I re-spec to affliction (SM/ruin) and Have a lot more fun playing now. 
---
Affliction I feel gives way more options and you pop siphon life on a mob and you can drain tank really really well. It‚Äôs almost OP. I just hit lv 43 and in pve I am very hard to kill. 
---
In pvp I‚Äôm very new to it, but against casters I do alright. If I can get off a fear and then dot them there really isnt much they can do.
---
How often are pvp rewards given out? I want the discount for epic  mount, just trying to figure out when it would go into effect
---
Based Ricardo
---
I play on Skeram too. Arcanite bars are over 70g each. Blue Sapphires are 45-50g. Kind of ridiculous.
---
good point, let me rephrase
---
we should never have had layering - and just add fishing tournament after 3 weeks.
---
only reason we ever needed layering is because they made like 2 fucking servers for europe and then called them "medium" when they were already more crowded than their most crowded servers ever.
---
True, very possible as well.
---
As what class? And how long will it be BiS for your class? 
---
Personally, as a tank, I looked at it since it's a great BoE threat option, but I think I'll just wait to get my Rag cloak instead, since it will last me longer and is generally better. That's just for tanks though - I don't know how good Shifting Cloak is for other classes.
---
Look at all these idiots thinking making comments is bitching....
---
Lmao yeah you definitely haven't worked on a big corporate application. No worries dude. I feel your frustration.
---
I use to ninja back in vanilla ( I was 13 ). I remember Blizzard got on my account, removed all my ninja'd gear and the gold I made from it. Id report him lol
---
what kind of fucking idiot healer rolls on sapphiron.
---
it's worse than cloak of cosmos which is ridiculously easy to farm
---
Let me guess, it's a shadow priest. No legit healer would roll on that.
---
&gt;  impossible to climb past rank 7 if you're anywhere close to casual.
---
that is actually normal and working as intended.
---
rank 1-4 is casual, rank 5-7 is semi hardcore,  rank 8-11 is hardcore and rank 12-14 is ultra no-life
---
damn bro i got chubbed readin this ty for the free boaner
---
Sure they might run out of mana,  but that's where the literally 40 inervates come in to play...
---
oh no.. he stole an item from a master looted raid... woooooooooow................ so sad
---
I understand that. If you read my message I stated that I had never played true vanilla I think I got a level 30 and I was 13 years old running around with no idea what to do... so replaying it as an adult is nice because it‚Äôs all new to me. And also like I said I was OK with vanilla IF they use it as a feeler.. if the end goal is just re release all the timeline 15 years late I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs the worst decision ever.. 
---
So in your perfect world they go BC... then Wrath.. then Cata? Then pandaria? When do you stop? With classic plus you avoid going down that endless treadmill. Make classic it‚Äôs own game/genre avoiding mistakes made with retail
---
OP is malding?
---
Maybe its because I don't play WoW but I guess I don't understand what you mean by ninja? I assume you mean he rolled on loot that dropped and won the roll but he wasn't supposed to? How is the game set up for that to happen? Why does it let you lot, but you guys don't want him to cast a lot?
---
Isn't his time worth as much as yours? is it some social construct you guys put in place before doing the raid? or was it gear he couldn't equip on his character? what's the full story? In any game I play online there is always a way to lock loot based on predetermined raid setup or need/greed in which case if you can need then its yours. 
---
some people are saying blizzard has stepped in to take action against ninjas but, if thats how the game is designed what weighs your need over his? and if not why don't they fix the loot system?
---
very confusing for someone who's never played wow
---
Np
---
Super geared, experienced groups can do any content faster than average person.
---
Arugal
---
I've never seen this dude except for these clips, but he's clearly a weird ass dude with no social skills or understanding of the impact of his actions on others.
---
Doesn't excuse him for being a twat though.
---
Hey man, fuck mages. This is all.
---
&gt;dds generally less geared than I would have thought
---
Not surprising, not that much loot drops in vanilla and there's a lot more people for it to be shared between
---
So instead, your /queued time is as long if not longer than your /played time because you and everyone else have decided not to use the alternatives.
---
Congrats.  You are the traffic causing the back ups and jams while the alternative routes are barely seeing any use.  Your main goal is to simply outlast the people on your server and then you can play the game, whereas if you had simply rolled on a fresh server or transferred away, you wouldn't have to factor queue times in your raid schedule.
---
how does that help in a raid?
---
Force reactive disk, from what I saw.  
---
The shield releases a charge of about 40-60 damage every time he blocks an attack, to all nearby enemies.  So with 8 mobs constantly hitting him, and spamming shield block, his shield procs non-stop.
---
How could this possibly be more efficient than logging on and using the LFG channel on your actual server
---
I'm not contesting that, just saying that the players in the rank 1-7 range are the majority of the playerbase and most of them aren't going to change their playing habits because of honor. Some might even decrease their playing time due to pvp.
---
Yes. Just saw a thread this week where they were saying to stay in battle stance, use the abilities (including sunder) from there. Can't say as I see it a lot, but I have read it more than once.
---
Good. Go for it.
---
Just to add to this, the Gnomish Battle Chicken has a chance on hit to give your whole party 5% haste. Min/maxing guilds will like you for this especially in aq40 and Naxx.
---
I already knew you didn't look it up because I did.
---
I am not from USA
---
get holy water, use down ranks, wand single mobs, mana pots and runes. Make sure ui is setup. It's easy. I didn't watch a guide, walked in one shot it walked out. First pack is hardest.
---
So you're not actually "spamming." Sounds like he was right, and you were full of shit.
---
In 1.12, every class has one spec that, all other things being equal, beats every spec of rogue.
---
Rogues are PVP-dominant in earlier patches, not in 1.12. Regarding casters, if they are able to survive your initial ambush+bs you either outspend them or you lose.
---
That's why you cast your large max rank heal, and cancel the last half second if it's not needed. This is much more mana efficient. 
---
If you don't want to play optimally that's fine, but if you're giving advice on healing correctly, you should give correct/optimal advice.
---
KEKW
---
How is your dkp distributed. Benched players in my experience that turn up ready (ready is not just being at the instance portal) and are willing wait to fill if needed should get 120% dkp. This is the way my guilds have run it. 
---
This works though if everyone is good with consumes, buffs enchanted. Which is honestly never the case. 
---
Im looking at you healers.
---
I'm so confused, everything you post makes him look in the wrong and like an ass yet you're defending him....
---
First exposure as well.
---
Ill be sure to avoid him.
---
Lol yeah? Whats ironic about it
---
how would it?  3-400 extra AP + hunter dps must be better than simply adding another warrior surely
---
I will always upvote this meme
---
I bet you everyone in this thread talking shit couldn't even implement the keyring lmaooooo
---
Nice. I did see him in EPL last night. Was about to go attack thinking this big one might have guaranteed larval drop, then I targeted and quick ran away as a lvl55 :)
---
You don't need gear to bubble hearth...
---
Pretty sure Day 1 didn't have free character transfers.
---
Yes?
---
I dont care.
---
This filthy guy looks like a rapist and probably stinks worse than dog shit. Classic wow is literally his life. Don't raid with these people.
---
False.
---
No, this was on Grobbulus and we were both resto shaman.
---
Uhh it tracks like attednance, charts and guild participation
---
Mograin
---
Perfect balance
---
He was a 61 elite
---
And he said "on reset day". Which it is.
---
Which is why I said earlier Blizzard is not your typical developer company. They have deadlines but aren't the least bit afraid to postpone them when they're not finished.
---
Starcraft Ghost was announced in 2002 and canceled 3 years later after multiple postponements. That's a lot of work and money, but it would have been worth it for such a (potentially) incredible and exciting game.
---
Not from a human.
---
Ah nice, sounds like a fun item for AOE tanking.  I hear it breaks super quickly though lol
---
Is it possible to do rogue/druid stealth runs for The Unforgiven in Strat Live? Trying to get the Mask.
---
LUL Twitch fame? I don't know if he was always like that, I only know of him from being first to 60 or whatever, and some posts in /r/LivestreamFail, but yeah ...
---
I watched 30 secs of this guy's stream recently. He was in scholomance, and didn't understand the mechanics of one of the bosses, getting pushback on his spells by the aura on Alexis Barov.  
---
Literally all he had to do was go max range. The most basic, easiest thing to do as a caster.  
---
This guy is genuinely so bad at the game. The only reason he was first 60 was by abusing layers.
---
I dunno tough guy insulting another person on the internet for being a tough guy, you tell me?
---
Well yes, but the context was same-raid rogues in greens outdpsing better geared rogues.
---
Yet he just spent a few weeks in the US hanging out with people doing many IRL streams...
---
Well isn't Tuesday also raid reset night? Or am I wrong about that?
---
&gt; I dont get it how people like this feel good about themselves
---
He feels good because he has the staff.  Fortunately, most people conscious prevent this.
---
The current BiS lists assume that the goal is to maximize damage, maximize mitigation, maximize healing, and minimize fight duration.  The best guilds in Vanilla (e.g. Afterlife on Cenarius) had this figured out 15 years ago.  Now it's just common knowledge:  Forget FR gear on Rag (other than the tank) and just dps like crazy.  A decent guild downs any MC fight in about 2 minutes.  If a healer runs OOM in 2 minutes they're doing something wrong, as most top guilds are running 8-10 healers.  In this phase, it's not possible to wipe due to mana concerns (unless you 10 man Ony or something).  But what absolutely can wipe the raid is the MT's death, and healing throughput matters here.  If your Gheal heals harder, or Renew ticks harder, it always helps, because overheal doesn't matter when fights are so short and bosses are not bursty.  
---
Later on, fights will get longer (Chromaggus) and more bursty (Lashlayer).  Mana pools will matter more.  Thinking carefully about when you allow a heal to finish will matter.  Spirit/mp5 will matter a lot more.  People will have to expand their repertoire to keep progressing (judge wisdom on a mob, innervate on healers, rotations, etc.).  Gear won't be nearly as flexible.  There may be two viable choices in a slot, which simply allows you to swap around for set bonuses (e.g. 3pc Transcendence).
---
So mana pool doesn't matter now, and later on pretty much everyone will have the same mana pool because they'll have the same gear.  It's not about math, or gear choices; it has been and always will be about strategy, coordination, and skill.
---
&gt; Then the true lesson here, is that you should have clarified everything that you italized from the very start.
---
Uhhh...I did. Lol. You should have read the post before firing-from-the-hip in response after reading the first few sentences.
---
It was dishonest but a lot of stuff was omitted from the 1 minute video clip.
---
The guy has to raidlead a ragtag group of NA randoms while playing from EU in the middle of the night.
---
He continues to raid lead even after 6 hours of constant wipes even on trash.
---
The mageblade (which has very similar stats compared to the staff he yoinked) was reserved, and it was stated beforehand.
---
If he had declared that he has 1 item reserved before this MC torture run everything would be fine but leddit is bored and nothing better than to organize some streamer witchhunt.
---
If you need the role is important. 
---
So say if you have to mamy healers you apply this rule to just the healers. 
---
Then with range dps
---
Etc.
---
I use a felcloth bag which is 24 slots for soul shards, I bought one for 60g on Bigglesworth, but it would have been cheaper if I bought the mats and had someone craft it for me.
---
Would be a nice afk queue check. Randomly when you're in queue it starts a 2min countdown that you can abort by entering a captcha. If you don't you'll get transfered to a random available realm.
---
fyi Blizzard is hosting faction specific forums if Ashkandi doesn't have its own subreddit
---
Since when does census scan automatically again
---
Every warlock will buy one or two of at least the 20 slot soul bag. You need at least that many if you plan to raid at all, and it can be nice to not have to worry about them for dungeons and PvP as well.
---
What else is there but loot
---
Oh I don't doubt it was true, it's still hilarious though.
---
What a fuckin asshole! Hope he gets his... Ban that is...
---
Tbh op and this whole thread just screams "I'm too dumb to asses risk and there is no way someone I don't know would do something to take advantage of me! Blizzard pls halp!"
---
I only played Horde basically from launch to now and rolled alliance for Classic. My jaw hit the floor with how much vanilla favours alliance. I remember memes and stuff back in the day about how Horde was harder to level as (think YTMND and Ebaums days) but it was so much more severe than I thought. 
---
There are the quests through multiple zones like you mentioned but the class quests, distance to dungeons and especially raids, the smoother difficulty curve of the zones. The Racials! Locking fear ward to a faction wtf? And paladin blessing entire raids vs whatever it is a Shaman is supposed to do for a single group. 
---
It actually feels like I‚Äôm playing on easy as Alliance
---
What a pos.
---
&gt; the logs are how our officers determine whose getting into raid next week
---
In guilds that try hard, yes, it is.
---
In *most* guilds, that determination is mostly based on whether or not someone makes an effort, doesn't severely fuck up any fights (like blowing up the raid on Baron), and is generally pleasant to play with.
---
Ahhh so youre one of those twitch fanboys I keep hearing about in this thread.
---
Because using more than one course ALWAYS works beat. I've found and met at least a dozen players now that I play with and such. Most of em rather cool ppl too, some jist some dungeon runners or farm friends.
---
Yup, done with classic. The streamers and other hardcore no life's ruined it for me.
---
lmao what does this even mean
---
It's a try hard thing. People think that because some guilds are clearing MC in 20 minutes they don't need mana or stamina, so they equip themselves in greens of shadow damage (which have zero int, stamina, crit, or hit). Also they think that because an item isn't on a BIS list it's not better than prebis.
---
Is there something going on right now? I've only been in queue to my server once or twice, just after launch. But now there's a queue. EU.
---
&gt; It was brought back because people that stopped paying for WoW are paying for WoW again 
---
Yes and why do you think this is? Jesus christ you're dense.
---
What do you think would happen if they put microtransactions in Classic? That everyone would happily throw money at them? It would die overnight you imbecile.
---
They know that the only way they can please Classic's audience is by NOT putting in microtransactions. THAT is why they are now able to report all-time record breaking sub increases. If they would have had p2w in classic it would have flopped harder than your reasoning skills. Companies don't care about people, they do care about their wallets. And evidently they can think a bit further ahead than you can.
---
Does that explain it thoroughly enough or do you require crayon illustrations for further clarifications?
---
What a piece of shit
---
That's literally the only argument you can make and it's pretty weak considering that it's such a rare occurrence. I've been playing since release and that's never happened to me. I don't even know anyone that has happened to. If you told me it happened to you, I wouldn't believe you.
---
Thanks friend. I'll try this as well. I know forums are a lil more dead but maybe things have changed lol
---
Lol what the actual fuck man
---
Retail and classic are not identical.
---
haha, can you imagine getting your entire account banned, including retail when you are a world first mythic raider?  Because you wanted a staff from MC in classic?
---
So funny how even blizzard has mobs stuck in trees. I probably saw like 5 on my leveling journey. I thought for sure it was just pserver bugs lol, but I guess not?
---
60, hunter, mining
---
I feel like people aren‚Äôt having as much fun this time around. Everyone knows exactly what to do. They all have their little leveling guides up, go here, talk to this person, go here, kill EXACTLY 13 of these. Go here and turn this in. 
---
The plus side was at first people grouped up ALOT to get that initial grind out of the way. But now most casual players who put in a few hours a day are all in their 40‚Äôs and it‚Äôs spread out. Finding groups for random quests and dungeons is tough because everyone has that step by step guide up and they don‚Äôt wanna throw it off.
---
Lol seen the exact same thing on my sever you figure they. Wouldn‚Äôt use Chinese‚Äôs names
---
Do you happen to know if the buff refreshes or you need to click it off and let it hit again

In laymen terms, there is an option for a Loot Master. Raids are primarily run by a guild that has their own way of determining how loot is distributed to their members (based on need, attendance, performance, etc...). In this case, rolling for loot like you suggested is not adequate, so we have a loot master.
---
The loot master can see what dropped, have people roll, or use the other pre determined system to distribute loot.
---
In this case, he was loot master and decided that he was just going to take the item for himself. People may run dungeons or raids where they "reserve" loot, but that is something that needs to be communicated to people prior to starting the raid, so they can determine if they want to participate knowing they won't get the item if it drops. That's not what happened here. He didn't reserve, he didn't roll, he just took it.
---
&gt; Yes, which deflates the price of said materials a bit. Big fucking deal. 
---
Well, now I know I don't have to worry about responding because you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about and the downvotes will show it.
---
That's not even a good insult. Jeez pal.
---
UD is better for pvp; Hardiness is really good against one class (other rogues) and kinda good against two (warrior, druid) as well as engineering (I think grenades are stuns?). 
---
WoTF is really good against two classes (priest/warlock) and kinda good against one (warrior).
---
Not that I have an affinity for apes or anyting, but you make it sound extremely easy when fact you have no idea what you're talkin about. I got to see first-hand what it's like to be in a guild going for world first. And while you might close to describing the logistics behind the event, you're completely ignoring that which makes it difficult to begin with; the preparation required to obtain world first. Practicing on locally hosted private servers for months upon months to get the perfect routine down, etc.
---
Being the first guild to do anything makes you the sweatiest nerd in all of Classic.  It doesn't make you an organization like Method, not by a long shot.  Fucking lol.
---
ITT: Jokerd fanboys victim blaming OP
---
I remember this so well.
---
Me and a fellow level 60 warrior(He Orc, me Tauren) decided we were going to try and get rich quick by farming the Skull Flame shield in Winterspring. Reports reached out ears that the Banshee's (or [Remorseful Highbourne](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Remorseful_Highborne)) were likely to drop the shield (like every 5,000 kills). We were both young, 13-15 years old. So it sounded like a fool proof plan.
---
So we are in Winterspring, grinding ghosts. Both of us in mostly Valor gear. Both wielding [Blackhand Doomsaw](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12583/blackhand-doomsaw) or some shitty blue. I am eating after fighting a few ghosts back to back and in Vent. He just says, "ummmmmmm...turn around"
---
I pan my camera around to see the server first Grand Marshall Warrior, Luciferz. Standing 20 yards away from us. Waiting.
---
&gt;I don't want to sound like a nut job here,
---
And yet you did.
---
Okay cool, but the person I was replying to was going off the original definition, so I did too
---
Lordy this geezer is probably starting to believe his own hype.
---
Usually in races you go for your fastest time, why wouldn't he use it. It's not cheating.
---
I would do BC (demand is there), then if there is interest do WoTLK. I guess keep going if the demand is there (doubtful).
---
The answer: neither layers nor lag, but lagers.  Enough lagers and you stop caring.
---
the dude got world first and deleted his character he does not give a rats ass about anything.  You hear it in the voip they immediately start saying hes gonna ninja it so it had to have been in the back of their mind.  Also you can not put him as master loot??  There are alot of ways to avoid this but they didnt take the precaution and got fucked.

---
Yeah definitely true
---
Can someone explain why that doesn‚Äôt affect his rep on all servers? Or is it ok to ninja loot in EU or somethin
---
did they say at the start how loot was gonna be done though? i mean if they have lootmaster turned on you have to know that things are going to be decided by the leader right?
---
Hey you‚Äôre getting downvoted. How dare you not know something!!!
---
I used to watch MTG competition and even the past few years they've been less than consistent on whether they can use their own stream to review instant replays in adjudication... Granted, it's a question of being fair to all matches, only one or two of which is under cameras, but still, seems surprising that it takes this long to consider it in some cases!
---
who gives a fuck?
---
Welcome to a game you have to play with other people and sometimes people are dicks.
---
Imagine A) playing on a streamer server, B) inviting a streamer to your raid, and C) being mad about a streamer being a douche to get attention.
---
When I get feared, I wish I chose UD.  
---
When I resist a stun, I'm glad I went orc.
---
Bandwidth is another technically possible bottleneck but I did not mention it as that‚Äôs a very unlikely issue. The actual size of all this data that has to be transferred is insignificant, the issue is how fast the servers and/or the software on the server can actually process the data.
---
I play a lock and a hunter at the moment, I've noticed the hunter pet pathing seems worse than my locks. I can be in a wide open space on my hunter and my pet runs in some random ass crop circle pattern to get to a mob which doesn't happen on my lock.
---
They don't ignore botters. They ban in waves so it's harder for bot developers to figure out Blizzard's detection methods.
---
This is a great reply. Thank you. Yes, I do tend to look at top tier situational PvP and extrapolate out, which is wrong.
---
I also tend to remember the last priest that feared me half way across the map, while not remembering that key resist I might have gotten in other fights.
---
Yes thats what i am saying the question is what is "intended gameplay" yeah i am talking about "bugs" not about bugs. More of a "problem if the code allows the players to break the game in a predictable manner."
---
wee what a power point presentation, the servers can't do this
---
Yeah, all layers are removed.
---
You can do raids once a week and they reset on WED for EU.
---
Why don‚Äôt they only activate layering in the four major cities (SW/IF/Org/UC) and only those? Would that help?
---
Yeah I had this, people will ask for a sap mid combat
---
Good God. I am thinking the exact same thing every time I do that quest.
---
Thank you! Now I feel less weird.
---
"If horde are competing against ally on their server who are also grinding"
---
They aren't. Your honor rank will be comparative between the other ranked PvPers on your faction within your server.
---
"i was on an alliance heavy server/battlegroup in classic. We had stupid long queues."
---
Individual server faction balance won't matter for BGs in Classic. BGs will be cross realm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo
---
Relevant bit @12:30
---
yes, exactly :) or the strat ud polearm
---
They stated they had servers ready to go if need be.
---
ewww what a power point presentation, the servers can't do this
---
I cracked up when I read that
---
I have only seen "complain threads" are there any good constructive threads you can link to?
---
My example I always throw out is rockstar games. That should be an easy one for you to go look up.
---
You hear it all the time because it‚Äôs true. I am not smart and do not know it all. 
---
I do know that bad news is what people pay more attention to. Does that help you?
---
&gt;But its close enough that no one cares
---
Seems i do? So that's at least 1 person. And if you think 1 in 37.000 is close enough to 1 in a million i hope you never do anything ever in your life that involves numbers. You are litterly exaggerating it by a factor 30.
---
Good thing the comment you're replying to says "in a raid"...
---
Haha! Perfect. This so sums up my state of mind.
---
Guess the question is... which do you find yourself feeling more?
---
Short term gains are a bad plan for a company that wants to be taken seriously.
---
So, you get into queue remotely, then use means to keep yourself from going afk?
---
Or to put more plainly, you log in while clearly afk and deny people who can actively play a spot on the server?
---
And then you have the audacity to say that people should not worry about the queues, despite knowing that not everyone is able to remotely queue in advance?  Or are selfish enough to deny other people game time?  This makes as much as sense as a line behind an arcade cabinet while you have the identical copy of the game, without any line, to the left and right.
---
I'm glad I left Sulfuras.  The queue times were unmanageable for me because I didn't use anti-afk measures.  I was busy with my family.  Then when I sat down to play, I didn't want to deal with 30 minute to 60 minute queues in my 2 hours of gaming.
---
Too many people are so frightened of being on a 'dead' server when the reality is if everyone in queues went to other servers, there would be no 'dead' servers.

F's in the Chat for server performance

Nothing gets people looking at your stream like angry people. Might even change a few minds.

Thank you, any tips for priests and the leveling journey? Never played one but I heard they melt when played right.

Blizzard doesn't care about discord, you have to state loot rules in blizzard channel.
---
I'm 60 and horde side on Kurinnaxx, from census data I've seen it's 60:40 Horde 10-60, and 55:45 Horde for lev 60s only.  So definitely a very balanced server if you believe the census data (not sure how accurate it is).
---
Anecdotally, it feels pretty balanced.

Scarlett Key for Stratholme Living side.

Skeleton Key for Scholomance.

Just remember, most twitch streamers have no actual life skills or experience outside of gaming.

Apparently, he is well experienced in being an asshole so at least he has a shot at the presidency but that‚Äôs about it.
---
Bad news is popular news. World is fucked in that regard.
---
No, that looks pretty good! You've got all really important stuff and there's nothing that stands out as wasted.
---
That said, I personally don't think Anger Management is worth a point (some like it), and you probably don't need to max out imp revenge- at 45% stun chance you're going to suffer from stun's diminishing returns on higher-health mobs. I'd say 1 or 2 points and you'll still get more or less the same benefit.
---
For where to put those extra points, I'd consider Toughness for the armor, or improved charge for the initiation. Or even the crit chance in Fury. Your call. If considering improved charge, keep in mind that it's another situational one, since you can't charge in to all encounters. And you already have a good amount of 'situational but good' talents with Anger Management, imp Revenge, and Last Stand.
---
They don't ignore bot-reports.. my [battle.net](https://battle.net) account gets compromised every time I quit playing.  I see them changing my password with the passing emails and eventually taking control.  At first I wouldn't care because I quit.  Then like a week or two later I see my account has been banned.  So saying they do nothing is a lie.  I've had this happen 3-4 times over the years and the account has been banned 100% of the time.  Blizz is good about restoring accounts to the proper owners and unbanning them.
---
Any tips for priest? I see you play one and I have never played one before.
---
&gt; I think my core concern is that the statement: "int is 2.35x more important than +Healing!" Is... incomplete at best.
---
Yes, that ended up confusing people more than I had meant to. The reason this stat weight is so high is because I used my "total combat mana" to be 5k, which is my max base. However, there's a lot of regen, pots, consumables, buffs, etc that really ramp up total mana usage for combat. If I plug it something more reasonable like 10k mana, I get a lot more weight towards +Healing (as you'd expect).
---
It keeps dropping for longer fights and bigger consumes because M keeps growing. Also keep in mind, +Healing comes in larger quantities than int in gear (generally 1.75x or more as much).
---
An example usage for this would be comparing the two staves I mentioned in the post: GSoW vs Trindlehaven. We are comparing 53 healing to 25int and 14 healing. Let's say I'm a pretty basic healer with a total of 200 heals, and I generally use rank 3 heals. These staffs drop and I want to see which is better. With modest consumables, I run maybe 8k mana:
---
&gt; `15*(623+0.86*200)/(8000*0.86) = 1.73` int to Healing.
---
So this means GSoW is worth 53, and Trindle is worth `25*1.73 + 14 = 57.25`. Trindlehaven is better! But their both almost equal. Conventional wisdom would put GSoW way above Trindle always. What actually happens is that at lower +Healing, GSoW is better. When you start hitting 200+, Trindle is better. If you use a lot of consumables, GSoW is better again. The equation just provides a lot more of a nuance analysis that conforms to your parameters.
---
I imagine so, you don't really even need stealth runs but I figure it would make it easier. 
---
Me(mage) and a Pally friend clear Hearthsinger + Unforgiven alone using the following method:  
---
- Go in through UD side  
---
- The first pack will need to be killed if you can't stealth by them, it's composed of non-elites and elites. What we do is have the pally tank (druid in your case) while I nuke the non elites (the rogue will be doing this), if we ever drop below 20-30% we pop out of the instance and heal.  
---
- Typically 1-2 phase outs and you've cleared all the non elites, so you just kill the 3 regular elites.  
---
- You walk to the side that heads to Live, and there will be about 3~ packs you need to clear before Unforgiven, and two pats (One big green boi and a wandering Ghoul), I'd suggest taking these guys down as they can be annoying. If you can stealth past, that's even better.  
---
- When you get to the Unforgiven, just make sure you have some AoE (I think the holy water works), and take him down. He's very easy to kill with two people.
---
Hence the clears and clears efficiently. 
---
Low levels in greens cleared this content. If you still need gear you have a huge problem.
---
My journey to BRD last night was TOUGH because of multiple alliance raids.
---
Are you having fun?
---
Bag cost = 2.9g - 5% AH cut = 2.75 G
---
1.25 stack of runecloth = 5 bolts = 1.3g\*1.25 = 1.625 G
---
Rune thread = 45 S
---
2x rugged leather \~ 20 S
---
total cost \~ 2.275 G per bag (not including recipe)
---
profit  \~ 48 S per bag
---
This is not including the AH deposit fee of 30S for a 24 hour deposit which you will lose if your bag does not sell. 
---
Not sure how much the recipe goes for but there are easier/cheaper ways to get tailoring to 300.
---
Huh! That wasn't case before now?
---
Yeah omg, I think this and the layering or whatever u call that in retail is the 2 things I hate the most
---
They told us it would be a few weeks... Now it's months? I don't understand wtf the problem is.
---
It's art....
---
You are allowed to show nudity as long as it is art.

That i was excited about it!

Doesn't Eve use Time Dilation to solve the mystery lag issue?
---
yea, maybe that's true in the short term...
---
Nothing because Game Masters aren't here to act on ninja.
---
who cares about a stupid name? really
---
Could it be the Ony head is about to be turned in?
---
People still were failing to clear MC in on the later patches as well. The vast majority of servers didn't have any guild clear NAXX, and a bunch never cleared C'thun.
---
works better for druids than anyone else, since you can teleport to moonglade to get back to that part of the world, and leave your hearth in SW.
---
hoes mad
---
What? Alliance apparently has better storylines (from what I‚Äôve heard, I‚Äôll never roll Alliance) but Horde seems much much easier. Much easier to access to many dungeons than Alliance, solid quest hub locations, better PvP racials overall, and Shamans are pretty tight, especially in PvP. So no I would say Classic favors Horde from ease to play, but there‚Äôs basically no solid story involved besides ‚ÄúMe want them dead.‚Äù
---
I realized that's why at I was typing it but figured I'd finish the thought anyway.
---
Seems like it also encourages people to stay until the end as well, for longer runs.
---
Some people didn't wait 10 hours to play on release day and it shows
---
Really though?
---
it was 3. and the released many more at launch. get real
---
Doesn‚Äôt that make the low population server very horde favored?
---
How do you determine whose making an effort? I don't understand why you want to associate logs with try harding. Maybe more guilds should look over logs.  
---
\- We've got people that are AFKing, or simply not trying (the logs help us see this)
---
\- People that are not pulling their weight (logs let us HELP them)  
---
\- People using wrong abilities, people not having correct buffs
---
The issues go on and on, and having the logs makes it easy to look over the fights and see what's happening instead of having to click through Details.
---
you get them to transfer with you..
---
I'm aware how Reddit works, but why would I delete my post? I'm unapologetic about my opinion.
---
I can understand why he did it but I think that it's a shitty thing for him. In the grand scheme of things I think that it isn't a huge deal though, I don't think he's a sociopath, just an asshole I wouldn't raid with.
---
I think anyone who acts like this is some hideously reprehensible act need to chill and they've got very little going on in their lives to blow this up as much as they are.
---
I also think you particularly are an extremely shallow, bland individual, and a doormat, if you always do right by others with very little thought about why you're doing right by them.
---
You're welcome to report it and try get it taken down but I stand by those statements.
---
Commenting only so this gets more attention. Everyone should see this
---
true, I think another way to think about it is also how often these spells come into play. Fear is obviously super important for warlocks and doesn't have a CD. And priests are generally high priority targets for rogues in PvP. 
---
I would take UD 10/10 times over orc for rogues, personally
---
ss vs tarren mill is a boomer meme, it happend for maybe 1 month in vanilla and is a legend. Afterwards no1 ever fought there
---
I raid right now and have a 20 slot soul bag and that‚Äôs plenty for me.  Especially considering the cost of the 28 slot soul bags.
---
On raid nights I just empty my regular bags some and put all the extra soul shards in the regular bags (a mix of Runecloth and Mooncloth bags).  We do our entire raid on one night so for the six other days/nights of the week a 20 slot soul bag is plenty.
---
Conversely the cost of a 28 slot soul bag doesn‚Äôt make send considering I only need the extra shards 3-4 hours a week.
---
yeah, otherwise cool raid (I was on when it happened but left the area fast lol, not much I could do as a lvl 47 other than being murdered for fun :D)
---
its a game though. what do you mean "other peoples feelings"?
---
~~Warcraft 4~~ World of Warcraft 2
---
Umm no... I mean honestly who cares about a stupid keychain. Blizzard seems pretty inept at dealing with it, akin to their dealing with the HK protests
---
May I recommend Ziqo aswel, haven't seen him mentioned often
---
Pally tanking can be great in the AOE loving days we play in. Though for raid tanking I have a guildie who lives and breathes WoW/pally (Mythic raider on retail, super involved in the paladin discord/Theory crafting) and even he admits theres a lot of fights that the class can‚Äôt handle. Though that isn‚Äôt to say there are useless and I love pushing hybrid classes to their limit.
---
i know you dont need to =) but what he was talking about was many actions in one button press done by a 3rd party keyboard software.
---
We have participated in a raid versus raid battle there several times since Classic launched. Meme or not, it‚Äôs been great fun.
---
&gt; I am glad you agree with my OP, it is an exploit that he is showcasing on his stream.
---
Yea? I never said it wasn't an exploit, so nice strawman.
---
Lol, imagine being so uptight.  You sound like a fun person.
---
All they needed to do was make Orgrimmar unplayable.
---
We as a society have to better control to whom we give our eyeballs and attention to.  For so long, we idolized fake prophets and the handsome entertainers and sweet talking swindlers.  We too easily give into convience and the shirt term good feels
---
&gt; Could you please provide a link to the spec, dps output and reasons for running it? Because my googling has just turned up with some guy saying he plans to stack of the wolf / gorilla gear while leveling for the fun of it despite knowing it's a bad idea because he plays a battle cleric in d&amp;d. I can't even find a theory craft of this idea, because it doesn't exist.
---
As suspected someone summarised it above your post. People fail to realize the game is 15 years old and has more to offer than meets the eye.
---
I can agree with all of that. If anything, I'd update your original tldr with a message in bold to the effect of:
---
**If you already have enough +healing to downrank most of your spells, then int is often significantly more valuable than additional +healing.**
---
(Though spirit's still way better than int ;D)
---
*Slide* show, as in "it's gonna lag like a motherfucker with 160 people fighting on half a mile of road"
---
#Nochanges boys, you wanted this
---
You might want to give the fiery cores to your trusty Enchanters and Blacksmiths for their Thorium Brotherhood rep.
---
Damn, the difference between 1 and 2 is almost greater than the difference between 2 and the rest of that list.
---
Good shit, OP. Pay no mind to the casuals who wanna talk shit even though they're probably not even 40 yet.
---
&gt; It's not cheating.
---
Never said it was...
---
Point still remains that he abused layering.  So i'll ask again... what is your point?
---
If the servers aren't lagging your computer will definitely be.
---
Perception is good against 1, MAYBE 2 classes. It has a 3 minute cooldown. That's pretty long.
---
It is so situational that it makes it useful in like 1 scenario:  When you see a rogue stealth near you you pop it. That's it.
---
Maybe if you have spy addon and it tells you when someone is stealthed nearby maybe then it is better, but lets say you don't have spy. If that rogue is already stealthed and you have no way of knowing he is there, why would you pop perception? You wouldn't.
---
Will of the forsaken on the other hand is good against: Priests, warlocks, and warriors. It has an actual benefit in combat and doesn't rely on you having to see a class use an ability. It certainly helps, but it isn't required. Breaking out of a fear will save you way more times than being able to detect a rogue maybe.
---
I'd level an alt to just sit in those raids and never bid on anything lol
---
I'm alliance and it gives me the option to transfer off Incendius

If you post on this thread
---
Dura is 120.  Not sure on exact % chance to take dura but it lasts thru 8ball garr without too much issue.
---
Big if true
---
&gt; Narrator: It wasn't
---
You inclination to use the past "tense" leads me to believe you don't think the game hasn't changed over 15 years. In reality, it has changed and more things are possible.
---
Fr is needed for vael and flamegor.  But sure give it to the hunters first
---
Dextros
---
I understand the person you are talking about exists but there is still a large group of people who don't want to interact with the guild, don't want to help, aren't in bis, don't use consumables, and just show up for raids because MC is ezmode. That is probably the majority of players as the more of the initial 60's on each server stop logging in. Assuming that every raidlogger is some elite player that has poured time and effort into their character is a bit of a stretch.
---
I do, seeing others accomplishments in classic wow really should not make you upset
---
Honestly, I've found it to be the exact opposite as Horde. That might change, though. I'm already 29 on my shaman and the questing has been a *breeze*. I've never run into the issue of not having enough quests. Hell, I've had to delete a few quests from my log as they went grey. So far the quests have been straight forward and linear: 
---
Durotar -&gt; The Barrens -&gt; Southern Barrens -&gt;Stonetalon Mountains -&gt; Ashenvale -&gt; 1k Needles
---
Compared to my mage (by 29):
---
Elwynn -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Early RR -&gt; Dun Morogh -&gt; Late Westfall -&gt; Mid RR -&gt; Early Duskwood -&gt; late RR -&gt; Duskwood -&gt; Northern STV
---
This is just a side by side of Orc and Human, though. Darkshore is an explosion of quests and XP in tiny area. 
---
When it comes to leveling, I think the Horde has it a lot easier. When it comes to end game, Alliance have it way easier. When it comes to PvP, the Horde is obviously better because
---
LOK'TAR OGAR MY BROTHERS!
---
Old but gold.
---
you still didn't answer my question, WHAT should I look up?
---
Because when it comes to PVP the Horde have a very strong handicap or at least that is the community perception.
---
Horde attracts casuals and retail babies who want stuff handed to them and to never lose or be challenged.
---
Most people rolling Alliance know what they are getting into with faction imbalances and they join the Alliance *anyways.*
---
Most people are too scared to be underdogs so naturally more plebs who dream of glory being handed to them with ease roll Horde cause they want the perceived handicap while also making themselves feel accomplished and strong when they outnumber the Alliance 3 to 1.
---
Raids reset were always like that.
---
SM Aimed shot...a NElf hunter can hit you for 2/3rds of your hp before you even know they are there.  They can cast aimed shot while SMed and it doesn't break until the cast completelys.  Druids can also open from SM with Starfire or Entagling Roots, both can be insanely strong based on the situation.  
---
Shadowmeld is very strong ability in BGs.  It is less strong in world PvP as it requires you to be in a place where the other faction is going to wander into your range, but in BGs there are plenty of places where that is guaranteed (point and flag defense).
---
I played as NElf Hunter when I first started in early TBC. Wasn't until well down the leveling process I realised the racials were/are absolute trash compared to others. Still my main on retail to this day but Blizz definitely gave Alliance races a bum deal.
---
Without the "exists" it would error.  With [@mouseover,exists], if you don't have a mouseover it skips that set of conditionals and checks the next.
---
/e is what I believe you are referring to
---
This guy is mad af :D
---
Again, this was never about fairness. The original charge was that Horde on Stalagg are twats and I am agreeing. That's not saying that Alliance are equally twats but I only encountered Horde as my enemy so it's all I have to go off of.
---
Twat behavior: Me and a Horde are questing near each other - we are both ignoring each other and only focusing on the quest mob - another Horde enters the area and starts a fight with me - I engage and begin the 1v1 - previously uninterested Horde now seems interested and attacks me. This isn't about fairness, just twatness and twatness exceeds faction lines.
---
Jump runs
---
Level as shadow until mid 50s. Plead with people not to HAM AoE everything. PWS DPS and try not to fall asleep. A good tank will make you bored, bad DPS will stress you out.
---
Healing is the easiest job in a raid, mucho recommended.
---
And you should be, don‚Äôt let those who are jealous ruin your excitement or pride.
---
I‚Äôm not saying they should‚Äôt be punished. Ideally they will, but they probably won‚Äôt. It was a sad learning experience for the guy to not play ever again with a streamer. They might be funny to watch, and I like a few of them too, but would never play with them because they will only care about themselves in the end.
---
If legitimate gear upgrades are getting disenchanted, that just means the minimum dkp bid is too high.
---
In the guild I'm in, you get 440 dkp for a full MC+Onyxia clear. Minimum bid is 50 for armor and 100 for weapons. Works great imo.
---
so what?
---
Streamer makes streamer raid. Streamer takes loot.
---
Hoes mad witch hunt o clock.
---
Also rule 3. delete this post
---
This is about as hopping as IF really ever gets. Our guild free-transferred from Mankrik. Still able to find groups, still able to raid, though town isn't nearly as lively as other realms. Pretty okay with that, all things considered.
---
no im lyin

Warrior is even more difficult then Rogue.

---
damn it, dad, you're embarrassing me in front of my gamer friends.
---
Honest question, no snark, how many times have you reported someone for this and they didn‚Äôt resolve it?
---
LMAO RIP your 15 year old emulator loot!
---
same. cunt.
---
Undead. I‚Äôm heavily biased, they are my favorite race.
---
I love the assumption that because a streamer is running a raid that somehow makes it legit or it won't be fraught with peril.
---
It really goes to show you how easily kids and young adults are drawn to these barely famous ecelebs. To these kids fame and popularity are the only factors by which these streamers are judge. It makes me sad seeing an entire generation worship streamers the way they do.
---
i cant decided whos the bigger loser, the streamer or all the people in here crying and giving him even more attention.
---
you dont want to be ninja'd? join a guild. crying never solves anything and social contracts are part of the classic experience like it or not.
---
2k as a priest? Teach me, master.
---
Hey dude! I think the addon is Miksscrollingbattletext or something similar. It requires a bit of messing around in the settings because imo the default setting clutter the screen but its very helpful.
---
ah ok, I agree
---
Wailing Caverns and Temple of Atal'Hakkar are my personal nemeses. My last run in ST lasted over 2 hours and we didn't even finish it because the healer bailed due to IRL issues.
---
bro i was on queldorei and it was so dead in legion that it got merged with senjin later on, its still dead as fk. i think there are a total of ~5 active guilds
---
I remember they mentioned it a while back, they dont want to deal with all the extra support that comes with settling disputes like that.
---
Is this English? I have no idea what OP just said
---
Not if it is your chosen profession. The monetary value of that kind of publicity is worth the dedication if you play your cards right. This guy had enough viewers and sponsorships to probably retire if he wasn't an asshole. Its a gamble but to the Victor go the spoils.
---
Surprised to see someone like this as a part of method but they probably care more about viewership than attitudes and toxicity
---
Say but you will about him as a person but from watching his logs on retail he is no bot when it comes to dpsing, probably doesnt care about dps when everyone has 1 button rotation
---
Why will it get more attention? I thought it is only about upvotes?
---
Use sixtyupgrades.com. it shows you the BiS item. If you click the slot, it'll show you a descending list of other items that are almost as good (and potentially easier to farm).
---
Level shadow. Wand specialization is 25% more DPS and spirit tap if used right means you never go OOM
---
The avg player doesn't kill the bosses in 15s. Yes top level do, but I was referring to the avg players experienced.

It's on them to make new friends and integrate to the new guild, are they not friendly people or do they just keep to themselves?  I mean, why wouldn't you want a bigger guild, constant people to run stuff with whenever you need and everyone is doing things to benefit themselves and others so the guild can easily clear the raids.   If they want to raid at all, this is how it has to be.   I just had to merge our guild with another this past week after having several other merges fall through, and in that time you find out who is going to actually still play the game and log in, and who was just in on the hype from release, so far over 50% of those players have gone from regular play, to casual or not at all and unsubscribing.  
---
What your friends need to understand is that a guild like this, as long as they are a 'good fit', as they probably are since you had several meetings before this decision, is that being in a guild like the one you merged with is mostly a protection to everyone's play experience.  It's an understood convenience that guildies are always available to other guildies, mostly, and that you won't have to find PUGs as much if at all anymore.  I can see where that one person might feel 'left out', but I'd also wonder how he responds to other changes in his life if he's looking to succeed.  They've got to be more open to befriending others, what you did is a total positive for that friend group.
---
It's a lot of bag space.
---
You can roll but they don't have to care about your roll. You go into the group accepting that it comes with preset rules saying an item is reserved.
---
You might want to remove minimum bid completely, and then treat 0 bid as a roll. For most classes with 40 weekly dkp, t1 would be worth less than 10, but bis weapons would always be max bid.

Sixtyupgrades.com you can enter your level and see BiS items
---
lmao dude probably can't make eye contact on the street, let alone talk shit
---
Yeah some do, but I wanted to give a slower estimate for fairness sake lol
---
We actually had some rules in place when we went to DKP specifically for that reason. First eye was reserved between 3 priests, first mageblade between 2 locks and 2 mages, etc. Just for the super big ticket items. There's a system we've discussed where you have an overbid of 2xMax bid, but nothing in between Max and Overbid. Overbid is the highest it can go, no matter what. So say Perdition's is 40 DKP minimum. Max is 100. Overbid is a whopping 200. (That's over a month of saved DKP for us).

Smooth McGroove is pretty chill and cool. I think he's a great guild leader as well. Nat Pagle is My Dad rocks!
---
He thought no one will know it in europe, only in the us server.
---
Controversial üôÇ
---
3.5hrs is pretty slow.  Ur guild needs the minor upgrades.  Dkp sucks.  Thats the way it is
---
&gt;Crit is better if you down rank because it reduces the chance of overhealing. I tend to cast heals that don't quite top off to account for crit overhealing.
---
I'm confused. You tend to cast heals that dont quite top off the target to account for crit overheal. My contention is that if a player stacks plus healing, they can more accurately predict and smooth out the healing. If you go on a dry spell stacking crit, you move up to a higher rank spell to compensate.
---
&gt;Keep in mind though, in my analysis it shows that the current crit rate cancels out for +Healing and int; critting on more spells (int) is just as effective as critting harder (+Healing). I also completely ignore the added crit from the `dM` equation because it's assumed negligible both in magnitude and effect. I made quite a few assumptions in favor of +Healing specifically to show that int is still a heavyweight.
---
I agree that critting more often or critting harder less often is negligible to practical healing.
---
&gt;See from the post:
---
&gt;&gt; Notice that (Sm) canceled out. This means that the mana cost of your standard candle doesn't matter, nor does your current crit. This is because those stats effect +Healing just as much as Int; more mana is more chances to cast and crit, and more +Healing scales each cast and crit. Turns out that these effects are equivalent. Your total efficacy is VERY dependent on these values, but not your consideration of stat weights between M and H.
---
Here's where I'm lost. + healing effects each cast as well as each crit. Int only scales the number of crits and increases your total mana pool. This is a huge distinction. The smooth predictable performance of healing power is the paramount measure of why the stat is bis.
---
The extra mana pool is diminished in importance once you account for consumables and that healers rarely oom.
---
What really controls, imo, is how often the healer has to uprank their heal.
---
I've been buying out all the Solid Stone on my server and raising the price, then going out and mining more once I've got the price raised to where I want. There's usually someone out there desperate enough to pay the increased price as long as your stuff is the only option available.
---
I tweeted this to Sco and method. I hope he will get kicked out of method
---
Take it from a priest who farmed TF and Hide Mats.
---
It sucks.
---
&gt;if this is what endgame is all about

cringe.
---
So he was farming directly next to a graveyard? genius.
---
Esfand is trying to get people banned from twitch for killing him while having hordes stack him up on reckoning for pvp. Same toxic asshole.
---
Is the raid leader able to use the money he got for bidding?
---
That was a bit different game and the game was not even released in europe for months. Now it was released in europe in the same time.
---
I've seen cloudkeeper legs going for 2k and higher. It's not really worth it imo

Sounds like ‚Äúif I can‚Äôt see you, you can‚Äôt see me‚Äù mentality lol but I‚Äôm pretty sure EU uses this reddit sooo

The second clip was actually kind of disturbing.  I kind of feel sorry for this guy and feel that he legitimately may need mental help.

I'll see you guys next year i guess
---
Dominant faction queue, with the ability to faction change for free until the population is withing 5% of each other.
---
Would definitely make slam not only usable while moving but not reset the SWING timer.
---
Maybe a little over kill but I think itd be cool
---
&gt; We've got people that are AFKing
---
That would also show up on basic damage/healing meters.
---
I think the biggest use my guild has for them is looking at dispel/decurse counts, which makes it obvious which mage(s) aren't stopping DPS to decurse people (as an example). That's also very easy to look at through Details though, there's no need to go through the extra step of logging. And there's *definitely* no need to make the logs public.
---
yeah, just ignore the fact that gm's contradict each other all the time, and sometimes they have plainly wrong info? this isn't proving much of anything sadly.
---
You mean you've watched his stream and DIDN'T expect this behavior?
---
He's in EPL. I know on my server the Alliance kill him rather frequently just to be jerks.
---
Good luck, just don't be discouraged if you die a few times in the attempts, we had a few wipes on the first pack before we got the rhythm down.
---
Now we can do it in like 5-10 minutes cleanly, a bit of practice makes it go much smoother.
---
0/62 atm buying krol today lol
---
Hemo rogue just feels nasty as a warrior (that‚Äôs the pvp spec right?)
---
This guy has pooped in my sandwich a ton of times, I think I‚Äôm 2-11 vs him. There‚Äôs a couple of times I maybe had a chance to kill him but he‚Äôs Orc rogue, and intercept gets resisted RIP.
---
I actually think I‚Äôve killed more Mages then PvP specd rogues, probably because they didn‚Äôt take me seriously (I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm still like 5-100 Vs mages anyways.
---
Nug energy gives you the upcoming energy tic as a timer which IMO is the needed for planning out attacks and not wasting energy or thistle tea...
---
You're not watching the right streams if you think any streamer above a hobbyist is cancer.
---
Couple points. I'm not sure which census you were looking at because the one posted on wowhead showed Stalagg as having the worst ratio in NA. 
---
Secondly, I actually do think it is *precisely* the hordes problem that alliance numbers fizzled out overtime, as Alliance are a Horde's end game goal. Not saying they were the direct cause of the fizzle, but if you were a horde and you heard that alliance are leaving in droves, as was clearly shown in the official Discord, because they can't finish quests would you continue to mob alliance out in the world? Sure, you can do it and claim "PvP server" but at the point you are directly part of the problem. 
---
Attacking me when other random members of you faction show up, when we were previously neutral and both questing, is twat-like behavior. This is the bit I'm annoyed with, not guild vs guild stuff near endgame dungeons.
---
Is he hard to kill?
---
Yeah, hopefully Venruki has the balls to kick him.
---
But everyone is getting ony head buff in this ss.
---
&gt; Also they think that because an item isn't on a BIS list it's not better than prebis.
---
The only piece of felheart that is better than any of the pre Bis dungeon/crafted gear as far as DPS goes is felheart bracers which have 1 more sp, and 1 int.  In terms of pure DPS, they are worse than greens of shadow wrath. There is some merit to having more stam, but as far as the content we have right now goes, it's not necessary at all.  Felheart is basically only used in pvp and for looks by folks who min max for dps.
---
Everyone.  No one's opinion actually matters to anyone else.  Some people think BfA is cool, doesn't matter.  Some people think it isn't, also doesn't matter.
---
It's all irrelevant.  The point is this is a sub about Classic, and clearly method isn't the best group in Classic, and that isn't an opinion.  Since this is about Classic, I don't care what method does in BfA because that isn't relevant in any way, shape, or form.
---
Go for gathering professions imo.
---
Healthy pop without being overcrowded. Finding groups is easy and the faction balance is as good as it could realistically get.
---
I don't entirely trust many people at all, especially randos on the internet.  Guess i'll just never raid instead of assuming the best in people and then yes expecting the GMs to do something about scamming.
---
They're going to be pre raid BiS for a long time with that raid comp. That's a LOT of players who need the exact same gear.
---
This isn't sustainable for long term success. They absolutely stacked this comp just for show and still only beat the next best time by 1 minute. Give it 2-3 more months and groups that actually raid with casters regularly to give them gear will blow these guys out of the water.
---
Off topic but the "study them" part reminds me of a story.
---
My buddy buys anime statues of like..anime babes..I guess?
---
We were at the mall and he took us into our local Anime shop and showed us this one of some really busty anime character and he said, "Dude I asked my mom for this in freshman year of highschool and said it was for a project."
---
I still try to imagine the look on her face as he told her that, like how in the world did he expect her to buy that.
---
You're gonna have so much MC mats, no reason not to give your tanks some decent FR gear.
---
Hunters to use shields.  
---
Let the PvP salt begin
---
Diablo 3 was garbage to be honest
---
Right over your head . We don't need more ppl on sulfurus it's perfect atm.
---
&gt; Here's where I'm lost. + healing effects each cast as well as each crit. Int only scales the number of crits and increases your total mana pool.
---
Your total mana pool reflects how many casts you can do, and each cast is scaled by +Healing. It only takes 11 int for a free rank 2 Heal, whose total healing amount is then scaled by by your +Healing. That's how they feed off of each other. +Healing is still generally more important, but there comes a saturation point where simply allowing more casts is better than a pinch more healing per cast.
---
The thing you quoted was just trying to say that the **mana cost** and crit of your standard candle heal does not affect the state weight between M and H. Less mana cost means more casts for H to effect, but also means M let's you cast more. These effects turn out to be equal. Same with crit (as you mention), critting harder each cast vs critting more total has an equal effect.
---
&gt; What really controls, imo, is how often the healer has to uprank their heal.
---
This analysis assumes you aren't changing your heal ranks; it uses a standard candle spell which is meant to represent your overwhelming primary heal. If you have to uprank, you should modify the "base heal" bit higher to reflect that average.
---
That's what I'm hoping! That or I use my wife as a puppy mill and breed a loyal raid team i can whack when they play sub-par.
---
300 is just waaaaaaay too much, and completely unecessary. 
---
Fewer people higher level well organised quickly in and out without them having time to assemble the troops.
---
Conflag with night fall gives you the most instant casts and is fun as fuck, just make sure to counterbalance your survivability with some Stam hear üòå
---
That was the joke
---
&gt;Is that a little better hopefully?
---
Gorgeous, thanks for updating it.
---
&gt;For now though, spirit is pretty useless in MC and Ony (Ony is a long fight, but the only intense part is the last 2 minutes).
---
My last Ony saw her spinning like a fucking beyblade in P3 cause pugs couldn't handle their aggro. It is only by the grace of some benevolent god that we were not incinerated.
---
AoE for spriests. I miss Mind Sear.
---
&gt; Lol why are you trying to impress me with your homework kid? Sorry but you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Yeah okay. I had an inkling you'd respond with something like that. 
---
&gt; "Mirroring" is not a thing, you just made that up on the spot.
---
Yes it was a quick analogy ment for people to understand what I wanted to explain, not for people with deeper software knowledge.
---
&gt; I've been a programmer for 9 years.
---
Yeah okay, considering your previous posting history that'd make you around ~23 years old - and you're calling others "kid"?
---
I'm done trying to discuss with you since you seem incredibly hostile and you're downvoting people you're discussing with. These personality traits sure helped your Blizzard internship application.
---
Down ranking affects the base healing of your standard candle. It's the `Sh` term in:
---
&gt; `15*(Sh+Sc*H)/(M*Sc)` Int per 1 +Healing
---
How? How do you do this?
---
Nah you can‚Äôt. The pvp balance spec doesn‚Äôt run boomkin form. It‚Äôs 29/11/11 or moon glow spec
---
Yea? Well that‚Äôs just like, your opinion man!

&gt; Uhhh...I did. Lol. You should have read the post before firing-from-the-hip in response after reading the first few sentences.

Deviate's a casual server, most people have 9-5s. You can genuinely tell when everyone gets home from work.
---

---
I love ele shamans. It‚Äôs been my main for all of retail. The only reason I‚Äôm not running one now is because all my mates wanted to go ally
---
Interesting! Does this work on friendly and enemy alike?
---
*I believe you*.
---
I had the phenomenal luck to receive the archivist cloak of (+33) healing, and I'm pretty sure they're going to have to bury me in that thing.
---
Don‚Äôt raid with streamers this always happens.
---
Reddit has a short-term memory so it doesn't matter in the long-term what they do unless it directly negatively affects their sponsors' income/image.
---
But that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Would it be helpful in preventing cities but being unloadable
---
First Exposure to him. Fuck this guy.
---
While it is somewhat common knowledge that you can scout for Skul at the side entrance using Eye of Kilrogg, I haven't seen any information on scouting for him at the service gate.  The most efficient way to farm the wand should be scouting at the service gate, suiciding to trash / hellfire and then running through the side entrance and scouting with eye before resetting and then doing run again but in reverse
---
&gt; Is it worth it to go tailor/enchanting off the bat, or should I just go herb/skinning for money?
---
If you stockpile the cloth/greens you get leveling up (Send it to an alt's mailbox), it's much better to just level herbalism/skinning and AH the materials you get. A stack of swiftthisle alone goes for 10-20G on my server and it's incredibly easy to get a few stacks while leveling around 30, so that you can easily afford your mount by 40.
---
Then when you're ready to level tailoring/enchanting, just drop the skills and grab the materials from your alt and you'll be most of the way.
---
With phase2 coming out and wPVP will greatly be in effect and on a server that is considered 50:50 balanced, what class would have the best experience specially levelling up between 30-40? I don't mean/want dominate wPVP but something that can possibly retaliate when someone is super aggressive?
---
Same for me. BC was when I canceled my subscription
---
See my comment above. Behavioural geneticists have data that suggests personality and social skills can be somewhat innate as well as learned. 
---
It seems as though we‚Äôre learning as we grow up, but another way to think of it is what we are seeing is traits emerging as we grow into adulthood. We think our experiences shape who we become perhaps much more than is the reality.
---
Gotta live the format life.
---
You don't need all of your healers active for trash fights, only bosses. It's common for some healers and some mages to be sitting down between trash packs drinking. What ends up happening is people take turns so some packs you don't need to drink and can run right to the next pack and some you have to sit and drink for a bit.
---
Its just a staff man...
---
Ive tried for ages to sell my fkin larval acid. Ended up vendoring.
---
Yea. One half is in Darkshore surrounded by lvl 18 threshers and the other half is right next to the fatigue zone in Westfall which a lvl 22 elite shark sometimes patrols the edge.
---
If you have been clearing MC for 6 weeks your guild isn't full of casuals...
---
Yeah, I was just thinking ‚Äòwhat keys?‚Äô
---
Last few days I've seen 5-6 Alliance that camp there and then kill him. Based off that number I'd say he's not super hard to kill. They seem to bait the dogs out, kill them, then kill him.
---
You can do DM East in 8-12 minutes. I don't know where you get 50 minutes from. :D
---
He's the one that said it.
---
It most certainly is my friend - as a long time fan of d2 (my favourite game of all time) they just didnt manage to make a game to the same standards. Hoping they will redeem themselves with D4, but I dont have high hopes
---
Reduce the threat of shadow priest dmg. Idk why the design is such that a low tier spec has one of the highest threat threshholds.
---
I won't believe this until someone who has actual experience with running/scripting pservers on mangos comments. So far it's just been random speculation from what I can tell.
---
Yes this
---
I've been reporting the same farmer 8 hours a day in the same spot all day for two months. Nothing has happened.
---
I've resorted to putting bounties on his head and letting all enemy faction players know via the sub about the guy so tomorrow they can farm the fk out of him.
---
Agreed. D2 is the gold standard I‚Äôm hoping D4 serves it justic
---
Can someone confirm the exact process for engineering switching from Gnomish to Goblin?  Just the standard make-Gnomish-stuff-then-go-Goblin process; I've tried Googling it but I keep seeing a lot of conflicting and/or outdated information.
---
It's good practice to keep consistent formatting throughout a figure. It makes it easier to read and to scan quickly for the information you're interested in.
---
Yes, I added to the post, I added the "Edit" portion at the bottom. I didn't change the substance of it. Are you saying I edited the post to include the portion I quoted in the post above yours? Jesus man. Lol
---
Order must be restored. It has pretty good rewards and takes a small raid group to kill him
---
There are no talent switches.
---
So you can't  click a button, Bam I'm the best Healing druid possible, click another Bam I'm the best Bear possible, Click again Best moonkin DPS, again, Best kitty dps.
---
Your talent and gear choices matter, becomes part of your identity. Sure you can pay to respec, but you can't switch talents between pulls, You either spec hybrid to play hybrid, or you spec a dedication to specialize. Being the best spec for PvP means you don't have the best spec for Dungeons, or Raiding. And being the very best at all things becomes very expensive.
---
In the lore it‚Äôs because glowing eyes signaled greatness so they started breeding only NES with glowing eyes and now that‚Äôs all we are left with
---
Paladin - Drop Blessing of sacrifice.  Make blessing of sanctuary a base spell.  Replace talent with a taunt.
---
To be frank I don‚Äôt give a shit what the alliance players do, just trying to offer a possible solution. I never experienced anything close to an 8 hour queue back when Classic released, and if I had you can bet your ass I would‚Äôve rerolled on a new server immediately. But now we‚Äôre months in, and I‚Äôve got 15 days of playtime on my main. 15 days worth of building friendships, sharing experiences with my guild mates, etc. Without that, the game is meaningless to me so yes, I‚Äôd quit. I‚Äôm a busy guy right now and I don‚Äôt have time to wait in a queue during the limited window of time when I can play. So yeah, if Blizz is ever stupid enough to implement faction dependent queues, I‚Äôm unsubbing.
---
Yeah, reports are showing 70 - 30 Horde on incendius, though it doesn't have that feel during WPVP

I find it amusing that Method lost world first 60 to this guy then hired him.
---
This did not age well
---
it literally just shows that hes a thief and would have no problem stealing from someone. Watch your shit if Jokerd's around!
---
UBRS full run including the time it takes pugging and getting everyone there like 1h-2h30m a lot of that depends on how quickly all 10 players get there and if you wipe
---
The resto shammy in my raid makes his gold by farming devilsaur, he can solo them by frost shock kiting I believe. He has a dps set though, that is also good for pvp
---
30mins for strath dead seems a bit optimistic considering 45min runs from the 2nd gate were a hardmode challenge.
---
Abhorrent, attention seeking behavior employed by many view-hungry streamers/youtubers is evidently disconnected from what you would call acceptable in society. Watch some IRL vods and its bright as day. Case in point, jake paul being sued by pretty much every single neighbour in a 20 mile radius.
---
When streaming first came out and people could make a living on it, I was pretty happy. I thought it was cool that they found a job they love. Now, all the streamers that made me feel that way have all turned into massive assholes that act like this. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty fucking absurd.
---
Not that complicated, our class leaders just keep track of everyone's gear and pre assign it to someone to which they believe improves their itemization the most. If it drops they get it, if not next week. It's why preraid bis is so important because you might raid for a few weeks or months until it's your turn basically, but it will happen. No tolerance for lootwhores, it earns you a quick kick.
---
Smart raidcompositions also allow you to itemize more efficiently, especially for an easy boss like onyxia. We split all our rogues depending on if they need the T2 helmet/viskag so that if it drops in any raid someone can actually get use of it.
---
Funnily enough the exploit in reverse, that is, getting from the Eastern Kingdoms to Wetlands and then to Kalimdor (but still via a coordinates trick when dying) is *incredibly* easy. You could probably pull it off as low as level 5 (maybe level 1 as a human), though I waited til 10ish on alts to do it to grab a couple of easy quests in the Kalimdor starting area.
---
They ignore reports of gold spamming bots as well.
---
Do we actually even have GMs looking at the reports?
---
I report every single gold spamming bot I get a message from then put them on ignore, and a few days later when I report one of the spammers, the report is already filled out. Because I've already reported them. Then I ignore them *again*.
---
I mean classic is fun, but retail raids actually require a brain.
---
lol a rogue can't even put a dent into a shadow priest let alone a SL/ruin lock. A mage can stall for blink cooldown and dismantle any rogue naked
---
Stop what?
---
Not what theyre asking though
---
Fucking hell
---
This is true
---

---
Skeletons were outlawed on Blizzcon though, because they ~~are not appreciated by China~~ don't line up with the general artstyle of the game.

Update: Jokerd has been removed from Method

That was a private server thing only.
---
Look, you're not wrong and I agree with pretty much everything you've said. I just push back against the mindset of "if it's red it's dead" in all contexts across multiple games, not just on WoW. I think it's a default, auto-pilot position with regards to PvP and it's not how I personally choose to play, and I consider myself a lover of open field, uninstanced, spontaneous pvp as my first mmo was Dark Age of Camelot.
---
If you're not concerned with some spamming you can make a castsequence macro to swap between tracking types to spam while you're running around.  Maybe bind it to the mouse wheel or something.  But yeah, I'm fairly certain add-ons can't automate that sort of thing.
---
I forgot about that. Guess that's one reason people like it more.
---
GNOMED.
---
Why are y'all malding over a 15 year old easy as fuck game?
---
Alright, thanks.
---
It depends, my servers on medium and I often see people around. When it comes to raiding as well we raid on the same nights every week and we take a few pugs so we often see the same people wanting to run on those same nights weekly as well. If one of those people did something and we chucked it up on the realm discord i imagine it'd hamper their ability to raid.
---
Honestly the ticket system is the shittiest I've ever seen.
---
It runs you in circles over and over even when you know your issue requires a GM and not some random "helpful faq" that does jack shit and submitting an actual problem is fucking rough as the options require you to upload a fucking file you probably dont even have and you cant submit without it.
---
Just pure ass.

DKP sucks. The only better option is to find a loot council guild with tegrity. GL with that. Our's has worked out amazingly. We have amazing officers tho
---
    #showtooltip

    /use [btn:2]Create Healthstone;
---
    /use [mod:alt]3 2
---
    /stopmacro [mod:alt]
---
    /castsequence reset=120 3 3, 3 2
---
So this will create the stone if I right click it.  If I hold down alt it was use my potion (in bag 3 slot 2) then stop the macro.  I do this in case the timing gets messed up.  Then the castsequence will use my healthstone (in bag 3 slot 3) then change to my potion (again in bag 3 slot 2) and reset at 2 minutes when the healthstone is off cooldown.
---
Agreed, but post first rag kill to your server subreddit, where thats actually useful information that such and such guild has cleared rag. Nobody here cares.
---
I did look that up, but nobody really showed how to deal with 3 caster lashers at the last boss. Plus, I neither have mining nor herbalism, which makes it a lot less effective I think.
---
The hydraxian waterlords
---
Lol get rekt
---
Oh god yes. To both. Get getting rid of reagents and keys from the main bank would be just awesome. It would allow me to actually use my bank just to keep gear for random things. I can do so now. But that requires me to use bank alts or mail banking.
---
There were guards in Vanilla. I used to get attacked by them after I got the Bloodsail hat. However I'm pretty sure they where fixed at some point to not be there, or not be hostile.
---
You mean rogues?  And no they aren‚Äôt.  One on one they should win most encounters because you don‚Äôt lose fights you don‚Äôt start.  They are destroyed by warriors and if a hunter or ranged class gets away they will be kited.
---
In group play it is hit and miss.  If exposed they are killed quickly.
---
To be fair they lost a ton of time when the server crashed during Barron Geddon probably cost them an hour or two.

Queues peak on weekends, it's not anecdotal. When have you ever seen queues peaking on Tuesdays
---
There's a couple, but I'm not sure if there is any quest with no prerequisites that does. I think only some middle quest in a chain would lead you there. The main one I'm thinking of talks about a connection between the scythe of elune and Duskwood.
---
Latency differences between players is managed mostly by the servers tick rate, which is how often the client and server check in with each other to see what‚Äôs going on. You have the right idea in that each players actions have to be processed and sent to all other players around them, which gets compounded when you add more and more players into the mix. Latency differences between players however is not really a factor, just the sheer volume of actions.
---
Around Kaldorei, watch yo bootay
---
Streamers and youtubers and famous fucks will get around the bullshit. It's so scummy that people do this and there has to be a very special place for them out there
---
Honestly people have problems not just with itemization but basic healing. I can't tell you how many times in both my current guild and my last one, I see other Priests with poor spell usage. Many Priests don't even understand the basics but what's worse, is that many non-Priests don't seem to understand that this is bad play. There's nothing as deflating as knowing your skill goes unnoticed and bad Priests are praised. The only time I can get someone to notice I'm doing anything well is when the shit hits the fan and I actually manage to keep them alive through it, where other healers fail.
---
Can confirm. My son is 1 and he still occasionally shits his pants - no social awareness at all...
---
Damn if only they charged their player base money and then could use that money to make the servers better.... if only.....

See but with eve every system is isolated. Wow doesn't have that so slowing down the time wouldn't work.

We use DKP and don‚Äôt have these issues. We get around 30-40 DKP per week, and people will just spend 1 DKP on things that are upgrades but not BiS (if they‚Äôre the only one who wants it). Do you have a minimum bid? We‚Äôve never had to DE anything that is an upgrade. The only ones hoarding DKP right now are our rogues because no rogue gear ever drops :(
---
Not all of the members have to spend massive amounts of time playing though, you can find a balance if your guild is organizing and optimized enough to get a lot done in less time.
---
Oh shit hahaha
---
Contract as an influencer?
---
...as a way to make money. I don't know him, I don't care for him and he sounds like a good old jetk, but he makes a killing with his stream, I don't even need to check it to know that. Those people always do. So yeah. He likely makes more money than you, with his "living with his parents only playing WoW". There is enough to trash him about, like his behaviour, so why would you downplay what is a dream for many people?
---
‚ÄúMost people aren‚Äôt even that upset only like 4 people quit the raid‚Äù
---
LMFAO
---
...which, amazingly, is a pretty respectable move.
---
This. You can't tie the queue to faction without knowing your faction. The system doesn't know your faction until you connect to the server. You can't connect to the server until you get through the queue. You can't queue without knowing your faction....
---
See but eve solar systems are isolated. Wow doesn't have that. So it's a non option.

Why do you say no one's opinion actually matters to anyone else?

That analogy could use some work but I am just not picking.
---
Because I play Disgaea and other Eastern RPG's D:  I'm addicted to the grind, and must needs punishment
---
I used to naked duel warriors on my mage using nothing but rank1 frostbolt, frost nova, and rank 1 CoC.  I almost never lost, but if I fucked up at all I would get one shot.  It was super useful for getting good at mage and being able to play effectively around deadzones.

You're well intentioned but imo mistaken. There is a tangible difference between player attitudes then and now, and the min max attitude which retail players have been groomed for absolutely promotes impatience and intolerance for mistakes

If there below 50% flash heal, if there below 90% throw on a renew. That's what worked for me.

Haven't heard of this guy since him hitting 60 was huge news. What's the context? Was it an expensive item? Why are people so angry?
---
Macro can do this.
---

---
This will likely result in less subs, thus will never happen.
---
DXP rewards tenure in the guild. Just have everyone list their loot priority/goals on a spreadsheet, then if nobody bids, it's forced to the person that has that item further up on their list?
---
How do you calculate your crit chance? I don‚Äôt know if a way using an add on and even then idk how. 
---
For melee I can see how much crit chance I have but not for spell casting. 
---
Thanks a bunch you‚Äôve been a huge help!
---
No chance you take the 31 point for Moonkin Form Hu? Haha
---
Typical misinformed huntard
---
Because they basically follow two different logics. The geometric distribution seeks to answer "how many times can I do x and still not succeed?/until success", where as the binomial distribution is used to calculate probability of x successes in n independent, identical trials.  
---
So the difference would be like .. if we wish to catch 3 mounts with a probability p, we use the binomial distribution. If we instead are interested in fishing until we get the mount and then immediately stop, it would follow a geometric distribution. 
---
In short: In the geometric we care about the number of trials until 1 success. In the binomial (which is basically n Bernoulli trials) we wish to say what the probability of x successes in n trials are.
---
I hope this makes sense.
---
what a dumbass. throw away financial opportunities to ninja some pixels.

You will be reported for this. They are handing out warnings for this sort of stop and potential bans(from experience).

Is it disadvantageous or stupid to start working on professions ‚Äúlate‚Äù? I‚Äôm leveling a couple of toons at once to see which I enjoy more and to then make my main. However, I don‚Äôt do professions on either yet bc I‚Äôve been focusing on just questing and leveling and haven‚Äôt wanted to add more stuff to distract me. Is it dumb of me to not be working on professions? Like is it fine if I don‚Äôt do a profession until like level 30 or so or should I definitely start working on those now.

Well. As of now most priests don‚Äôt get to heal dungeons because there‚Äôs too many healers. So keep that in mind.

He‚Äôs a private server loser, of course he has no idea how anything outside leveling works. Stop trusting ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù.

Without trinkets, a rogue can sap a priest and wait out the duration of their shield. Then stunlock them.

Once trinkets come out, things will change.

Log onto retail as horde. Queue BGs as horde. Wait in queue as horde. The same thing is going to happen in classic. Dont be delusional.

Is OP not a victim? Is this not victim blaming? Who cares if it's some pixels in a video game or not.  It's the same exact concept.  Victim blaming doesn't only  occur in rape or murder cases.  It happens all the time.

&gt; Sure, but then that would go against #nochanges. If they didn't ban for it in vanilla then they probably won't ban for it now. And if it's not bannable, **then it's just an exploit.**

Yeah, I know. Full DM east run is different from 3man DM east jump run. I just want to clarify that for you. The guy above said that it can be done 8-12 mins but it's technically not a full run.

Im on a PvE server, so i definitely want BGs sooner rather than later.
---
I dont even plan on PvPing nearly as much as i did in the past, but here and there theyre a nice change of pace.  Also fun on alts to break up leveling a bit.
---
Do you want to heal or dps in raids? Raid tanking won't be a thing because you'll be too late and there too much competition for those spots.

I'd go a shadow priest for great PvP and being able to get into healing spots.

Grats man, I've been getting 92 and up. I'm upset cuz I had a chance for as 98% on ragnaros but got knocked around a bit and the fight was a little longer than normal. But at my peak I was just pushing past 500 dps. Do you run 1 gear set or multiple for fights?

So the theory is if you're new, you aren't getting any BoP items, but at the end of the raid you acquire a few hundred gold to maintain for the next raid?
---
Pretty much the 2nd most important item for elemental shaman PvP after epic mount. Warrior's arcanite reaper (if he does not get a better weapon somewhere else) is the shaman's hand. 
---
In wPvP you are pretty much always snared by some bullshit ability. Seeing how insignia is 5min CD and FAPs cost 2-3gold a pop, winning fights without going the extra mile is totally worth it. 
---
Even more important without engineering, because shamans have zero gap openers without engineering, therefore you will have to fight more often in melee range.
---
Already fixed, thank you.

Not at all.

This guy would probably be a loser if he wasn't able to make a living streaming and he knows it, it's what feeds the insecurity that feeds his ego, making him an even shittier person.
---
MS&gt;OS +1, or GDKP are my two favorite, personally.
---
For Raids that are mostly guild run, GDKP is the most interesting and prevents drama -- MS&gt;OS +1 is the simplest and most fair for distributing items without an internal DKP or loot council.
---
Nice one dude.
---
We have 3 phases in bidding, first it goes for normal price and you bid your DKP, then it goes into PvP/offspec where it's cheaper, then it goes up for raid roll or roll between class. There is also decay which actually makes people bid even on PvP gear as if you hoard to much DKP, you will lose more in long run that getting small upgrades.
---
Semp my friend I will always be there when you need a heal... Or pots, or whatever :P
---
Absolutely. I don't get people who opted to play on streamer servers and are confused at them acting exactly like you'd expect a streamer to act. Views are everything to them.
---
Never even heard of the guy, until now.  And yes, I will agree he is a douchebag.  Then again, I think most of the people who play on Faerlina probably fall under that category.
---
Not downplaying streaming as a career, but he clearly lucked into his current position. He has been staying home playing video games all day until he went "viral." He's not like any of the hard working content creators/streamers and I think a distinction between lazy nerds like him and successful full time streamers should be made.
---
I don't remember people being banned in Vanilla and there were definitely a lot of ninjas, but maybe I just didn't encounter an incident with enough reports.
---
Guy even looks like a greasy loser
---
I mean even if you weren't invested in a server if you're with a large group of like-minded people and the choice to transfer would literally fracture the group, well guess what that groups not leaving.

My guild on Stalagg is the direct result of that scenario, now we have committed and will suffer the ensuing consequences.

Cats can't learn charge. Abilities are pet-type specific.

if you mean well made from an aesthetic/design perspective, sure, but you'll have a hard time finding people that will agree that ally city placement is better in classic. horde tend to dominate the center of zones while the alliance are sequestered in castles or islands in the far corners of zones. feralas and desolace are two particularity egregious examples. funnily, the one zone where alliance have a horde style hole in the ground in center zone is arathi, and that one ends up sending you far east or west anyway for most quests

Ashenvale is BiS zone. Very underrated.
---
Follows the ancient proverb "don't be an asshole."
---
Is that why the major faction imbalances on many realms were caused by alliance players fleeing to servers with massive alliance majorities?
---
&gt;he's a sociopath  
---
&gt;it's just a video game so doesn't matter
---
pick one
---
Oh, I figured he said some Gamer Words
---
Prove to me no one else on this list posted something on reddit and I will reward you
---
Oh wait, you have no way of knowing that! You arejust an ass!
---
He just got rekt
---
Damn he actually thought he had a chance? Thot was just using his flavor-of-the-month status to get some exposure. Surely he didn‚Äôt think he had a chance... lol üòÇ
---
Not at all. I just emailed his sponsors and got my guild to as well.
---
This man deserves it tbh.
---
Any evidence to back up the ban claim? I don't see how getting reckoning stacks is toxic. 
---
I also dont think its fair to say these two are the same when they're completely different personalities.  
---
Did you watch one Esfand clip and write him off?
---
Ooof my bad man! I read that out of context lmao. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This needs to be higher, fucking right @method good for you guys
---
fact chat is saying ninja for drama doesn't really help.
---
backpeddaling in mythic retail raids is fine, it's required for precise movement on some mechanics.  such a dumb buzzword people use.
---
If I were to roll a warrior I would probably do DPS with a off tanking gear set of course. I know PvP will be huge in the later phases.
---
This is how society works. Public shame is powerful.
---
better for who? spastic kid with ocd that lives in theoryland maybe
---
99% of the time the riding skill on gloves will be more useful than agi for a healer / caster
---
i'd even enchant advanced herbalism over +7 agi, because there is a bigger chance I will get a black lotus spawn on me while going to MC through Burning Steppes and win a contest with non-guildie lotus farmer just because he fails to loot it and I don't, than me saving a raid with a dodge from that extra agility :)
---
Yeah, but Ion is terrible with some Kavorka Man-like charisma where even CMs fired defend him awkwardly like an abused spouse or molested child.
---
Yup, just had over 20 people send in emails and am spamming to our server to do the same :)
---
Because it may mislead some people. Novice dungeon groups would tripple the time of the veterans.
---
He just got rekt 
---

---
I don't support Method in any way, but this is well play by them. +1 from me
---
Nonono, it's a goblin from FFXI.
---
Oh shit I had no idea, thanks!
---
I thought there was a lack of healer classes that was my whole idea behind wanting to roll a priest because of how easy it is.
---
"They think i care about my reputation on an american server"
---
So.   Hows that workin out for you now?
---
Glorious.
---
BRD pick pocketing.
---
Okay I'll bite. How do you get your figures? 
---
Even if every single one of his viewers sub to him, that's 3.5k a month. 
---
Then a couple of donations here and there, let's say 10k a year. 
---
Even in that extreme edge-case, he barely breaks 50k a year. Where are you getting 100k?
---
If you are trying to report this scumbag make sure he posted the loot rules in Blizzard chats you'll have a really hard time even though there's video evidence.
---
I'm about to get to 60 and I don't even want to imagine the crap I'm going to have to face.
---
UD rogues will demolish most clothies while leveling if they‚Äôre well geared. 
---
Spriests dumpster rogues... when they‚Äôre actually talented for it. Until then, it‚Äôs pretty annoying especially if you‚Äôre outleveled or outgeared or outnumbered. Not much you can do if you don‚Äôt have a pws on, are missing 25% stun resistance, and can‚Äôt get rogue off of you thanks to WOTF.
---
I saw a clip of him dinging 60 and knew in about 4 seconds that he was a giant wanker.
---
Why even group with people like that. They are sociopaths. Nothing good will ever happen.
---
Sounds like a "You promised me loot, I want my lootz NAo" kinda situation. 
---
in all seriousness, you did what is best for the whole and that really matters. I think your friends are having power issues since in your guild they were officers and now they're not. They may feel that they're wasting their time raiding with ppl they dont know. Well then start to get to know them.
---
&gt; Yes, it absolutely is reflected in the numbers! Read the damn post lol. If you plug in low H, you'll note that H is incredibly important. If you plug in high H, it shifts to int. That's the part that people miss; int becomes more important as H gets large. For instance:
---
You're only comparing a single rank of healing against itself. You are not comparing one rank of healing to another rank of healing - which is where downranking comes into play. The lower you can effectively downrank, the more efficient those surfaces you're mapping become.
---
Imagine for a moment you have a choice of becoming a stevedore or a doctor. Clearly, you'd maximize your income by becoming a doctor. But what if I told you that you lived in Lagos (where incomes in general are low) and you had a much better chance of immigrating to Paris (where incomes in general are high) if you were a stevedore? Then your strategy changes - it might well be that a stevedore in Paris makes more money than a doctor in Lagos.
---
That's precisely what is happening here. +healing allows you to make that discrete shift while intelligence does not. So even though you might cast more heals of a given rank by increasing intelligence over +healing, increasing your +healing means that you end up in a different place where both +healing and intelligence are more efficient than they are in your current phase.
---
Note also that you're seriously low-balling your available mana. With 5000 base mana, 1800 from potion, 1200 from rune you're at your supposedly extreme outlier of 8000 mana already. You haven't even taken into account your mana regen, flasks, Innervate, Wisdom/Mana Tide, or the weapon swap trick I mentioned.
---
Now, if you're not pressured for mana, you're not going to use all of that. But if you're not pressured for mana, you don't need Intelligence either.
---
been at this 15 years, to them it's just the small dopamine rush of "fresh lootz" that only lasts a few seconds at a time, till they want the next one
---
Hey OP I can‚Äôt believe this happened to you and it‚Äôs crazy how big this has blown up! This is so toxic it‚Äôs crazy . Not that it really matters , but is there anyway you could post a screenshot of your WoW character or maybe DM it to me. Your post history is mostly Fortnite related so I was just wanting to see it since you portrayed yourself as a member of the raid in your post.
---
&gt; Amongst other things I seen, Venruki also exploits pathing to farm ZF on his stream.
---
Showcasing exploits on your stream is filth.  I stand by that comment.  I never said he was selfish, and the raids he leads he expressly tells people ahead of time the items he will take, but he does pay them for it.
---
Out of the popular classic streamers, I honestly like Venruki the most.  I will however say he keeps shitty company, and exploiting is a no-no.  Showing people how to cheat is really bad.  Imagine if I showed people how to bot on my stream?  I mean its cool, others do it, and Blizzard rarely bans for it if you do it smartly.
---
Players of whatever faction have the least logged in will get moved to the front of the queue.
---
Can you send me a sixty upgrades link and your talent build I'm curious.
---
They are both easy, it's an MMO, the core gameplay is designed from the inside out to be trivially difficult to appeal to the most people possible. Arguing about which is harder is so, so irrelevant:
---
Classic is not challenging, retail is not challenging. 
---
~15 year raid leader and MT of cutting edge guilds from year 1, the game has never been hard.
---
Play with streamers, get fucked.
---
You're surprised why?
---
Ninja looting is absolutely punishable by Blizzard. Especially when its as fucking overt as this shit.
---
Aight well if you see me outside org challenge me to a duel haha
---
When he got first he acted like a manchild arrogant asshole. Did we see the same thing?
---
Lmao, shouldn‚Äôt we be able to go anywhere we want in the world and the multi billion dollar company we pay a subscription to should be able to support those activities, wherever or whatever they may be? Seems like that‚Äôs how it should be.
---
another fanboi trying to justify a toxic streamer's behavior lmao
---
It was pretty full there yesterday afternoon when we were dropping Ony buff!  Much more so than usual. But we were only really layered because of the size of alliance on our server to begin with so I didn't expect much on horde aside from common gathering times like that.
---
I don‚Äôt care for most streamers myself, mainly because it attracts competitive assholes. I also realize though that all streamers don‚Äôt fall into that category though. I will say one thing though, if you get killed in a game because someone is watching your stream it‚Äôs your own fault. People shouldn‚Äôt be punished because you announce to the world what you are doing online. Seeing people like Ninja reporting instantly when someone kills them for stream watching is bullshit and it kills me that the game makers actually listen to his ass.
---
Who hurt you bro?
---
fix it
---
That hungry for loot, off that boss...
---
Join the bandwagon. He clearly ninja'd that loot. Shit on him or we all shit on you united
---
Is the priest class group shadow protection book (i.e. like prayer of fortitude, but for the shadow protection buff) in the game yet? I have not seen a single priest putting it out yet.
---
And if not yet, when/where does it drop?
---
Sonii is great too
---
I think it's funny that you all got this mad about this ninja. If you play classic wow on faerlina you should expect this to happen. Streamers literally run shameless raids all the time in this server and take all pieces of gear. The only mistake that was made here is joining the raid in the first place expecting any loot. It fascinated me how anyone could play on Faerlina and then get pissed at how streamers act. Just server transfer if you can't handle it.
---
Does dark iron residue do nothing past honoured?
---
It was well over 16 hours per day. It was like 9 hours of break in 3 days or whatever
---
I can help you start out on Grobb Horde. Send you some bags and gold to help make the transition less rough. Just PM if you decide to move.
---
I assume you're a raid healer with  MC experience.
---
+healing is more important than a large mana pool in MC specifally because the quality of a heal is more mana efficient than several heals with less impact.
---
This comment is so incredibly clueless it hurts...
---
That‚Äôs not a skill element at all. Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre watching for that when you vanish.
---
Well they‚Äôve now [terminated](https://twitter.com/methodgg/status/1194733591537897472?s=21)  his contract.
---
They formed during BC, they also started on Alleria (sp?). They eventually transferred during Naxx in wrath because of server lag. They disbanded during Cata, and they tried to reform on Stormrage in Legion.
---
He was kicked from the twitter team. He was only suspended from Method "Pending Investigation".
---
Seconded for Smolderweb. 40K or so population so no queues but healthy economy and active PvE. 47% Ally vs 53% horde, pretty balanced for PvP server.
---
Nope. Maltese bro here. Meth is pretty much non-existent here. Adderall is extremely hard to obtain.  
---
Some of us are just very, very high-wired. We have a lot of pressure to be successful at what we're at + internalised inferiority complexes due to being ex-colonies so we tend to overcompensate.
---
How so? Sure looks like that's what they did.
---
I'm more shocked they kicked him out since methodjosh was way more toxic and he's still in.
---
First exposure too and dudes an annoying dork
---
All I need now is to hear that JokerD is banned from Classic!  Thanks for sharing this.
---
Anyone who thinks that APES would even come close to a top guild like Limit or Method is out of their mind. There's nothing in Classic that requires even a fraction of the mechanical skill needed to clear Mythic content. Look at how fucked fights like Mythic Kil'jaeden are, it was basically unbeatable when Method first started clearing it.
---
Classic is entirely about planning/organization. This is an accomplishment on it's own, but It's much, much easier to plan for a "solved" version of the game. Every tier in Retail has it's own insane gear/azerite/mats/professions requirements that takes a world of planning and guesswork to try to increase your chances at clearing content. Look at videos detailing Scrype's organization going into 8.1, where they basically bought out 3 server's economy of mats to craft marginal benefits for their whole raid team.
---
Horde - undead, for cannibalize or tauren for druid
---
Alliance - night elf for druid
---
 Great thanks, didn't even know you could do this with Weakauraa, I only uaed it so far for dot tracking.
---
Btw why do you have the stopmacro command? What does it contribute?
---
Difficulty is subjective. For reference my guild had exactly one dungeon grinding group that pulled the hours needed to hit 60ish in week 1, my guild cleared MC during week 2 so I do have some inkling as to what's required.
---
By far the most demanding requirement for pulling off what Apes did is time and dedication.
---
Grinding dungeons is not particularly difficult, you don't need months and months of practice to be able to grind dungeon A, then dungeon B, then dungeon C etc. The most important thing you need are dedicated people to put in the obscene amount of time needed to hit 60 (or close to it) so early. Most people just don't do it because they either can't (they have RL obligations) or they have no desire to do so.
---
After that comes the attunements which are not difficult. They are very simple quest chains that also don't need months of practice.
---
Then comes the rep grind which again, is extremely mindless and easy.
---
After that it's MC which, yet again, is not a very difficult raid. In fact it's quite an easy raid which doesn't require months and months of practice to do.
---
So ultimately the biggest challenge in doing what Apes did was simply getting enough people to commit their time to do what they did. If you want to equate that to difficulty than so be it, I'll agree that what they did was difficult but I have no desire to argue semantics.
---
Depends on your gear. Of course locks are great at PVP, hunters are always able to kite and use traps. A hunter can also kill a warlock on PVP, if you have broken tooth for example the push back on casters is oppressive.
---
Dude who the hell cares?
---
Hahahahaha
---
Yup Zizaran streamed 120ish hours every league start in poe, it's definitely doable.
---
Shadowfang Keep 20 to 50 minutes?  Not a chance.  They have it the same as Stockades which isn't even close.
---
lol keep the streamer worship culture going guys. Working so well for you!
---
Method dropped him.
---
Fair enough, I was speaking from a purely PvE perspective.
---
not for a pvp priest
---
Tanking isn‚Äôt hard lol. Bleeding edge is hard.
---
&gt;To be frank I don‚Äôt give a shit what the alliance players do
---
Pretty much sums up your argument. 
---
Have fun on your pve realm
---
Seems very possible to do. Especially since he has been doing it for years. He may be an idiot but he wasn‚Äôt some bad gamer who cheated his way to 60
---
You need to chill out.
---
Diplomacy is a sweet deal for sure, and wisp form is underappreciated
---
I guess maybe victim wasn‚Äôt correct even tho some of his comments maybe seemed that way to me. I was just genuinely curious because he specifically stated he was one of the people in the raid in his post. It doesn‚Äôt matter, but I was genuinely curious because of all the attention this has received (and the real world consequences that came about from it)
---
This shit has made me genuinely laugh tho. It is great entertainment
---
&gt;  it has a skill element as well, as you have to time the cast well 
---
The problem is WoW isn't the game for this kind of skill expression, WoW is for reacting to the current situation within the GCD, it isn't a timed/skill-shot game.
---
Um. You don‚Äôt need a key for dm east. Just north and west. Otherwise I agree. Keys waste so much space that I miss having in my bags or the bank.
---
That's what you get for playing on faerlina and joining streamer pugs, double fuck you, it's not my opinion it's fact. His raid his loot, make your own if you want some. Honestly what did you think was gonna happen? He was talking about that staff a few days before the raid, so what if it's an asshole move, atleast in the future he can't ninja it. I wouldn't nor have I ninjad before but reserve hell yea, he just pulled a sneaky on you. Anyway thanks for being in these raids so I have something to watch while playing on a non streamer server.
---
I only know countdown to classic
---
Right. Especially since he is someone who has leveled to 60 many times since private servers got shut down like crazy. I don‚Äôt see how people still think he cheated.
---
Chances are ppl just uses TB port after Rag to do Ony.
---
our lives are spiraling out of control haha
---
and you guys have no idea who reported him... so he is still in your guild :)
---
Going to even try to explain why? The maths and its implications are pretty straightforward.
---
His dad tried getting him to move out on stream one time
---
Sorry I meant DMN
---
Idk the company he keeps besides Zuco.  I mainly watch him on YT.
---
We can just end this civily, and agree to disagree.
---
I don't exactly agree that promoting a bot is equivalent to showcasing the ZF farm.  Mainly because you still are required to put in a ton of work, where as a bot is some 3rd program running to actually play the game for you.  You can farm ZF successfully without the path exploit.  The exploit just makes it easier.
---
Frost always seems to be humble bragging in every video or stream i ever see of the dude, he seems right around the corner from being just another cancer streamer
---
I'm sitting at physio, and this song started playing, I'm creeped out
---
&gt;  sponsor money 
---
What makes you think Method was paying him anything?
---
Right for the first time in almost 2 months and we haven't had layers for a month
---
Ok zoomer.
---
That is just perfect.
---
Arrogant PoS had it coming.
---
I'm sure they can take action on someone "public" like this, who entice others to do the same
---
Josh pretends to be a character though
---
Yeah stalagg wasn't layered
---
Please stop. real WoW players dont give a f%\^k about streamers
---
Talking to guildies. Most of us agree TBC was best wow. Some will likely drop off after TBC. most will drop off after wotlk. 
---
I and several I have talked to think TBC+. Is the way to go. Classic is great but for me the class and raid balance is just better in tbc.
---
Goblin boots are faster with a shorter cooldown, but goblin boots don't destruct when they malfunction.
---
Is that really so hard to believe?
---
For a PVP server, very even
---
People love people like him for reasons I dunno why
---
Probably thinking that threatening to stop playing will get them to fix it.
---
Didn't work out.
---
I don't really care how you want to define it, my point was the race for MC/Ony will have been **more** interesting than the other raid races. The degree of interest you (or anyone else since it's entirely subjective) want to give to those wasn't really the point.
---
46 minutes ago, checking in with an updoot
---
Not sure which post you read, because the one I read the OP didn't seem too affected beyond "this guy did this shitty thing and no one has mentioned it, so I guess I will." Not sure where he was the victim in the whole thing.
---
I don't recall any in game toxicity from Josh. 
---
Just a really creepy IRL person.
---
This post has less to do with the "pixels", and is more about his behavior. This also isn't a wall of text.
---
Good.  What are the chances that he gets banned in-game?
---
All classes are fun, try some different ones play the one you enjoy most
---
Josh also got banned on twitch for his treatment of a female streamer on stream.
---
Much respect toward Method for doing what's right!
---
lmao jokerd is a memelord first and a streamer second, he‚Äôs gonna do anything for the lulz and the views
---
It 100% is that, but that isn't something we can blame on Blizzard so people ignore it.
---
Isn't that the gnome racial? Insurmountable regret?
---
None of it ever was, I didn't say tanking was hard I *specifically* covered how trivial the whole game is by design. Incremental growth is a dopamine treadmill, the foundation of all MMOs.
---
Nobody fucked with his source of income but himself.
---
If only it were 2019 and we would have screenshot technology.
---
This ^
---
Part of the delay with Rend is just waiting for him to show up.  That's probably half the run by itself.
---
DM W on the short end could be like 1H
---
That's not the same context as influencers on social media.  That's just a guide.  If a streamer puts out a build, but also ninja loots, and you use the build and don't ninja loot, congrats you weren't influenced.  That seems to be what OP is talking about.
---
They have had multiple periods of downtime where they have made changes to the server since launch. They refuse to clarify what is and is not a patch and blame players for misinterpreting what they've said.
---
Justice reigns from above!
---
Far as I‚Äôm aware unless there is a log explicitly stating somewhere a policy against ninja‚Äôing, all it fair.
---
It was 3 at launch, EOD. Well that's really your own fault when you knew this would happen. Should have planned better. Now you have long queues:) have fun not playing the game.
---
Sorry I didn't read too much into an already stupid post lol
---
Google is a thing too...
---
Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.
---
Viable for solo play, dungeons, pvp and most of the game? Yes.
---
For raids? Not really.
---
Is there an Addon that allows me to scan my guild/raids‚Äô equipment and push that data to a readable file? Looking for a way to make loot council even more convenient by having my entire raid‚Äôs current equipment at the flip of a ‚Äúswitch‚Äù
---
I had no problem with mine. Worth every penny.
---
Bone is even more resistant then thick skin.  Those are the toughest players.
---
new phone who dis &lt;3
---
Its 2019 grandpa, plenty of people are fairly famous for playing video games for a living.
---
Not sure why this matters? There's video of the event. 
---
Why does the OP need to expose his character to potential hate from joker himself or his fans over this?
---
It's not a he said/she said argument there's a video of it happening...
---
Replying to this because someone probably went to the effort to downvote this post (it could also have been Reddit's anti-bot fudging of votes). I at first said "I think a 50.5% chance", which I got from 51/101, but then realized how to do it correctly. I just calculated the 1-500 portion of the 1-510 roll as a 50% chance of winning, so 0.5√ó50√∑51+1√∑51 = 0.5098. If you account for the tied rolls, I think you should get the same result from summing the series.
---
You really think 2019/2020 Blizzard isn't going to give people transfers off dead servers?
---
Your comment history is 0 posts in the last year except for all of a sudden you're all over this issue asking for personal details about this guy who made this post.
---
That reeks of sock puppet to me.
---
QQ
---
Oh, so it's something that will happen every few hours for a few minutes? And people are mad that it lags during these times? Simple, stay away from the mess and play without the buff, or deal with the spike in lag so you can have the buff. Pretty simple.
---
Weapons would finally become more than just stat sticks
---
I would still put a full run at like an hour tops.
---
world record speedruns on retail last like 15 hours lmao
---
The short answer is 'Yes'.
---
Shaman are the ultimate utility. Their totems can help with pretty much any problem that gets thrown at you. Multiple shaman can use multiple, different, totems - so for example you can get Grace of Air for more crits and more dodge *and* Windfury for more attacks.
---
While other classes can tank, heal and dps better than a shaman, a shaman can switch between these roles in one fight (although, generally, shamans are regarded as offtanks or emergency tanks after 40 or so).
---
It's a very fun class, in short.
---
But you should know that, in raids, most shamans heal.
---
While few people would disagree that guild runs are great it should be possible to get a decent gaming experience when not in a guild. There are plenty of reasonable real life reasons to pug, perhaps someone missed the scheduled guild raid days because of other commitments or someone is not currently in a guild and so on.
---
It lets me hold alt to just use the potion without doing any of the cast sequence stuff.  Basically and oh shit button if something goes wrong.  I really want the macro to use the healthstone if I have one and the potion if I don't but blizzard doesn't let you make decisions like that in a macro.  The castsequence is close, but it can get messed up in certain situations (spamming the button, loading into zones and such while the timer is ticking, etc).  It just gives me a way to get a potion regardless of what the castsequence is up to.
---
&gt;And fck Method.
---
Calm down, it came out now that he has been removed but even so, why so hostile before anything has happened.
---
50k isn't much if you aren't getting full time benefits. And you're playing WoW full time on camera. Not the worst way to make a living I guess, but fuck that'd get old real quick.
---
Haha joker you fucking cunt. Bet you didn't think that would happen. Pleb
---
Imagine caring this much
---
I know about it. I reserved names too. But I'm not gonna stay on a server for a dumb name, I'm not that stupid. If rather play the game without queues
---
by wearing the method tag he's providing advertising for the method brand, they're obviously paying him.
---
No, they literally never did this. I watched multiple bosses get ninja'd over the years during vanilla, Domo chests, Nef loot, probably almost every boss of every instance up to AQ. They never, and I mean never, ever took action based on any tickets made in-game to redistribute loot. 
---
The only cases they did this was when due to a server/game system issue loot was 'lost', and that was extremely seldom, often they would basically say 'tough luck, but it's our policy not to do this'.
---
Arcanite Reaper:
---
1) I've rarely had problems during my leveling of finding a group to run the dungeon I want
---
2) The economy does need work. It's not awful, but it's nowhere near as vibrant as the mega servers
---
3) All of our major guilds have completed all raid content, and new guilds pop up every so often as more people reach max level. My guild clears Ony and MC in 2 hours flat on raid nights, and many guilds have multiple raid groups.
---
Your definition of "dead server" is absolutely on point and rational. But it doesn't apply to mine. We're not huge with queue times or anything, but we're not on the verge of collapse either. We could just use more people.
---
Lmao, whats up eith you losers taking the piss out of someone for living with their parents. Nothing wrong with that
---
I don‚Äôt think I am qualified to describe the impulses inside our brain which make us feel certain ways about stuff that happen
---
Always upvote John Maynard.
---
That needs a NSFW tag mate
---
Just think, that‚Äôs what one part of [Pamela‚Äôs doll](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5149/pamelas-doll) looks like. Take a look at the head in the link.
---
HANCORK!
---
I agree it's not THAT big of a deal... if he wasn't representing a brand, doing it while streaming live and acting like a complete PoS while doing it.
---
And even then it would've been a shit thing to do.
---
This isn't Skyrim where you steal from an NPC.   
---
Why do so many people feel a disconnect between playing a social game and real people having real feelings? Do you think, just because it's virtual, people stop having emotions? 
---
E-sports is all virtual and broadcastings from the other end of the world and watching people play in an arena is *amazing.* It's just as entertaining as watching people play football.
---
Thank you for the detailed answer!
---
Fuck yeah method.
---
right that's what I mean, there are people who think if hunters grab a leather piece of gear they're going to be banned.
---
I really didn‚Äôt expect that. I know barely anything about Method but my respect for them has certainly gone up.
---
I don't think you have a realistic understanding of how much time the top retail players put into the game when new content comes out. The most time players will put in is at launch (And that's only a couple of weeks of no-lifing it), all these guilds will be fully prepared when new content comes out and it'll be cleared in hours.
---
MethodJosh did a good job of describing What Method did to prepare and compete for one of the early BFA raids.
---
You talk about comparing top retail players and classic players so go ahead, give me some factual, data-driven comparisons
---
The list has always been small.  The largest group they ever had was back in TBC / WOTLK when they had 2 groups of GMs handling the bot reports.  After Activision got its claws into Blizzard that all went down hill.
---
Yeah Method literally didn't have an actual guild lol, they paid a few streamers to play Classic with their names.
---
Sorry, I upset you...
---
Yeah I leveled mining just for this, 100% worth.
---
For last boss I just jump to the tiny ledge directly to the right of the tunnel, which evades everything. Then I shadowmeld and use invis pot to sneak inside, without shadowmeld you'd have to time the pot more carefully but it's still doable. Even if it's 3 melee lashers, it takes too long for me to kill it (once the boss is low HP it starts moving very slowly so it's always out of reach) so I don't bother.
---
Yeah I dunno what that guy up top is talking about. Sco and their leaders have worked their fucking asses off to build that brand and image, and in the last couple years it's finally started paying off. Why the hell wouldn't they care?
---
shit, you and me both bud
---
directionless and untethered since birth
---
Can someone explain to me the cosequences of this? Is it a big deal? Will this affect his bottom line somehow?
---
Cdew - god tier PvPer and also some farming on his hunter
---
I went with a Claw for a more manual approach. I have neither Claw or Screech on auto-cast and simply cast the one for the more appropriate situation.
---
I am smart enough to know there are smarter people than I.  While I am not in that 80%, there are definitely tons of people smarter than myself.
---
When AV battles were real battles, the Horde strategy was to let Allies take Snowfall so that we could take Stonehearth with little resistance. This was the beginning of the two sides skipping each other which in my book was never right. I wanted mass battles everywhere. So every AV game, while Horde were yelling to not take Snowfall, that's exactly what my brother and I would go do. The best part was, we'd immediately start yelling in chat "What idiot took Snowfall?!" "Holy crap who is really that stupid!!" and other things; laughing our asses off as we moved south to harass the Ally offensive. Killing NPCs is not the fun part of AV.

Ah, for some reason you can only curse poisons with the totem.

Ride to the raid instance faster.

I believe you, I really do.
---
Those are smooth runs time, if you're with unexperienced players  it will take much more time than this
---
Wand is only affected by talents
---
LOL Thanks. I definitely didn't mean to put that. Posting from my phone and I swear autocorrect plus typos puts in the weirdest shit.
---
tbf that‚Äôs pretty funny to be spamming arcane missiles in mc lmao
---
Just a pointless comment mate.
---
Out of curiosity, how long does it take you to settle loot usually? Also is there any particular reason you don't distribute gold after each boss, so people have more to spend on the remaining ones, other than it being a hassle?
---
Jokerd honestly just seems like such a dickhead, so nothing of value lost
---
The guy lost his "career" over his own behavior, but you put your own twist on it however you like
---
Clip?
---
Well, you have to lack empathy, else you would think to yourself: How would the others feel if I do this? How would I feel if somebody else does this to me?   
---
Either he actually lacks emotions which is concerning or he does revel in hurting others. Both emotions or the lack of are nothing to be proud of and rather frigthening.
---
no, what I was saying was that verbal agreements in game are not enforceable by GM's with regard to loot or literally anything else. Their stance is that the community polices itself when it comes to conduct related to loot or raid mats etc. They literally wont do anything under any circumstance.
---
No. Rogues do not do well against plate wearing classes.
---
Should just reduce the detection range.
---
Also gives armor.
---
He did announce in LFG channels when he was LFMing though that "NO LOOT RES"
---
*A flip scare.
---
That was part of MC which is why it had a shred of more interest than any of the other raids will. Yea they did it in 5 days, everything else will be cleared in under 5 hows, it's not a matter of when a guild will clear the new raids, it's a matter of who will do it the fastest the moment it releases.
---
Now I will add that what's interesting and what's boring is subjective, the only thing I was trying to illustrate is that MC/Ony will be the only Classic raids that have an additional component to the competition which is why they will be unique.
---
Break a contract and it will have consequences. Kid gets what he deserves. This is called real life.
---
He's a baby but that's also a pvp item that should probably be open to healers and DPS. Green +specific spell type items better for casters.
---
Ironic...
---
People follow streamers that resemble themselves
---
he got fucking kicked. I love it!
---
hes only suspended though, they may just be doing it for their image until it blows over
---
\&gt;bad habits
---
\&gt;videogames
---
Huh?
---
Im not agreeing or disagreeing with the sentiment.  I was pointing out the original poster said they got a ban overturned with a post from discord, but the responder said blizzard wouldn't ban based on discord.  They're saying two different things.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ddXt0p1.jpg
---
Considering his location, it's highly unlikely.
---
If all you have at that age is a video game, you need to maybe be on less and expand a bit. Especially if your a little prick. WoW isn't likely going to make him any better of a person.
---
I tried levelling a pet at 60, it's legit painful.
---
Why does it matter who posted something, especially when it's stuff that's completely verifiable? What I'm reading is essentially a "let's find the whistleblower" series of posts. 
---
And the 'lost his career' bit has to be a joke.
---
&gt; me he streamed the whole thing and did not use layers?
---
He abused the shit out of layers for the last few levels that's for sure, not sure from when though.
---
he also "streamed the whole" thing but spent hours with mic muted and no camera so it literally could have been anyone behind the keyboard and it was kinda suspicious
---
Depends on the guild imo. If you can get away with slacking and not using consumables while clearing the raids still, you'll make out with 20-30g I think. Obviously shit compared to GDKP but it's not nothing.
---
I think I like the gold one tbh. Only downsides I can think of is it encourages gold buying it perhaps people scrimping on consumables.
---
 Ahahahaha byeeeeee
---
In America, if you haven't pulled yourself up from your boot straps by 20 you are nothing.
---
only if you pre ordered the expensive version right ?
---
This is such a fucking creepy comment.
---
I wouldn't horde any of the DM books. DM farms are very common, and they're found quite frequently in these farms. As more and more of these books enter the market, they'll become less and less valuable, because people only ever need to use at most one book per character.
---
Honestly, the shit Joker pulled sounds like most Twitch Streamers on WoW outside of a professional team. They ninja shit all the time just to get reactions/draw crowds, and while some might say this is a true classic experience where some ninja steals shit and dips out, its honestly just pathetic seeing people above the age of 20 pulling this crap cause they "Do it for the views".
---
Noooo this man
---
Server vs faction aside, you realize retail still has far, far more players which is going to influence que times. Classic will have shorter ques because there are fewer players queuing. 
---
Plus the Horde vs Alliance split is probably even worse on retail due to Mythic raiding being Horde dominated.
---
Pointless comments attract more pointless comments. Shock horror. Go be a wannabe internet janitor somewhere else mate. No rules were broken.
---
Enjoy you purple piece of pixel you piece of garbage
---
I was hoping his account had been suspended, not just suspended from Method.
---
That‚Äôs how I feel about humans
---
Not trying to accomplish anything just saw this drama from a game that I didn‚Äôt realize had this much and I was shocked I guess. Normally there‚Äôs some like I was ‚Äúx member or person‚Äù on posts like this so I was curious. There was a situation like this involving the GM of the Toronto Raptors in the NBA finals last year so that‚Äôs why I was asking.
---
Ew, not even a mageblade?  Actually vendor junk
---
Technically Auberdine is a better solo levelling zone but I find it really dull. I usually migrate to Westfall for the deadmines questline.
---
ohhh shit son!
---
"massive drama" you mean the prepackaged content they made together?
---
He's not a pserver player though?
---
He hardly ever played pservers other than launch for server first 60 lmao. He's lootwhoring because he became huge out of nowhere and it's good attention.
---
You can ask people in those guilds when they raid, not like it has to be kept secret
---
I pick whatever lets me breathe underwater. I get turned around way too often and drown.
---
It‚Äôs not even the sword. What an idiot. Hope he never raids again.
---
*Server First
---
That's not the way to solve the problem. What you do is that you widen/legnthen the talent trees and balance existing talents so there are more decisions to be taken when going down a tree.
---
You don't remove everything and call it a day.
---
Zero
---
Do you really think it's more probable that Blizzard is CHOOSING to abstain from correcting an issue rather than fixing something that gets daily complaints?
---
Well they are but warriors and rogues do more dmg
---
not only that, but people seem to forget that the servers werent run from a guys basement, they were rented out of multi million and multibillion dollar MSPs and other server maintenance companies. I agree its bad but ive seen "ran out of a guys basement" so many times and its just blatantly not true
---
And beaten by &lt;Progress&gt; - Firemaw EU, as expected.
---
Exactly.
---
Self awareness is not your strong suit.
---
Well he did become a twitch sponsor this month so at least he got that going for him.
---
Sorry I don't play the game but I love reading about it. Could you briefly explain what ninja-ing an item mean?
---
They‚Äôre not even that OP in PvP. Well, I‚Äôve never gone against one with full gear but...
---
Anyway. They‚Äôre disgusting in PvE. No other DPS class can match their damage with the exception of Fury Warrior and even then Fury doesnt have 3 different means of reducing or wiping threat completely.
---
My definite does apply to you,  I‚Äôm sorry if the truth hurts. Your counter point 3 did not even address my point at all, I never said there would t be guilds clearing MC. Of course there there will a small handful guilds on each faction clearing MC, the easiest raid in this game, also at the highest player base since the game just came out. My whole point is when player base drops with time, recruitment will be needed. Having more players to recruit from is better with more numbers. The few people raider through 6 phases on your dead server will not be wanting to move guilds on your small server so easily. Do I want your server to be dead, 0%, I want blizzard to take better measures to balance serves with faction as well as size. But it‚Äôs hard when the base isn‚Äôt willing and the changes themselves take time to implement
---
Is no one going to talk about everyone in his Twitch chat encouraging him to take it? What a fucking toxic community, holy crap.
---
Mines been doing the same thing or sometimes when I send my suc to attack she gets right next to the mob then runs back without attacking.
---
Record is beaten by EU guild already buddy
---
I make 60 gph from selling loot to vendor. Each run is roughly 18-20g flat. 
---
My last run I sold 2 items for 70g + vendor trash it was 85g from a 20 min run. Plus 2 vendor runs =125g for that hour not including health and mana pots.
---
Mana and health pots alone make up about 30gph.
---
I may be mistaken but I believe atm there are no beneficial og love enchants to gloves anyway... i think a non-combat enchant is typical atm
---
Good job, Method. +1 respect for not tolerating such awful behavior in your ranks.
---
Uh, no?
---
Candy Crush is a casual game. WoW isn't, at all.
---
What if I told you that you were influenced by people around you too? Marketing isn't just a twitch thing...

"Periodic event happening, that brings people from all over the server to one place, affects lag."
---
*shocked Pikachu face
---
It's missing something alright ... endless amounts of frustration at getting ganked when fighting mobs, getting ganged up on by half a dozen players, and of course the very best one, getting repeatedly killed by ?? level players who you stand zero chance against.
---
Here's what no one on PVP servers ever tells you: You can absolutely do world PVP on a PVE server. Either you flag yourself as PVP, or you gather a large group of friends and start attacking enemy faction settlements. Once all the NPCs start dying, you'll often get a response from enemy players trying to protect their quest givers.
---
Basically, PVE servers allow you to CHOOSE when to PVP. Cause sometimes, you had a really had day, you're tired, and you just want to be left in peace. Which is not possible on a PVP server.
---
Each point gives 3 more stealth. 5 stealth=1 level so if you have 5/5 it's like being 3 levels higher than your opponent for purposes of stealth detection.  Some things can also increase their chance to see stealth causing the opposite.
---
Escape artist is subject to pushback which makes it very underwhelming in some situations.
---
Seems like everyone is equally as terrible since no one is the decency to help the guy out with some strategy. Stay awesome internet.

WTF does this sentence (the title) mean in english
---
Maybe he finally start doin real job; like cashier or walmart bag filler
---
He ninjad Staff of Dominance (Most wanted and rare caster item right now) out of MC as a loot master during a raid full of pugs and said he doesnt care about some random noobs.
---
#neverfaerlina
---
No.  Typically my reasons for using a build or playstyle are a result of mathematical verification, not because some brain dead, overrated man-child with no moral compass said it was \[positive slang\].
---
How exactly an individual like this becomes "most watched" in the first place is beyond me.  Effectively all he accomplished was to win a single race.  That's hardly worth of note.
---
That's because they didn't have enough hit gear and we're dual wielding. I can fucking promise you that. A 2hander is going to do more damage with no hit gear. I've been the top DPS warrior on every MC run I've done and I've been dual wield fury every run. Had plenty of arms warriors waste a raid slot with their garbage.
---
Math and logic are completely against arms. Fury attacks more, generated more rage and has death wish for execute phase. You know where warriors shine? Oh ya execute. You pop death wish and execute the last 20% of the boss, you get more rage to spam more execute with 20% extra damage. That alone shits on arms. The only pulls an arms warrior is going to do more damage than a fury warrior on are the like core you d pulls before magamadar cuz they can cleave a bit more.
---
omg dude sacrifice is one of if not the best blessing for PvP noooooo
---
Stop talking out of your ass dickhead.
---
Wand dps?!
---
Rogue is favored against warrior. Garrote into Rupture and then just deadzone.
---
It's ok guys... we get it, there's a lot of ppl when the Onyxia is about to be dropped.. move on
---
It's exactly the same context. That is the whole fucking point of influence.
---
I will give that a go
---
Ask someone for an int buff
---
The dude played on vanilla private servers and raced to 60 over and over again. Just so happens all that wasted time payed off big time when classic dropped
---
That's not true. The reason for his ban is still unknown.
---
My guess would be something related to security checks or data validation.
---
Didn't you just connect directly to the server IP for pservers? Somehow I doubt you're connected directly to the server blade IP in classic.
---
I honestly don't know which is worse, him trying to steal the item or him being so unbelievably stupid as to report you for 'slander'.
---
Servers are indeed dead...
---
But i think, they didnt mean it the way where you get problems, because they are overpopulated and having performance issues.
---
1 hour is normal.  2 hours is not uncommon at all if you do Jandice. 
---
Most groups skip 3/4 bosses (Kirtonos, Jandice, Marduk/Vectus).
---
what did you expect joining a pug with a troll ass twitch streamer as raid lead? this is like crying after putting ur dick in a mouse trap, ur own fault buddy
---
Buffy :)
---
That was private servers only.
---
Sulfuron, the bigegst french realm is "fairly" balanced, like 55/45 for horde Amnemar is much more inbalanced, like 65/35.
---
But the only PVE realm is actually 70/30 for the alliance ! 
---
Orcs and undead racials are just much better in pvp.
---
Blew method partnership in 2 weeks LUL

what patch are we in now? not 1.4 right? People wanted Classic. This is Classic mate.
---
What are you a bot? Are you of such a low intellect you cant respond except for the same few generic comments? Seems I ticked you off.
---
Crying over pixels OMEGALUL
---
The post above you is spot on. SPriests are hybrids. Off heals/bubbles are nice, single target damage is there, but no aoe and we need to drink a lot. 
---
Healers love shadow priests. Tanks are lukewarm at best. Unfortunately, tanks usually drive group comp choices.
---
*Laughs in medium pop server*
---
Nice try Jokerd
---
But they do *taunt*. Pet Intimidation skill for snap taunt, plus growl as a soft taunt. Most leveling hunters run BM and most dungeons are pre-60. Plus a BM pet can generate a crazy amount of threat.
---
If a priest accidentally pulls aggo, they can stop casting and run to me the tank or the hunter and within a few seconds, their aggro has dropped far enough that their mob is *taunted* off of them.
---
Not sure why this is so hard to picture.
---
Start doing arena,  anger, golem runs and some lbrs this well fine toy access to a college pre bis or viable alternative options. Once you hit 57-58 you can do dmw and scholo strat for the others.

You really dont want  people imitating assholes like this one, because they get off scot free.

It isn't about being exempt from \*any\* intellectual influence.  It's about refusing to be influenced by people who's most lofty achievement is limited to a little temporary celebrity.
---
He'll get an apology from the GM and priority for the next good loot.
---
I would hate to think this way. I hope the best for you.
---
How delusional are you?
---
What a guild for the ages. Really respectable of you method. Much love and respect.
---
They don't tho, they dumped him from the twitch team about an hour ago
---
Im surprised there's been so much ninja loot drama and it's only phase 1 loot
---
Fucking Rekt
---
I had a great time through MC and BWL in the original classic when it first game out, and I've realized, I don't get to just do that again. 
---
I played on the unofficial servers and this kind of personality was rampant at end game. You can see this guy's decency fighting with his ego, its all over his face. Then he finds a mental excuse to go on the "offensive" ninja the item and saying, "fuck you!" 
---
Watch out, we got a badass over here with a complete lack of perspective.
---
Of those that went back to classic, and reached end game and went hard thereafter; too many of them have fragile egos entirely tied in with the game, and their character's social status within it.  It's ugly, utterly cringe, and unpleasant to be around. 
---
But to those people: Keep making strides, eVeRyOneS rEaLLY iMpReSsED.
---
Thinking of leveling a hunter for an alt but I'm a little dissuaded by all the people I see pulling aggro with their pet in dungeons.  Do you generally dismiss pet 100 percent of the time in dungeons or is it a situational thing?  Pulling unwanted mobs seems like something I could easily do by accident.
---
Wait what happened to josh?
---
Why would I lie about this? You can probably find him crying about it in his discord videos, he comes back to his computer and he‚Äôs been booted and starts shit talking my guild for kicking him
---
I always thought the difference between influencer and advertiser was the cash payment.
---
So waiting half a second after being hit is impossible? Ok.
---
I sincerely hope you are right but there is a finite amount of content in vanilla.. 
---
It won't last forever. And I doubt blizzard will continue to funnel resources into producing new classic content that is directly competing with retail. Also, I have high hopes that the popularity of classic will steer retail towards being more like classic in design.
---
Jeez, Jokerd is 22 years old afaik. There's few reasonable humans to watch on twitch that is below 30. The rest is as you say, too stupid to understand things not that hard to comprehend.
---
On my server that is by far the least common Enchant (I believe only 2 people have it). I talked to one of them and he bought it for 5k gold. He will only give it to you with a base tip of 20g, but gets tips as high as 50g. 
---
Once the world bosses are out (hopefully tomorrow) this enchant should be somewhat "easier" to obtain and thus the cost/tip may go down.
---
I recently hit 60 on my pally, I‚Äôm holy spec but I skipped holy shock so I could get blessing of sanc and AOE farm and tank five mans. I‚Äôm really enjoying the AOE farm potential, but I don‚Äôt have the best set for it yet, I know I need plate for this, but what stats should I be prioritizing for this set? str? Stam? Int?
---
Quality content
---
ZING!
---
Good morning azeroth is entertaining but I wish there were more of them.
---
No, there was Tier 2.5...
---
PvP on a PvP server that isn‚Äôt happening inside a tiny box with special rules!? Oh noes!
---
As if that would be a reason to pick retail over classic given hundreds of other differences?
---
You want it fixed. I‚Äôm not the one crying.
---
This might be an unpopular opinion but i think it has to do with wow streamer mentality that they are entitled to gear just cause they stream.
---
The arena/anger/golem can be done by 52s yes
---
I mean, she hasn't really said much either. It's not like Josh is being ostracized from society from people who know the full story. Stop talking out of your ass.
---
This is a 15 year old game. Things like this does not happen on retail because blizz have already solved it with personal loot.
---
**For warrior tanks:** is wearing two wrath pieces worth losing out on the 8 piece might bonus? Thoughts?
---
they‚Äôre not. they are ‚Äúcompensating‚Äù him by bringing clicks to his twitch stream only.
---
All starting early really does is let you used your farmed mats for recipes.  But most of that stuff is pretty cheap on the AH.

Yeah definitely rogue. Has a bunch of cc spells, not to mention stealth.

Holy shit, big round of applause for Method.
---
I think the term is used pretty loosely. 
---
The get paid by Method. They have to abide by some rules. They have to use an overlay with Method graphics and ads.
---
Not really no.
---
lol you are the clueless one here
---
Man who plays video games 24/7 and shits in diapers turns out to be an asshole.
---
I find it odd how Jokerd can get suspended for his attitude but Tips Out is completely in the clear. I don't personally think either of them should be suspended, it just makes me wonder how Method evaluates what forms of toxicity are acceptable and which ones aren't.
---
i literally dont understand the question
---
GMA is so hype and nice, all that positivity around the game makes me happy.
---
Kargoz and Defcamp do an awesome job keeping the mood good for the entire segment. 
---
Worth a watch. Even the past ones are brilliant and insightful.
---
\#nochanges
---
They have said and people have posted proof, that they will not be getting involved in any loot issues. Even in retail they most often didnt get involved. Back in cata i had a boe ninjad off me from bot trash, even after specific loot rules were posted. Blizz did nothing about it after i put a ticket in.
---
He was kidding. Come on.
---
Or lack of prowess. Dude is actually bad at the game and people only watch him to see when he dies.
---
Fuck him and many others streamers that act like this. Its a game, play and have fun. No, this fuckers just gotta pull some stupid shit for content.
---
Annnd its gone
---
People should be telling you how *not* to be a "bad priest" instead of just being cringy neckbeard fucks saying "lul if you can't win as spriest then ur just bad xD UwU!1!11!!"
---
Most players did not play on a private server for 10 years, we can't know everything. It's like if a NASCAR driver went up to a kid who just got his learner's permit and called him a scrub.

Do you need the gold?  Then sell them.  Are you in a guild you like?  Then sell them to a tank that needs them in guild.
---
kromcrush is 58-42 horde. We have a decent advantage but not as big as some other servers.

Do the warriors really have to be told to execute?

That's nice and all on paper but pre-casting and cancelling isn't always optimal depending on your tank. You'll see tanks with all kinds of gear, with weird builds sometimes (newer players).
---
We have different playstyles. Mine has worked for me since vanilla, and I'm sure it'll continue to work. There's no perfect way to play when leveling, there are so many variables.

Joker got kicked from Method an hour ago.

&gt; Never any serious bid

Minus all the shittalk sco, rogerbrown, and a few other officers were talking about 'how easy it will be to get the first 60s'
---
Minus the massive amount of money they spent on a studio and literal hosts to talk over their power leveling.
---
You know if you just ignore THAT STUFF yeah. No serious bid at all.

Thanks @method , you guys are a glue that hold us together and allot of people look up to you, handling this in this manner is all we could ever ask. There is a reason you guys are so well respected.

From reading the life at 60 thread, lock sounds like a really fun time. As for spriest I've read more than a few times that the rotation seems pretty lame, mostly wand reliant.
---
Mostly wand DPS. Useless for MC, but handy for Onyxia.
---
Did vanilla have the voice chat system in it?

Not sure did you have cold blood. But I cheap shot build to 5 cp. hit CB and hit eviscerate and they are usually down to 10% health and o finish them off.
---
We do bid dkp and min bid is pretty low, so no one passes on upgrades. People will hoard for weapons and such but no needed tier is disenchanted.
---
If only 1 person needs something it gets defaulted to them for min bid.
---
I don't mind hunters, warlocks have been much more annoying for me as a healer, with their constant mana tap, never drinking or eating, just tap tap tap to near death and then expecting the healer to waste mana on keeping them up. Pisses me off.
---
While I am not a shadowpriest I have dueled quite a few and I always dread it. I would suggest watching some SPriest duel videos from the priests perspective to see if you can figure anything out. https://youtu.be/tnaqeofMZUo
---
So why would people subject themselves to this shit show?
---
I definitely rank it above countdown to classic. If it had an episode every week it would be heaven haha.
---
Like thousands of people?
---
What a braindead fool. I hope Methods kicks him. This is in no way someone you want to represent your team
---
Very good atm (like 60-40 horde)
---
REFRESHMENT TABLES
---
Azuresong mageblade is the most wanted and rare caster item.
---
Which means he didnt even ninja bis.....
---
Rogues are very good in phase 1. Lots of really good gear for them + no pvp trinket to break stuns yet.
---
Yikes is the only response
---
Is this "streamer bad" copy pasta?

Come on this is 2019 15 years after the games relese there has to be someone who knows..
---
&gt;did
---
why the fuck are you promoting some garbage nobody streamer that by your own words does not even play classic on the classic sub
---
Its based off one of the oldest found statuettes. 
---
"Venus of hohle fels"
---
Hope that helps :)
---
We just vendor them, hence the name. The disenchant value from shards is lower than the vendor value on my server.
---
It isn't satire if you're not funny.
---
You're welcome
---
The most sad thing is that this will all be forgotten about pretty soon. He‚Äôll make a half assed apology and then it‚Äôs business as usual.
---
I don‚Äôt know if method will let him back, I don‚Äôt know much about them.
---
But he‚Äôll keep streaming, his viewers will defend him, and he‚Äôll still be in one of the top guilds on the server for as long as classic lasts.
---
Well that‚Äôs how I see it going anyway but I‚Äôm a very cynical sod..
---
Well unless he signed up just to get one of those weird looking e-sports "jerseys"...
---
Momentous? Seriously? It's pathetic.
---
I love how Blizzard can release way too few realms, and then convince people they need layering.
---
Say it with me: layering is only needed if there aren't enough realms.
---
They could've released twice the number of realms and removed layering a month ago. But they didnt do that.
---
I'm on an average server, and there are queues everyday now. There are like 5x the people that were on a regular vanilla server.
---
Open up another ticket and hope for another GM
---
Yeah, just merge the dying server to make them Med pop, offer temp transfers to them from the super high pop, that way people don't feel they are transferring to a dead server.
---
People've been farming these things for over a month to make money, the Elemental Fire sells pretty nicely and is useful at endgame and that's one of the easier spots to farm it. I did my quest and ran into no less than a dozen different rogues over the course of a single week all farming that, including BOTH layers we had at the time.
---
‚ÄúClsssic dies‚Äù 
---
It is almost never the "pixels" people are mad about, it is the being used by another human and the feeling of betrayal/anger that is the issue. If you do not understand that, you're likely the same kind of person who would pull this kind of stunt and use and abuse other people
---
This made me more of a method fan. Standards are important
---
Because they still do play Classic WoW from time to time, and he is a WoW content creator. I thought you know in the middle of consistent negativity, I would offer some entertainment or someone worth checking out.
---
Also at this point I'd rather support "some garbage nobody streamer" and his friends, over watching "popular" or known streamers just to be in majority. Besides looking at someones viewer count and then categorizing them as a "nobody" then ignoring them is just a horrible way to go through life.
---
On top of that the original comment I was replying to was insinuating that a lot of WoW streamers and content creators are like Jokerd, I was just offering/sharing an alternative of a creator that I know of that is a great person and I extremely enjoy watching.
---
Hey can someone explain this to a noob like me, would really appreciate it (:
---
lmao hahahahaha lmao
---
We have a 20% weekly dkp decay for raiders. It has not changed hoarding at all.
---
One mage has lost more dkp then he has through dkp hoarding. At something like 450 dkp and lost 600. 
---
Worst thing is they (theres 2 but one is a worse culprit) complain they dont get loot when they don't even *bid* on items. Ever. Wait for mageblade and complain they dont get loot. 
---
People are loot horny, and no system can truly protect against their desire to purps.
---
As a new player who hasn't even gotten to raiding yet, I feel inclined to give up on the game seeing all the clips like this. It seems to happen so frequently that I'm not even sure sticking it out to the end game is worth my time. If people are willing to do it in front of thousands of people, I can't imagine what goes on when nobody is watching.
---
In vanilla you couldn‚Äôt understand each other cross faction. That‚Äôs were ‚Äúkek‚Äù comes from, it was the translation of ‚Äúlol‚Äù.
---
yeah, but he has to spawn first :(
---
Hate to break it to you but classic won't last forever..

Yea. Literally day 1 back after of her getting rejected by him and its a big deal that she doesn't want to see him? C'mon man. She even vanished off twitch for like a month after that clip lol.
---
It's gonna be any level 48+ zones + flightpath camping mostly.  
---
Sure there'll be some fights in TM / SS and elsewhere but if you're ranking ur likely to be just camping flightpoints.
---
That's terrible, but it wass definitely part of the experience of playing wow since launch. We had stuff ninja looted all the time.
---
It's one of the disadvantages of playing WoW classic.
---
It only took them a day to do the right thing... Should I praise them for that?
---
Suicide kings with separate lists for armor and weapons+trinkets. The list can be performed in  a way that everybody rolls and you order it. Lists resets each tier. When we started using it in WOD the great way to prevent camping was forcing  a direct upgrade in case the item was over 15 ilvls higher. This would not work in Classic obv but can be modified. What it also allows is having multiple chars under one nickname so if you have enough ppl to form two raids with couple of alts you can gear up alt at the cost of the spot for the main. Also, missed a raid or two due to RL? Np, your place in the didn't changed. Great system.  
---
As far as any points system goes, then can be corrupted easily and that creates too much drama. Also tracking those is horrible.
---
Bigger heals less often = more 5sr regen. do you include that?
---
You literally said most wanted and rare, which is not true.
---
Why would you even ninja a Mage weapon? We‚Äôve had mageblade drop 4 weeks in a row.
---
yeap. and the raid leaders post auction stats after every auction by chat macro
---
so like
---
1st boss: 200+300+150
---
2nd boss: 500+1600
---
you get the idea
---
Then how are you sure it's possible to have better servers
---
Also I hate my wife.
---
this guy is a fucking tool &amp; should be outed from the guild...his comment "like i give AF about my rep on an American server" pisses me off.
---
&gt;Not only did Joker ninja the item
---
Or?
---
&gt;laughing at everyone after he wins the item.
---
I'm confused. Did he ninja the item or did he win it? Which is it?
---
Wow, this guy... I don't like him.
---
No, not with trinket. How is a non undead rogue meant to beat a shadow priest without spamming sap+cs into expose?
---
Did it became so big by eating newbies?
---
Will give it a go. Ty.
---
Good, fuck this guy and his undeserved ego.
---
Yes it will, it literally will be playable forever as per what Blizzard had stated multiple times.
---
It‚Äôs a museum pirate but sure
---
&gt; meaning I could lowball a bid and even though I lost, I can pray to RNGesus and still win it
---
But you'd still pay what the other player bid. That's important. There's no discount for having a low bid, only a lower chance to win the roll. If you know what everyone else is going to bid (like if you're the raid leader, people submit secret bids to you, and you bid last ‚Äî something that wouldn't be possible if the game handled the secret bids instead), then you bid at least as high as the highest bidder apart from you, and maybe higher than that.
---
&gt; there's actually a chance he could get the item despite being a cunt who lowballs obnoxiously.
---
So your entire net worth is 2000g. Is this guy someone who's willing to spend 2000g on a joke? He'll only have a ~0.05% chance to win the roll even if he decides to go for it, though.
---
&gt; Some other dude went balls deep and snagged the item for 1 DKP more than I bid, even though I had more than twice that much DKP to spend.
---
To me, it's important that this is a zero-sum system. Wowwiki or Wowpedia has an article on [loot systems](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Loot_system#Collusion) that talks about issues like collusion, "the DKP gap", etc., but the objective for a zero-sum system is that you shouldn't care that much if you get a particular item, because its price should be very close to its value to you. If you get the item, then you pay a high price for it. If you don't get the item, then you get a small amount instead (like every other raid member). It also makes you less upset at people (maybe the entire raid present on a particular night) pushing bids upwards, because everyone benefits when that happens; with a system that isn't zero-sum, everyone present suffers when bids go up.
---
If you lose a bid by 1 DKP and are disappointed, it's because you didn't what the item was worth to you. In that particular case you lost by 1 DKP and probably would have been happy if you won by 1 DKP, but because you did lose, you would have been helped if you could have /rolled for a chance to pay the higher price.
---
You don't just get twitch banned for this length of time for something small.. whatever he did was very serious, and the deal with that streamer thot was some serious and fucked up shit, it doesn't take a fucking rocket scientist to conclude it was the likely cause of his ban.. you're being purposely naive.
---
Id rather have a free get out of blind.
---
It depends. Do you want to make your own Sappers? For me I do, so I got gnomish to 240, made all the BoP gnomish items, then switched to goblin. I now have the best of both worlds. Cost about 50g extra than if I had stayed gnomish. Also I‚Äôm a mage so my hearth is already set to Gadgetzan, meaning the winter spring teleporter was way more useful for me.
---
In the options you can shut off chat invites and then all of these will be blocked
---
For Warlocks, Banthoks Sash or Clutch of Andros with the 1% hit is much better than the Felheart Belt.
---
You're gonna have to wipe a ton without having any idea where to go to spend 6 hours in there. My first full clear (in like 13 years) was somewhere on the order of 3-3.5 hours and we killed every single boss.
---
You sound like the kind of guy that tries to get a waiter fired when your chicken tenders come out cold.
---
It was more putting myself in the shoes of the people who get upset. They fall into 2 major groups, the ones who don't understand how decay works, and the ones who were hording to exploit the system (which OP mentions people are doing - that's the only reason upgrades are getting disenchanted instead of getting 1 dkp bids).
---
Every guild I've seen using dkp is lead by a selfish asshole like that, or was getting taken advantage of by one. That's WHY you use DKP, to exploit other people. Groups that care about guild progression don't need to use DKP, and it would be foolish to do so, as "I haven't gotten a raid upgrade in a long time" is about as likely to correctly identify the best person to receive an upgrade as random rolls are.
---
Like I said, I stay the hell away from them as much as possible. Loot council is the best way to go about it you have competent and trustworthy people.
---
Ez clap
---
as a 52 that's not a healer or tank you're going to have trouble getting groups, not saying that you won't be able to, but the amount of level 60s that still do Anger, arena golem as DPS is so high. If you have close friends sure, if you don't mind looking for a group for a while sure, but just keep in mind there is an over abundance of rogues that run for HoJ, and people will invite the 56+ over you every single time unless you are friends. 
---
To be efficient leveling, I would do sunken temple a few more times, or if you don't have blackstone ring yet do Princess runs until you have it. Quest a little bit more and come back when you are like 54-55 to get groups quicker.
---
Bruh the other post is literally already at the top of the subreddit. Did it really need a repost?
---
It's kinda morbid but it would be nice to be able to load up a stream of their actual life when it's about to end, whenever that may be. Shootout robbing a gas station, overdose, can't contend with their life choices and take a shortcut, whatever. 1. They're streamers, they want attention. 2. It'd be cathartic. Win-win.
---
This most likely means that he has a paid contract and he can't legally be fired for this. From Methods pov they wanted him for PR and not to get a fucking staff from MC. He provided the opposite for them and I doubt he'll ride in their colors again.
---
&gt;He's clearly talking about following the selfish, dickbag behavior of some influencers.
---
By generalizing all of them? I don't think you know what "clearly" means.
---
He was a loser, he was a no-body streamer at all before he got all the attention from levelling. Reddit created his entire career and twitch too. He was posted here every fucking day for like a week. 
---
You can analytics or social blade his channel and see this for yourself, he was literally a loser no job fuck up that never left his house. 
---
He is the embodiment of Keyboard warrior.
---
Tell them to get off their asses and level? Mute point until then right?
---
You've clearly allowed them to influence you into an extreme jealous rage
---
Little tip, get up to about 20mp5 and cast rank 1 mind flay.  With enough SP it does more than wanding, keeps up weaving and costs almost no mana
---
You mean in the same way diablo, Warcraft and StarCraft are playable forever? As far as I know they haven't announced any "new" vanilla content being worked on
---
Nice try jokerd
---
Dude... Warstomp let's you reset fights and heal which is one of the most important things as a druid. You gotta be delusional to think shadowmeld even comes close.
---
Ulda might be a bit long on your chart. I was running it with a pretty well organized group and our tank decided to time us just for fun, we were at level and averaged 39 minutes between 3 runs. The next day I had a rather disorganized group and it took maybe 80 minutes
---
Lol actually /orgkicked
---
There's a really infamous incident from TBC where a rogue got the bow from sunwell because it was an upgrade as a stat stick and he had the dkp for it.
---
Im not sure if thats so much a dispute, as it is theft. "tank rolled on DPS gear" sounds like a dispute, cold ninja taking an item and taunting/gloating is more like "i maliciously intended to abuse this role to acquire loot" and imo should be punishable. But I understand if they are too understaffed to deal with that, considering everything else thats happened with classic.
---
Especially the last stretch where it is 3x harder than the first half of the dungeon.
---
Sorry I got confused, I thought they meant private servers. Obviously retail is different to classic.
---
‚Äú future of his contract as a WoW Classic Influencer‚Äù LOL what else has Method done for Jokerd besides losing to him in the race to 60???
---
They didn‚Äôt know how many players would stick around instead of just playing for a week until bored 
---
So they overpopulated servers so they wouldn‚Äôt all be dead
---
Which add on does this? and does it work for say and yell chat?
---
if they ban your accoint, xou are free to make a new one? They don't blacklist you?
---
So you cant get banned for ninjaing good to know. Also this pic is cringe.
---
She‚Äôs like ‚Äúyeah....that‚Äôs somethibg.
---
No, I'm saying new **Classic** content, or currently unavailable classic content will be cleared in hours. I'm also saying top retail players will put in a comparable amount of hours to top classic players (ranking aside). The biggest time investment in classic is upfront, once you‚Äôre set up there isn‚Äôt actually a whole lot to do and new raids don‚Äôt really change that as they‚Äôre cleared in hours once a week. Retail on the other hand has spikes of no-lifing it that lasts weeks when new content comes out. Overall Classic will probably eventually get a little more time consuming as old raids will still yield relevant gear and things like ranking and trying to control world dragons (As long as they remain relevant) will still be a thing but the difference in how much overall time top players put in between both game‚Äôs isn‚Äôt anywhere near as vast as you‚Äôre making it out to be. I know people love to hate on retail in this sub but at least try and be honest.
---
It was, it just wasn't as noticeable.
---
Not once in a raid have we ever been like if dont bring pots we will think less of you.
---
This type of useless post is flooding this subreddit. The people posting this shit need to be told.
---
Funny thing is someone thinks item not being bis has anything to do with anything. I assume large number of people would have settled for the "lol noobs using only 2nd best shit" tier weapon.
---
Reddit must have ran naked to MC, then bitch about how hard the game is because equipping nothing but what theorycrafters tell them to equip is waste of time!
---
You cam change them around easily to suit your needs though.
---
I disagree with their decision but understanding why they did it is important.
---
Such a loser would only get a loser family and a filty dog. So he is best of with wow :)
---
Well that warms my heart right there. I‚Äôve definitely noticed that we‚Äôre a feisty group, and we embrace the underdog mentality
---
New content isn‚Äôt Vanilla though? 
---
You don‚Äôt make any sense. Classic in the form it is in now will be playable forever.
---
"I think i'll go get commercially actored today"
---
Funny is subjective.
---
Method is an esports organisation now, they have sponsorships, do consulting and all sorts of shit, its a businesss.
---
&gt; For raids? Not really.
---
We have two Enhance shammys in our raid and its a big fight to who gets them in the group as imp wep totems is amazing.
---
JFC i cant even imagine having this mentality
---
Out of curiosity, do you play on a PVP server?
---
I've got the same setup, will let you know when I get in what sort of FPS I'm looking at in cities. Graphics setting shouldn't matter at all, it's the CPU that takes the load of calculating all of the player actions. 
---
Your game may be capping at your displays refresh rate, this would make sense if you are playing on a 60hz monitor/tv.
---
Tauren shaman here. My two most spammed things are chain heal and /cheer.
---
The honor system is being released tomorrow so leveling a fresh character on alliance might be brutal depending on your server.
---
&gt;Horde have it easier in terms of distance to dungeons,
---
It doesn't matter what the distance to a dungeon is, you will be half the world over when a group forms for it.
---
Me, in Kargath:  "Hey, you wanna run SM Armory and Cathedral?"
---
Me, in Desolace:  "Hey, you wanna run Uldaman?"
---
Me, in Brill waiting on Scarlet Monastary...  "Hey, you wanna run Zul Farrak?"
---
I firmly believe that the day I'm in the same zone as the instance when a group is formed, is the day my character will get bugged, and teleported to Winterspring or some crap.
---
I guess what I meant was, I don't just go around killing people for no reason. I'll kill someone for a quest or resource node and not feel bad about it, and when I die for the same reason, it doesn't phase me at all.
---
So many years later I still don't understand why people camp or grief each other. There's so much to do in this game, I can't figure out where they find the time.
---
What they did is basically remove the filler talents which is fair imo.
---
I prefer the older system but 90% of the older talents are kinda filler anyway, they boil down to some minor decisions you do once while changing the small amount of talents that matter.
---
fucking big brain right here lads. 
---
"a result of mathematical verification"
---
They bubble, you sap.
---
Wait out the bubble re stealth, cheap shot &gt; builders &gt; Kidney shot dpsdpsdps &gt; blind &gt; restealth &gt; cheap shot &gt; builds &gt; eve or kidney again depending on how geared you/ they are.

It isn't hard.
