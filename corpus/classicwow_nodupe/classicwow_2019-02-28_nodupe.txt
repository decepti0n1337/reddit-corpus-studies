&gt;look cool 
---

---
This is very subjective, I think they're hideous and especially don't like the audio cues.
---
---
---
I largely agree, but you are still missing my point here...
---
&gt; If the difference is 0, logically all players have equal rights.
---
The difference is *not* 0 when one player can use that item and the other 4 can't.
---
Thank you for your input 
---
Mage is best played on ally and warlock on the horde because racials but thats endgame pvp.
---
IMO the warlock fantasy due to the quests make them a better leveling exp then mage.
---
When it comes to endgame mage and warlock have good time because they are both op on patch 1.12
---
oh and as mage you will be ask for food and water all the time lol. Hope that helps
---
I love the giant shoulders, I think it's one of the more unique looking characters. Their animations are solid, they make a very no-nonsense, not flashy warrior. I am into the tusks because I'm playing a fantasy Orc, not Commander Shepard y'know?
---
Yep, most of the top guilds on my old RP realm would perma-flag. It was part of the enjoyment for those of us who PvP-grinded and wanted more fun outside BGs. There were numerous smaller guilds to do the same, or people who were aspiring to join PvP-heavy guilds would rock the perma-flag to show solidarity. Hell, many guilds would go raid cities after their big raid nights. Just kill Onyxia for the first time? Now let's kill a faction leader!
---
I mean my guild was full of HWLs and most of us were tired of PvP before ever stepping foot inside a raid. Largely the reason our guild began raiding (BWL patch) was because the raiding alliance were out-gearing our Hardcore-PvP core. After that it was just a means to an end - get gear raiding to kill Alliance in PvP.
---
Can you explain to me just because its more community based (hopefully) streamers would cause a problem on a server scale?
---
Do you want to be farming soul shards before every raid, or rather create water for all the casters pre-raid is what it comes down to.
---
Are video games immoral?
---
Warrior or Shaman? 
---
Race: Tauren, of course
---
A little about my playstyle:
---
1. Planning to PvP in-world and in bg, Raiding, 5mans, General shenanigans like soloing instances
---
2. RP-PVP Server
---
3. I enjoy playing a guy with 1h+shield and tend to build them offensively. I'm comfortable with both classes and believe I can play them to their outmost. 
---
4. Either way I will go Mining+Blacksmithing.
---
5. Long term, best scenario goals: Rank 12+, Sulfuras, Ironfoe, Clear all raids
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I simply cant decide. Both of these two classes are just too damn awesome. Help me out fellow Warriors and Shamans? 
---
No its not. Granted, I'm planning on streaming my warrior. Going to call it "chronicles of the fail warrior". Mainly just to have a record of how bad I suck, I doubt anyone will watch.
---
I played both and I like the ability to teleport to the other continent as mage. Huge time-saver. However warlocks do have noticeably faster leveling because they are a pet class -- and a free mount. I'll be choosing a mage, most likely. I just liked it more. 
---
Really the only difference is there is spot for shadow vuln which does help a lot for aq/naxx. Locks are still very much on struggle street for MC/BWL trying to get +16% hit from gear alone without any help from talents. Even with 16 slots there's no room at all for an affliction lock using corruption/CoA/Immolate.
---
Yes. 
---
What exactly might ruin the server?
---
Back in the old days famous guilds and players drew a lot of attention to their servers. And published screenshots of them and other players, too.
---
Thanks
---
Warrior: execute 
---
Warlock: fear
---
Mage: polymorph
---
Druid: roots
---
Shaman: windfury
---
Rogue: kidney shot
---
Hunter: being retarded
---
Paladin: bubble 
---
Lol edge lords. No idea what that is but I chuckled. You can’t call people losers who are all playing the same game as you. Unless you would call yourself a loser. 
---
God I'm so excited. Why must the wait be SO LONG :((
---
That place reminds me of the zoo how the path is elevated away from much of the actual mobs/zone
---
Hope scholo is a 5 man an UBRS is a 10
---
I believe in Ras Frostwhispers room.
---
Don't forget the little touches of ice here and there
---
If we stop watching the streamers, they will stop streaming.
---
Just play the game and have fun, my dudes. Stop trying to turn everything into a racket.
---
This isn't true. The warlock point you made is more complicated. In 1v1 WOTF makes Alliance warlocks worse. That being said eventually you get fat enough to where a 5 second fear immune isn't going to break you in any way. That being said horde lock is still better in 1v1.
---
Taking all of that. If you do organized group pvp. Alliance locks are way stronger. As they don't have to compete against fear ward and paladins. They will mess your crap up. In the context of organized pvp Alliance locks are much better.
---
„You have gained one talent point.” - that was the thing i was fighting and questing for :) 
---
60 ding was awesome filling, mainly because there was no achievment notification in guild chat, but we had announce it to all guguildies :)
---
I thought there are no locks who do any DoTs in raids... *mayyybe* one who is SM/Ruin specced over DM/Ruin? Corruption ticks just to try to get that free insta-Shadowbolt.
---
I was more referring to the fact that in the 8-debuff raids, CoE and CoR get used, but not Curse of Shadow. Once the additional 8 debuffs are added, you get CoS + the shadow priest buff, correct?
---
Stonetalon is much closer of a comparison to RR
---
You can definitely fight warriors and chase them down with curse of exh. Same goes for priests, paladins to some extent, and even mages. If you are SL lock with a felhunter, you can get yourself out of poly, fear, HoJ, etc.
---
Usually bags are good for this, but with other items, not being able to sell them might be an issue
---
Ok I been stuck on these 3 for a long time and I really wanna settle one one, so hopefully some of you can help me out. I want a warrior but I'm scared I'm gonna be kited like a nooblord and utterly destroyed. Like when I come across another player in pvp I feel like im gonna be /coward cuz they will able to run laps around me as they destroy me. I wanna play a paladin but I'm worried that only having judgement and having to rely on Auto attacks will get a little boring. I wanna roll a Shaman but I'm worried the youtube videos I been binging are just highlights of the best moments and that windfury isn't really all that hype. help a classic lover out? 
---
Did a baby boomer make this meme holy shit
---
Which is absolutely upsetting for being such a low level in redridge. I never really got to experience redridge fully because of the annoying amount of high level horde there. Only similar equivalent is stonetalen but that's too far outa of the way I would guess
---
This post is max autism.
---
Iron Man challenge on a hunter, melee only. No Pet.
---
LETS DO IT
---
Top guilds will be streaming guilds. 
---
Yes but mainly because I do this while doing other stuff on other monitor.. all you do is check mana seals/shield active while holding back walk to aggro more so there's no point having to put the extra attention into it, i don't click when pvping but stuff like this doesn't matter when multitasking
---
Living the dream.
---
I can't get close to children due to a court order.
---
Meeting stones don't summon in vanilla, they were used as a pseudo LFG system for filling parties.
---
I am not quite sure I follow your argument. In 1.10 the caps on the dungeons were lowered to 5 for all but Blackrock Spire, which was lowered to 10.
---
So with Classic being 1.12, I think it's pretty obvious what the caps will be.
---
That would be impressive for a warlock. 
---
Well, thinking of lots of people who don't have the time to play Classic or endgame (because of job, family, etc.). They can at least enjoy watching somebody playing it and chat and interact with them.
---
Their life prevents them from NoLife, so some people have to live it for them.
---
Back in the old days we watched live raids on German television (GIGA Games).
---
And Korean's culture treats it like football.
---
Holy shield and Ret Aura is AoE though.. not using Conc increases xp/hr because there are is no downtime at all
---
Most likely 5 and 10 man. 
---
Druids are not shit healers. They are not the best, that is held by priests imo.
---
Realistically Vanilla has only 4 healers, only 3 of which can be on a single side.
---
* Priest
---
* Druid
---
* Paladin
---
* Shaman
---
All 4 are viable healers. Each have their uses and bring something to a raid group. 
---
Druids as heals bring in one of the, if not the most mana efficient heal in the game with Healing Touch Rank 4. Battle Rez, Intervate for other healers, and a decent raid buff. And while HOts aren't used on most fights, they can be useful for certain encounters. Any good raiding guild will have 1-3 Resto Druids.
---
In all honestly you'll likely to have a tougher time getting into 5 man groups due to lacking a true rez spell. But in raids you should get invites with no issues. 
---
You are missing the point. 
---
The game is great because it was impossible to succeed alone and hard to succeed with strangers. This FORCED people to work well with others to succeed.
---
This eventually leads to players forming close friendships with those that they can rely on. It makes being reliable and friendly in your best interest.
---
Your name is cuck killer. You know damn well what an edge lord is. And yeah, I can call people who get their jollies off by killing people who have no chance to fight back losers. Gankers (and in my experience that's most of the players on pvp realms) are the equivalent of drunks who beat their children.
---
Wanna get your pvp on, show the world how good you are? Chill out in the gurubashi arena instead of goldshire. Hell, run around with your pvp flag on.
---
Curse of Shadow isn’t a vanilla spell. The only lock curses used in raids are like you said elements and reck.
---
&gt; Was just pointing out it was a slightly snide comment
---
It wasn't a snide comment at all.  You're being melodramatic.
---
&gt; Now downvote away ya fucking incels
---
Seriously? Did you forget your meds?
---
I tried both on PServer and decided I didn't like their rotation, nor did I enjoy the fact that I had to give out water/summons/healthstones. So instead I decided I'd go Hunter, much more engaging rotation, still good in PvP and I don't have to buff anyone aside from my Trueshot Aura.
---
My biggest recommendation for mage over warlock. Is that mage is the most silk slippered spoiled class in classic wow. The only thing they have to complain about is making other people water. When the only thing you have to complain is other people want some of your free crap. You are a golden child lol.
---
What do you mean? It's definitely *in* the game. Are you saying it just doesn't get used? I was definitely using it on certain raid fights just last year on [insert private server name].
---
This is true but due to the question i figured they are none hardcore and will not end up in premades. 
---
Thank you for this correction. I apparently remembered that incorrectly. 
---
I'm confused why you went for only 4/5 reckoning with 5/5 imp 1h? I feel like having a guaranteed reck stack on crit is far more beneficial than plus like 2% 1h dmg.
---
I had a n account on gurubashi that was legendary for ganking. My friend and I both sold our accounts for a pretty decent amount of cash 
---
Hey some of the steps in your guide seem impossible to do, particularly in Teldrassil. Mist (the escort quest) and Tears of the Moon (kill the level 12 spider) are listed as a step at level 7. Is this correct and you're banking on people having a group here at this stage?
---
A lot of people think because Horde have Undead that the warlock can never get fears off now. Which is true to some extent, but I think the fear is higher over exaggerated.
---
It's true a warlock might fear an undead only to have it broken right away, fine good, then cast another fear or use Death Coil. 
---
You’re right I think I was confused with the tbc affliction talent. CoS and shadow bolt spam is basic vanilla raiding rotation.
---
That was the bright side to classic through part of wrath. Nowadays people don’t really defend. 
---
Warriors:
---
Arms is better for PvP. Yes you'll get kited, especially if you're not a Gnome. You ideally want to play with a healer so you can withstand being kited and become a wrecking ball. Requires lots of gear, you will be shit until you get epics.
---
Enhance shamans are kind of a meme, I personally think Ele is much better for burst. Or you can play an Ele/Resto hybrid and help heal as well.
---
Not sure on paladins, never played one.
---
I cannot speak on the gearing side. But Ele/resto 30/0/21 will do good in PvP, and will heal fine in raids.
---
Yeah i mean this way of xp seems good. I've leveedl a pal with a ret spec and tbh i wouldn't advice to anyone to play that. But saying "aoe" when you're actually only tanking 2 or 3 mob seems a bit far fetch.
---
Then walk your druid ass over to IF and level in your spirirt buddy's zone hahaha
---
That sounds right
---
It really comes down to what role you want to play.
---
Shamans are support healers, yes in PvP they can be played as Enhance or Elemental to be DPS but a good Shaman will still know when to throw a heal or drop a totem to help his mates. In PvE they are solely healers, Ele is awful and Enhance w/ Nightfall is pretty much a meme.
---
Warriors are frontliner damage in PvP and PvE, and the best (only) tanks in PvE.
---
I’ll vouch for the G600 too, I had never really used a gaming mouse prior to using one, it took a bit of getting used to, but I do enjoy it - the G shift is great.
---
Joining TBC, I never fully experienced this zone as well as a few others: desolace, stonetalen, Azshara, hinterlands, searing gorge, burning steppes, wpl or EPL. I cannot wait to fully soak in feralas for every single quest that it has. Same with felwood, that place is bottom line favorite
---
Mage
---
* Great DPS in all raids
---
* Great farming at 60
---
* Great in PvP
---
* Great at getting around the world with Portals and Tele.
---
It's called hype, nothing wrong with it. I don't think anyone actually thinks it can live up to expectations, but it's fun to think about. PC Gaming as an industry has largely turned into nostalgia/hype/daydreaming  - once the game actually comes out you just move on to the next thing.
---
You can't have curse of exhaustion as a SL warlock.
---
You sound like a filthy hunter
---
UBRS should be 10 man
---
Scholo should be 5
---
In 1v1 they are pretty poor duelists however they do amazing burst and you can still win fights.  If you have a healer friend you go from alright in 1v1 to capable of winning 2 v 5.   I mean all melee require around the same amount of consumables so it's not too necessary.  You don't have to pay attention to too much other then smash face and button presses are on the lower end.
---
Nah mate you're missing the best reason to play Horde. 
---
* Standing on the Bank roof
---
There's a few there that need notes.
---
- Mist is a do 'if the area's crowded enough that others are around to kill pathers / spawns' otherwise skip. The other purple / blue lines around level 4 are the same, do if at launch it seems possible to do quick
---
- 4 elite quests (Sathrah here, Vagash, Hogger, Princess) like you suggested, bank on there being a ton of people around at launch. Does anyone think
---
With the right rotation, locks have essentially zero downtime while leveling.  Mages can AoE farm massive gold/hr. 
---
They are marginally worse than Warlocks late game according to PServer dps numbers. Warlocks apparently scale better is all.
---
That being said you really shouldn't pick a class based on their DPS numbers unless you are a hardcore raider.
---
I'm personally going to play a Hunter because I enjoy not having to throw out summons/healthstones/soulstones, and also Hunter's rotation is way more engaging than Warlocks who simply just spam Shadowbolt.
---
Good thing you said class and not spec. I pity all the Ret Paladins who think that spec exists at end game in Classic, lol. 
---
Great leveling spec, though!
---
Eh, its still a theme park game at its core.  The content is mostly fed to you.  There hasn't been many "whatever you make of it" games since SWG.  
---
Gah.. what ever happened to that old etiquette: "I got an item, I'll pass"
---
fyi - that shield &amp; ring drop basically every run
---
Non-Raid Gear Priority:
---
1. Main Specialization &amp; Can use immediately
---
2. Off-Specialization &amp; Gear above your level
---
3.  Disenchant, Auction House, Vendor, R.P. set
---
If you are in the highest tier of priority for your group, need, if not, greed. It’s a simple system in practice and theory.
---
They say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder but goblins are objectively sexy.
---
From a pve point of view, both are good . Warlock is less played and still needed so i guess it's easier to get a spot as warlock.
---
Mage have the best dps (especially for the first raids). But warlock are a must have because banish and also shine a lot in later stage of the game.
---
From a pvp point of view it change a bit. Mage is overall the best class because it can adapt well to any pvp situation(bg, wpvp).
---
BUT (and it's a big BUT), warlock will reck mage in 1v1 no matter what, and, warlock have a burst that can actually kill someone, mage is more about aoe and control, playing with your team (in bg)
---
So in the end it's up to what you want to play i guess? 
---
Do you want to farm soul shard for 30 min before every raid ? BEcause you're expect to teleport any fucker whose late, give ss to healer and healthstone to tank (at the very least)
---
And in 1.6 scholo packs were trimmed to make it more accommodating for 5.
---
&gt;If you want fair pvp on your own terms, play horde.. if you want to always fight an uphill battle, play alliance (and keep your bubble hearth handy).
---
Best awner.  Horde wPvP is easy mode.  Alliance wPvP is hardmode and your allies either suck or won't help you.  Pick which you enjoy more.  
---
Gotcha, so the Mist quest is basically do if you can, and the Sathrah quest will most likely have help from the flood.
---
This guide is dope!
---
Well anyway the big part of players doesn't care if those methods break the gold value, if they can get "easy" gold without taking as much time as they had to in Vanilla.
---
It was possible during Vanilla but only 1/4 players were doing it (seem legit). In Classic it's gonna be 3/4 it really change a lot of things.
---
2 people is totally different from 1. Cause in the end you can say "5 people doing tribute is an exploit ?". When you are alone you abuse AI and it path. As 2 if you are using game mechanics + skill to reach your goal it's not an exploit
---
I've always found the horde to be better people than the alliance.  It's mostly the gnomes.
---
PvE server leveling is easy mode and boring.  That's all.
---
It's viable if your willing to farm 300% more to do 90% of the damage. Unless you are doing Naxx progression. People worry about comp too much.
---
&gt; Now, does that enjoyment come at the cost of another player's own enjoyment? Sure, but that can be true when you gank people of your own level.
---
Thing is, even this isn't necessarily true. I was a total carebear when I first played the game, rolling on an RP server and having basically the same idea as the guy you're responding to. I genuinely believed if you weren't being "honorable" about PvP you were legitimately a shitty person just there to ruin others' fun.
---
Then I met some new friends on a forum, rerolled on a different (albeit still RP) server to join their guild and started actually *doing* PvP with them. Including ganking and being ganked. And I fucking loved it.
---
I went from spouting blue streaks every time a Horde showed up anywhere near my character to monitoring WorldDefense at all times, hoping and praying for some action. I actually got kinda' irritated at the inability to communicate with the other faction because I honestly wanted to congratulate the guy who'd just pwned the crap out of me.
---
As far as realisme is concerned, what's usually happening on pvp servers is not real war and i won't go in details, do you research.
---
Also, the failure that is pvp ganking should have been built around some sort of criminal/bandit system because let's face it, killing lower level of the other faction could be seen as crimes of war.
---
Heck, a criminal system could have allowed rewarss of increasing sums for your head! (Incentives for own faction help)
---
I can tell you as a long time horde player. We are toxic as hell bro. This is a grass is greener view. We got plenty of unshaved necks lol.
---
Let me sell you on Hunter
---
* Great PvP,
---
* great gold farming
---
* best ranged dps rotation in the game. 
---
* Doesn't have to summon/healthstone/soulstone/buff/water vendor. 
---
* Greatest leveling experience bar none. 
---
* Required in raids because of Tranq shot/NR aura
---
* Desired in 5 mans because of kiting/CC/pulling
---
* Despite what some think they scale perfectly fine throughout all stages of content. Check Naxx damage meters from VANILLA footage, not private servers with janked up numbers, you will find hunters do just fine, maybe not Mage levels, but still competing and even beating warlocks sometimes.
---
If you're like me and like to keep watch of a lot of different things running out, i.e. Dots, CC, while managing your pet, positioning, channeling/casting/wanding etc. then Lock is def. the right class to pick. I just feel there's a higher ceiling to the class somehow.
---
Leveling is a breeze when you learn how to keep track of pet's mana as well as Life Tapping your own. Last time I leveled a Lock I used a separate keybind to toggle (the switching off/on mechanic for petskills) Voidwalker's taunt, so that the dummy wouldn't taunt on the mob when they're already low. The manacost for Torment (the taunt) is ridiculously high. 
---
Hope I managed to pique some interest to my favourite class :D
---
That's the journey 
---
truth, ty
---
idk there's been a mentality on retail for years that pvp is "beneath" pve and an inferior form of content and blah blah blah blah  
---
kinda spurred on in a big way by the infamous 'shut up pvp guy' soundbyte.  
---
not saying you do any of this ofc but the sentiment absolutely exists and at one point existed (in jest or otherwise) among the devs to a degree. 
---
&gt;Also, the failure that is pvp ganking should have been built around some sort of criminal/bandit system because let's face it, killing lower level of the other faction could be seen as crimes of war.
---
No such thing in "warcraft".  Maybe your thinking of World of Peacecraft.
---
I would prefer they both be 10 mans and be tuned to be 10 mans as well.
---
Yes there is probably a lot of work. But : 3D models, quests, environnement,dialog,translation are here. Everything is here, there is nothing to create, to test, to validate etc...  
---
They ""just"" have to convert old data into the new one. It's a lot of work, but probably not worth the same time it take to create a game.
---
Gets to and kills vael while still using ww axe.
---
It's an mmo.. toxicity will be everywhere, just find a good guild and ignore every other chat
---
Disagree, a lot of people definitely care if someone does 10% more dps. If you do, go mage, if you don’t, pick either. Mage is more convenient and can farm much easier gold tho. But there are 50% more mages than locks
---
You sound like you have no idea how to level a priest. You never cast smite. Look up priest leveling rotations and reconsider.
---
You always glad to have a wl to summon BUT, most group will prefer a mage because it's just better to handle situation where you need ae dps, and sheep is more reliable than fear(you can't use it for a lot of pull). I'm saying that because i've seen a lot a grp looking for a mage instead of anything else.
---
People actually voted for Teldrassil over Tirisfal? Lmao
---
For sure. And I dont disagree, I'm doing the same thing. Having tons of gold early to buy up all the items that will shoot up in price later is important.
---
Back to your original question, throughout the game (assuming changes aren't made to prevent you from doing so) you can start by farming dm, then farm zg crocs, then farming ele earth in mara once aq is out. The takeaway is, there aren't other classes that have all of those options to capitalize on.
---
Lotus farming in Av should also be easiest on mage as well.
---
This is just another standard you guys have rosies on. No we don't and yes it is the best mmo ever. You are entitled to your opinion but don't expect agreement here lol
---
Just do what you want. Need to get quests done? Do it as 5 man. Want to chain quick runs together because you have an item reserved? Do it 10 man. Want less competition for loot in general? 5 man.
---
I got that it's nice, but basically any old green is really only going to be a few stats behind the best you can get at that level. The difference in speed over an hour of levelling would be measured in seconds. It is not a 'major difference'. Even a massive weapon upgrade is going to be at most a 20% dps gain, which when you consider the relatively small amount of time during levelling you're actually attacking is going to be around 5% in actual speed increase. And that's talking like going from a green at 34 to a whirlwind axe, the absolute best case.
---
&gt; Put on /worlddefense and you will see just how much people like to cause havoc.
---
I concur. /worlddefense kept me busy for months
---
'Exploitations', heh.
---
Loot trading world worst cast scenario - a few friends all roll need on an item and then decide among themselves who gets the item if they win, resulting in a lower chance of the pug player winning an item, and trashing their reputations immediately in the process.
---
This of course is massively different than people need rolling everything without consideration for others. Another vanilla wow loot sin. And massively different than the group leader flipping loot to master loot mid-pull to take the item they want. Which are 'exploits' under the old loot rolling system, and are dealt with by community social punishment.
---
Thats what peak performance looks like.
---
warrior is mostly good with a pocket healer in pvp.Tbh don't play warrior if you don't have a reliable guild/Friends to play with. It's hell.
---
Ench shaman is a xp build and is worthless in pvp/pve. On the other hand heal shaman is very much needed in pve and always appreciated in pvp. Elem shaman is insane in pvp but useless in pve (the old burst vs dps dilema)
---
Toxicity belongs to both factions, sometimes it's just easier to see the one belonging to the opposing side than the one you're on, sometimes backwards.
---
My friends and I would usually sit around in Org and either pretend to not know something very basic about the game, while defending not knowing it by applying real-world/faulty logic. Or wait for someone to brag about something and just take the wind out of their sails. Amateur stuff, but it always made us laugh. 
---
The old sap and run on lowbies is great if you play a rogue. 
---
&gt; The issue topic is that PvP servers offer more than a PvE server can offer, 
---
Also, retail servers offer more than Classic servers.
---
If I’m 60 and I see an enemy player(say level 50) ganking a lower level player (say 46 or lower) I will intervene immediately 
---
the rest of the time see how it pans out.
---
I think grizzly hills sucks dick.   The music isn’t anything crazy either
---
Best part was doing that back when the BGs had exits. Better than an instant kill, just flat out remove the enemy from play.
---
Tbh it only depend if u will able to play with others or not. Don't ever play warrior if you're going alone into the game. Warrior is by far the best IF AND ONLY you get a healer behind you, otherwise it's shit and you will end up wanting to delete it.
---
I also remember a shit ton of world pvp on pve servers. 
---
The raiding guild recruiters at least shouldn't have to care about a few % DPS though. There are only a few fights that really need you to absolutely maximize DPS and as long as you're a good player and reasonably geared even those should be fine (and a guild could always do world buffs if they are that worried about it).
---
Oh, I remembered another one, I had a macro for when dueling in Goblin towns for /forfeit /pvp. Can you guess what happened next?
---
Buddy, I'm going to step in and cream any greenskin I see attacking my allies. 
---
Look out for your own 
---
If you play druid in pvp, the only thing you're good at in carrying flag in wsg. Your premade will still let you guard flag on arathi out of kindness but that's it. Obviously you're expected to heal in PVE(but it's shit in 5man haha)
---
Yeah but ... Dishonorable kills ...
---
&gt; I simply said PVE servers are ezmode.
---
Play permaflagged on a pve server and get back to me on that. See how ezmode pvp is when everyone is always getting the first shot on you
---
Can't trash a reputation if no one knows.  Are you checking on everyone in your pug an hour later?  Ever?  No.  
---
Have any points that hold up?
---
warlock have a better end game dps, but hunter is still needed for tranquilize shot(bth i'm not sure of the name anymore, but i'm talking about the skill book you get in mc and is use to calm down bosses)
---
We used to have a few vigilantes in STV on my server back in the day. 
---
I remember one guy, a hunter, who had a tiger pet. He would always play tricks on gankers and control his pet and walk around other tigers with it as bait (probably looked like a quest mob due to its level?) and then pounce on them from behind cover when they came closer to have a look.
---
He killed some douche rogue that was camping me, so I'll always remember this guy.
---
In classic I'm gonna take up his superhero mantle and hunt rogues in STV in his honor.
---
&gt; . But I think we all need to stop pretending world PvP is half the game. 
---
You need to understand that the people making this argument have a vested interest in ensuring that pvp servers are heavily populated with targets.
---
To tank it's more about your gear than consumables. I mean you need stuff from different location that are very exclusive to druid. Especially in the early of the game. However, if you get a spot in a raid as druid tank, you'll be very easily stuffed because you  have no competition . I mean who else need that + def or +str on leather gear ? No one.
---
trash game mechanics attract trash players
---
Slows her down enough so I can farm that sweet, sweet Blade of Eternal Darkness
---
if you will equip it, then roll NEED. That's it.
---
Once you get to level 60 and items start becoming "best in slot" for certain classes, then you should be more careful.
---
And this is why I'll be on a PvE server :)
---
This is the most interesting thing to learn of in months about classic. I feel like there should be more threads about this. This makes me so hyped for summer
---
This right here.
---
ITT:  
---
Alliance players giving all the reasons they will ignore their own allies and watch them die.  
---
Horde players asserting that any Male Night Elf must be killed without question.  
---
If someone rolled need on an item just to sell it when someone else would have equipped it, that's the last time I group with them.
---
so you are scared of rogues ... u may played a crappy clothie?
---
I know right? I voted Tirisfal, Teldrassil, Dun Morogh on that one
---
It’s not about making it through the content, it’s about competitive speed running for some and simply faster runs for others.
---
only gunna stream to record my gameplay
---
Vanilla is its own odd &amp; antiquated thing that you have to accept for its flaws. It just is what it is.
---
Gonna have to add combat rogue with swords. When vanilla first released I use to participate in world pvp before any battlegrounds even releases and I ended up getting rank 8 on my troll rogue from word POV solely. Combat rogue all the way!
---
You’re thinking Feral druid, not Balance. Even Balance doesn’t have enough consumables or a gimmick like MCPs to make them not run out of mana after a few minutes. 
---
Allies are in trouble. The beacons are lit! Gonder calls for aid! We ride...
---
If your banner is blue, your limbs I’ll strew.
---
how can I be scared of a class that I frequently camped the shit out of in TBC/WOTLK?
---
I'm just saying that the rogue class attracts bad players... 
---
The first level 80 Gladiator rogue I killed was when I was a level 79 feral... killed him so embarrassingly that one of his friends actually logged onto a horde alt and whispered me that "he wants you to know his little brother was playing his character"
---
Now Rogue is a good class for pvp and, when a talented player plays it, they can be unbeatable. But *most* rogues are bad players who are looking for a crutch to hide their terribad skills.
---
Leveling- 
---
Both are pretty easy. Warlocks are probably slightly more efficient/faster due to their pet. However, a frost mage can AOE level very quickly (this will be challenging to do on release though due to competition). I wouldn't really base your decision on leveling difficulty, as both have great utility. 
---
PvP- Warlocks are gonna be better 1v1. Pet sac is huge. Both are good in BGs. Mages are obviously good in PvP, but something to think about is what your primary spec will be. There are pretty big gaps between the PvE Mage and PvP specs. I would consider looking at this for both classes. Warlocks have more PvP utility "baked in" to their class without having to spec it.
---
PvE- Mages are the best end game ranged DPS. Warlocks are also good and very necessary due to their utility they bring to the raid. You MAY have an easier time getting a raid spot as a warlock, as they are a bit more rare at 60. 
---
Just base your decision on playstyle. They are both excellent choices and you can't really go wrong. For me, I choose mage due to the potential to farm gold VERY well at 60, for food/water, and for portals. 
---
Stonetalon and Hillsbrad are on lockdown by alliance gankers and alliance gank guilds.
---
My warlock friend and I would use waterbreathing to go to the bottom of the ocean, then randomly invite non-undead lowbies from org to our group then summon them and watch them drown.
---
good times.
---
heh I was pretty much a Alliance player from Vanilla till I quit BFA but going for a Undead toon this time around.
---
I have a group of friends I will be starting off with and regardless I'm a pretty social person. I usually find that a warrior that isn't afraid to tank will find themselves with quite a few friends, especially if they tank well.
---
Druids have stealth, outstanding mobility, and VERY strong cooldowns. They are a truly dominant 1v1 class and big underdogs when it comes to WoW PVP. 
---
Another big benefit is that you can be simultaneously spec'd to PvE heal but also go down the balance tree for pvp.
---
PvP has always been the unloved sibling.
---
I've spent a lot of time PvPing in Vanilla. World PvP, BGs, ganking, being ganked... I really enjoy playing against real people. PvE encounters are predictable, but PvP is dynamic, surprising and demanding.
---
Though, compared to PvE, Blizzard hasn't put much effort into PvP. Very few quests, few content, new content sucked (Silithus, Plaguelands), no equipment upgrades...
---
I LOVE the Vanilla BGs, but I quit soon when BC was released and joined again in WotLK with Arena. But Arena and the new BGs really sucked (WoW was no game for 2-man or 3-man PVP). Haven't played since then.
---
There were so many possibilities for PvP! Imagine quests and rewards for killing faction bosses or raiding cities. Also, the PvP honour rank system was just plain stupid. No skill needed, just invest a lot of time and actually you were fighting (~competing) against your own faction. Dishonorable kills fucked up city raidings (why not just deactivate them in 'green' zones where people have to opt-in for PvP, even on PvP servers?) Creativity level zero! WAR EFFORTS were made for fighting bugs, remember? I'd have loved these kind of events for PvP!
---
I'm still thankful for the PVP we've got in vanilla, but WoW obviously focuses on PvE content.
---
Oh my god it’s the best. Especially when people duel or fight you on the boat
---
I won't interfere if my fellow hordie looks like he's going to win. Any other situation, or if the ally is higher lvl and they're getting creamed
---
Do them all as you are leveling. Why skip content?
---
That's fair enough. Speed running wasn't really a thing before private servers (as far as I remember at least) but I can imagine it being a thing on a re-release. In my experience at least with clearing faster, you'd shuffle around a bit, but it wouldn't be enough that I'd advise picking a mage over warlock for higher dps.
---
It'll be interesting to see. There were a lot of limits in terms of what flexibility people had doing 40 man raids in vanilla and those limits may not all exist in a re-release (server transfers, game knowledge, dungeon strategies, more min/max info, etc).
---
I guess my recollection was a little skewed. I thought after 20 it became a drag but everyone’s saying more like 40. 
---
When you say double support, I assume you mean healer. Orcs on look y have shaman as support do UD would have the edge on them.
---
No Duskwood at all? I love how the area around Forlorn Rowe would get a deep purple fog when you got close to it. This is an unique feature in Vanilla WoW and apparently it was quite innovative game design at the time. 
---
I'm leaning towards this too, we'll see if that changes (sometimes you meet the right type of guild...).
---
Ideally, I'd like the WC3 remaster to come out before classic so I can play through it, to prime and pump myself up.
---
Grow up ffs
---
Always hated the, "tab" to target nearest for that reason. But no really way to remove it, since its mainly used for non campin reasons. Just try an spawn in a outa the way spot, as far from the camper as you can.
---
How does canalize benefit in WPvP?
---
Please try r/wowservers for private server discussion, or r/wow for modern WoW discussion. (Rule #1)
---
I've decided that I want to hybrid healer with their ranged dps spec. Druid/Shaman or Priest. Heavily Leaning Shaman.
---
Are Ele shaman any good for dungeons? Do they acquire their gear too late in the cycle to really be able to do this without 2.5 or higher?
---
Always respect the 1v1. This is known by all serious PVP'rs  
---
If being a streamer naturally ruins a server and ruining things for other people is immoral, then streaming is immoral.  
---
Amazing how you can make such a dumb stretch like that.  
---
I don't think it's immoral, but I do think streamers and their fans are cancer and I will be avoiding them on Classic's launch.  
---
Uhhhh? 1.12 should be 1.12. Why is this such a riddle for some people?  
---
The inhabitants of [Pyrewood Village](https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Pyrewood_Village) just outside SFK are friendly to Alliance during the day.  During the night they transform into Worgen and are hostile to both factions.  The Kirin Tor mages of Silverpine's Ambermill and Alterac's Dalaran Crater are also Alliance-friendly.
---
For the Horde, I believe the Orcs of the lumber operation in Ashenvale are Horde-alligned.
---
No heirlooms for sure since it devalues the game. but levelboost and dungeon finder are a must. I am 36 years old and I have 6 kids and a full time job. God says just people are just but waiting for the dairyman is justice league. 
---
Don't really think so, either way it doesn't really matter though, nothing you can really do to stop/prevent it 
---
PVE warlock and mage, in my opinion, are pretty similar.  
---
**Ahead of raid:**  
---
Mage: Start conjuring tons of water  
---
Warlock: Farm shards  
---
**During raid:**  
---
Mage: Spot conjure water  
---
Warlock: Spot conjure healthstone  
---
**Raid DPS:**  
---
Mage: spam frostbolt  
---
Warlock: spam shadowbolt.  
---
The only real deciding factor in my opinion is PVP. Go watch some vids of that.  
---
Anyone who thinks there is an observable personality difference between a horde player and an alliance player, is probably the perceived "problem" with their faction of choice. And by that, I mean the problem with the entire population.  
---
That’s a T4 isn’t it? I’m sure it could start at 3.5, and that’s why I stopped there lol. Once you hit 30, you’re in multiple zones
---
Paladin
---
The only people who start tossing out insults online and making unproven claims about another person's life are people who got ganked on a PVP server and are really sad about it.  
---
Not much but if u get the kill on someone and others in vicinity can use it as a quick heal incase u happen to kill someone near a gy
---
Yea they could do so much pvp wise. Have a quest where you have to get 5 honor kills in a contested area or something. Man that would be fun.  I think enemy faction kills should yield exp also. 
---
Druids can stealth, too. It's Vanish and Sap imo.
---
You're leaving out the part where he said he was extremely unsure of his estimate and that he's not 100% sure if it was a year before.  
---
Depends on the the level difference between them and if there is a numbers advantage. If 3 guys are spawn camping 1 person, I’d dive right in.  
---
What's the issue with streamers. I'm not being arsey just want to know.  I personally don't watch any other than the odd YouTube vid but how exactly would they ruin a server?
---
thanks man. One more question is it always a kite fest in world pvp with a warrior?
---
Play the AH. Your situation is perfect for it.  
---
do gnomes really make that big of an impact?
---
If someone can afford a lifestyle of playing video games whenever they want to (and even more so for people that can do it successfully and offer some kind of entertainment value/actually bring in revenue to support themselves) then more power to them. I certainly can’t and quite frankly my significant other would leave me if I tried to. That doesn’t mean I have to hate someone for being a successful streamer. I don’t personally like some of the streamers that are more successful than I think they should be but I also have a great solution to that— I don’t watch them.
---
Your pserver likely has 4-6x the 2.5k players that each vanilla server was capped at.
---
Succubus sleep is pretty darn close to sheep when comparing mage and lock CC no? plus locks get banish for those demons in the later instances too
---
Mimimimimimimi
---
Sry buddy, its war, and the only reward I need is a single guy to go out of his way to switch to an alt and pm an insult at me, thats all I want.
---
I really liked mage play when it comes to 5 man's prob the most fun I've had outside healing. But trying to lvl one it seems hard because of the ganking maybe it's do to my massive inexperience in pvp with a mage idk just seemed like a free kill for someone all the time 
---
[removed]
---
I did this on a recent project with my druid. Taunt + press escape really fast. The pet would hit me and they'd both die, I'd be unharmed.  
---
Decided to AOE taunt suicide in the inn once though and took 5 AFK players with me.  
---
Right so I did this on my level 50 paladin to 55 and it seems really awesome!! You don't use Conc but use Max rank Seal of the Crusader and Max Rank Seal of Command Judgement every CD (Imp Crusader on talents).. You never go OOM and vengance ALWAYS procs and the damage is really good if not better than the usual Ret STR build.. I own in world PvP like this, curious to see raids if I can join.
---
Too bad there's no option for ppl who want p e only.
---
It’s tiring, too.
---
Sometimes i let them live. You know, when i’m having lunch or there’s something good on. Every now and them they still die, though. I guess a 700 DoT is quite a lot for a lvl 15.
---
Keeping the war going is not easy, but it’s honest work.
---
I'm excited to do regular dungeons again. They felt much more rewarding to finish than they do now.
---
Dang I completely forgot until just now this was a thing. Lol
---
This guys post says it perfectly.
---
Hunter. No contest.
---
As Alliance, I was really bored one day and I swam from the Westfall Lighthouse to Southshore. It helps to know I was a druid so I had aquatic form. It still took me a while and I was curious if I could do it and if I would see anything interesting. I did learn that there are certain points in the ocean where you zone into SW and IF.
---
Were you like me and also afraid to swim down off the dropoff because who knows what is down there? I heard rumors of massive sharks and monsters and stuff being down there if you went far enough. The rumors in Vanilla were crazy.
---
Even a shit rogue is dangerous when they open on you with cheapshot while you are in combat with a mob
---
I'm afraid that sharding will ruin this. They say it won't but I think it will.
---
The first char u hit max asap to bring in the money, then you enjoy things with your next chars. 
---
But you speak about enjoyment and fun. Those things aren't guided by the fact that you know you are doing mathematically 5% more damage. They're (often) influenced by the fact that you feel like a badass wielding a Corpsemaker that's destroying your enemies or the looks of your Herod's Shoulder, Arugal's Robes, or Bad Mojo Mask. The excitement and the piece of mind that you got an item you don't need to worry about replacing. I know that may sound shallow but those are often big factors in enjoyment of the game.... In ADDITION to the challenge and fulfillment of doing dungeons with a group of people
---
Yeh I spent the least amount of time in that zone. And I usually always have the music off
---
you recall it vividly as 10/15 because thats what they were for the largest part of vanilla.  most ppl weren't 60 for meme 40 mans and 1.10 was late as fuck and most people were done gearing from them by then  
---
Saying "ganking is the only complete wow experience " is like saying "mass shootings, gang wars, and police brutality is the only true American experience". Its dumb. Theres literally nothing enjoyable about getting corpse camped by a guy who cons skull to you.
---
Duskwood is a 22 to 28 zone. 
---
horde is filled with metaljesus looking dudes with horde logo tattoos whose personalities are defined by a 15 year old video game 
---
This is the kind of post I always hoped to find afterwards on the realm forums.
---
I disagree. It’s morally right to always interrupt the fight and help your Ally. 
---
A lot of people seem to think Classic wow will put them back in high school, there will probably be a lot of min maxing/optimal raiding guilds compared to vanilla wow, especially since anyone who wants to clear MC fast can google "Vanilla wow MC guide" and instantly build a near perfect raid comp, compared to 2005 where a lot of people didn't have 14~ years of private servers crunching the numbers
---
Was a gift. Now it’s just gonna be a cesspool of people pretending they played classic and trying to bring it back.
---
I have a spotify playlist with the WoW soundtrack, many movie soundtracks, and a few game soundtracks in it, always FeelsGoodMan to be transported to Dun Morough or somewhere in azeroth when it comes on :)
---
Yikes. Forgot about that!
---
escape artist is pretty juicy in PvP, although that being said Orcs are probably the best because of Hardiness and Blood Fury.
---
We're not saying it's the only experience, we're saying that without them it's an incomplete experience.  
---
Just like if I lived in the U.S. without mass shootings, gang wars, and police brutality, it wouldn't be the *complete* United States experience.  
---
And I just don't know if I can live with that.  
---
You can heal dungeons from Ele spec yes. Is it viable dps-wise? Not really, they go oom very quickly. If you want to play a hybrid spec I would say Shaman is probably the way to go though, at least in PvP. [30/0/21](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hvbzVfMqZZVfcb0xo) is probably the best PvP spec as it offers you utility enough to heal and do decent damage too.
---
" There was also various Class imbalances such as mage-warrior etc. "
---
Vanilla PvP was not based around 1v1 interactions. Every class did not have every tool, and nor should they.  Group PvP was the aim - Blizzards design principles was heavily influenced by activities being designed for groups not solo play. The obsession with the need for everyone to have everything and make everything "fair" is a pretty modern paradigm, and one which does not belong in an MMO.
---
^this. 
---
Erp isnt my jam. I'm more of a pvp-rp guy. I'd rather watch porn than erp
---
A truly balanced game is boring. 
---
Hm. Always worked for me. Id have the whole zone coming after me. I'd spread the word to city chat and have a bunch show up for the massacre.
---
You seem like a really good developer, you should run over there and help them out so it'll go faster.
---
Yes. Classic isn't out yet so I can only assume you're running SFK in BfA for some reason?
---
Absolutely, I hated swimming in the open water back then (and still do, I didn’t like Vashj’ir). The Druid swim form quest on an alt was terrible for me. I don’t even like going to Theramore and seeing those high elite level sharks chilling right around the docks.
---
I'd rather watch you watch porn.  
---
I'm pretty triggered about the lack of even a single droplet of information tbh.  
---
There was information released, quite recently even. You’re just not paying attention. 
---
Basically they’re working hard on Classic and still expect it to be ready in summer. 
---
Duh 
---
Warrior - Execute
---
Paladin - Hammer of Justice
---
Hunter - Aimed Shot
---
Rogue - Vanish
---
Priest - Mind Control
---
Shaman - Ghost Wolf
---
Mage - Conjure Water /s
---
Warlock - Fear
---
Druid - Shapeshift
---
Do you know of any good shaman gameplay videos or streams?  I am really interested in playing one but it’s hard to find a good gameplay video other than PvP montages. 
---
That axe was everything before I spec'd hammersmith and became OP.
---
Agreed every character i ever level horde or alliance does Feralas.
---
Good I’ll do it more
---
That's the information?  
---
That's they're working hard?  
---
&gt; You understand that we admire people whose actions show courage and/or skill, right?
---
We're not talking about whether or not you admire these people, we're talking about whether or not they're scumbags.  Is everyone you don't admire automatically a scumbag?
---
&gt; You don't need to "pump hundreds of hours" into BGs to be able to kill other players. All, and I mean all, you have to do, to win in WoW's shitty open-world PvP system, is be ten levels higher than the opponent, and not actually be AFK. That's it. No skill, no gear, nothing. This is especially the case if you start off invisible and wait until your opponent is weakened first.
---
So?  Does that mean someone couldn't find it fun?  What does this have to do with making someone a scumbag?
---
&gt; It is in no way a "challenging" or "courageous" or "skill-requiring" act, to gank lowbies.
---
If you enjoy doing or even casually partake in an activity that's not challenging, courageous, or skill-requiring, are you a scumbag?  Sometimes I like to just relax and listen to music to unwind.  It's not challenging, it's definitely not courageous, and it doesn't require skill.  Am I a scumbag?
---
&gt; Being "bored" and "not even thinking" about the effect of his actions on others is not some kind of argument for defense, you realise. It's an argument against. It may be "aimless" to him, but it's a fucking painful nuisance to everybody he affects.
---
Then they should play a PvE server.  My point is that he's probably not thinking about the effect his actions have on you, you're thinking about this way more than most gankers would.  They're probably just messing around and having fun.  They're not scumbags just because you don't like the way the game you're voluntarily playing works.  You act like people are forced to play this game.
---
&gt; There are no perfectly reasonable or mundane reasons to be out ganking. It's a shitty, bullying, annoying behaviour that the broken system enables.
---
Have you heard of this thing called 'fun'?  It's a pretty good reason to do things.
---
&gt; I am indeed "ass-pained". I despise bullies, griefers, trolls and assholes in all contexts. I will indeed be playing on a PvE server, because that's where people like you, whose "fun" is ruining the game for others, aren't.
---
I've never said I enjoy or play on PvP servers but OK.  People who play the game differently from you aren't automatically bullies, griefers, trolls, and assholes.
---
&gt; I love fair PvP, ie battlegrounds. Back in the day I spent plenty of time doing it, and I believe I got quite good at it. There is nothing to learn about PvP from ganking lowbies.
---
Aw, that's cute.  You think BGs in WoW are fair.
---
This sub gets more than its fair share of dumb questions but this takes 1st place.
---
Late in classic you couldn't get into any dungeon except raid dungeons (which includes UBRS) (and I think BRD - because it was the original entrance to MC) with more than 5 people.
---
Wasn't expecting to watch that whole thing. Twas captivating. 
---
It's one of the reasons why flasks cost so much. Not only do they require expensive and rare materials, they also require a special location 
---
Hunter is my favorite class for world pvp personally followed by rogue Druids are good for escaping world pvp.
---
"Before a GM restored it" See that should never have been restored, no body learns that way. It just makes people entitles, and burdens GMs from actually helping people.
---
Or when they launch TBC Classic. *a man can dream*
---
If you want to get more into the details of the music, cause I believe the vanilla music has a real simple elegance to its melodies check out this channel that started earlier this month.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_sx858VWGPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sx858VWGPk)
---
I won't on account of latency
---
Also i think this blizzard system is a dumb, i mean you have very low chance to hit higher lvl player with spells, you can't kite him or interrupt, you can only escape if have any kind of speed increase or bubble+hs. 
---
So imagine that you have same chance to hit, almost same hp(except gear) you have only few differences it's a talents, spells and gear. It will be more healthy. 
---
It will be absolutely same. 
---
I have spent a lot of time playing both factions there is going to be toxic players n both sides fairly evenly. The best way to make it easier to avoid toxic people is find a good guild hint it is very very rarely the guild that invites everyone. 
---
Goblin sapper charges are the meta of wPvP that has actual importance (world bosses and some world buff wiping off enemy raids). Paladins can give freedoms to warriors, BoPs to mages, and free cast with bubble. Shamans give the horde more dispels for FAPs/LIPs/BoP/Freedoms but also have to eat through more buffs because of paladins as well. With freedoms and backup FAPs warriors push with ease, with BoPs and backup LIPs mages blink in and AoE while avoiding getting chunked.
---
All of this creates a dynamic where alliance is both better at offensive and defensive play. This is why the vast majority of competitive guilds go alliance (alongside the PvE benefits) and why on private servers the most iconic duo is the alliance and uncontested world bosses (the horde not even showing up/trying). 
---
no srsly, all of those people will go to pve servers while all of the ganker wannabes are screaming "you're missing half the game!" and "you have no skills nub" etc etc etc
---
Amen to that.
---
And you should ignore them, if you want pve then go for it, nothing wrong with that. You play for your own enjoyment, everyone else can fuck off.
---
I'm lol'ing at your username while remembering that I once got banned here for just saying "sig heil" when someone randomly called me a nazi
---
&gt;Hey guys the games not cancelled!
---
Yeah not quite what i consider substantive info either lol.
---
I honestly don't like the Horde zones as much as the Alliance ones. 
---
Started as a NE back in 04, could just be a bias, but even after leveling a Forsaken next, I ended up going back.
---
Go middle and settle on Dwarf Rogue.
---
Adding a question just because i do not remember does loyalty drop if your pet is dismissed? 
---
Turns out the best way to troll a no-skill ganker is to simply tell him you're not going to roll on a pvp server. they lose their minds over that.
---
I do not agree, played since Vanilla and Grizzly is my top pick for soundtrack.
---
Does that have anything to do with the rate I level? Idk how to ask this without sounding dickish lol
---
Of course, competition for mobs/quest objectives will certainly impact your leveling speed.
---
I agree. I finally caved in today and ordered the rest of the stuff for my new PC build just to distract myself for a few hours
---
It’s not common practice for game companies to constantly update their fan base with new development information. 
---
You've yee'd you'r la'st h'aw
---
I laughed, if it makes you feel any better about the downvotes
---
I'm trying to decide if I want to play a hunter or warlock first. 
---
A bit of background;
---
I didn't play back in vanilla, I started back in late tbc(plus I was so young then) and I've always played warlock, shaman, and either warrior/rogue. I want to play warlock because of the sheer amount of abilities they have in vanilla and I feel like they have a lot of depth in regards to playstyle outside of raiding. I also heard that hunters in vanilla have a pretty high skillcap(something I want) especially in raiding. I actually used to love hunter back when they had mana instead of focus and had to manage their pet more/ammo. I'll be doing both pve and pvp at 60 I just can't decide what I'm going to play between hunter and warlock. Although in the end I'll probably end up leveling both.
---
TLDR: hunter or lock for a class with a high skillcap and interesting playstyle/builds for endgame?
---
Did not know Kenny Powers played wow.
---
Oh the downvotes were to be expected. Everyone knows that westerners worship Japanese culture and you’re not allowed to say anything bad about it. 
---
I’m debating what to play in classic, both as a main and as an alt. I will be raiding and doing pvp. I’m debating between a warlock, priest, or hunter. 
---
I have played a warlock since just before tbc was released and really miss how they used to play (can’t stand the playstyle now in bfa).  
---
I played a shadow priest back in tbc and loved it. I am afraid of not finding a raid spot as shadow though, and I have little interest in healing full time. 
---
Played a hunter starting in cata and enjoyed it, but I know they are much different in classic. I am afraid of having to fight for gear with many other classes, and my best friend will be rolling hunter. 
---
I will be rolling Horde. 
---
Its fun
---
Yeah then you were fortunate to never come across the scumbag hunters who would corpse camp ruthlesslessly with their track humanoid spell on the map. They can stand on your body and you cant rez out of its range so he just sends his pet to 2 shot you.
---
Alliance. Mostly because it’s so much better for pve and pvp. 
---
I'm considering Hunter vs Warlock, and my only hesitation with warlock is how much soul shard farming is required before a raid. How long does it usually take?
---
I'm pretty sure I've come across all of them. I certainly played for long enough.
---
If you're a high level ganking people 10+ levels below you as they are questing, you are scum. Change my mind...
---
Valid usage, maybe double check next time. 
---
I haven't mentioned anything about *constant* updates.  
---
That's not my goal. I don't need to know how many light posts have been corrected since Blizzcon. Are we getting a beta? Is that really a difficult scenario to discuss with the player base in the interim?  
---
In Vanilla, horde have better PvP racials.
---
And that does what exactly?
---
*Paladin free casting while bubbled*
---
*Mage BoPed and wrecking havoc*
---
*Unstoppable warriors with freedom*
---
*Virgin shaman panick purging off trash/paladin buffs and not the BoPs/Freedoms, and if they get lucky the warrior pops a FAP and the mage a LIP*
---
*Dwarf priests giving fear immunes*
---
*Paladins cleansing everyones problems away*
---
"but the racials"
---
The first 2 months or so of the game people would link greens in general chat for the zone and others would  love it. Way back then, most people didn't even know all of the prefixes and suffixes in the game, so we wouldn't really know what items were. Plus, if you had named items like "Eric's Mallet" then people REALLY didn't know what it was.
---
We used to brag about every thing. I remember being the first level 11 and 13 character in my server (cenarion circle!) and always checking out other peoples stuff they'd find. The energy was always high and relatively positive. No one was burnt out on any aspects of the game so people found content either engaging, or they'd just ignore it. I honestly wish we could have our memories of in-game knowledge wiped so we could play the game fresh again.
---
Good. I hope that your awful experience (and mine, and a million other peoples') creates an appreciation for classic WoW on day 1 and persists for years.
---
I feel like the rate of spawns is alot higher tho.. I never have a problem killing mobs.. and if theres a mob objective elite I need to kill I can get a group quick
---
Oh my god thats scarlet monastery gear right?! I’m having flashbacks of my first main rn 
---
Yeah, rushing to 60 in WoW would be like trying to marathon every marvel movie, harry potter movie, and LOTR extended editions. You don't go in thinking "YEAH IMA BURN THROUGH THIS", you instead say "lets..... focus on what's in front of me instead".
---
Yes this is the turtle way. Everyone sitting around twiddling thumbs up they ass and never actually winning.
---
I agree with you, and I dont think the guy arguing with you has any experience with vanilla and the specific items we are talking about. There is a massive massive difference between edgemasters and a BoP item worth 1-2g at the vendor. Hunters cant even use edgemasters, and he called out hunter as the class in this discussion about BoE mail gloves worth 1000g.. in which we are obviously referring to edgemasters.. which makes it super clear to me that hes coming from a place of ignorance. The same would go for any other valuable BoE, like a freezing band, or a Foror's Compendium in Dire Maul. 
---
This is not even something that is up for debate, this is the very normal and standard way of doing things. If you expect to just be able to roll on and take an item worth THOUSANDS of gold, then you are expected to call it "Reserved" when recruiting people for the party, so they know what is up. 99% of the community rolls need on BoE loot. In the very very rare occasion that its an item that someone really can use, and its cheap AH trash that only sells for 5g or so, like a bow with poor speed and no stats -- then and only then will someone be allowed to just take it. And EVEN THEN, they will be asked by the party to equip it in front of everyone to prove that they need it.
---
I am not sharing my opinion btw, these are facts about the etiquette towards very vaulable BoE items from my experience playing for a few years on many different times leveling.
---
I guess there is not that much info to give out, it’s not like the game is going to have many surprises in it. Each dev day would be mainly bug fixes etc.
---
I think princess lives above me in my apt building. 
---
Aussie as well, will probably go horde because I’ve spent so much time playing alliance on retail too. 
---
The faction I'm choosing is gnome.  
---
He’s ally and it’s lvl 60 killing lvl 20s. So he basically wipes the whole town without even really doing anything lol
---
I agree, the classes felt really unique and fun in vanilla. I think tbc made this even better with useful buffs by every spec. 
---
Just so you know, there is a concept you don't seem to be grasping, it's that the time it takes also depends on how many ressources you allocate to the project. We usually talk in man.hours, for exemple, a 1000h project for one person becomes a 500h project for 2 persons. Yes, this project might not have that many hours required. But it is a really small team working on it. 
---
You could always go Engineering to help negate some of those annoying kiters. Being able to stun someone from a distance or charge someone with the Rocket Helm is great
---
"I cannot even comprehend the idea that you could be a dick to someone else in a computer game. I mean... it's a computer game... so how can you be a dick? It's impossible, obviously. It makes no sense. On any level. Never in all the history of video games has anyone been a dick. It's a contradiction in terms."
---
4 days 20 hours is world record pace. 6 days is far from it. 
---
I roll on all the loot cause it levels enchanting pretty quickly from disenchanting items that way. Dont jave to use any materials for quite a few levels
---
Hey there Red-Parthat. One thing to keep in mind is that it is a long process to level. In classic, the slow leveling combined with the gradual addition of new spells and talents gives you time to learn how and when to use these abilities. Don't worry about being overwhelmed, you've got plenty of time to figure out how to play while leveling. Also there will be a TON of guides on literally everything you could ever imagine once the game is released. Goodluck! I suggest you just play what looks most fun :) 
---
It's a different type of gaming and there is nothing wrong with that. Me personally I want that rival guild to show up outside of blacrock spire type of chaos.
---
And yet Alliance premades wreck horde premades.  
---
You may not personally like pvp servers and pick a pve server, which is absolutely fine. You can then go on to enjoy the game your way and everyone is happy. However...
---
The potential maximum experience that vanilla wow has to offer can only be achieved in a pvp server, simply because removing the open-world pvp dynamic takes variety out of the game. Fun is subjective, the amount of possible things you can do in a game is not. 
---
BRUH Imma let you finish, but undead rouges are the most pwntastic PvP force of ALL time.
---
hey. great vid. 
---
at 4:57 - 4:59ish, there is an AoE like spell that is shot toward the horde from just off the right side of the screen. it looks like a frost multi-shot. can anyone identify what the attack is? 
---
&gt;On retail in oce alliance is the dominate faction
---
Tell that to Barthilas.
---
Geta usually have 2 stubs underneath, she's holding her balance with just one on top of being super obese, that's skills yo  :p
---
They're good (though overrated) in 1v1s but suck real bad in battlegrounds and Group PvP.
---
1v1s aren't winning world bosses.
---
thanks i will take engineering into even more consideration
---
Amen brother.
---
I feel like everyone here is forgetting the whole damn point of having two factions. The horde and are alliance are at war. They are enemies. It shouldn't be fair. PVE is for those that don't like this aspect. Fine have at it. Many of us relish the war theme and rivalry all game.  It's such a important aspect of the story it would be weird with such restrictions being on a pvp server. It's perfect as is imo.
---
They can't even animate hair or cloaks correctly and you want them to add Flails? Lol gl with that.
---
After reading your post I felt so nostalgic, I went and bought the soundtrack. So many memories rushing back!
---
This happend to be at ZF except I was the war and got the epic sword from that place aswell.
---
Also played alliance for ages. Looking forward to a different levelling experience as horde! 
---
Warrior doesn't need support to be good in 1v1s. Most people that play warrior aren't thinking to the classes true potential. Charge is a low cool down, you can drop combat and re-use it for interrupts. Same with intercept. Mortal strike is great against Paladins/Druids but you're still going to have a hard time against them due to their high sustain.
---
With the right setup and spells, you can take down hunters and mages with no problems.
---
There's TONS of utility that goes unused with a warrior.
---
please source. i get my classic wow info from this sub only (clearly a mistake) and need info. 
---
Your right. It's best you stay off the pvp servers.
---
both
---
Ideally I'd want something that is white and looks longer than your average cloak or cape.
---
I will be streaming but no one is going to know what server I'm on.
---
Wish there were more more ultra rare droppable mounts. I dont want them added in really. More like i wish they'd been in since the beginning.
---
Popular streamers attract huge crowds of players around the streamer. If you are around them, you'll get lag. If the crowds get large enough, they can crash the server
---
Check it out - it's called a PvE server.
---
Can I have some context as to what I need to be growing up for?
---
If the "real experience" entails some screeching autistic 12 year old camping my alt's level 12 corpse with their level 60, or some angry virgin basement dwelling fatass neckbeard manchild, I'll just stick with the "watered down" PvE servers, thanks.
---

Good things take a long time otherwise anyone could do them.
---
You have it backwards, though. Those failures and frustrations are important because that it what makes the successes meaningful.
---
If the game was so streamlined that you never failed and nothing required much time (i.e. retail wow), then you would get bored and quit.
---
/spit was a legit command, you didn't need to type /me

I see the appeal of PvP servers(heck I play on then myself too). I also understand if there is person who has, lets say, two hours time to play max. per day. That person might not want to get forced into hour+ pvp session where he/she cannot progress their own journey/character. 
---
paladin
---
I don't actually PvP to kill people. I pvp to troll them. 
---
When they are hearthing out. Ill always cast to stop them. But I wont follow up.
---
Im surprised they arnt doing 24-48 hour "BETA" tests every month just to keep people subbed, probably would drive a lot of people back to retail and would of course increase likely store purchases.       
---
I mean fuck id sub just for 20 level cap for a day!
---
Camping lake shire. It's one of the first contested zones all alliance get funneled into. Once I hit 60, I did this for about a week straight. People COULDN'T LEVEL. It was great.
---
Eventually someone would run off to Stormwind and get a bunch of 60s to come and fight me. Then a bunch of other horde 60s would show up and it'd be a giant war.
---
Highlights just how far MMOs have fallen that having someone help you with 1 specific thing is being social... hope to god Pantheon pans out and they put an end to the “solo 90% group 10% design”

I had that on my mage, first epic, rocked it forever, thanks for the memory.

I ran WOW BC back in the day on a Mac Book Pro, it had a GT 8600m and a dual core CPU at 2.4ghz and ran fine. The Air 2018 has about 2x the GPU and better CPU (newer architecture and higher top speed). 
---
Two things are important:
---
-Make sure you laptop doesn’t thermal throttle, simply buying a laptop stand with two fans and some elevation will do wonders. 
---
-Check both Mac and windows versions (With Bootcamp). Many games still run better with bootcamp than the native Mac versions. 
---
I feel like it would have been so bad, that it would have become iconic. 
---
Fair enough, seems like a good reason to avoid them.
---
Bruuuuh this is so funny to me because im not trolling 😂
---
OooOOooh gotta log in before your ears get blown off 
---
I dont play retail dude. I play Vanilla and have done that almost daily for many years now.
---
I cant imagine anything more cruel to new players than to recommend them to play "what looks cool and all specs are fun in raids" and bullshit like that when they will realize their mistake after 300h played and are forever stuck.
---
From the perspective of the warrior or the clothies?
---
Bruh D2 did it just fine.  
---
He was the only one that needed the items.  It's not like he was preventing us from getting our gear.
---
You can assume that.
---
All they needed to do was add the Ravasaur trainer quest line and mount in Un'goro. Considering the dude is already in the game.  
---
Maybe a very rare wolf drop from Thrall, and a very rare horse drop from Bolvar or whoever.  
---
poor lil feller
---
Throwing sticks of dynamite into fish pools people were fishing out of.

I feel so despondent after reading that.

I doubt someone that have work and other stuff to do outside playing will have a 2nd char.

Imagine you have a kid who has a hard time learning stuff. So you and your wife/husband help him study so he can get good grades. You grind and try and learn with him. This forms a bond between all of you. And when your kid gets good grades, you'd be like "Oh my god, I can't believe it!! I'm so proud of you!!! Let's go get a big pizza!"
---
Now imagine your kid is a genius and he doesn't need any of your help studying. He's just breezing through school. You'd be like "You're a genius. I'm proud of you."
---
 /me spits on you. would display the emote for everyone as if you spit on everyone around you.

STV Master zone. 
---
If I want it I'm rolling on it, I don't care what it is. I will be upfront with the group beforehand though. For example, if Spirit is as powerful on retail as it is on Lightbringer, my warrior is taking ALL the spirit gear, idgaf.
---
I know. And *no news* whatsoever other than a semi-confirmed summer date. I can’t wait 5+ more months! 😖
---
What a classy gent.
---
I’m based here in Australia as well and will be part of the Alliance. 
---
Gnomes 4Eva!!! 
---
So refreshing to see non-politically correct players.  LOL
---
Yeah, I've never really understood the draw into ganking low level people, unless you're trying to start a bigger fight.  But it will happen, a lot.
---
I was a warlock class lead on a pserver and I always  rolled into the raid with 2x 28 slot soul bags full of shards (we only had 3 locks and the other 2 weren't reliable). I would farm them from the level 50-51 ogres on the mountain in Searing Gorge and never spent more than 20 or 25 minutes farming them 2 or 3 times a week. It's really not bad and you often get greens to sell/disenchant or runecloth for Band-Aids which you always need.
---
Such a tough guy
---
I got the "itch" so bad that there wasn't enough Vanilla Content on Youtube... so now I make my own videos in an attempt to fill the void :( 
---
The addiction got so strong today that I had to start on an undocumented server to calm my brain down. I will probably continue playing...
---
Aussie here and rolling Horde!
---
yup, twas youtube tho
---
You will not top the meters that is completely right, but you have to take into account that you also do 10-15% of the warlocks damage, and that doesn't show on the meters. I dont get the downvotes tho, I've played private servers and seen shadow priests hovering around the 10-13th spot on dps metres, and that's without taking shadow weaving into account. The only real problem for shadow priests is their mana management, which is somewhat awful, like boomkins, although boomkins have innervate som maybe worse even (if you get to use it on yourself that is).
---
Alliance, my wife doesn't like horde. Dwarf ret paladin incoming!
---
mind control the target and let him blow a 5 min cooldown
---
dispel
---
already dispelled
---
silence
---
maybe throw in a mana burn here and there and let's see how well they fare while oom... and that's just one class. paladins are cute, durable, and easy to play. sadly, easy to outplay, too.
---
Fwiw listening to the customers is how you get Retail.
---
You want servers dominated by a faction with the other faction unable to turn in their onyxia attunement? Because that's how you get Thrall/Bolvar camped 24/7.
---
Not at all. The thing with classic/ vanilla is that levelling isn't just something you need to get through before reaching the "real game". It's a huge part of the game (at least 50%, if you ask me) and will require you to explore each zone just to find some of the quests. If you want to keep going after you hit 60, more power to you. It's a big world; you have quite the adventure ahead of you
---
I have 2 friends (48 and 49 lvl) that killed a 60 shaman, they started to camp his body until he took it from the spirit healer.
---
Is a poison talented rogue viable? With debuff limits to consider and the damage it does. Never played classic but that's the first choice spec for me.
---
Alliance, but all of my friends are playing horde. 
---
I just want to have again hunter with meld and the amount of undead rogues/mages will be huge for sure.
---
I know trolls and orc can get to ratchet/bb at level 1 plus there is the zeppelin alowing you to do tirisfal and some are around grom'gol as well.
---
Tauren are probably unlucky as getting though barren can be tough but maybe there's some good death spot to die for spirit rez?
---
Horde exploration runs are less common because the human one is easy and quick. The human one has been done dozens of times in videos and guides do horde ones would be much better to have.
---
Sounds unhealthy. 
---
Meanwhile melee damage isn't avoided nearly as much, so if 5-6 level 20-30s gank on a melee 60, they actually have a chance. But a level 20-30 mage can do fuck all.
---
Westfall music is the GOAT. 
---
It was like that in Classic. But I have to admit, I dont expect heavy SS farming for so many healthstones to be a thing in BWL or MC for Classic.... Now AQ and Naxx? yeah..
---
Stage 2 is way too much content. Implementing BWL+ZG+BGs (and the whole ranking system) all at once is going to make it a massive shitshow.
---
It would be much better to stagger content but we just have to wait and see if Blizz changes their minds on how content is released.
---
Man I just like the horde zones so much more. The alliance have it nice from levels 1-30 with how close they are, but man the horde zones just kick ass all around 
---
If the /sit won't work, is it still useful to level with Fury ?
---
You need to go play Vermintide 2. Viktor Saltspyre's got a nice selection of heavy spikey things on chains for much splattage of heretic skulls.
---
But I agree, always loved flails, and they look great on the D3 crusader. I don't believe blizz at the time of early 2000's WoW could have done a good job with their animations, but the current art team could.
---
Honestly I'm thinking they'll be following their current six month patch cycle. Stage 1 is launch, stage 2 is 6months after launch, stage 3 is 6 months after stage 2, stage 4 is 6 months after stage 3
---
I’d say one new event per month would be pretty cool. Start with MC, then kazzak, then azuregos, then dire mail, then Onyxia, then bgs, then zg, then bwl, then green dragons, then silithus content, then aq, then scourge invasion, then naxx.
---
Starts slow, ends fast. Player base will be at its peak at the start, hold back the content a little to keep people interested. Towards the end, when lots of players have left, release the final content to keep people around/make people come back. 
---
Why does this read like it's written by someone who got like a 10 minute primer on the game but has never actually played? A 'really hard quest that you can't do with your gear?' A people glowing epic staff with +5 str that a priest would roll on? This sounds like something my mom would write.
---
&gt; VERY strong cooldowns
---
Druid is the last class I think of when I think of "strong cooldowns". Rogues with prep and PoM-Pyro mages have strong cooldowns. Druids just win a slow fight of attrition and run away when they bite more than they can chew.
---
The debate rages on.. not to mention how handy the portals will be in classic. But warlocks get cheap mount at 40 
---
I'm pretty sure that's just the Chris Metzen version.
---
As a joke a friend posted my home phone number in trade chat and said the first 5 people to call me would get 1k gold each, had so many people calling my phone it was nonstop ringing, the second I hung up it would start ringing again, was funny until the death threats came :\
---
same here. now i am playing there every weekend for some hours with fully rested xp. i thought it would maybe "spoil" my experience in summer, but i dont have that feeling yet.
---
[I fixed this for you.](https://imgflip.com/i/2uu8k4)
---
my first char in bc was alliance (human wl). after that i only played horde. will go back to alliance in summer. 
---
People often cite WotF as being a really good PvP racial (and it is) but in WPvP (specifically, large groups vs large groups) it's not as significant because what generally decides who wins those encounters is 90% players, consumables and gear - or in short, **burst damage**. If you ever watch a BRM guild ganking another or any world boss fight where there's fewer than 3-4 guilds contesting, you'll see that when the fight actually starts it ends in half a minute at most. 
---
That being said, one of the ways people do this is by using Goblin Sapper Charges. It's an engineering item that deals some damage to you and then a bit more damage to all enemies nearby. Paladins can mitigate the self inflicted damage with Divine Shield, thus they could basically just run into your raid and use sapper charges at will, and there was nothing you could do but run from them or try to bait it out somehow because they were immune to everything while doing it. Horde can do that too with some consumables but it's way more costly. 
---
In Legion I mained priest and would occasionally go to low level areas to check for low level pvp. If it was 1v1 I wouldn't do anything, neither if my own faction initiated the fight. If it was 2v1 however I'd fly down and put a shield on the poor guy they were ganking. I didn't kill the enemies, just merely kept shielding the lowbie, so the enemies could either keep chopping but this time on a pretty much invulnerable target, or they could leg it.
---
Helped the friend but without actually killing the enemy lowbies, felt it was a pretty fun and "fair" way of breaking up a ganking.
---
*Hi human!* It's your **5th Cakeday** CptJonzzon! ^(hug)
---
The game's not balanced, and there's no point in competing with other classes, though.
---
u gotta watch some druid video as that description isn't accurate at all
---
&gt; This isn't true. The warlock point you made is more complicated. In 1v1 WOTF makes Alliance warlocks worse. That being said eventually you get fat enough to where a 5 second fear immune isn't going to break you in any way. That being said horde lock is still better in 1v1.
---
WoTF isn't what makes alliance warlocks suck.
---
Lack of orc racial is what makes alliance warlocks suck.
---
Also tremor totem.
---
The only time I got salty was when a hunter rolled need for a blue dagger against my shaman :(
---
you are  intentionally ignoring the difference between BoP and BoE items.
---
Well what else do you want? They already told us our plans on what may be different or about the few weeks of sharding. 
---
What can they show that will not be controversial? Because face it this community and a lot of people in general like to be dramatic
---
Having DM from stage 1 is Also a mistake
---
Or who entered the instance first.
---
This, just cant understand why people complain so much about that feeding thing. As far as I remember it really was not that big of a deal.
---
People believed that Tier 1 was good raiding gear for every class. It drops from the "hardest content", it must be good, right ?
---
I would have it like this:  
---
Stage 0 (launch): MC, Ony
---
Stage 1: Kazzak, Azuregos, DM, BWL
---
Stage 2: ZG, Tier 0.5, Green Dragons
---
Stage 3: Silithus Content, AQ20, AQ40
---
Stage 4: Scourge Invasion, Naxx  
---
I keep overthinking which class to play (that’s what this thread is for right?) What is everyone else gonna roll? Will I get a raid spot with x class?
---
But.. we have no idea which patch classic will be, if it’ll be 1.13, etc. the more I think about it it seems less unlikely that classic will just be 1.12 forever. Are they gonna dump so much money into a game and then keep balance and progression stagnant after Naxx? I just feel like there’s no way.
---
I’m just not sure how solid our wisdom is about which specs are raid viable, how they’ll do in pvp, etc. We can make some pretty good guesses but I think things will end up being pretty different from pservers.
---
All that to say I think I’m gonna relax some of my assumptions and just pick the class I think is the most fun.
---
Simple as that.
---
I sure hope you’re right. I really want to roll hunter but folks around here have me worried about both endgame pvp and pve 
---
I see, interesting. I’m not claiming you did btw, just a bit of brewikg and speculation...a dog’s gotta gnaw right. 
---
You're right, seems I had a brainfart. This actually means that both Orc and Tauren lack a defensive magic dispel, which neuters their Warriors hard. I'd still put Orc above Tauren, just because Tauren lacks any proper caster DPS, and Druids barely function as a 2nd healer anyway. Much rather just stack Shamans instead.
---
&gt; Playing the AH is a great way to afk some money. Scan every hour, and set alerts for items that drop below a certain threshold.
---
how can you do that?
---
One year? You’re just speeding up the death of the first servers. 
---
Most players are gonna take their time playing and leveling alts, i agree that they should stagger content, but I say no Naxx for close to 2 years is a much better way to go.
---
Certain add-ons can do this with the Legion Api. I wont/can't give an explanation here. But it should be possible. If not, then it would be up to the player to search for the items they care about after the scans, to determine which items have been posted below average
---
The problen of Scholomance isn’t whether it should be 10 or 5 man (it should be 5), but Dire Maul invalidating it too early in the cycle. 
---
It takes skills to pawn 5v1. Mad skillzzzz
---
Multiboxers suck so hard they need several chars synced to win.
---
The more chars a multiboxers has the harder they suck at 1v1
---
Sometimes a force of nature comes through and fucks your day up.  That's just life.
---
KOS
---
Why you say 5+ months. Isn't it at the latest 5 months?
---
If they stick to "summer 2019" then its coming out between 3 and 6 months.
---
To be exact summer starts on june 21st and ends on september 23rd. So between exactly 16 weeks and 29 weeks.😭😭😭😭😭 i want to sleep till then😔
---
I’m not so sure, I feel like you could lose a lot of players that way. Personally, I’d be ok with it. But I don’t think servers will die any time soon after naxx. It will be hard to clear. I think they’re more likely to lose players on the wait for naxx. 
---
Trash buffs are proactive and dispels are reactive. You're the one using GCDs in the fight, not the defender.
---
Everything you're saying about priest dispels (used offensively) is MORE effective on alliance due to the lack of paladin buffs (and horde has to dispel/purge TWICE if they use FAPs/LIPs while horde ONLY has FAPs/LIPs).
---
Above two points are insane deals when sapper charges are the meta and the stakes are a world boss.
---
Mind control has a 20/24 yard range and heals have 40, you have to push through the front lines get the 3 second cast, and then have it not be dispelled by a priest/have them sit it (while you're out in the open, and if they do use bubble they *still* get to free cast).
---
Silence has a 20/24 yard range and if you're using it because a paladin is cleansing you've got issues. (Did you know another paladin/priest can dispel/cleanse the silence too?)
---
Mana burn has range issues compared to heals (-10) as well and has a cast. Let hunters take this job (oh I guess paladins can cleanse that too...).
---
(Mind control and Silence might be 20 yard range even w/ Shadow Reach in classic, reading the talent it doesn't seem like they should be effected but they are on private servers)
---
They shouldn’t, they should do what’s best for the game.
---
I always assume worst case scenario so I won’t be disappointed 😩 because Activision. 
---
That's like saying in wartime that the other soldier can't attack you, cause he has a M60 and you have a handgun.

24.0 yards ≈ 21.9 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)

Lol, why would it be bad..?
---
Bitch got style
---
Make sure you hit Searing Gorge at 48.  It's real easy to go from 48-52 before you hit and then most of the content is to easy.
---
Druid do have a strong opener that can almost one shot clothies unless they have ton of stamina if it crit (just wait for them to sit down and have a drink for a guaranteed crit). 
---
Other than that yes it is slow.
---
You can take engineering to deal with that.
---
what is the problem? He says "what do you guys think", and girls respond.
---
That's why I play on a PvP server. I *love* exploring and PvPing in the remotest places of Azeroth. Gank some alliance in the Plaguewood and sure enough, some guildies will show up.
---
Plaguewood is probably my absolute favorite part of Lordaeron and it's a pity, there is not much of interest there.   
---
Therefore I make the interest myself.
---
Or Lionheart.
---
those are sandals you weebr
---
a certain dipshit pissed me and a few friends off during an instance run by pulling recklessly, generally being an gigantic asshole and ninja looting just to finish it all off. bad idea...
---
I was playing a priest, who have a wonderful, wonderful spell - mind vision. it lets you see whatever the target is seeing and can be cast on anybody as long as you're in the same *continent*. makes it very easy to track down people... or watch their every step.
---
the fuckery started mildly: a few guys following him, sheeping mobs, disrupting his pulls, pissing off high level players then leading them back to him, that sort of stuff... and went on until we made the guy basically experience schizophrenia.
---
he messes up a pull while leveling, nearly dies, suddenly gets a message "your mother must be disappointed for giving birth to such a failure". a lower level alliance rogue ganks him, another message from a different player "you should be ashamed of yourself". he's dueling in front of Orgrimmar, "you know you're going to lose. you're not good at anything. don't you wish you were never born?". all messages from different characters, all level 1, all in the starting zones. 
---
this went on for weeks... whenever one of us was semi-bored, I'd mind vision the guy, watch him for a bit, then the whispers in the back of his head would start again.
---
I wish I had a proper, dramatic ending, but after a while, we never saw him again... he might have name changed, transferred, quit wow, or have gotten committed to an insane asylum, we'll never know... I don't even remember the guys name anymore. but it was certainly fun while it lasted.
---
tl;dr: don't be an asshole, even your own faction can grief you to shit.
---
flails OF HAIR!!!!
---
Yes!! That’s exactly what I want 
---
more tittaes/sacks
---
aoe loot or proper guild support.  nothing else. 
---
Rag didn't die for the first time until a 1.5 months after DM was even added. For the vast majority of players DM made very little difference. There was only 104 days (3 1/3 months) from US launch until DM was added. Europe was like a month.
---
You don't have neutral point of view, you just flame. And i have been studying as developer, so thanks for the advice 
---
WoW took 4 to 5 years to be created from scratch but they are working on Classic for 3 years ? They only reason is probably due to a too small team. Else YOU are indirectly saying that they are bad.
---
With pfui it’s absolutelu impossible to miss as your pets health bar turns yellow. Toss mr kitty a fish and keep grinding, not rocket science lmao
---
&gt; semi-confirmed summer date
---
At this point it is unconfirmed - unless they said something new.  
---
The last statement by Blizzard only said "in 2019" and pointedly did not say "Summer 2019".  It's seems very possible they will not release in summer, given that they were unable to confirm or restate that launch is in summer.  
---
People need to ask Blizzard for confirmation. If they refuse to confirm, then we know the summer release is not a given anymore, and they are considering releasing after August.
---
With most games it’s safe to assume they’ll blow the release date. 
---
No, you’re not allowed to just explore. You’re obligated to PvE. Jesus these questions on this sub
---
Sadly that is quite true😣
---
Damn, that's the vanilla spirit!
---
Well, thats exactly what hes doing by going to a PvE server?
---
All horde is is people whining about alliance in my experience.
---
Well we don't know any details. Workforce size, how much work is required to get the game to run under the modern infrastructure and code base.
---
It's like asking someone how long it takes to build a house. With no more information about the house and the people involved in building it it's an impossible question to answer.
---
this depends on how well the tank is, the only way a hunter tops dps in ony is with a below average tank
---
Yes
---
*How hard it was to get into a raiding guild and the extreme comittment it took. You had to be available for 2-3 times a week for about 5 hours each time.*
---
Actually this kind of raid shedule is pretty mild and casual xD During the first weeks of a new raid released I had to raid 10/24 7/7, and keep at least one alt geared and prepared. That was WotLK, Cata and MoP.
---
Well to be exact happiness drops when u dissmiss it. Not loyalty. So u need to feed it right away after summoning it again or loyalty drops
---
If you are the very first to find titanic leggings when they get introduced and you spend the next two days at the blacksmith crafting leggings and make a profit of 15.000gold, then yes, trading is fun.
---
Here here. I’d rather not be in a world where horde and alliance are waving as they pass each other on the paths to their own little quests. 
---
Holy fucking shit, there are so many triggered babies I cant believe it. I can't believe people actually think PvP server = ganking and nothing else. PvP = fun at least 3 times more than ganking =  grief.
---
M'good princess 
---
Even before 1.10 people cleared Scholo/Strat/LBRS as a 5 man group even though it was possible to do it with 10 man. They did it because it was faster and safer and you could get potentially more loot per time unit. 
---
They were balanced for 5 man even though it was very hard if your group wasn‘t geared that good but it was possible!
---
I like half of your opinions, however... If youre locked out of raids, have your professions at max, and no reps to farm... The game is about PvP. You raid to get stronger. You get stronger to kill people better, not to farm raids slightly more efficiently.
---
Woooooooooooooooooooot
---
It was then clarified to still be summer 2019
---
dude, I have played a paladin healer and I have played even more against paladin healers. they are one of the easiest classes to lock down.
---
dispels are something you throw around nonstop anyway, so you can get rid of trash buffs - not that most players put any up, mind you.
---
you don't mind control the paladin, you mind control whoever they're healing - you can often even predict when they're going to bubble. my memory might be foggy, but iirc, you can't cleanse anything on hostiles (aka your buddy under mind control), your best bet would be running to the priest and hitting them with HoJ, but you sure as shit won't be healing.
---
then there's the whole cast time on all heals bit (hello, silence/spell lock/pummel/earth shock/whatever, oh, also curse of tongues), the absolute lack of mobility (or, to be more precise, you're either healing or moving) and... let's just say you're vastly overestimating their abilities. or, to be more precise: holy paladins are really good and useful, but a good player can fuck with them in the most infuriating ways possible.
---
ps: I honestly can't understand how "bubble" isn't a meme by now... it has a 5 minute fucking cooldown, very few paladin fight will end with it giving them even a slight bit of edge.
---
It's always a sight to behold two warriors charging each other and keep walking, just to gain them sweet 25yards.
---
So just never release battlegrounds?
---
I don't understand why it's taking so long tbh... Its not like its a new game. 
---
Everyone make mistakes
---
I know, right? That dude was drunk on the sheer power of paying five times as much as everyone else to win 5v1 fights. You get the very strong feeling that there is no other aspect of his life in which he gets to feel powerful.
---
Kind of worried about RP honestly. Got quite a few years of questionable lore I don't know. 
---
It's pretty simple on a new server. Get as many 60s as quickly as you can and start raiding. If you get to 60 fast and play well and treat people well on the server it'll be easy to attract players. Do your homework so you know all the fights inside out and so raids are fast and drama free. Work out your raid times, what's to be expected gear/consumable/discord wise and how loot will work. Get to know everyone in your guild, it'll be very obvious who you can trust and you can rely on to do things. Give people a bit of leeway but when necessary don't be afraid to kick players causing drama or wasting peoples time.
---
Thank you.
---
The vanilla^(tm) experience is not only raiding end content, besides that, people will need time to equip, remember 40 people (with bosses droping 4-5 items) to at least half-equip before even trying next tier, things need to be spaced out in my opinion.
---
overcrowded private servers.  
---
it will happend on retail aswell of course, just not as much.
---
Yeah, hasn't had World Buffs (but every other available buff there is!) ..  
---
Should see his Vael Kill with worldbuffs. 1.6k dps lol
---
Disclaimer: I have not been a guild master myself, but have played in many guilds at various levels, and have several friends that have run guilds. So this is a combo of "what would I like a guild master to be" and "this is what I heard were the struggles as a GM". 
---
I think a good start is finding your core members - in a more ideal scenario this will be people you've known for longer that you know you can trust, so IRL friends, or long time gaming buddies. 
---
  
---
Not only will it allow you to sanity-check your ideas of how to run the guild before imposing your new rules on a bunch of people you don't know, it will also help you reduce any unwanted guild drama. In my experience, the worst kinds of guild drama (or well any drama really) occurs when management isn't agreeing, and is calling each other out. 
---
Having a homogeneous management group in the guild, will make it easier to get started, I would think. It also means that you can "outsource" some of your tasks to the other guys in the team - arguably your main role as the guild leader should be communicating to guild members, keeping people motivated, answering questions, etc. If you spend all of your time of running the guild website, planning the raid schedule, and so on, you might not have time to do the stuff that makes your guild nice to be in for its members. 
---
You also need to decide for yourself if you wanna be the raid leader and guild leader, or just guild leader. I've seen many guilds where drama started as a result of some members being unhappy with other members (especially officers') performance in raids, in combination with the higher amount of loot they might get. 
---
Some of the non-optimal extreme scenarios I'd say you should avoid as a guild leader are: being basically just a front figure, that doesn't deliver anything to the raid, but gets all the loot - that's the most certain way of having "mutiny"; you obviously also wanna avoid being the guy that makes all the calls (e.g. raid leader &amp; main tank), but doesn't really have the experience to back it up, and finally, depending on the ambition level, I've also experienced guild leaders that are too hardcore - so that everyone that didn't keep up with their extremely high performance was looked down on (I find that this most often happens with the main tank + raid leader + guild master types) - this might work in a super hardcore guild, but in most other cases it's pretty demotivating.   
---
Just my two cents :) 
---
KoS.   This is War bruh especially Nelfs 
---
Stop bodyshaming her guys. This plump goddess has financed my epic mounts in the past. Be respectful.
---
Stabled pet never runs away no matter what happiness it was when stabled.
---
Last time I ventured through STV I saw a 41 orc hunter killing a 35 fellow alli. Ofcourse I intervened.
---
There is unfortunately no way balance ever does 90% of a competent raider's damage, even if he farmed consumables for a week straight.
---
I really wish game companies would stop using seasons as dates... not all of us live in the northern hemisphere.
---
Right here with you
---
Nice tin-foil hat bro.
---
Hopefully people stop whining about it now.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics
---
That shit would likely give major delays to release date. It takes an amount og developer hours unequal to zero to have a playable beta.
---
Exactly! people didn't fuck up methods mythic progress so they are not going to target random no bodies on a classic server.
---
Doubtful. Esfand complained about it again in this ClassiCast 30 minutes after Caden explained how it worked. A lot of people are probably too set in their ways, they've already decided that it's a bad thing without even knowing how it actually works.
---
"We want progressive itemisation and not like click report"... the same as every cast.
---
In PvE, both are pretty similar I'd say - you just spam your one spell, while managing your mana in the most try-hard way you can. I'd you're going alliance, there'll likely be significantly more demand for warlocks than mages, as warlock players don't wanna deal with the undead racial in PvP. 
---
For PvP both can be pretty strong. I'd say Mage is easier to get pretty good with, whereas locks take some experience and gear before they start really doing well in PvP. I think both have very high potential once you get really good. 
---
My personal opinion is that locks are way cooler :) 
---
Ok, I'm gay.
---
Oh, I agree that raiding isn’t everything. I plan on spending a lot of time pvping. But does the release schedule for raid content affect non raiders at all, regardless of it being a 1 or 2 year cycle? 
---
Duskwood, you left out Duskwood ... how could you?
---
Drives me crazy haha but yeah its set in stone now I guess.
---
I have a Addon for showing me when my pet is unhappy, pretty useful 
---
&gt;I mean fuck id sub just for 20 level cap for a day!
---
people actually blizzconed once for a tiny part of the level 20 cap...
---
What I'm concerned about, is the datamined database. If that's really what's in the game, then they're copy-pasting every quest by hand. That would explain the delays and lack of communication.
---
While it didn't make a difference on retail that doesn't mean they have to go with the same route. DM being blizzlike delayed on pservers has been a really good thing.
---
This title is literally what my parents have been shouting at me for years 
---
I read the title thinking someone was in the closet.
---
The Stage plan from Blizzard is perfect. BGs are not the ranking system. I used to play the exact same timeline on a successfull private server. 
---
Frostmourne has a much bigger pop compared to barthilas doesn’t it?
---
OKay but that's like literally 0.001% of streamers that are actually popular enough to have "crowds" around them and everyone in this thread is shittalking every and any streaming of classic wow.
---
Indeed, and the return of Master loot / DKP will see to that :D
---
Nobody was speedrunning leveling when vanilla came out. Nowadays players rush to max in just a few days.
---
Unfortunately not. Poison shiv rogue was technically viable (read: suboptimal) in TBC due to shiv, but never in classic.
---
&gt;summer starts on june 21st and ends on september 23rd
---
in my country, summer starts on April 25, and ends on October 26th. And, I guess Blizzard WILL release Classic in Iceland, because why not? That gives them a lot of time...
---
The most important thing is that you need to have trustworthy people that you can split responsibilities too. Also get a pessimistic advocatus diaboli. That way you won’t be overburdened and see problems from different angles. 
---
but with Activision, you won't get the release date
---
Or in situations like the op is talking about where the hunter gets an early ash. Or maybe simply the hunter doesn't get hit by conflags and the melee dps have a few more whelps to deal with due to bad luck and/or a noob.
---
If they release diremaul sooner than 3 months it will be a disaster. Your average person who works a job will take a few months minimum to hit max level. By launching with diremaul you're effectively robbing those players of content.
---
Mehta, that wouldn't take too long. 
---
One intern doing ~100 quests an hour for like 3 weeks could do it.
---
And by the time you log in your main and go to the zone, the ganker is already gone.
---
No green dragons until AQ is interesting.
---
Takes me back to when World of Warcraft was originally being developed. Even to this day I haven't forgotten about the immense anxiety I felt in anticipation of both Warcraft III and World of Warcraft. Any fantasy and medieval media I saw, instead of its origin, all I saw was Warcraft. Morrowind and Lord of the Rings helped soothe the ache, thankfully.
---
No spring and autumn in iceland? Is it 6 months of summer 6 months of winter?
---
&gt; **I blast the original WoW soundtrack on the speakers at work once a week for 3 hours** 
---
Friday, somewhere in north Europe. Am I right?
---
Stabled pets last indefinitely. You'll need to keep feeding whichever pet you keep out but once they're max loyalty it's pretty much like once every coue hours and if they die, which is almost nothing.
---
 Engineering is indeed a must have for any kind of pvp. And pretty much yes, no one want to stay close to a warrior, even rogue kite you to wait for energy. You can always use free action potion, they're very strong.
---
That's the things with warrior, you need everything to make it work if you're solo. Also, fury is really less effective than arms.
---
Vanilla is great because regardless of what type of player you are there's something for you. Are you a tryhard who wants to squeeze every last % out of your character? There's always something more you could be doing to increase performance. Are you a casual who just wants to mindlessly spam one button and still win? You can do that too.
---
Rogue HAS to be gnome. xD
---
It's the last day of summer 2019 now. Though I suppose it is summer 2019 again in 9 months and 1 day. 
---
It's my feeling after playing one, i don't really care for those vid of full t3/r14 people, that's not the game you and i are going to play.
---
Hi,
---
I was the class lead of a top raiding guild on Kronos (private server). Soul shard farming adds about 15 minutes to your raid time on a standard raid to farm 50 soul shards in WPL (Horde) or Burning Steppes (Alliance), or roughly double that if you're just starting that raid and need to mash out healthstones en masse.
---
Soul bags aren't necessary unless you have a really cluttered inventory or your guild is really jonesing for healthstones.  
---
I've missed the Horde not having any pretty elves in it. I'll be glad to go back to playing the scrappy underdogs and outcasts.
---
Nochanges or people will play private servers
---
In my country calendar summer starts at June, 1 and ends at August, 31. 6 months maximum!
---
I can't believe everyone got priest wrong. It's obviously shoot wand. 
---
im assuming you are talking about honor system without battlegrounds, which is not the case in blizzards timeline
---
the only server in the last 5 years which did that tanked 80% of its population in the 4 weeks they had it
---
Well, he got that nice helm from bwl. Jumped up about 5 slots on the dps meter lol
---
So what's best for the game is what you want?
---
What exactly your concerns are? About wrong affixes? Database is the same, but affix system probably was from retail.
---
That's actually pretty good Warriors staff for that level, if I remember correctly, it's slow it has some stamina, and the spirit helps with regen in between mob pulls
---
I would watch. But the moment i notice my horde buddy is losing I one shot the alliance.
---
For the horde!
---
My fondest memories was a buddy and started questing in Ashenvale Horde-side months before Wrath release.
---
We came across two Alliance questing together and battles ensued. The following day we bump into the same duo further into Ashenvale and again we battle, this time one of them jumps on their main and messes us up so my buddy proceeds to jump on his main and destroy them.
---
The next fucking day we bump into the same duo in Stonetalon Mountains, we got the drop on 'em killed them a couple of times w/o either of us dying and then we peaced out.
---
For those three days we were rivals and it was amazingly fun, we were low level fucks but it didnt matter.
---
I'm gonna go for druid - but it really depends on what makes you excited. If you wanna just throw a big crit in somebody's face out of nowhere, then they are not for you. If you wanna have good control of the situation in world PVP, druids just have so many options. You can stay stealthed to pick your fights, you can get away from almost any fight if you want to. You can turn a fight by running away, healing up / drinking, restealthing, and going again.   
---
Depending on what else you want to do, there are specs that allow you to be more of a threat than what people typically think of druids as, either speccing fairly deeply into feral (especially if you have AQ40 or PVP gear), or balance, will allow you to get some big hits through, while still having your mobility, and some of your healing potential. StormX and Ebn on youtube have some really cool druid PVP videos. As a resto druid (as most people are) you are very hard to kill, but for obvious reasons, don't deal a lot of dmg. 
---
So not PvP'er?
---
I would afk farm honor in AV :) go move character every 4 min. Yes yes, flame away.
---
No it wouldn't. 
---
I don't like to have PvP forced on me. When I'm doing my rounds gathering with no PvP-oriented talents, equipment or - to be honest - player skills, the last thing I need is some rogue-kiddie jumping me and ruining my playtime or preventing me from farming the mats I need to prep for raiding. 
---
I get it - you like PvP. I don't. I want the option to not have it forced on me. Right now, that option is called "PvE server". Please keep it that way. 
---
The ruleset you propose only makes sense if it's automatic and can't be cancelled. If it's voluntary it wouldn't be needed at all, anyone can switch on PvP voluntarily. No, the ruleset you propose is nothing but a means to force PvP onto players that don't want to have to engage in it. What's your rationale for forcing a playmode onto players that don't like it?
---
Hopefully so, this time I have a life and can't spend 5-6h daily as I did back in 2006
---
I can not imagine many people will fall for the /afk anymore 
---
There is a pattern that drops in EPL from a mob but there are only a few of them and the respawn time is pritty long. You can farm these while being afk most of the time.
---
Forgot the patterns name.
---
If you want DM not to be stage one content then you also want Maraudon not to be included on release.
---
My goal is to explore and become exalted with both the furbolgs and the Winterspring trainers. 
---
So my biggest question is if I should play druid to make exploration and farming fun and easy, or play priest to make anathema my end goal. 
---
I know you can't cleanse off mind control, that's why I said "dispelled by a priest" (offensive dispel). Your comment about mind control makes 0 sense if you actually meant MC a warrior ("whoever they're healing"). You MC the warrior and then the pally bubbles? In what world does that make sense? 
---
Trash buffs are absolutely massive especially in the fights that matter the most (LM rush -&gt; BS) and World Bosses (significant setup time). If you want to argue its not as big of a deal when the skill levels are low and cooldowns are down I can agree, but alliance is absolutely superior when it matters. A world boss fight? Of course they're bubbling. Lay on hands too. If you think bubble is bad because of a 5 minute cooldown when it literally makes you invincible and lets you free cast I wonder what you think about rogue (absolutely worthless in your eyes? Overrated I can agree with).
---
You're right about silences and interrupts, getting holy locked is brutal as a paladin. Earth Shock (20yds), Silence (20-24yds), Pummel/Kick (5yds). Spell Lock is the biggest concern at 30 yards and a 8 second lockout. Felhunters melt to warriors though (exorcism helps if it works, I don't remember). Curse of tongues is not some unique paladin problem, its a caster problem. 
---
Paladins don't cast every single one of their heals just most of them. Divine favor holy shock or holy shock by itself is perfectly fine if you're feeling threatened by an interrupt. Shamans have it worse, the only time they aren't casting is with NS. Paladins can every 30 seconds.
---
P.S. T3 pally gives an instant heal to cleanse... oppressive.
---
 
---
You will melt faces as a shadow priest in pvp.
---
Screwing with guilds heading to molten core was always fun. Mind controlling people of the chains into the lava good times.
---
I’d take that all day over having DM at launch
---
This time around Rag will die within 1 month of first release. With- our without DM gear.
---
Lets not forget the lvl 40 epic mail gloves that are bis for fury war.
---
Nice post
---
I mean some of the best pvpers on private servers don't really know what side is better. Keep making stuff up though :)
---
Did people really think development started only after the initial announcement? 
---
That's a funny way to spell troll. 
---
If you play Warlock, you have the added bonus of destroying small towns/killing low lvls of your own faction with your Infernal or Doomguard
---
I'm planning on running a hunter to fight back in STVietnam. I'd love to join you on your quest
---
I've only just found out classic is going to happen last week. Already I've resubbed and dropped 750£ on a desktop solely to play on release 😂 spent the whole of tbc, wrath and a bit of cata on awful desktops and laptops so I figured it was time 😃 I just wish tree of life was going to be in classic 😯😯
---
Play the way you want me personally i like leveling mainly i hit 60 get bored try a new class and spec for leveling. I am that person that will level as prot warrior or holy priest just because i can.
---
It will be frustrating not being able to grind honor/BG rep while levelling, I always used to queue AV as soon as I could so would be exalted by 60.
---
Why do people even hate DM at launch so much, it has a few useful pieces of loot which are on par with the rest of lvl60 loot and does not change anything on a larger scale. (Unless you think that purple quest sword is OP because purple stuff is always OP in vanilla, right?)
---
A 6 month wait for BGs would be incredibly depressing as it's mostly what I'll be playing for.
---
If 1.12 should be 1.12 then naxx should be out at release. 
---
rogues and warlocks aswell. humans take this easily.
---
I feel like they should put the World Boss releases in between the Stages, so it comes down to a similar content flow as retail.
---
Stage 1: MC, Ony, DM
---
Stage 1.5: Kazzak Azuregos
---
Stage 2: BWL, ZG, PVP
---
Stage 2.5: Green Dragons
---
Stage 3: AQ, Silithus
---
Stage 3.5: T0.5
---
Stag 4: Naxx
---
**I feel like the release of Open World content is a very good incentive for players to organize PvP events**, things that create memories. They should not be thrown in with Instances.
---
Stage 2 Still seems a bit big imo. especially AV is a rather expansive BG. Might be better to split BGs and the actual Honor System. That was PvP'ers get the chance to have fun in BG's from the start, but do not get any PvE advantages from early PvP Gear, especially if it's the buffed version.
---
PvP servers for life.
---
Red is dead. Learn to play scrubs.
---
Give them a butt-pucker and a shot of relief adrenaline.  I like this one a lot.
---
No one give a shit about your delicate feelings man :(
---
"Idk what is best" *almost all pick alliance.*
---
*Progress goes horde*, *demolished by APES*, *quits*
---
No egos on the line here...
---
Maybe its just me, but I find it kind of puzzling that blizzard has added dedicated store pages for the newest titles, Warcraft Reforged (Warcraft/Frozen Throne remaster) and Diablo Immortal (mobile phone app).
---
And theres nothing about Classic WoW, which was announced before both of these titles.
---
Also to note, even when I click on the World of Warcraft page I cant find any links to classic or the forums etc, but links are provided for both of the above games. 
---
This is why big tech is marketing AI/computers as “The digital coworker”. So when people get fired and replaces with tech, it’s not as bad. 
---
Wut, I always thought summer was from the 1st of June to 31st of August, so you know, 3 months per season.
---
if you're talking about Quel'Serrar it's literally the best 1-handed sword for warrior tanks.
---
True. The thing is some professions are only worth it when you can get a good recipe. I find it more logical to wait until that happens and then powerlevel it. Until then go for double gathering.
---
I'm playing other faction and class. I don't really like it, but it's something and I won't play it in classic anyway, so no spoils.
---
one event every 4 months would be better
---
whats best for the game is not ruining economy and gearing by implementing catch up content after 6 months.
---
I'll be watching streamers just for the fun of watching them getting ganked and their view when I gank em :)
---
I'm playing my first character on a private server and it's so frustrating not being able to switch to my main and crush anyone who touches me. There's nothing like having your baby rogue camped then switching accounts to the full-pvp geared rogue parked nearby with almost exactly the same name. 
---
Had it drop once, I being the warlock in the group made my case but everyone rolled need. Went to a hunter. 
---
Thank you everyone for your responses.
---
Yeah, September is basically agreed upon. 
---
/celebrating wasnt a command in vanilla wow
---
how many of these post should exist :/
---
My ignorance here
---
but they should have all the original code, no? What is there...to test?
---
New hardware, possible QOL changes?
---
I see you’re a man of culture
---
The aspect you're most excited for is imagining stories about kind players and friendly interactions? Sounds about classic. :p
---
Pick up cooking and eat everything. Careful. If you get too large you won’t he able to rise your mount due to weight restrictions.
---
This again? This game is not being made for USA only. 
---
Fear my flowing beard and ability to laugh at your ailments. 8 second wonder baby.
---
hopefully yes
---
Travel form costs 173 mana at level 60 and bearform costs 478. You have 5-6k mana as a level 60 druid there is no way you go oom after 3 shapeshifts lol. And there is no full t3/r14 druids on youtube they all use a mix of rank 10 gear/tier1-2 that is available for casual players too. It's the game you and I are going to play. 
---
&gt;Implementing BWL+ZG+BGs (and the whole ranking system) all at once is going to make it a massive shitshow.
---
let's talk about stage 1 first.
---
And by the way... where is Maraudon?
---
Honestly kind of indifferent to ZG &amp; BWL being released at the same time. What boggles my mind is that they don't release BGs in between Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2. Having it between major content drops would be perfect. DM coming out at launch is also not a great idea. You'd want DM to come out with BGs in between major content. DM-T buffs would make MC a complete joke &amp; the gear from DM would make a lot of other instances kind of obsolete, even at launch. 
---
I play Joanna's 1-60 unedited speedrun on YouTube while at work. Screen blacked out, just the sound! So calming and nostalgic :)...
---
&gt;Rag didn't die
---
but others died
---
I am having a blast on my 13 hunter crafting and checking out other continents I would have usually ignored.  HOURS playing.
---
I cant touch live for more than 5 minutes before I quit in disgust.
---
May I ask why? Is it RP purposes?
---
It will release before I hit 30 anyway
---
Imagine there was a function to ignore people that say stuff you don’t like. That‘d be great wouldn’t it?
---
It is a pointless discussion since there will be 1.12 talents anyways. 
---
And you may not be able to get into some buildings due to doors being too tight
---
&gt;then green dragons, then silithus content, then aq, then scourge invasion, then naxx.
---
wait, does that mean only one month for pre-AQ content? Or AQ coming along with scourge invasion?
---
And, what about... elemental invasions?
---
This sounds like so much fun, honestly something I’d love to be doing myself as well!
---
It’s like it’s just you and your few abilities, and everything else is just an added bonus, right? No pet to control, no DoT that has to be timed, just your weapon of choice and some sick looking gear charging at your enemies. This honestly sounds like an even easier version of paladin (it definitely isn’t, but considering the simplicity of the gameplay perhaps it is)
---
what the hell is affix? All I think about, is mythic+... which won't be at all in Classic.
---
I'mm thinking about how there are tons of missing quests from classic wowhead.
---
I would imagine both. 
---
The Honor System was first released in 1.4 (5.5.2005). In 1.5, Battlegrounds came. Then in 1.6, BWL. Zul Gurub was 1.7 (13.9.2005). 
---
They're probably just batching that timeframe together. 
---
I like it. No hoarding nature resist loot.
---
Thank you so, so much. I’ve replied to somebody else too that said warriors seem to fit, and what I said really corresponds with your reply as well! It’s just you charging at your enemy, and everything else is a great bonus.
---
Didn’t even mention the fact how badass it is really. You can dance all you want around me with your flashy arrows, spells and DoTs, but boy once I get to you... prepare to be blown up or at least feel some good damage.
---
This sounds awesome. Which race would you personally say fits the best badass warrior type?
---
The ERP scene in classic will be looking for this guy everyone needs their little gnome stepped on
---
Top guilds today will proverbially skullfuck Rag &amp; MC 1-2 weeks after launch if Blizzard doesn't tamper with the health or dmg values. If DM-T is enabled, they will have an even easier time doing it. You walk in MC almost naked, knowing the mechanics, having some FR thrown on your MT, having Onyxia buff &amp; DM-T. That's an easy 1½-2h clear. 
---
Thank you so very much for this reply. You made an amazing good point, and it made me realise that it’s not as scary to have many buttons when there’s time to learn anyway.
---
What class will you be playing? And what race? It sounds like your mindset is exactly like mine - to have fun, and fully immerse into the world :)
---
ya I atleast want some info : /
---
I want to play vanilla so bad I keep almost convincing myself to play a private server but im not going to spend days of my life getting to 60 just to do it again in a few months. plus im over the corrupt pservers
---
I keep going back and forth between Human Warrior and Human Rogue. Back in vanilla I played a warrior and never got to gear him out the way I wanted so that would be nice to complete. On the other hand playing a rogue in vanilla would be a new experience. I swear I seem to flip flop every other day haha..
---
I live resto druid and that fucking fugly armour hiding cartoon tree is hideous
---
Guys, don't whine about DM at launch. Every single non US player had DM at launch. Did it break the game for EU players? I don't think so. And the same arguments can be made for basically all patches. Most Vanilla WoW players weren't present in the earlier patches. Did it ruin the experience for them? Again I don't think so.
---
You're just screaming around because hardcore 1st day / world 1st rushers are telling you to do so. Wake up.
---
well they are recreating 1.12 with the modern engine or whatever so it kindof is
---
Hahaha the flipflopping effect is real for you and I both!
---
I may be a huge noob in WoW, but I sure as hell played a lot of games before. What I gather from your post, along with how I’d feel in your situation, play the warrior first. Probably, upon reading this, it’ll give you this “calm” feeling like “okay then.” instead of a “rogue is cool... but...” you know what I mean? Even if this doesn’t make sense, it really sparks out that you should complete what you were going for back then.
---
Make the warrior complete, make it your badass blood-shed warlord. Rogue will always be there for you afterwards, plus you can twink him up to have even more fun when leveling up and ganking others :)
---
&gt; starts at June, 1 and ends at August, 31. 6 months maximum!
---
thinking that way, you should ask Australians.
---
March or earlier.
---
Well don't you actually have to purchase those 2? wow is just being included in the retail subscription.
---
Maybe it was a conspiracy theory to test if we REALLY want it :D.
---
\&gt;  Don’t get mad and call someone a scum bag for playing the game lol seems a little over the top   
---
It is a scumbag thing to do though. Is it part of the game? Yes. Are you allowed to? Yes. Are you a scumbag finding joy in ruining someone else's experience with no benefit to yourself? Yes.  
---
I don't understand how this is a difficult concept to grasp for you. If your joy is found in ruining the experience of someone else, then you're a scumbag. It's no different to running over to some kid on the beach and stomping on his sand castle. You get nothing from doing it, and the joy you feel is because you made someone else feel bad. That makes you a scumbag.
---
Dealing with assholes is part of the PVP experience and some people like the risk of running into them. But it doesn't make the assholes NOT assholes, because they are. That's why people get excited from being in risk, because encountering an asshole scumbag is something you want to avoid. The guy that's "just playing the game BRAH, git gud BRAH" while corpse camping someone that hasn't even got a theoretical chance of winning is still an asshole, and a scumbag.
---
As long as it's not a fuckwad hunter rolling of str mail.
---
Tbh these large game companies don’t have to tell us the truth anymore. 
---
Maybe that was the case, or maybe someone gave it all a back story so they could talk about it. 
---
Innervate is one of the best cooldowns in the game, nature SW back to full, and natures grasp. Those were the big 3 I was thinking of. 
---
Yeah this applies to like 1% of the classic population.
---
&gt; No spring and autumn in iceland?
---
No. Though there are seasons of "more rain" or "more snow", they are mostly regional. By the way, the actual summer, aka season with sun and almost no rain, is usually less than 1 month.
---
&gt; Is it 6 months of summer 6 months of winter?
---
Yes.
---
Bigiron , good name for warrior
---
I thought he guessed at the 1 year thing.
---
Releasing BGs too early kills world pvp. But yeah, BGs will be my focus, too. There’s so many factors and so many people to please. Somebody will complain no matter what. On my timeline, you could put BGs after Onyxia. 
---
Switch green dragons and silithus events, then 
---
Yeah, from what we know so far, that's the payment system they are using. 
---
I was going to mention this, but it doesn't take away from the fact; the official blizzard site is basically void of anything Classic WoW. It just seems a little odd.
---
And like I was saying, even when you click the official WoW page, there isnt anything mentioning Classic as an up coming release tied into the Retail subscription, which I'd totally see as a positive announcement for sure, and perhaps an opportunity for further advertisement? For both classic and retail. 
---
And I'd almost go as far as to  say, for discussion sake, Classic WoW is the biggest and most 'hyped' of the 3 newest titles announced since 2017.
---
War is hell
---
Way too slow
---
&gt;One intern doing \~100 quests an hour for like 3 weeks could do it.
---
Level 20? Hmm....
---
I'd say more like 1 week. Remember, if you play less, you have that blue bar filling up.
---
And that 1% are also the only people that are gonna care (and frankly notice) whether DM is in from the start. Why not make that 1% a little bit happier instead of 0%?
---
Yeah, it only applies to good players. I can see why you're not interested in it. 
---
PvP on a PvP server. There you go.
---
I'll go out on a limb and say he isn't triggered by what someone did in a video game. If he's triggered at all (which he isn't, because "lol triggered" is just a weak rhetorical ploy when you can't be bothered discussing, it's because someone needs to make someone else feel bad to enjoy themselves.
---
Noone's saying you're not allowed to corpsecamp people 20 levels lower than you while wearing your Monster snapback backwards and playing Jake Paul videos on your other monitor on repeat and yelling "LOL U SUCK BRAH" at the monitor. It just makes you an asshole. You're allowed to be an asshole on PVP servers. That's why they exist. It's a part of the game. It doesn't mean you're not an asshole though.
---
If you have trouble understanding why going out of your way to ruin the game for someone else that hasn't even got a theoretical chance of winning, and finding joy in that makes you an asshole.. Well. I feel sorry for the people you encounter in real life. But I'd guess that you wouldn't curb stomp a five year old in real life, because it would be an asshole thing to do. It's just that you seem unable to realise that doing the same in a video game is still an asshole thing to do, EVEN if the person signed up for it and doesn't get hurt from it other than being slightly annoyed and losing time.
---
The fun in PVP servers is having to avoid assholes like you so it benefits everyone in a sense. But please read that last part carefully. The reason PVP is fun for people is because **you're** an asshole. Also because some times you get a evenly matched PVP fight out in the world from people who aren't you, and aren't assholes.
---
the amount of development time before we knew about it doesnt make much difference. 
---
we saw the demo, which shows where the development was at that point in time (regardless of how much work was done beforehand) -- and that beta showed about how much still needed to be done.
---
Ashenvale for me. 100%
---
some armor types will also be restricted. Like if you are a paladin and just hit lvl 40, plate might not unlock do to size.
---
He guessed the one year so they likely began right after that quote. Maybe it made them realize how dumb they sounded. 
---
It could be something was a lie, or a guess. Or he could have just not known in 2016 that someone was working on it (as in it could have been a small group at the time he wasn't aware of), or at that point they had some people doing very early work on it and he didn't think it was going to go anywhere (could have been just considering it at that point). Lots of options.
---
Doesn't work like that, they create the old game in the Legion Client - so basically everything needs to be tested.
---
excluding tf and naxx gear ofc
---
If ya need a distraction and like anime... check out Overlord, it's based on an MMO shutting it's server and a hard core player staying logged in to the last second but gets transported to the MMO with all of his NPC and dungeon his guild designed.  3 Seasons in the anime but 13 light novels... really good stuff.
---
To ensure that loot box and MTX can be added seemlessly. 
---
&gt; If they stick to "summer 2019" then its coming out between 3 and 6 months.
---
Last they said was "in 2019" so I wouldn't really call it a confirmed release date. They aimed at Summer 2019 when they announced it. I wouldn't be surprised if it's late fall 2019, or early 2020.
---
Seems like a cash-grab but actually a smart idea - I would sub again only for this.
---
These are known as manlet heels
---
Except all the companies that do... Digital extremes was weekly dev streams about warframe. 
---
I think its easier to gear a lock. Mages are usually pretty populated. Also while mage DPS is slightly better, everyone knows they are literally pressing 1 button and won't think any less of Lock players for it
---
Speaking as a registered altaholic, this is why you plan ahead and park your main close to where you are lvling your alts for the day.
---
Would use on my pally
---
Beta any day now
---
lol, dont joke they just might
---
The best track is the Wotlk login music. It’s roughly 10 minutes long but it’s the best masterpiece Blizzard has ever produced 
---
LMAO. Found another one who wasn't good enough to get away from a couple camper in WoW. Unreal.
---
Not really, it falls short of Ironfoe or Alcors (given enough damage intake) for threat gain outside of even raid drops. Quel'Serrar is really cool, it's not really good though.
---
That would be awfully slow, but if you wing clip-kited instead of hamstring it would work.
---
Maybe for us old timers, but from their prospective it's probably easily the least profitable. Things line candy crush bring in more money for them than the rest of their games combined.
---
I named a character "You" so i was able to create trolling /me messages everyone would think they triggered somehow.
---
That's not the problem, the problem is partly that a veritable FUCKTON of insane healing loot is available in there, from mindtap to very generous sources of +spell damage or +healing items, but even this isn't the primary issue.
---
The primary issue is that with DM open your MC raid is going to have 3% spell crit, 200 AP and 15% stamina for free, which is absolutely insane.
---
Playing on a PVE realm you never have to worry about being jumped by 3 rogues when you are farming or heading to a instance. If I want to pvp i'll just que for WSG/AB and do that. Or duel people outside of IF. It's easier to get gear on a PVE server as a casual since most of them just do PVE stuff and it's much faster to farm in the open world since you never have to worry about getting ganked. (I'm going to play on a PvP server myself) I just think people give PVE server players a hard time, it's like they are forgetting BGs exist on those servers lol. 
---
In vanilla and further expansions i made sure i always tried to leveup the max level by exploring a new area. Because it happened by accident the first time.
---
LOL
---
Warlock Epic Mount quest is in DM. You think it's a mistake to not let an entire class not be able to get epic mounts for months?
---
I play on pserver, know what I'm doing, and I get epic mount within weeks of rolling a new toon. Even if it's 1% of the playerbase, there will be people ready to do the quest but unable to.
---
Also, DM was available on Vanilla release in Europe.
---
One of the better posts on this sub.
---
Yeah the lack of information kinda scares me too.
---
And before you attack me with "omg u want update every day u stupid" like it's happened many times here, I'm not talking about daily updates. Maybe not even weekly. But would it hurt Blizzard to give us update once per two weeks or even once per month?
---
DM was available on release of Vanilla in Europe region.
---
You need to think holistically, if you're typically run a mage group of 5 mages and swap out one of the mages for a feral druid you need to factor in a lot more than just pure dps. 
---
Having a boom in the group gives 4 mages +3% crit which wont show up at the booms dps but the mages. It also brings an extra innervate and battle res, which is incredibly useful. 
---
A battleres can save a fight, an extra 10k dmg over the coarse of a fight usually doesn't make or break it.
---
Its not even funny how great stat spirit is for a warrior.
---
1. Buy a mount like everyone else.
---
2. DM was not available until a month from EU release. And why would we go for EU timeline? (Not NA based so no bias)
---
Affix is modifier on green item. Scary shoulderplates of the Eagle, etc.
---
Where did you get that from? Anyone could just run in and grab the flag vs a pals, you just need to click it. It’s not like an AB base.
---
Whatever you need, bud. You're still an asshole and trying to justify it doesn't change it. Just embrace it, it's classier.
---
Id say thats obviously fair game. When in doubt, just ask first. I always make sure to ask if ppl mind if im rolling need on offspec (even if all 4 have pressed greed). 
---
I saw some addon that made big boobs and "larger than char"-type of rack.
---
I assume Maraudon is just going to be bundled with release. It effectively was for most players (18th Dec 2004, 1 month and 11 days after US release, and before EU had even been released), and won't really impact early progression. The most impactful item from it is the ring from princess with hit, which many melee might use for some time early on, but other than it's not game-breaking.
---
Is it normal i recognize the items?
---
Although I agree, you mess with my faction - your going down. 
---
If I could I’d just heal the faction I was on or if I couldn’t slap a cheeky dot 
---
What? It has bad stats and a chance on hit you cant rely on, maybe decent preraid for mc but you'd wanna switch it out pretty fast. 
---
The smartest thing they could do is to open it either early summer or at the end of summer that way not too many people are on vacations. All depends on how confident they are on the servers stability and also the release of new content for Retail WoW. Because they probably won't release it if there's a patch coming around june/july. I don't really follow retail wow so idk. 
---
PvP purposes actually. A larger target is more visible on the battlefield. A world PvP guild, so the earlier it's available, the longer lasting and the cheaper the better.
---
Just play on a Pserver ? Obviously it's not going to be the exact same numbers as retail since most of it is unknown but it's a start :p. 
---
Or  Scarlet Champion Helmet
---
I guess I just got so used to it I didn't realise how much it had grown on me until it was removed 😂
---
Over a period of time when your pet is happy and builds up loyalty it takes a really long time to get it down. Even from green to yellow takes really long when your pet is fully loyal to you. AFAIK. I may be wrong on that. I'm just saying what I noticed while playing the hunter from 10-20.
---
Why would it ever be bad? Not everybody has to like the same things :D
---
DM can definitely not be at launch. The top 1% of players on each server that get 60 fast will be ahead and stay ahead of the rest of the server for a long time. DM also brings world buffs and makes the earlier content easier. 
---
The only really good stuff I could think of are sublime wristguards (no really good alternatives) and Padre's Trousers, but there are decent alternatives to that (Especially if we're getting 1.12 itemization). 
---
World buffs don't matter much for casual players (except ZG one which persists through death), as they would wipe because some hunter did not dismiss pet and buttpulled imps or similar stupid reasons anyways. For the good players... Well, you understand that the content will get steamrolled anyways, and these buffs would save them 5-10 minutes clearing time, and the real wbuff MVP's are Dragonslayer Cry and Warchief's Blessing you get in the baseline game.
---
DM was available at release for EU.
---
Rag will die within the first week of launch
---
*OwO, what's this? * It's your **2nd Cakeday** Nussy5! ^(hug)
---
I prefer orc. Has +5 to axe skill, an attack power buff and bonus stun resist to be more of an unstoppable force.
---
That comment was made at Blizzcon 2013, long before Classic servers were on anyone's radar.
---
The 4 stage idea is way too compressed.
---
The I’m not concerned with sticking with the original vanilla progression - they did some things objectively wrong like tier 0.5. The important thing is that each content release is a meaningful but not overwhelming “bite” of content with enough time between releases to savour each one. 
---
I’m in no hurry to get to Naxx and neither should Blizzard. The full “season” should be on the order of two years imo.
---
Stage 1: Molten Core, Onyxia, Old School mounts
---
Stage 2: Dire Maul, Kazzak, Azuregos, Epic quests, Updated mounts
---
Stage 3: Honor System and Battle Grounds
---
Stage 4: Blackwing Lair, Tier 0.5
---
Stage 5: Zul’Gurub, Green Dragons
---
Stage 6: Ahn’Qiraj, Silithus Content
---
Stage 7: Naxxramas, Scourge Content
---
Each stage should be 2-3 months apart preferably. I’m assuming 1.12 itemization the whole way for simplicity and to make the loot from the original dungeons competitive.
---
90% of all mankind does though.
---
Roll Cow
---
Oh I embrace it. Can't wait for this summer
---
Imagine New players face when they realize that they can de curse it
---
&gt; Oh I embrace it. Can't wait for this summer 
---
Doesn't really sound like it
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; But literally calling people names because they killed you on a video game is just laughable. And pathetic 
---
I mean, if you embrace being an asshole you shouldn't mind being called one.
---
But yeah, enjoy it like I hope we all will get to soon. Just make sure to try actual PVP against an even match some time. It shifts the joy you get from ruining someone else's game to excitement that you might actually lose. It's also good practice in case people try to counter-gank you.
---
Elixir of Giant Growth (alch) and Winterfall Firewater (furbolg drop) are the typical enlarging consumables. They add 8 STR and 35 melee ap respectively as well.  
---
Im with you there.  I Caved in and bought BfA and bought a 60 day card just to get a little fix.  its not classic but its a good enough fix for a bit :)
---
Though Ive been away for such a while, Its almost like a totally different game
---
Someone playing casually will not be too concerned with levels per day anyway. Even 2-3hr a day is seen to be a lot of time to game to some people. But since its classic, any way you want to play will be fun. Since leveling in classic is a fun part of the game. At least to me anyway.
---
Makes no difference at all
---
Oh it was 2013? My bad then
---
Just go play on a private server then.
---
Maybe it’s not for you.
---
And they learn from it, and remember it, and will teach others. But if its fixed for them, then they dont learn. Making mistakes is part of the game, and should be allowed to happen. Now if you lose an item to a game glitch or something along those lines, then thats a different issue. But calling a GM because you dont understand disenchanting, or you acedentely ate your food, or used a fishing lure at the wrong time, that's what bogs the system down.
---
Can a bunch of rocks be considered obesity?
---
No, go see a shrink for that.
---
dont forget "heals cant crit"
---
Sounds like the guild for me. If raid times Suit me I will definitely contact you guys. Playing fwarr probably if that matters
---
I'm completely fine with your position and *much* prefer PvE to the current PvP system. There's nothing wrong with PvE servers. There's something badly wrong with PvP servers: griefers. What would be ideal would be the possibility of open-world PvP without actual griefing.
---
Many people want random world PvP. Some express a desire to *do* griefing, especially when "bored". Few express a desire to be griefed themselves.
---
The reason I proposed a flag at 60 as a type of compromise is, if two combatants are both level 60, the differences will be gear and skill (and to some extent ping rate). Of the two, it's been my experience as remembered from battlegrounds years ago that skill makes about 75% of the difference and gear makes about 25%. Below 60 or maybe high 50's, 90% of the difference is level.
---
Lionheart is yellow
---
Tengu, the final boss of Dead or Alive 2 wears the same things.
---
I need to know how to plan my vacation!
---
Ahh I see, that's a shame! I started playing in 1.12 so have no idea what WoW was like before then. Pretty surprised to see DM on that list, but I guess that explains why that dungeon has more going for it than others such as the class-quests and decent loot.
---
This. 
---
[https://www.gdconf.com/](https://www.gdconf.com/) \- march 18-22.

Most dm gear is better than mc gear 
---
Nature resist grind
---
Care to provide a link?
---
What idiot is going to quit between AQ and naxx
---
Blizzard titles are on life support and corporate is still more concerned about their mobile apps.  RIP Azeroth.
---
New server backend and Legion (maybe BFA soon) client. All databases are stuctured differently, so they need to make the data in such way that the new client and server understands it etc.
---
New hybrid LUA code (mostly legion + stuff from old that legion doesnt have - stuff that legion has and vanilla doesnt ).
---
I'm absolutely, unashamedly the same. I'm hearing all of this great stuff about classic PvE, and I want to care...but I don't. I just want to kill people...
---
&gt; Yeah, it only applies to good players
---
Having zero life doesn't make you automatically good. Most people don't have the option of speedrunning to 60 in a week.
---
There’s idiots everywhere. The fresh meme on private servers starts after AQ, doesn’t it? I know it’s because naxx isn’t properly tuned. But does everybody know that? 
---
Releasing naxx soon after AQ doesn’t hurt anybody not doing naxx and AQ. It only benefits people doing naxx and AQ. 
---
Or you know, we could just enjoy the classic experience of leveling and actually having a fun talent system back.  Unless sharding and blizz's crappy servers don't ruin it.
---
&gt;The top 1% of players on each server that get 60 fast will be ahead and stay ahead of the rest of the server for a long time.
---
Lol, you figure the top 1% wont be ahead without DM ? They will clear MC within first few weeks or release. Before most are even L30. There is no "hard content", buffs will only affect speedrun clear times. Not progress. 
---
Alrighty. Look out for next week's post. I will be announcing our raid times there.
---
I listen to all the soundtracks while I work. It helps me grind out more lines of code and keeps me in the zone.
---
My favorites in order of most to least played:
---
Vanilla
---
Wrath
---
Legion
---
Bfa (xpac sucks but music and art still top notch)
---
Bc
---
Cata
---
Panda
---
Wod
---
Also listen to wc3.
---
Really wish more ambient music was available too. There is a huge amount of music in the game files that aren't available to buy. Going thru them is a pain though as some are only 30 seconds long..
---
https://youtu.be/MW4fASDkQXA good ambient channel everness 
---
See you all in classic! Hoping there will be oceanic servers :) eu-chrommagus no longer geographically supports me.
---
Could be confusing when trying to attract new players? Especially when they want new players playing current retail.
---
Oh, man. I sure am enjoying WINTER right now, with all this SNOW.
---
First of all, what do you consider "poison spec"? Vanilla has neither envenom nor shiv (tbc additions) and poisons scale with +spell/+nature. 
---
There's just 2 talents that affect poisons, Vile poisons (+20% poison dmg + 40% dispel resist, 5 talent points) and Improved Poisons (+10% increased chance of applying poison, 5 talent points again). No master poisoner, no other synergies other than the raw attack speed from SnD and some consumables/enchants that give similar (yet minor) haste effects (juju flurry comes to mind, minor haste enchant for gloves and arcanum of rapidity as well). 
---
PvE-wise even deadly is out for grouping (you'll be using dual instant for pure damage) since debuff slots are more valuable, PvP you're likely to go double crippling unless you need any other utility one (and well, you should be keeping mind-numbing and maybe wound poisons on a weapon in your bag to swap when that necessity appears).  
---
For "poison spec" vanilla-wise I only think of an awkward spell damage rogue (with talents boosting them ofc) and, honestly this is limited at best as a spec for funsies in PvP, along the spell damage hunter. 
---
Overall you'd better go for a more standard rogue variant. 
---
Preach brother, I am willing to do the pve so I can get better pvp gear, but I try as I might I just can't care about waiting on 39 other people to get their shit together so we can go fight a loot pinata.
---
u camp rogues? xD in your dreams
---
The release schedule affects everyone.
---
Hardcore players will rush through content and get significant gear advantages over casual players. In general, as the gear gap increases a server becomes more hostile to new players. It isn't much fun to hit level 60 fresh when there's already people running around with full AQ40 gear.
---
Limiting content release speed is also beneficial to the hardcore players, so that they don't consume all the content too fast.
---
You also simply need time for a lot of things. Raid loot is incredibly scarce in vanilla, and not allowing a sufficient amount of time between content means you're just skipping stuff as you're not giving sufficient chance to actually get some items. Even worse with the honor system which only allows a certain number of players to rank up per week.
---
Besides, the hardcore players will stick around anyway. They're hardcore because they love the game, not just because they want to consume content with the biggest possible shovel. It's simply better to stretch out the release schedule, let things take its natural order, and give the server the time that it needs to blossom.
---
I would do 
---
1: MC/ONY/DM
---
2: PVP, T0.5 + kazzak, azuregos and green dragons
---
3: BWL/ZG
---
4: AQ
---
5: Naxx
---
Its not blizzlike or what vanilla was, but T0.5 etc after aq40 is just worthless to most endgame players. Make it relevant by releasing it earlier. 
---
I guess you mean the Crusader Enchantment recipe. And it would be in northern WPL.
---
Thats the one, and I ment WPL idd. Thanks for clearing it up for me 
---
It's possible.
---
After wracking my mind a bit, its possible Classic WoW could just simply be a server option, and nothing else so to speak (possibly no Classic style menu/title screen etc), if you have played WoW before you might know what I mean. 
---
I wreck people in PvP.  We're you that bad? I've already explained myself on this topic. Go to bed.
---
You just completely ignored everything I said. Good job.
---
Hate to break it to you but having zero life does make you automatically good in vanilla, in PvE. 
---
Skill ceiling is so low that the only deciding factor is how much time you put in the game, really. 
---
Why? I haven't played vanilla - why would people not want DM at launch?
---
&gt; I wreck people in PvP.  
---
Yes, it would be pretty embarassing to lose when you're ganking people who are 30 levels below you.
---
Exactly, it'll stop guilds from being able to instagib aq40 so easily, though I suspect some still will!
---
Patently false. Also the skill ceiling is way lower in current WoW, they've homogenized everything so much that it's so absurdly easy and all semblance of difference with talents and the like have been abolished. Mechanically fights may be more interesting in retail, but the difference in skill between players in vanilla was far more stark back in the day.
---
Screw all of that. We need PILUMS.
---
OP, what are the chances, I just published a podcast ep all about the soundtrack! Breaking it down with a musician from the 2:50 mark, you might like it! :)

---
There is no point in trying to slow down top 1% players from clearing everything by a few hours/days. It's really pointless. Normal people will still take a normal amount of time to do everything.
---
&gt; Maraudon is just going to be bundled with release
---
and Stage 1 not?
---
So is paladin mount. They need to do  West for part of the horse. 
---
Seconded on Overlord; Shield Hero is fantastic too.
---
I’m pretty sure the reason we still remember it to this day, is because the lesson is learned. And trust me, he talked about it all the time when having to disenchant something. Besides, it wasn’t all the time you could restore an item. GMs didn’t just restore items per request. 
---
Didn’t power word shield require them to be in your group?
---
Already playing on a private server. I don't trust Blizz anymore, probably add a lot of shit to vanilla after release when they already cashed in.
---
I feel so strongly that ill main resto druid but if it went to tbc I'd reroll.
---
It's possible, but I feel they'll still split them on the launcher/in game in order to avoid any sort of confusion about what version of WoW you're playing. Don't want new players accidentally choosing Classic, even with a pop up or something, and hating it because its hard.
---
Though that error could still happen if they're separated on the launcher.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
&gt; Affix is modifier on green item. Scary shoulderplates of the Eagle, etc. Those were wrong on demo.
---
&gt; 
---
were they actually wrong on demo, or it was a visual? Because it may be related to the +7 agility on recipes, etc...
---
&gt; I thought they just used their old wowhead backup.
---
I think they just datamined the classic client, as it's missing fundamental things from even patch 1.2 - like, human starting quests...
---
I think i talked and made friends with more people yesterday by playing for an hour on light's hope than I did on retail in a year.
---
Play the game how you want to, doesn't hurt anyone else.
---
I'm looking forward to exploring and running the vanilla dungeons, they were so much better than retail versions.
---
Cc and play as a team, love it. 
---
hmm...
---

Sums up today's players while op sums up my vanilla experience
---
Most of my top 5 come from from WotLK. I only spent a couple of weeks playing through that expansion yet somehow some of the songs have stuck with me more than any vanilla song. Grizzly Hills, Storm Peaks and Arthas, My Son are the pinnacle of WoW music.
---
Because people didn't understand much in vanilla and it was glorious, fun and sexy.
---
Orcs, hell yeah! I always get so thrilled when I see them in LOTR and the Hobbit :D. Being a warrior sounds incredibly rewarding man
---
Yes and no, considering gearing guides, the world buff rotation and general veteran experience I thinking the first tier of content (Ony/MC) will be steamrolled (bar Rags). Speaking for my intended class (warlock) there are very few bis pieces in MC, or at least close enough to bis to bother about.
---
I think it's the second half of BWL that things will slow down and the gear accumulation process will need to start in earnest and definitely required to step into AQ.
---
Stage 1 is release 
---
Yeah, Chimly mentions Grizzly Hills as a fave of his in the call, I need to listen through that WOTLK soundtrack again!
---
My first lvl 60 took 26 days /played because me and my friends did explore, had server events, world PvP etc. That's what classic is all about.
---
Doing what you think is fun without being pushed to max lvl and end game content. 
---
If people can grind the rep, I don’t see 40 people hitting 60 in less than. A week and then getting rep to extinguish the fires within that same week. 
---
The main issue are some very powerful buffs from doing a successful tribute run (a tribute run is where you sneak through and keep all the bosses alive so they give you rewards at the end). Raiders on private servers would stack them, the ony head turn in, the hakkar heart turn in, darkmoon faire buffs (if it's up) along with a bunch of potions and a flask and then be putting out an ungodly amount of damage above their gear level.
---
The music was obviously fantastic but I think Halo pips it
---
Yeah WoW isn’t my #1, FFVII is probably in that slot. But it’s up there.
---
This was in Legion, I don't remember how it was in vanilla, but it didn't require them to be in group now lately at least.
---
Perhaps, but you'd have more luck grinding out your own Compendium then seeing and winning an Ironfoe.
---
Though it will be fun to go through something like the Lyceaum with competent groups, compared to all the nightmares in the past.
---
Maybe that's what they want!
---
I have a theory:
---
It's not a new game, we know everything about it. Also, we can safely say that retail WoW is almost dead. The need to create hype is huge!
---
So we have two types of players that would readily play the game:
---
1. WoW classic fans. They don't play WoW for a long time and can't wait to see the game released (that's us). By not communicating, they create this "drug addict" kind of hype.
---
2. Retail WoW players. They follow WoW news more actively and aren't necessarily sensitive to WoW classic. The non-communication can create an instant hype when the game releases *"Oh right! I almost forgot they wanted to release WoW Classic! and it's live now??"*
---
So they gather both types by non-communicating or casually saying they're still working on the game (to maintain some kind of excitement for the 1st type)
---
What about contested zones? Like STV, it’s just a tag fest with both factions?
---
&gt;if you're talking about Quel'Serrar it's literally the best 1-handed sword for warrior tanks.
---
How to prove that you don't know anything about Vanilla in one easy step.
---
The southern hemisphere is confused
---
So what you're saying is, you want me to wake you up when September ends? 
---
I was under the impression Frostmourne was bigger. 
---
My bad if I’m wrong 
---
I've done it twice, 240 runs for the first, in the low 100's for the second.
---
Have a healer friend at the ready, alternatively a second character, then simply get all those warriors/rogues/shamans who want HoJ and run 'em through, I'm perfectly clear that ML will be on for Emp incase Ironfoe drops, the rest of the drops is theirs.
---
I realize it's not for everyone to do, but it isn't as bad as one might think, 10 hours is 50 runs alone.
---
if your a twink and you think bashing on levelers is fair well you should think this is fair aswell
---
We don't know yet. The 4 stage release was just their current plan but was open to changing it depending on the community, which is why we need to be **VOCAL** about these things.
---
Yeah i have a job and a family so i can't speedrun to 60 in a week, so i must be shit at the game.
---
Because they are no-lifers who are sad that with DM released, they'll not take 3 weeks to kill Rag, but just two. And that just ruins their fun.
---
The top 1% will be getting gear from Ony and MC before the average player reaches lvl 60. The gap is larger than you think, regardless of DM release time.
---
Balance is a viable PvP spec.
---
Thanks so much for having me on! Really looking forward to listening to this after work! 
---
I doubt any 1% guild will take more than two weeks (one full reset) to clear each and every raid after release.
---
It's twitch chat before twitch chat was a thing, I love it.
---
some of the no-lifers will surprise you man.  people be cray
---
Was an absolute pleasure having you mate, you were awesome.
---
&gt; ~~Balance~~ Elemental is a viable PvP spec.
---
FTFY
---
I have very little experience with classic Wow, the +5 strength is making fun of vanillas itemization
---
Even the fastest speed runs take about 5 days played so its unlikely MC will be cleared in a week. 
---
Warrior = Charge  
---
Paladin = Divine Shield  
---
Hunter = Freeze Trap  
---
Rogue = Stealth
---
Priest = Manaburn  
---
Shaman = Totems  
---
Mage = Blink  
---
Warlock = Pet Demons/Life Tap  
---
Druid = Shapeshift/Thorns
---
So what?  Wow came out super late in china so what you wanna start with BWL out aswell?
---
The guilds in joined on classic private servers you had to fill out an application for the raiding team so that they knew if you had experience raiding, you had to post a screenshot of your ui to see if you were a clicker, you had to say which addons you use for raiding and what your rotation are while raiding. 
---
For class leaders i think its about sho knows the most about the class and who has the most experience playing the game.
---
Wife wanted divorce. I'm more than ready now!
---
Shield Hero is good but only 8 episodes out so far, he'd be waiting 1 ep a week and he's already upset he has to wait till summer for classic. :P
---
I'm pretty sure blizzards servers won't be mega servers like private servers that had 10k population. 
---
Some of us played the original you know. 
---
hh man it was some legit ashenvale 20s battle
---
DM is one of the best ways to farm gold in the game, It can be done solo and it's instanced. It would affect the economy for everyone.
---
1. Night Elf tavern music. It was playing sometimes in Temple of the Moon in Darnassus, but first I heard it on Shalandis Isle as a Horde .
---
2. Plaguebringers/Loatheb. Sometimes I listen to the whole Naxx soundtrack.
---
This is an extremely underrated post, people underestimate how OP Onyxia buff (and not to mention Nef buff) are, especially on a server that might have double or triple the population OG Vanilla servers did.
---
My guild on a certain pserver was unable to clear Vael until we went in with Ony, Nef, and ZG buffs and one-shot everything until we hit a wall on Nef.
---
This is a bigger deal than most people realize and if they think Vanilla content is easy now just wait until you have to be invited to a raid and require Juju Power, 3 Elixir Powers, possibly a flask, and any other elements for your class (poisons, soulshards) etc. and the massive hordes of Chinese players on each server will affect server economies to the point where everyone will wind up buying gold from them instead of Blizzard. Massive amounts of these consumables will be available and not to mention will be required for most guilds as they are required on private servers now, and these consumables make content *extremely easy*.
---
I think by now we all know it’ll come down to the better premade on the day, not the faction. But will be interesting after premades kick off in classic
---
Listen to Wotlk login music. 10 minutes roughly and an absolute masterpiece 
---
Horde can head down to SenJin village and get huuuuge by talking to Bom'bay at any time (provided you finish the quest line), but it only lasts 5mins.
---
I dunno, even a no lifer would really need to break some records, hit a decent gear/stat mark, then grind rep hard.. 
---
Thanks. I’ve had this thought for over 10 years. Would be pretty funny if they admitted to it. 
---
I think Blizzard might be afraid to slow down. In the past they have been sceptical about vanilla being popular (the whole "you think you want it but you don't"). And with retail they are pressured to keep an almost unfair stream of content.
---
It's not like back during vanilla. There really wasn't any alternative to WoW for a (back then) popular, casual MMORPG. The game were also current back then, now we know what happens. Everything about it is different.
---
I hope they slow down and release less at a time (introduce more than 4 stages), but I don't think they will. Not because they are an evil company like some seems to think, but because they might honestly believe their approach is the best.
---
I’ll preface my comment with the fact that I’ll just be happy to play the game instead of waiting and debating when we’ll see content. 
---
Yeah, power creep is a big problem. But, ~6 months before BWL. No power creep yet. Another ~6 months before AQ. At the ~1 year mark is when power creep starts to really be an issue. 
---
At this point, they can make a new server with eventual server merges. Because names are always something people want to keep, the older server is the server that keeps their names. So the players just coming to the game make characters on new servers. That’s what I did in vanilla. I know this is controversial. 
---
New servers are going to be a fact of life in classic wow. And with new servers comes dying older servers, due to “FRESH” memes. What also comes with new servers is a perpetual game that never dies. Just like diablo 2’s seasons. 
---
Are raiders trying to get to naxx going to abandon their characters to reroll? Doubtful. They want to see content. Is powercreep a significant issue between half BWL half AQ gear and full T3? Not really. 
---
And this is assuming people are just going to faceroll through naxx and get easy loot. I don’t think that’s the case at all. I’d actually argue that naxx will take a very long time to clear. 
---
I always enjoyed being able to get quick dungeon groups as a bear tank.  That may be the deciding factor in the end.  Thanks for your input!
---
classic when
---
Good to know about the raid heals.  Thanks for your input!
---
You have control over your routes and habits. If you're playing on a PvP server, don't waste big cooldowns on mobs unless necessary. Eat and/or drink frequently instead of doing it only once you're nearly dead. If you're approaching a spot where both factions have a quest objective, try to hide behind the terrain as much as you can. If you're playing a hunter, kill mobs while standing on a trap and use Flare. There are some situations that are completely one-sided and cannot be reasonably avoided simply by playing well, but that's where another aspect of being prepared comes in - have a good network of friends that like world PvP and call them to your aid if needed.
---
No it wasn't.
---
EU release was February 11 2005.
---
Patch 1.3.0 (DM&amp;World Bosses) released worldwide on March 7 2005.
---
&gt;But does the release schedule for raid content affect non raiders at all
---
It is probably one of the biggest things for everyone. Remember in vanilla you would still gear for PvP through PvE. If the release cycle is way too fast it means only those with a lot of time to play will be able to keep up, the rest will fall behind in gear progression, which means you will play PvP outgeared. Catch up gear mechanics change the general difference in gear between PvP players as well.
---
Furthermore the whole economy changes based on PvE content available. Some new farming methods become available too soon and different things will be needed for raiders.
---
In vanilla everyone were PvE'ers to some extend. The difference was either you did PvE to get to harder PvE content, or you did PvE to become stronger in PvP.
---
Josh I appreciate what you do. I'm a fairly new listener but I travel around alot with my job so you make the boring drives so much more enjoyable. 
---
I played classic with a bunch of RL friends but most have moved on and I probably won't even get to play classic when it rereleases. But reliving those glory days through this podcast  is a great experience.
---
 Thank you for all that you do. 
---
Off topic a bit but I am playing old school Runescape for the classic itch
---
I’m torn. I have always played horde but I think I will go alliance this time around. I don’t know the quests so it should make for a great adventure. I’ve also always wanted to play a NE Hunter for fun wpvp. Maybe a NE Priest too for mind control fun at the great lift. 
---
It’s going to be just like changing regions/PTR. So no, no ‘split launder.’
---
As to why there’s nothing on the website for Classic, that’s because it’s just additional to the game that already exists, other websites (such as this) already have such large communities for this topic, and the lack of activity on the actual WoW forums pushing something pointless like this why it is how it is. Just wait for Summer lol... 
---
#ACTIVISION BLIZZARD YOU SUCK
---
And that is something other players should care about why? 
---
You happen to have any good Hunter pvp resources? I fully admit to not knowing a ton about their pvp viability, other than bm is godly until people get gear. I just remember blowing them up with my lock mostly lol
---
&gt; There’s so many factors and so many people to please.
---
This is *exactly* why they should just do everything as close to vanilla as possible, including the progression plan. Sure some will still complain, it is the internet after all - but at least they don't pick any side. They just do as they promised, giving us vanilla again. 
---
It sucks if you just want to do BG's and they aren't there at launch, but as you mention, granting BG's at launch ruins the whole "new server open world pvp" experience. It literally removes that era of WoW from the game. That's not fair, so the solution is quite obviously to just do it like in vanilla.
---
You're building a PC for... WoW? 
---
I guess this is a big problem for Classic - people know what is to come. Some people will wait for specific things, especially to try the infamous Naxx raid. So for those people you need a quite fast progression.
---
In vanilla no one was like "speed it up Blizzard, I want Naxx" because no one knew about it.
---
Lots of fun even. In my old guild we used to do special events a few time per year where 1 of us would plot a route through the world and taking screenshots of remote places then posting them as clues for us to follow and the first one to reach him at the "end" would win something small but nice.
---
he said vendor value tho
---
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH GOES INTO CODING A GAME WE ALREADY MADE AND HAS ALL THE COMPLETED QUEST LINES, #DIALOGUE, DUNGEONS, AND RAIDS BUDDY BOY
---
It wasnt, i even think it was more realistic. Similarly fighting with your pet to raise it's level, and even get certain skills on pets. It was much more involved and really more of a companion then just a "spell" like it is today.
---
Why are people so wrapped up in the idea of stages being patches? They are called stages for a reason. They are phases of content that last for a set time. For example; stage 1, it’s likely mc and ony will be released with the launch then this stage may last 10 months to a year, within this year they will release content in patches over the course of the ‘stage’ so it’s very likely am will be released a month or so after release then down the line bwl is released with pvp then a month after ZG. Then stage two begins which also lasts 10 months to a year. Stop confusing stages with patches people. 
---
Engineering is the best PvE and PvP profession 
---
The bomb you are mentioning is called goblin sappers
---
For PvE Alchemy.
---
Buff potions, mana/health, fire resistance. No competition.
---
Yes, it is bad. You can't just come here to reddit spewing nonsense like *you* are in charge of what to do in a video game.
---
You better get your ass to STV so we can gank you.
---
I'm thinking of upgrading myself to an i9-9960X, 32GB RAM and 1660 ti SLI. Do you think that's good enough to run WoW? I don't want any bottlenecking going on.
---
I started off in vanilla as Alliance, only fair to start as Horde this time. Have not made up my mind yet though on which race or even spec, though undead looks good (first few zones at least).
---
&gt; And I'd almost go as far as to say, for discussion sake, Classic WoW is the biggest and most 'hyped' of the 3 newest titles announced since 2017.
---
I think this might be a big part of why Blizz hasn’t gone all out on promoting classic wow: what does it say about the direction of your company when the biggest product of the year is basically just “undoing” the last 15 years of work you have put in to the product? 
---
Not really, but it’s quite good for what it tries to accomplish.
---
Does Alchemy make the flasks last longer or something? 
---
Yeah, people do forget you can world PvP on a PvE server, but there are still quite a bit of differences. One key aspect of a PvP server is how you and everyone always are in danger of getting attacked. The fact that you can't opt out changes things a lot. While some people might think of ganking, Xv1, lvl 60 killing low levels etc. as bad, it is that kind of chaotic war-like experience some people like.
---
Oh, and then there is the people. A PvP server will generally attract, well, PvP players. So you can be quite sure that people are on average better at PvP than on a PvE server. And most of the really skilled PvP players will be found on PvP servers.
---
But yeah, PvE server *is* nice if you just want occasional world PvP, but it really isn't the fully same experience.
---
Im’a let you finish, but Chrono Trigger has the best music of all time!
---
Oh wow you're right. My bad
---
haha
---
This is the correct answer. The reason being is it is the only profession that brings something to raid. Sure, you do need to bring people with specific professions in order to make use of BoP recipes (i.e. Enchanting), but none of them actually can DO something in raid. The closest I can think would be tailoring for bloodvine, but you can have 2 professions, so why not tailoring engineering for casters?
---
Engineer has bombs, sappers, Battle chicken, Arcanite whelp. When you have a raid with 20+ people with sappers you can smash the shit out of AoE checks.
---
In his defense that 1% crit lasts a long time! 
---
We need 5 stages. 
---
Ashenvale has to be 10/10. 
---
Regardless, every song in WoW is great. I can instantly know which kind of zone i'm in based on the music and ambience.
---
Only 4 stages is absolutely terrible. 
---
They should expand that to around 8 stages with longer time frames @ each stage. This seriously needs to be revised and given more careful thought to.
---
do the bombs share CD with potions and stuff or they dont?
---
Some will, but ~40 all in the same faction same guild on one server? Very unlikely.
---
The trick is to log out and do something else for a while. 
---
You can install a private server, get instant max level, teleport and all the gear you want from GM island. That will allow you to explore everything in 1 hour instead of months. Why? The game itself is just a joke, made to steal money from users. There is nothing to explore, it is just a bunch of mobs moving on place and using 1 or 2 abilities in the whole world. What makes it alive is being part of a group and interacting with other players. Remove that and you have just a shitty game with empty maps (just 3d models moving in place) with no videos/interactive story.
---
Overthinking your class pick is pretty normal and honestly like you said: just pick whatever class fantasy appeals to you the most.
---
I won't go into your other comments as they are contentious and mostly conjecture.
---
Engineering is pretty much mandatory for any semi hardcore guild. 
---
Nowadays players aren't playing vanilla. I'm sorry if you feel like pirate server "Accomplishments" are anything to go by, but in reality they are running on guesses and hope.
---
+1 on Ashenvale
---
Hauntingly beautiful and triggers a huge amount of nostalgia for me.
---
This comment will be vastly underrated.
---
Not really an argument, I just want to know what people's personal preference is.
---
I guess I should have stated more clearly I would personally prefer both UBRS and Scholomance to be tuned and expected to be ran as 10 man instances.
---
For the most part of vanilla, Scholomance was ran as a 10 man (while possible to do as a difficult 5) and UBRS wasn't always run with a full 15. It wasn't until 1.10(?) Did they changed the instances to be ran with 10/5.
---
I just think it would be more interesting to have 2 bigger pre-raid instances that need 10 people as opposed to just UBRS.
---
It is good but I am more nostalgic for Ultima Online midi's from the 90s. Also give me Ocarina of Time theme on loop. MegaMan music also hits home.
---
It’s not being considered a “frontline release” and is included with your regular sub so that’s more than likely why. 
---
It wasn't uncommon for people to get full 15s to run then waaay back in the day.
---
Citation needed
---
That’s my memory of it. I thought those were the “raids”. I didn’t know that molten core existed or was a thing for a long time 
---
I keep formulating talent builds over and over for my two classes on playing. I have about 12 Google keep notes packed to the brim with information regarding my leveling, gearing, farming and spec builds.  
---
   
---
It's nice during my down time at work however I'd much rather be fishing in Azshara.
---
A commonly repeated lie. The best DM gear is better than the bad MC gear. "Most" DM gear is trash.
---
Classic wow will probably be a server selection like NA/EU from within WoW page and not a whole new section. 
---
It's a proven scientific fact that you need to he an asshole to play as a gnome.

I don't usually take "summer" to mean literal summer months. Just when it's still hot and isn't winter yet.

Prob gonna want to step up to an SLI setup with RTX series. Just to ensure no bottleneck.

Have you researched gigabit ISP solutions, to minimize latency? Don't want that bottleneck either.

I run PServers on a 9 year old laptop connected to my tv all settings max no isssues

I hardly think you need to build a new pc

Is it bad that I like apples?
---
What a stupid fucking question.
---
There were items like “of the feverflare” giving +10 crit +10 haste, for example.
---
i am not saying everyone on a pvp server knows how to fight.  simply that anyone who does know how to pvp will not be on your pve server.
---
Oh hell yeah you have chimney on this I'm definitely listening to it
---
No. But makes pots and flasks easier to obtain :)
---
Depends on the server population though. If they chose to go with an extended population, black lotuses will be quite hard to obtain.
---
Where do they confirm this?
---
What a horrible timeline. 
---
DM will trivialize MC because most of the gear in DM is better. 
---
ZG will trivialize BWL because caster dps spikes with ZG gear. 
---
No BGs for the first 3 months?? Wow, have fun leveling in eastern plaguelands while hundreds of 60s are ganking you for ranks. 
---
They need to follow a private server timeline which has been proven to work excellently. 
---
Good info.  Followup question on this:  Leveling vs Endgame.  How did you manage inventory space, what bags did you focus on getting, and how many shards would you hold onto?  (i.e. did you ever buy any soul bags pre-60, do you need soul bags @ 60 or would regular travellers be ok (for the diversity in being able to carry regular items instead of just soul shards..; etc etc)
---
Appreciate any info.  Also:  I know voidwalker/imp are the defacto demons to use while leveling, but is there ever a situation you would use succubus or felhound for anything other than demonic sacrifice?
---
Yeah, after they have 35ish L60's they are going to clear MC. Healers can be under level. Its all about levelup speed. Every raid will be cleared on first reset by a LOT of guilds. Most oneshotting ~every boss.

40 hunters kill rag.avi
---
Confirm what? The launcher? They discussed in a Q&amp;A. Feel free to look yourself. 
---
Well on one server it was cleared in... 10 days? I wouldn’t expect the world-first this time around to be any longer than that.
---
I don't know the actual numbers so I can't comment on whether Rag will die in a week but it's not like hardcore players are going to have to find each other. Plenty of Classic guilds have already formed because they've been playing together on private servers for years.
---
I'm sure whatever is possible will be done. 
---
Warlock will be your best bet.  Shadow Priest is fun and if your guild has more than 4 \*or more\* warlocks at a raid level, then a shadow priest may be worth it. (if for some reason your guild has less than 4 a shadow priest becomes hard to justify.)
---
Sounds like a waste of time to me. Any profession you can get with gold is inefficient to me. I can just pay the alchemist in my guild or but off the AH.  I think I’ll go tailoring, engineering, since tailoring gives me 2% crib on bloodvine
---
wait, feverflare? WTF, did they intentionally add them? Such thing never existed!
---
Wasn't the absolute world record 4 days and 20 hours by a hunter? Add the extra time for paladins, warriors, or other slow leveling classes THEN the time it takes to farm rep and there's fucking no way rag dies within a week of launch.
---
unless there is a group of people who have been running private private servers in order to do just that.
---
I met a fella on a private server who played hunter who had created his own personal server over and over in order to practice solo quest leveling a hunter so he can be #1 when all is said and done.
---
Hunters fall off and didn't get better at scaling with gear until TBC.  Warlocks scale better, but their rotation is pretty  boring.  In PvP they have interesting capabilities, but honestly it boils down to your class fantasy appeal.
---
Hells March from Command &amp; Conquer
---
That makes zero sense from a technical perspective as classic and retail have different back ends, client data and files.
---
Not potions or healthstones. Might share a cd with some random things, but it would be items with similar effects. Bombs do a share a cd with lesser ones.
---
The burden of proof isn't on me mate, you made the claim.
---
Engineering by far. Bombs make any boss fight mechanic where loads of adds spawn not even worth mentioning, adds just disappear. DPS increase in normal fights too. Great for aoe tanking taking initial aggro. Engineering shield for tanks. Chickens for AP buff.
---
Tailoring has some BIS cloth user items.
---
Just gonna add a couple sources to this
---
Wikipedia says WoW released in EU February 11, 2005 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft
---
WoWpedia says Patch 1.3 released March 7, 2005 https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.3.0
---
Maybe with low settings and 30fps at 1080p, but if you go any higher on the settings, you'll lose fps.
---
Also that arcanite transmute is a must for end game guilds.
---
I mean a whole lot of MC loot is terribly itemized, the BRD / D2 quest boss / DM loot / Crafted can put someone on on even footing / better than a fully MC looted person.
---
Hunter t1 is really the only properly itemized set besides maybe warrior.
---
Ohh, I didn't know there is only a single spec that is viable for pvp. TIL.
---
I can get on board with this. It just doesn’t seem too likely. 
---
I’m not here to find a Q&amp;A about something as trivial as how we’re going to launch up the game. If you’re truly skeptical about something so redundant, use Google; it’s a handy tool. As for me, I don’t care enough lol.. again, wait for Summer. Don’t be a spastic.
---
That feel when I'm suddenly a chimney :(
---
How close to release would they announce? It's not like they could announce that it's dropping a week or month from now. Odds are, they'd announce the date at least two months in advance. 
---
Does it actually work? Does it just throw other players into a group or what? Ive always wondered lmao
---
OMG auto correct, so annoying! What kind of tea you rocking today? 
---
/me takes a deep breath..

Part of what made the war effort so great was that the mats were readily gatherable by people across a wide range of levels &amp; professions. Yes we can stockpile them now knowing what we'll need, but it was a pretty great spread of items that let everyone on the server feel like they were contributing their part to the war effort, no matter how small.
---
Defcaf Earl Grey because I'm in the office :(
---
Ashenvale music is bis and the music in naxx is amazing too
---
On Nostalrius it took 8 days total (starting from server launch) to clear MC and they did it with 38 people. 
---
Felt like that in BRD yesterday (private server). Got to L60 tuesday, wednesday going to BRD. We had a pally tank, pally heal, rogue, me (dps warr) and a mage. We were going to "save princess run", but going through the instance, not lava run.
---
Got almost all +defence items along the way (pally didnt need them) + HOJ.
---
That's why I bring my arsenal to the office. Lots of Jasmine, oolong, Darjeeling, Assam, pu-erh. (Chauncey from YouTube btw)
---
On a pserver
---
I think it actually ends up in the Horde's favor.  The Horde can level up to the low 20's in the Barrens, a safe zone, while the Alliance end up in Redridge.  Redridge has no Horde FP's, but is anything but safe for Alliance lowbies.
---
I raided with a lock for a little bit in MC and bwl and the damage was okish the problem is threat.  you crit 2x at the start of a fight and a 3rd might pull aggro.  that can be managed but your dps can be controlled by threat and not your actual max dps.  
---
managing mana during raids with lifetap was prob my least favorite thing about them.  i can deal with soulshards, but i hate lifetap and how inefficient they are with mana.  mages get evocate, mana stones, and generally more efficient spells, along with innate threat reduction from talents.  locks really need spell hit since they get 0 destruction spell hit from talents which makes them suck even more in early raids since spell hit gear is not that common.  
---
i still really like lock for what it does and with gear they are a monster in pvp and pve, but for my playstyle i prefer a mage
---
An interesting point here, is that teleporting between capitals is probably more useful for Alliance than horde, due to there being longer travel time between alliance cities.
---
Slightly incorrect.  ZG gear and Tier 2 gear start to give decent enough damage for ele. Though you are correct that AQ20/40 really pumps up their viability as a DPS spec.  
---
You really only need 3-4 pure resto shaman.  If your average guild has 8 shaman (1 for each group) then only about half of them need to be pure resto.  YMMV though.
---
Not sure MC will run smoothly enough in VR with an outdated system like that.
---
Diremaul should not be that big of a issue, for example for EU release back in 2005 there was 3-4 weeks between the release of the game and the release of Diremaul. A handfull of ppl might have been lvl 60 before Diremaul came out. It also never trivialised MC in any way. Hell MC wasn't even cleared in US before DM was released. If anything 1.12 talents and spells and 16 debuff slots will make a lot bigger impact on MC difficulty than the release of Diremaul. All in all i would be fine with releasing DM a bit after release also, but i doubt the impact will be that big. It might impact some of most hardcore players but thats about it i reckon. 
---
Oooh! A man of great taste!
---
I don't drink caffeinated drinks in the office because I don't want to spend extra energy there - gotta save it for yt work ;) 
---
Hmm interesting point. It is worth noting when classic releases, the pop count will be lower so there will be less max level gankers patrolling. But you’re right, I was getting ganked in the middle of Sun Rock and went where it was safe and cozy grinding quilboar in the southern barrens instead.
---
More like they did not have time to remove them.
---
No doubt that this will happen, my guess would prolly be the 2nd week already. But this will be done by the most hardcore players in the world that have been playing on pservers for years and years.  
---
I think its far more interesting to see if casual players will actually be faster than the first time around. 
---
heh, 420.
---
Ah the good ole "burden of proof" bullshit.  Neither of you is required to provide proof on a game forum.  Both of you can use google.  Both of you are equally responsible.  If the other guy wants to provide "proof" ahead of time he can, and should. But it's not required.
---
If you have enough time to reply and make a post to say "The burden of proof isn't on me mate, you made the claim." An equally minuscule amount of time could have been made to google search it for yourself.
---
I personally wouldn't call it world first though, those have been claimed 15 years ago imho. 
---
I don't think so.  You'll still get enrage procs, but not as reliably.  Arms has solid talents at every stage and makes you something other than a fish in a barrel in pvp.
---
&gt; Most Vanilla WoW players weren't present in the earlier patches. Did it ruin the experience for them to begin to play in patch 1.x instead of 1.1? Again I don't think so.
---
Well personally I'd like to experience the patches, or something resembling the patches, that were released before I started playing sometime around 1.5. Obviously it didn't *ruin the experience* for me joining at that time but getting to see WoW release from a different perspective is part of what's attractive to me about Classic. 
---
If we take this argument to its logical extreme, we're left with something like:
---
- Make everything from vanilla available at release, including Naxxramas and all world bosses. I know there are some people that wouldn't care about this but I think even a lot of folks that want DM at release would be wary of this.
---
&gt;You're just screaming around because hardcore 1st day players / world 1st rushers are telling you to do so. Wake up.
---
If you're capable of coming to your own conclusions about this, surely other people are as well, yeah? Why not let your argument speak for itself rather than dismissing everyone else from the debate? 
---
You should roll a paladin.
---
Also no one on PvP servers had even close to full t3, so that is totally fycking irrelevant for a long time.
---
Enjoy getting your blessings and buffs purged.
---
I think that WoW Vanilla ost are indeed the best video game soundtracks to have ever existed.  
---
It's hard to chose a top 5, as every music makes me reminds of a different experience, different feelings, but here's my shot :  
---
\- Login screen, aka "Legends of Azeroth"  
---
\- Some WoW trailer music called "The Shaping of the World"  
---
\- Song of Elune (even though I'm a horde player), which must be played somewhere around Teldrassil or Ashenvale   
---
\- Forest (Hillsbrad Foothills and other places)  
---
\-  Shadowfang Keep dungeon music
---
I'd say no changes as it means I can stock pile materials to sell once there's a huge demand for them.

They said it’ll be out this summer, but I hope the release date isn’t like the last day of summer...

Do you understand how servers work?
---
 First off, Classic WOW is going to use the current architecture.  In fact there's been MANY comments from the developers about how to re-create classic in the current server architecture they are using and how it's been a challenge for them so far. 
---
A front end client CAN be made to use a back-end data set easily.  In fact it's far easier to provide an updated front end that connects to varying back-end clients; then vice-versa in the software industry. (Source: was a hosting application administrator for a software company for 6 years)
---
Yo this comment made me so happy !
---
You're really underestimating the no lifers. Rag will be down before 10 days after release guaranteed.
---
I don’t think a whole bunch of people nerdgasming over something that isn’t out and that most of them haven’t played in a decade is exactly “the biggest product of the year”. Hype is just hype. Not really a useful metric in any sort of evaluation. It’s a semi-random human emotion that is easily misguided and blinded to reality. 
---
How many would need the rep anyway? I know you need revered for the permanent quintessence, but that was only added in 1.11, i tought before one person could douse all runes in a run, provided that one person in the raid got, i think, honored with the waterlords and did the 2 prequests to talk to the duke. If you then summon him 7 times to the duke and back to MC that person should be able to douse all 7 runes with the single use item. 
---
Or it was 7 ppl in the raid that needed to have a quintessence.
---
What?
---
Hakkar's heart doesn't persist through death?
---
Sure Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer and Warchief's Blessing are better from a speedrunning stand-point as it vastly increases DPS primarily. What's going to screw you going in undergeared is a boss like Ragnaros who'll melt (pun intended) your tank, getting a flat 15% stamina boost on that shit is invaluable, and in general the extra survivability pushes you out of lethal range from a lot of things such as domo reflects/blast waves, Rag blasts etc.

Thats quite a big gamble, does he even know if all the data on his own pserver is 100% correct. It would suck to go off wrong data, get stuff wrong in your planning and put it all that time and then fail at being #1 in Classic. 
---
It does look like an uprooted building straight out of WarCraft 3.
---
It's kind of the height of arrogance for them to go about it this way.  Connecting it through Battle.net and re-engineering everything from the current game backwards.  All they had to do was release a server realmlist for people to connect to.  It's obvious they're looking to milk this thing for more money than just a subscription.
---
Sorry for your 10-12% getting confused.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
Hardcore raiding and hardcore leveling are two completely different skill sets. While some players enjoy both, it definitely isn't true that all hardcore raiders are also speed levelers.
---
In my experience, most of the people who enjoy speed leveling play multiple alts and while they casually raid on done of them they enjoy the journey to 60 more than hardcore endgame raiding.
---
id say many of us wont be pretending....
---
They're such fucking arrogant idiots. But here we are. We did want it. Shocker.

I think his point is that for EU players delaying DM is not really blizzlike (it wasn't in at launch though, but 3-4 weeks after launch, so basicly no one was 60 yet). For US players a delay is blizzlike though. 
---
&gt; "you think you want it but you don't"
---
that was in reference to exploits not content.  They fixed that issue by using the modern client and porting it to the 1.12 database.  That's why they were so excited about that technical presentation at blizzcon.
---
I mean, I wasn't in this exact situation, but I was in the #1 top raiding guild on emerald dream before bc was released. Yet after bc release, while the guild had done the best raiders on the server, that didn't necessarily translate into them being the fastest levelers.
---
Yes, but with Diremaul they could shave literal *minutes* off that time unfairly!!!!!
---
I don't think it was intended that way, I think it just worked out that way since the barrens is such a massive zone. Splitting the barrens into north(uncontested) and south(contested) would be a good move. Making Redridge uncontested would be another good move, the fact that it is contested just fucks the alliance over hard.
---
You don't can't travel form until level 30. Stealth might be more effective for getting past things, I forget what level you are able to train stealth. Since these are trained abilities, they will cost silver and if your only purpose is to level quickly you won't have a lot (if any.)
---
As much I love classic soundtracks, MoP has a lot of good songs as well. I’m on my phone, so I can’t share an example right now.
---
What the fuck am I reading ? 
---
No it's not, stop it. It's maybe mandatory in the most autistic hardcore server first guilds.
---
We're all gonna make it brahs...
---
don't think we'll have it any time soon =(
---
I, like an embarrassingly large amount of us, rolled a NE hunter for my first char. The time spent with my first pet bear Guinness seared that enchanting music and visuals into my brain. Can you blame me !?
---
Sets are always overshadowed by superior individual pieces, that isn't a molten core flaw. It's true among the tier 0 dungeon sets, true with tier 2, absolutely true with AQ's t2.5 sets. The exception to the rule is t3 in Naxx what has nearly perfect itemization for most raiding classes.
---
I think it’d have to be Darnassus for me purely based on the nostalgia. First character was a Druid and I had no clue what was going on, but when I finally made it to my first big city I was blown away. Spent probably two weeks getting to level 10 just because of how much exploring and aimless wandering I was doing. That was the best time I’ve ever had playing a game. Wasn’t about leveling up quick or getting good gear. It was about being pulled in to the world.
---
Spent a ridiculous amount of time saving up 50 silver for the owl pet you could get outside darnassus lol. I was pretty much the most powerful being in Azeroth after getting that in my mind.
---
But I’ll never forget going into darnassus and really wanting to guard the place. Crazy how fast I felt like a part of the world. I hope some kids out there give Classic a shot and get to experience this. 
---
Or just don't use those buffs, they aren't mandatory in any way, shape or form. Especially since this content was cleared already years and years ago. If you don't find it fun to use these buffs, just don't do it. 
---
In Vanilla how many guilds would run Diremaul, save a ony head before a MC run. I can tell you, it wasn't a commonplace practise at all. 
---
Ragecap is a pserver thing and Ironfoe has 0.5% droprate. 
---
The classic wow community is soooo high maintenance haha! 
---
Lmao
---
All about invincible and the ghost lands my dudes
---
Most private servers are horribly overpopulated though. It will most likely be way less ganking in official classic servers.
---
I realized vanilla Wow is really the only video game I wanna play and started on Northdale. The way I look at it is like a test run, getting into certain habits, trying different classes and figuring out quests and zones. Retail classic experience is going to be a different experience anyway from private servers and I’ve always been a kind of altoholic. The security of your character alone is gonna change the experience.
---
I could also careless about corrupt GMs as long as it doesn’t effect me (which at the moment it hasn’t). And ping hasn’t really been a problem.
---
Also we don’t even have a release date for classic yet, and don’t know what stupid things ActiBlizz will add. 
---
So I say just go and have fun on Northdale in the mean time... i’m loving it and the server is really active.
---
You only live once and what other games are there that are this special? 
---
Man my favs are og Teldrassil, STV, Storm Peaks and Duskwood. Listening to those send me back to my childhood. 
---
WHO CARES?  Seriously how will it affect your experience one iota if top guilds on your server clear MC in 2 weeks after launch?  Just ignore them.
---
Would love to see a WoW 2 that kept theme park elements but also offered more sandbox elements like SWG.
---
Yeah, I don't have my hopes up either. I'll take Classic for what it is and try to enjoy it.
---
Honestly, I think a proper progression is the most important aspect. I don't care a flying fuck about battlenet implementation or tiny changes in the smallest graphics. I don't care if my Aimed Shot does 2000 or 2001 damage. But I care about whether or not the progression is so fast I can't keep up.
---
In Vanilla MC wasn't even cleared before DM was out, so that loot and these buffs were available back then also for guilds progressing on Ragnaros. Did a lot of guilds use them often if at all, not really to be fair. They were used ofc in some niche cases, but not in general during every raid. 
---
I still have my level 20 something warlock on am abandoned server on retail... I ran SFK 10+ times and never won robes of Arugal :( I believe I'm in the chest from RFC on that toon.
---
This thread makes me shake my head at this community.  WTF is wrong with you people?  Who cares if no-lifers will have an easier time clearing content before you do?  Just ignore them!   Level at your own pace, and clear content at your own pace.
---
Horde. I like both factions, but it will always be home for me. &lt;3
---
TIL
---
the word you are looking for is three
---
I didn't say that quote was in regards to content. I said it was in reference with whether or not vanilla would be popular - which I'd say is true. It boils down to them thinking people wouldn't want to play vanilla if they actually got to try it again.
---
The catch with tailoring is that you can drop it once you've crafted those BIS robes. Tailoring's only unique bonus is an additional 2% crit when wearing full bloodvine, but often you'll only wear 1-2 pieces not the full set, and you're really wearing it for the +hit, the +crit is just a cherry on top.
---
I'm gonna be honest, even though it's a change it would be interesting to see people's reaction to it being different resources needed. Guilds would scramble out their troops and start farming non-stop in hope of being the first ones in. It would definitely be more rememberable for the entire classic community for years.
---
But I don't think Blizzard will change it up, simply because they have said that they don't want to touch the old data at all thanks to the ripple effect it can have.
---
Tbc had some great ones as well. Netherstorm is my favorite
---
Dude people made guides for fucking RFC on YouTube.  The classic content stone has been squeezed so dry already it makes your mom's twat look like a rain forest.
---
NO.
---
I'm about to have my second child.
---
Give me time to get him sleeping through the night and give me about four months at least to settle on a main.
---
Do I do a human Paladin and relive vanilla?  Recreate my rogue and go back to farming barmans Shanker? That was fun and almost makes me want to pick a rogue.
---
Do I try a PvP server this time? I've been in war mode for months in BFA and am loving it.  I probably should.
---
But I was on a pve server in vanilla so do I want to do a paladin on a PvP server? 
---
Should I see this as a fresh start and try something I've never really gotten into like a warlock or druid?
---
I always envied mages and only got mine to about 40 in vanilla.  Mage?
---
I NEED TIME TO THINK, please not yet lol
---
In all seriousness, fell in love with druid in BFA for the first time ever and am tempted to try a druid in classic.  Also a lock, but the paladin and rogue keep a-callin.....
---
bloodvine is pretty amazing for locks until naxx, assuming you have the full set and tailoring bonus.  i think most min/max will have tailoring and 3/3 until its actually worth breaking which could be months
---
Thanks for your insight, I don't plan to play on a pvp server, just trying to reach 60 the least painful way haha. I'm thinking going Arms from the beginning and using the 1 mob pooling/2 mobs WW method. Especially now that we know the /sit won't work on Classic.
---
Faster imo. I can't see them stretching this over 2 years. 
---
[Here](www.reddit.com)
---
Not trying to make a direct response there, but it might be a good idea to take a look at the video where JAB says this to give context.  It has nothing to do with if people wanted to play it or not.  It was in response to "you have already released the game once, just let us play it" type of question.  There are so many exploits for that original game client that have been developed that the game would literally be unplayable without serious and full time oversight and moderation by blizzard.  Porting it to the modern client is the only way this would work which is why they couldn't just "release the game they already had".
---
felwood?
---
That's not true at all, we know that they fired, sorry laid off, 800 people.
---
Quite possible yes. Grizzly did it 1-2 weeks after Nost release iirc yea?
---
”Undocumented servers welcome”.
---
Re reading my previous post I hope it didn't come off too hostile.  
---
Anyhow: I'll leave this link here.  https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2444718-Classic-WoW-FAQ
---
Yes the client they are basing it originally off of is a legion 'off-shoot'  for all intents and purposes that is "retail architecture".  That being said it's being a little pedantic to say that legions architecture isnt closely related to BFA.  
---
Not saying I'm infallible and we could ALL be wrong and they have another plan entirely; but in terms of what makes sense: it makes sense to re create the classic experience that can be easily integrated into the modern bnet client. In order to do that I'm willing to bet that the backend architecture (read:not the dataset) will be very similar if not the same as the retail architecture.
---
Well, might be too long since I saw the video. Can't watch it right now, so I won't comment further on it.
---
Still, I'd say the point of my original comment holds.
---
What planned release for Bliz in 2019 do you expect to be bigger than WoW classic? The entire advertising industry disagrees with your assessment of hype, I’m inclined to do so as well.
---
I had some great memories from Feralas but I never fully appreciated it until I was reading some random blog in BC. The guy was talking about how he felt Feralas was the most beautiful zone and often overlooked. It was then that I gave it some more thought and my love for the zone has grown ever since. 
---
To this day, no other zone has felt so wild to me. The tree cover and overwhelming greenness of everything make it so feel so isolated and remote that I'm always comfortable and relaxed when I'm there. It gives me a feeling of coziness similar to the bio-domes in Netherstorm, despite having so much more open space. They really hit it out of the park with Feralas. 
---
I love that Blizzard created the Emerald Dreamway for druids in Legion. It's easy for me to visit Feralas whenever I want now. 
---
Gordok Ogre Suit 
---
but this requires lvl 42.  If you combine this with all the other things, you can get really huge. (at least Molten Giant size)
---
You didnt consent to the other 2999 people on the server either.
---
I agree with your original point about them not changing the release schedule, but I think it's because they want a very easy and streamlined process so they can release new "fresh" servers routinely in the future with very little overhead.
---
No. There is no correct way to play a game.
---
You pay for your account and you decide what to do. 
---
That is how it is. 
---
The problem here isnt the streamer themselves, but the "ripple affect" caused by them being present. Of course, I think its a bit silly. Let streamers roll on my server. If its a real problem we'll just gank em until they xfer.
---
Yeah seriously. I’m happy beyond belief that Classic is coming out this year but for God’s sake, I wish summer would just hurry up and get here! Since Blizzard really nothing major planned for this year, and have no new games or expansions coming out this year other than a remastered Warcraft 3, why don’t they give us more updates on when Classic is coming out? That is all I care about from Blizzard anyway. 
---
I’m really restless since Blizzard is being dead silent about a concrete release date. They made me really happy in November and ever since then.... Nothing. Not a peep. I’ve checked Wowhead and the depths of the Internet all the time and still nothing.  I’m guessing and hoping that in the spring we will get the actual day it comes out. 
---
/me considers rolling that Rogue 
---
As a rogue just messing with people while you are in stealth. 
---
I'd aim for 10 and if you end up being able to no life weekends for 5-6 weeks you may be able to push higher
---
"Guys, the launch was fucked up in Europe so we should make the same mistake again!"
---
Brilliant.
---
I'm debating between a mage or a warlock. Warlock does seem the most appealing to me, but I will most likely roll alliance, and world pvp is a big deal to me. How much of a problem will wotf actually pose?
---
Upvoting because of your edit.
---
I remember my cousin hitting High Warlord in vanilla. We were in high school. He would wake up @ 5 am to get a few games in before class. He would play a match during lunch break in the library. He would play from when he got home til when he went to bed. I think it took him about 3+ months of hardcore playing.
---
It's hard to say how far you will get since it's dependent on how competitive the race will be for your server. If you get in a good premade you should definitely be able to get R10+.
---
10, you’ll probably want to push for 11 for the epic mount at a major discount. Anything more and u prob have to take time off from work. Rank 10 lock gear is great
---
&gt; it definitely isn't true that all hardcore raiders are also speed levelers
---
That's not what I said. I said that many of the people that will be doing that have already found each other. 
---
The #1 guild on my pserv requires all raiders to have 300 Engineering... they also require everyone to have a raid-ready alt (for group comp. adjustments if needed) and a level 45 warlock alt solely for summoning purposes.  Definitely beyond semi-hardcore.
---
The next top 20 guilds on the server don't require any of that, and still have all current content on farm.  None of them will ever compete with the #1 guild for clear times, but I think its a fair trade-off considering they don't have to devout their life to a pserv guild... lol.
---
The question is, why would you want to push high ranks as a warlock. Your premium pvp gear is from raiding anyway.
---
I would say start with a leveling guild, and recruit everybody.  Make it clear that the intention is to start raiding PVE at lvl 60, but everybody above lvl 10 (or 20) is welcome.
---
you will automatically assemble a group of people that bond together and have the intent to raid this way, as they will learn to work together in 5 man content.  Eventually people will step up to take leading roles. 
---
Lot's of people will leave, that's also ok and part of the natural flow. 
---
Once enough people are lvl 60 and you are doing regular UBRS runs you start recruiting extra lvl 60 members to step into 40 man raiding. Around this time you should have one or two main tanks, and a good healing team leader.  There are always players interested in starting the raid progression from scratch. 
---
Before the lvl 60 content it is a good idea to start organizing weekly dungeon runs at (somewhat) fixed times, both to discover what good raid times will be and to get people used to this kind of organized play  (sign up, and actually show up)   This is also very useful for Onyxia key quests etc.  
---
You could hit 13 with a good premade.
---
Although now you would log in on a level 1, go to your heirloom tab and equip your head, chest, neck, shoulders, back, legs, rings, trinkets, and weapon.
---
I want the best 1v1 class for duels and I'm leaning on SL Lock with eng/tailoring. Are there any matchup guides? gearing guides? ect?
---
Yeah, that's pretty much what I've figured through my research. I like to think that as Classic becomes older and older, and the crazies have gotten their r14, my playable hours will get me higher on the ladder each week. You got to think the ladder will become less and less competitive?
---
once classic is 2,3 years old, maybe I'll be able to get that r14 :P
---
At least one out of three Horde characters will be Undead and it wouldn't surprise me if Undead made up 40% or more of all Horde players.
---
I almost wish they would double the time between each planned release.  The thing I wished the most about retail Vanilla was that it would have gone slower so that I could enjoy the content, but it just felt so rushed.  Since Classic isn't going to have any expansions why not release the content as slow as possible.  
---
Caveat: it depends where in the patch cycles we are. It'll get easier later on as raid gear starts to outperform the PvP sets. But 11 is definitely doable and I think if you're efficient R13 probably is too (esp. if you really nolife the weekends for the final few ranks). I had 3 friends who hit 11 on a very popular (at the time) EU server playing less than that and I hit 10 playing way less.
---
Doesn’t the “No green dragons” refer to the elite dragons around the Emerald dream portals or am I mistaken? The ones that you need to kill for a fragment for the AQ gate opening chain.
---
This 
---
Yeah, I agree, having good class leaders makes a huge difference in your guilds ability to operate smoothly (especially with loot distribution). They should know all of their classes current gear and performance, so loot is going to the best candidates. Make sure their class has buff assignments, or healing assignments, their schedules, etc.
---
End game guilds will have Alchemy on alts
---
I agree with what your saying... if you don't mind farming gold and having a guild member making all your potions/consumables then you will be better off with engineering.
---
That said, alot of people (myself included) really like being self-sufficient when it comes to raid prep.  I like knowing that I can gather the herbs I need on my time, and that I can make my consumables for myself and always be prepared without having to coordinate with another player to have things made.
---
I did MC with another fury warrior. I was dual wield, and he used a 2h. He usually beat my DPS. His AOE was better than mine, but my single target was slightly better. 
---
&gt; is revising the mats to open the gates too much of a change? 
---
If I learned anything in discussions about Classic, it's that "any" change is too much of a change. 
---
Personally, I wouldn't care one way or the other. My memory of the time is fuzzy enough that I wouldn't even notice the difference without a google research anyway. 
---
I feel you, bro.. Went through the Smash Ultimate information drought and now this one, it's rough.
---
And that's fine because you would just be helping me filter out the newbs who can't understand why it's fairest that all people roll need on valuable boes. 
---
I do like these kinds of changes.  Knowing whats to come changes the nature of the game and having to figure out as you go is more in line with the original experience.  Things like this are welcome to me.
---
Yea, classic wow is definition of balanced pvp which showcases who has the best skill. It's definitely not based on who has sunk more time or money in the game.
---
&gt; The thing I wished the most about retail Vanilla was that it would have gone slower so that I could enjoy the content, but it just felt so rushed.
---
Lol no.  I started at Nov 04, downing bosses in MC in Jan 05.  The gap between content patches was huge, meaning we were raid logging for most of wow.
---
Playing on a pvt server with a sped up timeline is a hugely different experience.
---
Alliance zones close together 1-30? Are you out of your mind? Horde has the Barrens, Stonetalon, Ashenvale, and Thousand Needles right next to each other. Hillsbrad is further out of the way, but Horde has far more convenient cross-continental travel since zeppelins are right outside Orgrimmar and Brill. Alliance has to deal with flying to Menethil Harbor, then flying from Darkshore every time. Horde leveling is just so much more convenient from 1-30.
---
Im a pserver player myself but just wat. Imagine playing this hc on a server that potentially could close any day..
---
Unpopular opinion here, MC is already a cake walk. Each boss has 1-2 mechanics and the trash is usually more difficult than the bosses.
---
Yeah, I expect to raid. I just never have really done it and don't know if I'll be in a guild and get drops and such. At least I know if I can get r10 I got a pretty good set guaranteed. Also horde lock pvp set is the most awesome looking set.
---
The only way it becomes less competitive is if the server you're on decides on honor agreements and you don't have any huge assholes. Otherwise it will always be people pushing 1mil+ easily a week.
---
Is there any guild that raids from morning/noon?
---
Really hard to find a serious raiding guild.
---
Yeah people keep saying DM and 16 debuff slots at launch.  If that's the case, Blizz has already totally screwed Classic up lol.  But hey I play Warlock, so bring on the dps for me LMAO!  Oh and say bye to all your healers because all of the priests will want to be shadow from the get go.
---
If you spend 2 hours gathering herbs to make potions and I spend 1 hour doing the most efficient gold farming method and then buy the same potions you made, then I am saving myself 1 hour.  If you argue that getting the herbs yourself is more efficient then that means herbalism is the best money maker in the game which I don’t think it is. 
---
I dunno but I got the flurry axe in off hand and thrash blade main hand.... DW is fun and the dps is great (when you actually hit) I’m lvl 50 btw and I don’t really have +hit gear.  I’m not a min/maxer obviously but I’m having fun with it.  Pros: more potential dps on mobs and in PvP.  Cons: misses destroy you in PvP
---
If you're alliance you dual wield. The only exception is if you get a BRE off of Ragnaros as an upgrade from pre-bis.
---
As horde I really don't know what the cut off is though they will do more damage with 2h than alliance does cause of windfury. 
---
6 hours per night, weekends free? You'd definitely be able to get rank 10, and you don't really even have to premade for that even though it'd be quicker.
---
You can probably get rank 11 if you play on a smaller server or sacrifice an hour or two of sleep for a few weeks.
---
Rank 12 is probably out of the picture unless you take multiple sick days.
---
&gt;DM coming out at launch is also not a great idea. You'd want DM to come out with BGs in between major content. DM-T buffs would make MC a complete joke &amp; the gear from DM would make a lot of other instances kind of obsolete, even at launch.
---
Agree, DM gear/buffs trivializes 95% of MC as soon as it comes out. If the goal is to present any kind of challenge at all (the act of grinding Hydraxian rep for Aqual quints, working out boss strats, wiping to Baron, etc.) then you want to wait until MC is cleared for a lot of guilds.
---
Should be good enough, I’m building a quantum computer from nano material and adamantium just to be sure.
---
I'm moving to an apartment down the street from the datacenter to minimize latency
---
I sadly hope it is. Away all summer doing a field course and won’t be able to play till September. But I’ll be happy for everyone else if it drops mid summer. 
---
High Couture troll/ogre high heels
---
You shouldn't be anxious at least until the start of summer, because that's when they said the game was comming.
---
If you happened to get in your servers legit best premade, where they literally never lose to other premades, and your server didn't have bracket Buster's... I think you could probably do rank 13...MAAAAAYBEE 14 (BIG MAYBE). As long as your servers top premade queued during your availability. 
---
Maybe the weekends will be prime queues for your server, then that would help. Some people would honor cap in 3-4 days on their rank14 push during good weeks where no one was being an asshole and trying to bust a bracket.
---
It seems to be some sort of a trinket. My guess is that it's either [Ramstein's Lightning Bolts](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13515/ramsteins-lightning-bolts) or [Six Demon Bag](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7734/six-demon-bag).
---
Yeah, but the r10 set is not really that good for a warlock. Especially if they rollout ranking with BWL. But I get your point - at least you don't have to depend on anyone and for sure get something. Still I'd recommend finding at least a casual guild and raiding some. The first raids are really easy and fairly quick, so the time commitment to get better gear is far smaller compared to ranking. Anyway, warlock is a great pick and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
---
I wanted 2060's but the nice man at the store said I cannot run them SLI.
---
and no... I haven't looked into gigabit ISP... I'm such a plebeian... I'll never be able to properly run a 15 year old game. Even the minimum specs for Vanilla WoW calls for a 935MHz processor or a G4 or G5... I can't even find those online?! They must be crazy expensive. Plus it requires 512GB of RAM... 
---
Grats!
---
1660 ti SLI would be a complete waste of money. 
---
How is it arrogant to modernize the vanilla client? If anything, they are doing it to make it easier to fix bugs and run the servers cheaper. Not everything Blizz does is a shady cashgrab.
---
Exactly. 
---
They "had" to put the 1.12 patch info on a 7.5 client or something.
---
Because this way they'll be able to use the newer functions like battle.net and such. That's why it's taking them so long basically.
---
Yep, I spent a lot of time SL spec. I never went out looking for a fight, but the spec was amazing for driving away players who tried to contest your farming spots.
---
Just from a developers perspective, while they may be tied to battle.net and have the same sub -- the games have two totally different dev teams, product strategies, and client data.
---
While I agree on the premise it would be convenient for the user to simply "choose" a different server to pick between a list of "classic" and "retail" servers, everything else falls apart entirely after that.
---
Game settings, game data, meta data, and everything in between is totally different and would be a technical nightmare to have them sit on the same client. And the premise of needing to have essentially two games be installed to play one is also ridiculous.  You are essentially forcing every player who is only interested in playing Classic to have a full updated version of Retail and vice versa at all times.  If one game has an update (they have two dev teams on different release schedules) all the other players on the different game now must experience down time to update their client for a game they don't care for.
---
It just makes sense to have a classic launcher and a "normal" retail launcher, instead.
---
IMO, racials don't matter too much in WPVP. Racials have more of an impact in premade vs premade or duels.
---
What makes you think it's semi-confirmed? They announced it at Blizzcon. It IS confirmed unless something catastrophic happens.
---
On live, Joana, way back in 04-06. 
---
I’m pretty certain mages AoE Grinding or group mob tagging can be done faster, and that will be stressed come launch day. 
---
I never saw it used tbh, I think it just auto-invited people in a specific level range who had used the stone to fill out a party.
---
You still don't get it and haven't read a good damn thing a said. Go away
---
You don't have to buy anything, you just have to subscribe.
---
Yeah, but north americans don't like using easy and simple measures.
---
Dropped in to say the same thing. Every track on the FFVII soundtrack is fantastic. I could listen to Listen to the Cries of the Planet for hours. 
---
Disagree, MC is a faceroll already, every guild with a 40 man roster will clear up to Majordomo on their first week, and DM buffs will just allow them to get out of that joke of a raid faster.
---
I'm looking forward to throwing chain lightning into crowds of alliance in the inevitable warzone known as the Hillsbrad Foothills in the first content release stage.
---
No BG's on PvP servers means Hillsbrad, STV'nam, Ashenvale and BRM will be blood baths.
---
I can't fucking wait.
---
No one is stopping them from getting an epic mount lol!  Go buy one like everyone else.  Warlock and Pally mounts are there to be a special price discount for them.  Those mounts are a special unique item that only Warlocks and Pallys can get.  No one else in the game will have mounts that look like theirs.  The resurrection of those mounts is tied to Dire Maul.  Since the original release of Vanilla Locks and Pallys have had to wait for DM to get their mounts.  Why would that change now?  Stop trying to change Vanilla.  Nobody cares what Blizzard gave EU back when.  They're lucky they got to play WoW at all.
---
9 months of MC no thanks
---
Don't worry, the proc rate is super low, and the proc doesn't scale with spell damage. It's another vendor item, or keep for rp.
---
There was at least one pserver where nobody was particularly motivated to complete the war effort, so the staff auto-completed it after a few weeks rather than having it drag out. Don't assume people are always going to stockpile.
---
However, stockpiling can happen. I don't know that having players dedicated enough to force an early completuion of the War Effort is such a bad thing, or whether it is guaranteed to happen.
---
There are a lot of aspects in WoW where people know all the spawn points, best gear, places to farm, etc and #nochanges will trivialize a large portion of the game for a lot of people.
---
Engineering is BiS profession for both PvP and PvE
---
I don't know about OP but you piqued my interest.
---
Pretty sure Diablo 2 has that honor.
---
Yeah lionheart is same model recolored tho
---
You can easily skip darkshore, or just do darkshore. 
---
Dark Messenger from 9 tho.
---
What the hell is an honor agreement? Like once someone hits highest rank they just chill?
---
And don't forget, if they release Classic with 16 debuffs, it will be even easier because locks will be higher DPS and shadow priests will be in on the action.
---
I built my first one for BC so yeah I figured I'd finally update too a PC that will run the legion client and stream music at the same time
---
The green dragons are not really needed for NR gear in order to clear AQ. Maraudon and other places provide enough NR gear to make it. 
---
&gt;  the pop count will be lower so there will be less max level gankers patrolling.
---
I think this is such an important point that bears repeating. A lot of expectations people have with this stuff is skewed by private servers with enormous player caps.
---
That's probably not how it would work in practice. The guilds that would be buying your mats would simply have farmed their own.
---
You'd have better opportunities to make money if they do change the materials, because then those guilds will actually be strapped for resources. 
---
Azeroth is such a vast place to explore. And having the world back the way it was pre-Cata is a real treat. 
---
Yes, we have to remember that a player base of 10k players on one pserver is going to be way different than a player base of 2-3k players on a Classic server.
---
9 is a very close second FF game for me, and if I didn't have the nostalgia I have for FF7, I'd probably say 9's soundtrack is at least equal if not better.
---
Classic Wow is being treated like a side project/fan project, so no news is good news for me. They already said it is coming out this year, hopefully Summer 2019 like they said. Hold your steadfast resolve a little longer brothers.
---
I don’t trust any pserver records, you can’t turn around without a gm putting his thumb on the scale
---
I've developed a full proof plan for waiting for classic. 2 weeks from now, I'm headed to Miami for a work conference (which i'm excited for) so I count down to that. Then, 5 weeks later, I'm going on a cruise for my wife's 30th Birthday. Then, roughly 2 months later i'm closing on a house.
---
Just fill your schedule with other things to count down to. Build a house, go to the bahamas, get married, have a kid, etc.
---
1 2060&gt; SLI 1060s
---
Nah, Plaguewood is the area in front of Stratholme Live with its huge ziggurats and giant mushrooms. Lots to see in the acolyte quarters, but next to no quests. :/
---
Naw it's like an agreement on how much honor the rankers will farm for the week. Its normally higher than individuals can farm, but you want to keep it low so you don't spend a ton of time ranking if you can (especially during holidays).
---
That's interesting to me because I remember singing the praises of Nagrand as everything zone design should be at the time. And I hated EVERY other TBC zone. 
---
I think its hard to design theme park driven content if you dont control how classes are designed. 
---
I would love a theme park game with raids and curated content, but how do you balance raids curated raids without knowing the meta? 
---
You were not very specific. Hardcore raiders and hardcore speed levelers are two different types. My point was that even if you have a group of 50 hardcore raiders from a private server, that doesn't automatically translate into all 50 of them being hardcore at speed leveling also. If you meant to imply that, I apologise, but you didn't say it outright.
---
Personally I don't think it will happen. Private servers have the advantages of being free and somewhat unifying. A guild that plays on private server x probably includes players from all over the world, and I suspect many players will prefer to play in locally hosted servers for performance reasons, which is going to wreck many private server guilds. I also suspect at least some percentage of private server players are unable or unwilling to pay for a retail sub to play.
---
Anyway, we'll see in a few months :)
---
I played the original plenty, I’m just not sure how much that’s going to inform the finer details of mechanics in classic
---
I personally hope so.
---
When Naxx came out back in the day, a lot of guilds were still trudging through AQ 20/40.
---
Stage 1 could easily last 6-10 months, and Stage 2 - 4 could easily last 12-14 months.
---
It would also be a good way for Acti/Blizz to milk money off the game by just prolonging the content.
---
I steamrolled through 7 without a whole lot of effort. Killed the under water weapon without help, though I never got ruby. I spent a lot longer on 9. I went after all of the skills, weapon unlocks, collected the cards, and Ark will always be my favorite summon.
---
I love 9 more than the others. Maybe I was too young when I played 7, maybe life was rougher at the time and 9 was my escape. Whatever it was, 9 is my comfort game, and I love all of it.
---
It's also the last final fantasy game I actually enjoyed playing, so that too.
---
That's a strange way to spell elder scrolls
---
I would personally like to see Stage 2 be split up into two.
---
Stage 2a - BWL + PvP/BG's
---
Stage 2b - ZG + Tier 0.5 + Twilight Summons
---
Stage 3 - AQ War Effort + AQ20/40
---
From my limited understanding, agreements are meant to establish "honor brackets".  I.e. an agreement will form between the dedicated PvPers of a server and each person in that group will be given an honor cap/bracket.  Doing this maximizes the upward movement of a larger group of people, and lessens the amount of time everyone has to grind.  Brackets are needed because only a certain number of people can move up to the highest ranks each week.  So, if you're willing to wait your turn at the lower brackets, when your time comes, reaching those higher ranks becomes a bit more manageable.
---
However, all of this is ruined if even one person decides to break the brackets and farms honor excessively.  Once someone does this, the brackets are shifted and everyone gets screwed over.  The end result is that everyone else has to no-life and farm excessively to keep up with that one person.
---
Link me your best song 
---
You sold me at BWL + T0.5 tied together.
---
&gt;Nobody cares what Blizzard gave EU back when. They're lucky they got to play WoW at all.
---
What an incredibly ignorant statement.
---
I'd love to see a mix of no changes and modification. Like have a ton of materials required but change the ones you need so people can't prepare. 
---
The game isn't about just raids....
---
I've seen this happen more often than not. Which is why I laugh when a greedy mage or whatever spends hours trying to form the perfect group so that nobody will roll against them. If he just ran the damn instance he could have cleared it three times instead of once and it would still be worth it if he had to roll against another player.
---
Rank 10 or 11. Further you need premades and be a NEET
---
I think you can last in bloodvine on ANY caster until late AQ at least.  Its pretty hard to find 3 other items that give a combined benefit, and even then you have to get all three to drop and funneled to you.
---
DW is better period with exception of when you have WF totem and BRE (or any other wep that is of higher quality than one hands available for you).
---
and don't forget about the added Warlock and SPriest dps if they launch with full debuff slots.
---
My opinion 
---
Each server's War Effort event should require a different random list of materials so players can't stock up and farm the mats months prior.
---
Give it a rest already.  Nobody cares what Blizz gave to EU.  EU got the game late that's the only reason their timeline was different lol.
---
What more info is there to give for a game that came out over 14 years ago?
---
Both retail and classic Everquest sit on the same client. Blizzard will likely do the same. It's built off retail as a previous comment said, so they won't need a separate client.
---
DM and 16 debuffs at launch is a game changer.
---
True, the challenge at the start usually lays in getting good enough gear and enough level 60s to actually do the instance. 
---
Yeah on N*D* private server spirit mail gear sells just as well as str/stam or agil/stam.  
---
I had a bunch in my early 20s because of crescent staff from WC and a few random gear pieces I could chain-farm mobs a level or two below me with basically zero downtime, I stayed at those quilboars by Camp T for a couple levels getting all of those buffs from the blood shards, spamming bandages (because of endless linen/wool cloth drops) and also farming the thunder lizards nearby for their tails for a cooking recipe.  It is a PERFECT warrior grinding spot. 
---
I’m curious which you think is contentious. Because lots of stuff we discuss here is conjecture. We definitely don’t know anything about patch progression. And I know the community likes to assume we’ll basically get 1.12, but I personally just don’t think that’s a safe assumption.
---
Seems like an important point to raise imo, that if you’re picking a class assuming 1.12, some things could potentially be pretty different or even change in a patch a few months in. 
---
ahh hell yea my first 60 was a paladin before i went horde back then. i used to think i was doing my holy duty "farming" those mobs
---
bUt I'm a MeLeE HuNtArD!1111
---
Currently, I am leaning towards going an orc rogue. However, because my friend will be joining me as an undead priest (he will be playing spriest until 60), I'm also heavily considering an orc warrior. I just don't know what to expect if I decide to go warrior. My friend and I typically play together often and we usually focus on PVP pretty hardcore. 
---
I have generally heard of the juggernaut duality of a healer and a warrior in a pvp setting, but I think that is pretty gear dependent, right? Although I know gearing up is necessary, I don't want to be spending a large portion of my time focused on PVE for fantastic gear in PVP.
---
Either way, my friend and I have it looking good due to the fact that he is a healer when it comes to group content.
---
What do you guys think?
---
An authentically-long war effort provides three things:
---
1) Opportunity for entire servers to band together in a common goal. Even the newest, most inexperienced player can contribute to opening the gates and help their server compete with others.
---
2) Stimulates the economy by creating new demand for materials, getting gold out of guild stockpiles, and creating opportunities specifically for lower level and more casual players to earn gold. 
---
3) Affords guilds a reasonably tight amount of time to complete their Scepters. 
---
All of these things, particularly the first, contributed to why the War Effort is remembered so strongly. It wasn't just a day of server-crashing madness in the desert. It was weeks of preparation leading up to it. And it came out of nowhere. The World suddenly put a goal in front of us, so we met it. 
---
If they *don't* change the material requirement, top guilds can stockpile mats for months and complete the War Effort in rapid fashion, robbing servers of everything that made the event legendary.
---
So it follows that changing the material requirement to prevent metagaming is consistent with "no changes" philosophy. And in my opinion, preserving the integrity of the event should be important to Blizzard because the legacy of the War Effort played no small part in influencing the community's desire for Classic servers. I believe it's the right thing to do. 
---
I would say if you can get rank 12 for the first half of the epic pvp set, its worth it.  The mount is from rank 11 and is nice if you prefer the alternative colors.
---
On my shaman, I really want those legs, gloves and boots.  Tons of stam, spell crit+ SP on mail, and 15% ghost wolf speed is awesome with imp ghost wolf. (I'm ganna try a 31/7/13 build, I end up using ghost wolf more to my advantage than a little extra crit on lighting.  NS is hard to pass up tho).
---
I think without going full on no-life you can't get past rank 12.  Rank 11-&gt; 12 is doable with a lot of effort as long as you are part of a pvp group, but going beyond rank 12 is just not doable with the rank points decay and the sheer volume of honor you need compared to even rank 8-11
---
Like everyone said, engineering is a must unless if you have very specific needs for 2 other professions.
---
Tailoring is needed to craft the prebis/bis chest for mage and priest (optionally warlock), you can remove tailoring after crafting this. However if you are a mage/warlock you will need 300 tailoring for bloodvine set bonus when it comes out.
---
Other than that, for PVE there's not anything out of the ordinary, blacksmithing actually gives you a trinket that makes you immune to fears for 30 seconds, but it's probably not something you'd actually use in pve(very good in pvp tho). 
---
Pick a 2nd profession that makes you gold is basically whats it.
---
Just to add, tailoring is not needed before ZG. The best money maker is not always available and sometimes it's nice to have something more reliable to go back to, but yes before ZG (and after you lose the set) you want a profession for goldmaking, depends quite a bit on the sever and what class you pick which one that is the most optimal.
---
Gloria!
---
Rank 10 is achievable. It's what I did during vanilla back then, and I had similar available hours. I almost never did premades tho, so you could probably get more than that with one.
---
I was also a Warlock, and the rank10 gear was awesome for a non-raider like me.
---
Well, at least for this mage, his plan was to quest or grind instead.  It's not like he put everything on hold for the group.
---
I don't really have a favorite T3 zone. If Duskwood was on the list, it would be my choice.
---
Bloodvine is actually really fucking hard to break without using pvp gear (which is not supposed to be in the game with blizzlike progression) or getting specific gear from AQ
---
Even though I’m a Horde player (started off as Alliance briefly), Stormwind is one of my favorites. Classic and TBC player here.
---
One of their community managers on the forums confirmed they are still stating Summer of 2019 - he specified that much.  I'm at work right now, else I'd provide a link.  This happened a couple of weeks ago, when the layoffs at Acti/Blizz were happening.  
---
Yup.  Fix bugs, prevent the many known exploits, allow b.net chat, connect to modern server infrastructure.. not to mention (future updates,, !!!??)
---
We're in peak offseason, boys.
---
I agree with that.
---
Alliance is better to DW, Horde it just depends what weapons you have available / receive.   Similar situation for non-human rogues.  You don't necessarily pick if you are combat daggers or swords, it just depends what weapons drop for your guild and which ones you receive. If by luck your guild gets super unlucky with sword drops but its raining good rogue daggers, looks like your rogues are rolling dagger spec.
---
At least horde can make good use of their 2h axes/swords for their fury warriors, as alliance doesn't really have that option without windfury.
---
Square Enix and Bungie have more memorable soundtracks in my opinion. Blizzard is famous for their cinematics.
---
TBC was probably my fav. Love any music involving the blood elves.
---
Ocarina of Time will always win for me.
---
Grinding to honored in Silithus doesn't take that long at all, especially if you have a large group. You can 2 man chain pull and hit honored relatively quickly. The rep "grind" for Hydraxian is baby mode.
---
Yeah you are right, but then it doesn't also mean they aren't speed levelers to with the sole intent of getting 60 gearing up and downing MC as a classic first that have been practicing in the shadows.
---
I'm not sure it will be possible or happen but I wouldn't put it past 40 people giving it a shot and practicing right now.
---
Does anyone know how threat works with engineering damage? If you're in def stance and drop a bomb does it do more threat than if you were in battle stance?
---
Good summary.  Horde has the option of 2h Fury, WF enables that.
---
Why do you say it's going to be slower?
---
I’ve been sleeping to the soundtrack almost every night since the Blizzcon announcement. So... they’re such good ambient music. Nice tempo, doesn’t distract you too much, great variety, and just plain catchy.
---
Son of Elune, Teldrassil, Darnassus, Duskwood.
---
The music alone is a big reason why I primarily play Night Elves. As a middle schooler, I think the music was the major factor which got me immersed in the game. When the lightning from Song of Elune comes on as you’re walking through the magical forest, it’s just... magical.
---
Honestly forgot/didn’t know those gave the rep. 
---
But that is completely ignoring my post and makes no sense at all.
---
I literally started out with
---
 &gt;While it didn't make a difference on retail 
---
And then talk about how delaying DM in a blizzlike manner is probably a good thing, because it has been a good thing on private servers.
---
It actually wasn’t like twitch chat at all. There is nothing worse than twitch chat. If you mean barrens chat turned into a twitch-like chat in certain servers that’s really bad.
---
Luckily you can turn those off.
---
Ignoring playing the AH. What’s the best money per hour in the game? Because you could spend time buying herbs and making flasks or you could spend time farming Dire maul or BRD
---
i think explained it way better than my incoherent rambling so thank you for that.  
---
is this from current classic dev team?  or nost?
---
Thank you, seems like you get it.
---
Knowing Activision they are thinking how to make micro transactions in WoW classic work. Not understanding if they they add even one micro transaction that did not exist during it original run will scare away everyone EG 6 month server transfer okay with payed mounts not okay.
---
Yes it was and it was beautiful, I'm looking forward to shitposting again during the leveling experience.
---
Pretty much. Right now I'm planing for mid August. But who knows. 
---
open your eyes Luke.  OPEN YOUR EYES
---
"Why are you complaining so much, this is just a beta, obviously they'll fix it."
---
The last pserver I’ve player (whose names rhymes with burger) had 8-9k pop peaks and still took a full month to complete because of a handful of low level turn-in stuff, and that was with Blizzard numbers on a server that had 2-3x a regular server’s population. 50% of it was done on the first day by people rushing in to turn in the easy stuff for rep (me included) but it took forever to get the firebloom and linen bandages done. 
---
I don’t see the war effort being done fast in Classic outside of 1-2 servers where both horde and alliance guilds are rushing to get AQ open and working together to do so. Servers where 1 faction dominate will take forever to open AQ as well. 
---
And I don’t see the need to “randomize” the mats required considering 90% of the basic profession stuff is needed, you could only at best randomize which faction gets it. 
---
It's right up there, but I'd have to put it at 4 behind MGS, Pokemon (any version really) and FF7
---
Well the problem lies in the way clipping works in the modern client. I don't think very many of the old cheese paths up mountains will work because you can't wedge your feet into the polygons like you used to be able to. I hope I'm wrong because that was most of my non pvp/raiding fun in wow
---
It’s not only guilds that are buying the mats for turn-ins. Plenty of people use that opportunity to farm for rep or to further to war effort by themselves. 
---
It really really really depends on the server and how blizzard does classic.
---
Here's some examples on what is probably some of the best gold makers:
---
Devilsaur leather on fresh: Devilsaurs are rare elites in un'goro that spawn pretty slow(around 15-20min with 4-5mobs), skinning them gives devilsaur leather which is used for prebis hunter/rogue/warr. On pservers these has been so heavily contested that players started forming groups to cross faction collude to kill anyone that even approaches them and they would farm these 24-7. It's not gonna be like this on classic, but from playing servers that are more similar to how classic will be ( no crossfaction collusion, lower pop, region specific), they were still really good gold to farm. If you can do this solo it's crazy, but you probably have to duo, lots of pvp expected. Skinning is obviously required. 75-150g/hour I'd recon
---
Diremaul tribute as a hunter, this nets a consistent 130+g per hour if it's not removed. It was possible in vanilla but very few did it  Hunter only requiring engineering.
---
Rogue BRD farm with mining pickpocket and rare killing + the vault chest, with mining this is actually pretty crazy. Does depend heavily on dark iron bar prices and how classic will have pickpocket loot though. 50-70g/hour. Mining required.
---
DME 2man boss farm. This is a classic because so many can do it, you go with 1 warrior/rogue(pref warriior) + a healer (pref pala/sham), you need mining+enchanting (and optionally herbing), you kill 3 bosses, herb a bit and kill the aoe packs on the way to last boss. There's 2 rich thoriums in the end. This spot will depend a lot on large brilliant shard prices, and how lashers/herbing in dme will be. Typically the warrior/rogue has mining, and the healer enchanting and herbalism. Remember you only need to learn enchanting not train it in order to disenchant anything(skill req. to DE was added in TBC)
---
I get it. You enjoy the power trip you get from being an asshole to people online and ruining their experience when you're safe from retaliation and don't risk losing. I've already said it's okay to enjoy that. I'm just reiterating that you enjoying being an asshole and people willingly putting themselves at risk of being bothered by an asshole does not mean you're not an asshole.
---
Is my constant annoying of you in ways you've put yourself at risk from, but not asked for, annoying you? That's a shame. Maybe you should roll a new username on a forum where you can't risk people replying to you. 
---
Thank you for the responses!
---
I am so excited with the assurance of r10. I love the look of that gear, and only like r14 more. I like it so much, I probably wouldn't replace it even if I got better gear in PvE. My plan is to grind to r10, grab my gear and start a PvE career, where I will only really be looking to upgrade rings/necks, I can even upgrade pants/boots, but nothing that would hurt the look of my set.
---
I feel like I'd have a pretty good solo BG'ing life in classic with r10 set and some good PvE off-set items. But who knows, if I can get say T2, or even 3 then of course I will. how does R10 set match up against T1?
---
Dot forget to cost it in gold pressed latinum 
---
My math could be slightly off here, because I'm basing off of memory of TBC from 14 years ago, but IIRC it was 28% miss chance against bosses when dual wielding, and 8% miss with a 2H.  Your special attacks will have the 8% miss chance regardless of DW or 2H.
---
The second factor is that your off-hand does 50% damage and does not contribute to special attacks.
---
The third factor is that your special attacks do more damage with a slower weapon, especially Slam since it resets the swing timer.
---
However, dual wielding double-dips into attack power, or at least 1.5x dips into attack power.  If you factor in misses, then it scales 17% better than a 2H.  This is probably a big reason why it takes over.
---
A classic, for sure, but there's a reason Civ IV was the first gaming soundtrack to win a grammy.  [Baba Yetu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJiHDmyhE1A) gets all the love, but Christopher Tin is amazing and his other work is fantastic, including [Sogno di Volare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQYN2P3E06s), the theme for Civ VI.
---
You are probably EU...no one cares.  #sorrynotsorry
---
It should.  There's the threat modifier of the stance itself, and the threat modifiers on individual attacks.  This should be affected by the general threat modifier.
---
Play what you want to play. Pretty simple.
---
I think everyone skipped my main point of this. The release time is only 10 months from MC to AQ. Let's say adverage player takes 2-3 months to hit 60 then needs to gear for a week or 2. Youd only have 6 months to do all MC and BWL content before AQ is out. Doesn't that seem to short for the adverage player? 
---
No, atleast if it's about min/maxing - Alchemy gives nothing u couldn't use anyway on ur character. Engineering and Tailoring (for Casters) does give benefits u can't get without having the profession.
---
baby ally need diaper chang xD
---
People are going to demolish the content within days of each of these stages being released. Spreading the content too thin would be a big mistake.
---
Why would you need to have it different between servers?
---
Exactly this
---
Depents alot of the population of the server aswell if I remember correctly.
---
If your personal power in combat is the most important thing, engineering is best.  However, it's a hard market, because most people who can use engineering items are engineers themselves, and can simply make the items.
---
What would make you think that I, as a player, have a conflict of interest with what is best for the game? Your objection seems a bit hyperbolic, contrived and antagonistic mate. 
---
If PvE: Mage
---
If PvP: Mage
---
That's true but the same logic applies. Everyone will know it's coming so they'll have the same opportunity to farm in advance. 
---
Additionally, IIRC you can't turn in materials anymore once their requirement has been satisfied. So if the War Effort is zerged on some servers, those players might not even get the chance to do their turn-ins if they don't log in for the first couple days. 
---
It’s always fun being a raid boss trying to kill the raid 
---
You think BC is going to roll out afterwards? 
---
The Undercity brings back memories for me... 
---
&gt; And then talk about how delaying DM in a blizzlike manner is probably a good thing, because it has been a good thing on private servers.
---
This could be the case, i don't know though, i've played EU at release and played pservers with delayed DM and honestly haven't really seen any real difference one way or the other impacting the gameplay by a lot. Imho either at launch or slightly delayed both could be fine. 
---
Maybe the other two are coming out before classic ? I may be wrong .
---
By the time the majority of the server population would have gotten to a Dire Maul level, it was March 7th.  
---
All you're doing by googling release dates without applying logic to those release dates is making yourself look pedantic.
---
Those who abandon their allies are worse than scum.
---
What does not get into my mind that the stock pile faction never thinks about the limited storage space they have.
---
It is basically not possible to stockpile for the whole war effort.
---
So there is no problem at all with stockpiling
---
Teldrassil.
---
well we technically had one with the paladin tank artifact weapon mage tower skin.
---
They can do it, but it doesnt mean they will :3
---
It is odd that they don't want to advertise something that they are creating , isn't that counter productive if they wanted more sub numbers?
---
Is that because most alli mages are gnomes?
---
why is "swing kiting" retarded ?
---
Do you even have time for alts in a increase release server? While still having a life?
---
Yes, but you also just named the biggest zones in the game. It's rough going running between horde zones, but I prefer the aesthetic to horde zones than Alliance
---
I’m pro NoCHanges 
---
Now let’s talk about my list of changes 
---
Every no changes post ever 
---
Spell damage doesn't increase poison damage. If it did, you'd see rogues using spell power flask more often.
---
I would just save some scratch up and buy a cheap PC. You've got plenty of time before classic drops and there are tons of people offloading old PC's on Facebook/craigslist that are very affordable.
---
My experience socially has been that Mage is much easier to find groups than on a Warlock.  On the Warlock, I've had several snobbish groups refuse me entry because I was "too low level" for the dungeon.  When in reality I'm appropriate level and they just want to cheese the dungeon by being 6+ levels above what you need.  I've never had that on a mage, because people are so desperate for mages.
---
Mages offer significantly more to the group than a warlock does.  Sheep is better than fear and easier than seduce, and while a really skilled warlock can CC a lot of enemies...mages have frost nova and counterspell.  Mages can decurse, make water, and at higher levels give a portal at the end of the instance.  They have better buffs (Arcane Intellect &gt; Blood Pact).  Warlocks might have the ability to keep enemies from running in fear...but again, Mages have frost nova.  And both can AoE DPS...but mages are safer with Frost Nova.
---
This is where we run into another issue.  At least 1/3 of the time (probably more than half the time) your healer is a priest.  Your group really wants a mage.  That's already 2 clothies in the group.  So you've got to convince the mage and priest that it's worth it to bring another clothy to compete with gear.  
---
Honestly, mages are the most sought-after class in a dungeon in my experience.  You've usually got 3 classes that can heal, 2 classes that make acceptable tanks, but only 1 class that everyone wants for their CC.
---
She might use them as a weapon to kick up dust storms. Otherwise she might be able to float like her mom, Therazane.
---
Not undercutting your comment, but cmon...Onyxia buff within 1 week?  Sorry but in the time it takes for the speed levelers to get to 55-60, AND do the onyxia attunement AND UBRS quest?  You'd need at minimum 25% of the population with the UBRS seal of ascension, along with the slog that is the LBRS onyxia chain you won't be clearing onyxia within 10 days.  MC is more easily accessible: yes.  But you won't be doing it with the onyxia buffs on your first playthrough.
---
In BC we would get a druid and a warlock to go the top of the mushrooms in Zangarmarsh. We would have the druid in flight mode click the summon and when players would accept the summon they would fall to their death. 
---
Cant tell you how many times we did this when we were bored. Good times.
---
I get sick of climbing giant ass trees every time I want to turn in a quest. always found the night elf areas annoying.
---
You don't need to carry more than 2-3 shards during levelling. You're killing monsters constantly and can grab shards whenever.
---
It' 27%. Other than that, you're correct. DW has higher auto attack damage, extra scaling from AP. 
---
And that also means extra rage generation and an additional weapon enchant.
---
My first kid is due August 29, no wow classic for me :(
---
That's honestly the least of the things to be worried about. If you want to faceroll MC that bad just bring more warriors.
---
fortunately she can be solo'd at 60
---
well sure it is literally .001% of streamers but you still don't want to be around them
---
You really shouldn't listen to most of these comments. Warriors are one of the best classes in PvP once geared. So if you're good, you will be able to stomp 95% of the players you encounter if you got gear, proper macros and proper usage of engineering items.
---
this was in WOTLK and I was feral, so yes I fucking camped rogues.
---
Vanilla is sort of a "what tracks DON'T I like?" question haha. Winterspring/Dun Morogh were always one of my favorites, Durotar/Barrens/TN, the Shadowfang Keep music. You could go on forever. And the expansions weren't half bad either. Grizzly Hills and Storm Peaks, Terrokar Forest, tons of bangers.
---
Correct, my mistake there.  Cleave until then
---
I agree it seems obvious. But its the same as the 1.12 thing which of course means talents etc and not that naxx will be out on release
---
They can't leave classic as a standalone game where you have to manually install the game from different installer and not battle.net because most of the people won't bother going through that or won't even know about it (look at this thread, some people didn't even know classic is coming out) for them to put it on battle.net it has to have all the battle.net functionalities just as any other game that gets put on it i.e. destiny 2. At the end of the day it's not about the niche group of people who spend their time on private servers and go through hoops and loops to play it but about the broadest audience possible 
---
This video went from obnoxious to very funny very quickly. 
---
&gt; simply that anyone who does know how to pvp will not be on your pve server.
---
I question that opinion because I have real-world experience that says otherwise. I have done extensively world pvp on both types of servers and there's little skill difference. There are mainly just more rogues on pvp servers.
---
Grizzly Hills is good, but not even close to Howling Fjord. And you ignore Dragonblight?!
---
&gt;DM East partial runs that skip a large portion of the bosses, and have an inordinate amount of trash mobs that have higher value grey loot; which can be done solo \*efficiently\* by only a select few classes
---
FTFY.  Oh also, easily rectified by having daily instance reset limits.
---
No
---
It's funny. I can appreciate the no-life dedication. 
---
dude, you are the one needing a rare drop that someone else can equip so that you can sell it. There are a million ways to make gold in wow that don't involve ninja-looting. You sound like a huge prick.
---
Exactly, you can full clear AQ on day one without killing a single world dragon.
---
Sounds like the beginning of an anti-hunter crusade.
---
I think being able to gather the materials beforehand undermindes the point of the event. Therefore I am in favour of changing (possibly randomising) the items needed.
---
Have you guys actually looked at the amounts needed...
---
UPDATE: The Macbook game in the mail today, and I have tried installing a 1.12.1 client to try it out. It worked completely fine. Runs very smooth, and there are no problems with overheating or the fan working too hard (stayed quiet the entire time, which wasn't that long I'll admit).
---
I guess Classic will require more than old Vanilla, but I'm hopeful that it will work OK. I also have a PC here that I know can run WoW, I just don't particularly like it.
---
Its guarenteed to happen since some guilds will want the AQ world first and the one who will get will likely be on the server that open it the first.
---
Private server are different, you only are in competition with the other guilds on the same server so they have no reason to open the gate asap, and the more time they have the more scarab lord they can get inside the guilds so they dont even participate.
---
The cooking recipes for example, you have lots of low level cooking recipes you can ask instead.
---
There are so many things wrong with this. 
---
1) you should know by now that a baby kitten is killed ever time you enter a zone without pvping or doing a dungeon.
---
2) constant walking can be hard on your character especially without decent boots that you get from dungeons or raids
---
3) if you get lost there’s a high likelihood you will die. Who will bake cookies with your grandma if you go off dying like that? 
---
4) you probably don’t have life insurance which will leave your guild to fend for themselves 
---
You can’t “just explore”. It’s a video game with real virtual consequences. (Jk it’s a video game do wtf you want.) 
---
It easily takes the cake for best gaming soundtrack. Nothing even comes close, other than maybe Halo? 
---
If it were a film score, I'd honestly put it in the same conversation as Lord of the Ring in terms of quality. 
---
Damn, I didn't know SM had that rare mob. Thanks for the info!
---
I hate the fact that my favorite class fantasy is a meme spec. Love shamans but hate that almost all tier gear is resto based. Seems like a waste :/
---
This could be a legitimately compelling argument if you show the math. 
---
Yep, mapping VW auto taunt to a toggle is one of the best moves you can make for leveling speed. I'm amazed this is the first time I've seen anybody bring this up.
---
It's not something that can be done entirely on your own- you'll want a core group of friends and trusted people to form the base to recruit around.
---
It's not impossible to stand a guild up on your own, but if you're getting a 40-man raid group you'll inevitably invite another core group of friends. Since you won't have a core of officers, they'll probably fill the void and eventually that can turn into tension.
---
So I'd say try to make some friends in the meantime before classic releases (private server raiding, or just casually playing and recruiting like-minded people), and then roll a main tank and GO HARDCORE when it drops so that you'll be ahead of the leveling curve and can recruit when it's hot.
---
Play a Tauren.
---
I have an ambient station on Pandora that I play while working or studying; The Barrens music is definitely one of the songs on rotation as well as Shimmering Flats.
---
9 alt * 40 guildies * 100+ bag and bank slots should be enough
---
You can also stock an infinite amount of mats in the mailbox (just have to be carefull with the 30day limit)
---
Yup, I logged in the morning it started and Rugged Leathers were already fully turned in. I also turned in so many heavy/thick leather bought from the AH I probably singlehandedly raised the AH prices 1-2g per stack. 
---
&gt; those players might not even get the chance to do their turn-ins if they don't log in for the first couple days
---
That’s how it is, I don’t see how that’s a bad thing. Some mats are going to be fully done 10x faster than others no matter the server pop. Stuff like leathers and Runecloth are filling up the AH, while low level food/linen cloth/midlevel herbs are barely there. 
---
I think there are good arguments for randomising the list. However, at least for the initial war effort, I thiknk it best to have the requirements be the same (whether randomised or not). The reason being there will be guilds across these servers competing to beat the event and the raid content behind it, and this would result in a fairer playing field for these guilds.
---
It's 5 days /played just to hit 60
---
This right here is the sad reality of the warlock. You feel like Pepsi to the Mage's Coke. It may seem like your class should be in high demand for groups, but in reality your'e pretty much 1:1 competing with mages, of which there are many, for dps slots and most groups really don't want to run with 3 clothes just for loot distribution purposes.
---
The fuck, why? All content is doable without all this stuff. You can even bring rets and ferals. Vanilla will be piss easy anyway when it comes out. Two months after BWL clear we will Pug it!
---
The only Warcraft soundtrack I can listen to repeatedly is the Burning Crusade. The Blood Elf music especially is insane. 
---
The Classic soundtrack is pretty mild in most cases, as is the Wrath one. Cataclysm and Mists come pretty close to the absolute awe that BC imposes and I spent most of my time during retail Mists solely listening to the music. I literally have not heard a single thing from the Legion and BFA soundtrack as I play with the sound off.
---
why would opening the gates faster be better exactly?
---
then fewer people get scepters and.... thats it?
---
the gates open for everyone at the same time.
---
Nope, they are different clients. It would make zero sense to let Classic only players download the whole 50GB+ of retail data. Classic is client 1.13, Retail is client 8.1.x.
---
Are we doing sarcasm? Nagrand and Grizzly Hills are objectively the two best zones of their time.
---
The FFVII soundtrack is hands down one of the best ever, although I personally think that Cowboy Bebop has the best OST of all time but it's not a video game. 
---
Yeah I'm really glad they decided to postpone BGs for a bit. Though honestly I probably won't even be 60 before they launch. 
---
Why are you guys inferring they will release stages all at once?  Stage 2 content can be spread out too 
---
You can gather materials while you can play, and semi-afk craft to raise your profession since it takes a crapload to craft. Also you can maybe flip things in AH.
---
Quark get off Reddit.
---
If a fire elemental lord (ragnaros) can be considered buff and cut with his large chest and small waist, then this fat bitch and her mom can definitely be considered obese despite being earth elementals ;o
---
The client is based off of current retail. You're completely wrong. You're talking about the game patch, not the client.
---
It probably was affixes from Legion affecting items from the demo. That won't happen in Classic, just an oversight.
---
Did they say that they were postponing BG's in and of themselves or just the rewards that come with them? 
---
Don't get me wrong it would make sense to postpone both, but they can be mutually exclusive. 
---
/1 Why is Zelda always trying to save the princess?
---
2nd week? That would require 40 people without jobs that just play WoW 12 hours a day and do nothing else. Even then it would require some really fast leveling speeds. It may well happen, but it will be far from the norm. Most people will not be stepping into MC until 3-4 months after launch, making the whole DM discussion largely irrelevant as to whether it launches immediately or 3 months after.
---
Duskwood, but it's not listed, so....
---
Same here. Midi music never sounded so good!
---
Not to mention there were 0 guilds who full cleared MC when DM came out.  So the gear was available to EVERYONE during Mc progression.   And even STILL the amount of people who stepped foot into MC pre DM was so astronomically low, the experience is going to be ‘changed’ for almost no one.
---
Good point 
---
The aq gate event is actually one of the few things I would like changed from classic counterpart... Or more just the drops/mats needed. Make a quest item version of every requirement. That way noone can stockpile.
---
I could see future updates fixing other bugs/exploits no one really knew about when Vanilla was first out.
---
As long as they don't "fix" getting to the Blue Dragon elf lady in Winterspring for the Alliance Onyxia quest-chain I'll be thrilled.
---
I wish there were more people in this world with your kind of intelligence and understanding.
---
There are people who want to convince you that, in order to raid as feral, you will need to farm a consumable weapon that drops from a Gnomer boss (consumeable = bring 12 to each raid).
---
They are wrong. You can safely ignore them.
---
Good shit dude. That's gonna help alot
---
Screw flails, I want Taruen warriors wielding giant totems like in War3. Huge missed opportunity.
---
I'm glad its being treated as a side-project. It means greedy investor hands won't be all over it. As much as one may like or dislike Hearthstone, you could tell it had a ton of flavor and feeling from the developers when it first came out, and later the lack of it when the spark faded.
---
If you want to tank, take enchant for the bis bop trinket (you can drop it once you have it tho)
---
Also be carefull to pick mark of tyranny (other bis trinket), the heal trinket you can get as a reward from the same quest is good but you can always replace it later meanwhile you wont ever find anything as good as mark of tyranny so always pick it even if you just want to tank once in a while.
---
They clearly said, if someone played the game back then and time travels to 2019, there should be no difference to the naked eye.
---
So I don't know what you are going for.
---
It's pretty straight forward.
---
lol meant to write three.
---
I agree, I am staying far away from any "streamer server", and don't really like the way that obsessive viewers follow streamers and boost them, but instead of shittalking all streamers, can we talk specifically about "top streamers" instead? I myself stream pservers I have like 10-30 viewers, I think I capped at around 100, I NEVER impacted the game like you are talking about, at most I had a guy from my stream(who would typically be a buddy otherwise) boost me through a dungeon or kill someone who was streamsniping me. Anyone can see that as a small boi streamer like that, I am not destroying servers or the experience at all, and still provide what is in my opinion significant content showcasing some of the great things about the game and overall just entertaining peoples 2nd monitor while they play the game.
---
You can level whoever you want! I actually recommend it, as you'll always have rested experience to abuse with multiple characters.
---
Having said that, if you have small children and you want to be in a PvP World, there is a definite bonus to just hitting stealth to deal with wife/husband aggro.
---
Just level perma-flagged on a pve server. Then you get the best of all worlds. 
---
World pvp all the time and no ganking. 
---
&gt;It's like they say, you need to be unemployed to get rank 13/14.
---
Back on my server (Arthas US) I think it was impossible to hit R14 unless you account shared, could be mistaken tho. 
---
Westfall, easily. 
---
^This guy gets it 
---
&gt; At least horde can make good use of their 2h axes/swords for their fury warriors, as alliance doesn't really have that option without windfury.
---
What do you mean?? We have at least 5 ret paladins per raid we can give them to...
---
Tremor totem sucks and while I agree with you Orc warlocks are the best. Gnome warlocks are extremely powerful too. If you plan on premading in pvp. You also won't have to deal with paladins which is about the biggest blessing you could get. Alliance locks being bad is a meme.
---
Doesn’t change that there *will* be nolifers that blast to 60 and do MC in their leveling gear. It doesn’t take the raid away from us at all.
---
It's not a big deal no. It only matters for people who get 60 and prebis before DM actually comes out. But basically it's just some staggered content, instead of immediately getting satyrs bow as a warrior you farm LBRS for the xbow with a hunter in your group flaming you about stealing his loot (ironic right?), it makes clearing MC before DM a bit of a special achievement and such, and overall it's just better this way, rather than having it at launch. Not a dealbreaker at all, but why not get that extra out of the experience.
---
MoP's soundtrack is the only one that I separately paid for. Its amazing. 
---
I think people are just anxious for news, which is justified as its been an echo chamber since Blizzcon.
---
For reference, two Blizzcons ago (when Classic was revealed) we had a BFA trailer, panels about BFA, BFA's launch, and *two* raids and a beta of a new zone with a *third* raid.... and still nothing about Classic except, "It's coming." This is like Valve-levels of quiet lol.
---
&gt;  I myself stream pservers I have like 10-30 viewers, I think I capped at around 100, 
---
Maybe this is just semantics. When people are talking about "streamers", they are talking about top streamers.
---
I simply asked a question. I find it also quite bold to state what's not best for the game. I don't believe you possess that knowledge. It just sounds better than: " They shouldn’t, they should do it the way I want them to."
---
&gt; So it follows that changing the material requirement to prevent metagaming is consistent with "no changes" philosophy. 
---
I'd argue that it's not "no changes," by definition.  It definitely would be no-changes in spirit, though, and to that end it is definitely something they should consider doing.
---
If you want to make it happen fast, just let the pet die a bunch of times and don't  feed it lol.
---
he said good use
---
Literally haven't been this excited about a game since I was a highschooler waiting in line with my friends to get a copy of halo 2
---
I hope so. Naxx was released way too fast for my taste.
---
We were still wiping on the Twin Emperors, when Naxx was released.
---
What a Nightmare.
---
Problem is, as Ythisens said in the last Classicast, for the last Dev Watercooler they needed around 1 month of constantly reiterating that post and go back and fourth between multiple people to get approved, to not say something "wrong".
---
Every info about Classic is very carefully craftet. So I think they don't want to deal with that anymore before the actual release information.
---
Corpse camping is a completely different then traveling somewhere and killing someone once.  
---
I don’t know why that’s so hard to understand 
---
2h-fury is ***better*** because it's much easier to gear for.
---
It requires significantly less hit  % gear in general because you don't have the significantly lower off-hand weapon's hit chance.
---
Dual wield is much stronger and scales way harder but requires very specific items, making 2h-fury a very reliable choice for new characters and early game progression.
---
Always remember, girls come and go. Epics are soulbound.
---
Pretty much set on playing a warrior, however have a question that could severely impact this decision:
---
Can a warrior be effective in PvP without raiding? I mostly want to pvp and run dungeons. I have kids and don't have a ton of time to put into raids, but I could sneak in a 5 man / bg every once in awhile. Would the gear from that and BG rep rewards (+ low level honor) allow me to be competitive in pvp? From reading here it sounds like they are very gear dependent. 
---
Thanks!  
---
But why does there communication require such an absurd level of blue type ? Surely division heads can write a short blog saying what their team was working on? "This week we tackled scripting in dead mines, it went very well but there was a fun bug with X."
---
Man, I realize this isn't really a new observation or anything, but it really puts it into perspective how bad of a system it was that players had to put together honor cartels to make it reasonable.
---
On the other hand, maybe that's just a good example of emergent gameplay.
---
So you're saying that because there is another staff from a WC quest that is better, you all rolled greed even if it was an upgrade for someone? That doesn't even make sense. If it's an upgrade you roll need.
---
Alchemy does give you a BiS druid tanking trinket.
---
Yes I know it's a very specific situation. You can also just unlearn alchemy once you have that.
---
Single target dps is the way to go. 
---
Rank 11 maximum
---
I'am a looooong time Blizzard fan and played their RTSs extensively from WC2 on. For me it just would not be an option to roll on a PvE server because of this. WoW for me is primarily about the conflict between the factions and ofc the community on my on faction. This is also the main reason I'am not drawn to retail but very much to classic/vanilla.
---
Also it makes leveling and general world stuff much more exciting. I just hit 33 with one of my toons and visited STV with her. It was exciting from the get go. Suddenly it isn't just a mindless mob grind anymore.
---
You have to consider so much more, such as how many of your faction are around you, who is obviously ganking and who isn't, respawn timers and so on. You try your best to get through the zone w/o getting caught by high level opponents or large groups but also try to hunt down opponents who you can.
---
There is just much more *gameplay* when everyone is PvP flagged. The people who don't like that: I'am ok with that, it just isn't for them! But consider it for your own sake *if* you want to invest brain power into it and not just get frustrated when it doesn't go your way w/o effort on your part.
---
Final Fantasy X (original)
---
All. Day. Long.
---
Though WoW vanilla has some damn good stuff. See also Bastion, Diablo II, Braid, Mirror’s Edge and final fantasies VI through IX for more good game music. 
---
That is my hope. Was peak WoW imo
---
I enjoyed parts of 15, but aside from those few parts 9 was also the last Final Fantasy I enjoyed.
---
to be fair i didnt say i was or wasnt pro no changes.  i do think there is a ton of grey area that is up to debate about what qualifies as no changes.  
---
As someone coming from a private server to classic, it's gonna make a huge difference, the itemization options in DM are far better for most classes, the 200 ap buff for your melee dps is MASSIVE, in terms of dps out put for an entire raid.. And 16 debuff slots to begin with.. They absoutlely are going to have to make some balance changes to MC/Ony if they don't mix up the time line a bit.
---
They are very gear dependent. However, from memory, arms warriors with the unstoppable force (from Alterac Valley) were pretty effective in pvp until post molten core
---
this is really indicative of how there's pretty much zero replacements for classic WoW to tide us over
---
Better red than dead.
---
Sharding/itemisation/content phases/debuffslots/loottrading/rightklick report and ofc the actual release date.
---
\#1 *Legends of Azeroth*. Will never forget staring at that login screen in absolute wonder.
---
\#2 *Elwynn*. Just incredibly peaceful and soothing, lends a lot to that feeling of home I get from the zone.
---
\#3 *Stormwind*. Overall great atmosphere, and the drop once you enter the Valley of Heroes for the first time is amazing.
---
\#4 *Ashenvale*. Sounded exactly what I would want a night elf zone to sound like. Haunting yet beautiful. 
---
\#5 *Ghostie*. They did a phenomenal job making the spirit realm sound calm yet unpleasant. 
---
No, he's correct. The BFA client and the Classic client are two separate entities. 
---
\*dopamine rush\*
---
Damn okay, but do you think it is good enough to play vanilla wow?
---
Have you seen the first 5man takedown of onyxia? The video is from the perspective of a resto shammy and it really inspired me to love resto back in the day
---
If i really wanted to troll someone (on my faction) i used to a melee class around and constantly polymorph the mob they were attacking, i managed to kill a warrior doing this but after i felt terrible so i helped him finish his q. 
---
And what makes you think they won't demolish it even faster if they're bundled up in 4 stages? You clearly don't understand the necessity of "Server progression". It's vital to keep the raid timeframes distinct as well as spread out. ZG drops op gear. That makes BWL a joke for example. Green dragons should be released before AQ to give people reasonable time to farm nature resistance gear. Think it through.
---
A boe is literally a bag of gold that drops, there is a reason blizzard made some items boe and some items bop and just because you can't understand that difference doesn't make me self-absorbed. If all people roll need everyone gets an equal chance I don't understand what is not fair about that. 
---
That's like if you and me, complete strangers, were walking down the street together and some random guy comes up and is like "hey I'm going to give one of you a $20,000 motorcycle, you can either choose who gets it or roll dice for it". And then I tried to tell you you needed to let me get the motorcycle since I have a license to drive it and you don't. Doesn't that sound pretty retarded to you? 
---
Winterspring by far. I intend to spend a size-able amount of time there.
---
I think you underestimate the dedicated few. These attunement quests and lbrs farm for gem is no match when you have 80 experienced players putting in a minimum or 4 hours daily towards a common goal.
---
"Yeah yeah Vanilla was fucked up, we should change it ! But... #nochange remember heh?!"
---
Even more brillant.
---
Also don't forget it really depends on what you actually have available in terms of weapons. If you have two good 1h weapons and a weak 2h weapon then it is obviously better to DW and vice versa. People discuss this topic as if everyone can just pick and choose whatever.
---
But the reality is that you have to adapt your builds to your gear just as much as the other way around.
---
If your tanks is aware of the plan and competent you can probably throw up corruption on other targets. Agony probably wouldn’t be worth it. 
---
Just don’t dot the sheep &gt;.&lt;
---
Wrong. Where's proof of that? Blizzard hasn't released any information about them being separate clients. If you're basing this just off the demo being a separate client, blizzard always does that.
---
just curious to what information you want from them? you know what the game is going to be like, are you looking for daily lists of bug fixes?
---
Grow up.
---
Are you sure they weren't yelling "Get out!"?
---
Exactly
---
No comment on what will happen, but it's worth noting that Blizzard explicitly said it was what they were currently thinking at the time of Blizzcon but were looking for feedback. I didn't get the sense anything was set in stone.
---
WoW has some great tracks but if we're going to talk best of all time?
---
I'm going to get the current populist one out of the way but, in all seriousness, the score for Apex Legends is fantastic (if unfortunately mixed way too loud in settings). Both the [menu](https://youtu.be/bU1bZLsg4MQ) and [jump](https://youtu.be/AtwHhkhRiU0).
---
But beyond that you're now also now competing with absolute legends like [Halo](https://youtu.be/0jXTBAGv9ZQ)
---
[Unreal Tournament](https://youtu.be/SjIliNbBDuQ) has had a persistently awesome sound track even when the game wasn't so great (stupid UT3). Always recognizable for those who play it.
---
During the last 5 or so years, Nintendo has also drastically upped it's sound game too. The soundtrack for Smash Bros has become massive in showing it off. Even just the themes. It's kind of cool to [listen to their progression](https://youtu.be/Q5oWoKqXNaE)
---
It's also competing against other Blizzard franchises with incredibly iconic soundtracks:
---
You have [Diablo,  so iconic it was introduced with mere chords](https://youtu.be/ZNIGZsfNw7Q?t=75).
---
You also have Overwatch which has won best original score, best audio, best sound design, etc. [This song is a personal favorite of mine](https://youtu.be/H3xFKckFCGM).
---
WoW will always have a special place in my heart and the music is well scored and fitting the theme. Due to my history with the game they're nostalgic too. But it's up against a LOT of challengers. Frankly, no shame losing to them either; they're heavy hitters in score/sound design.
---
Actually Warlocks do more DPS than mages from like BWL+ on statistically.
---
My leveling rotation goes like this: Immolate&gt;Corruption&gt;Curse of Agony&gt;One Shadow Bolt(or fear if needed)&gt;Wand shots right after the shadow bolt ends so the first shot will be an instant cast.
---
DM was out before raggy died on live, what's your point?
---
Random sounds good at first, but then what about the poor server that rolls 10 million felcloth 10k flawless dragon sinews etc.
---
A server will die if it's quicker to reroll and regear than it is to farm the obscure random items.
---
Its better than the constant 
---
"When will get news );" posts
---
I don’t care what triggers you dude. I know better, so I said what I said. Guess you’ll have to look up the arguments. You probably wont tho. Have a nice day and bb.
---
So you're telling me that Blizzard just developed an entire client for a demo? Not that it IS the client they're using for Classic but they just quarantined the play zones for the demo? If you think that Classic is just going to run straight off of the retail client it really shows your lack of understanding of how this stuff works.
---
It's not. Being slightly less of an asshole is still an asshole. Ganking players who have not even the faintest chance of winning (i.e. Gray go you) makes you a scumbag regardless of how you try to justify it. That's life on a pvp server and everyone knows it, but you're still a scumbag even when people expect you to be one. 
---
great. thank you.
---
Actually both Warlocks and Mages are extremely good and popular for dungeons. The summoning is not the huge deal there but the ability to SS your healer. Mages can provide top tier CC and free water/food for the group. Also both are ranged which makes them pull less mobs accidentally and take less damage.
---
They never do lmao
---
&gt; then needs to gear for a week or 2 
---
The average player (which in my mind means "not a nolife") won't get gear in a week or 2.
---
&gt; Youd only have 6 months to do all MC and BWL content before AQ is out. 
---
I don't get it, are MC and BWL closed and not raidable anymore once AQ is out?
---
Your early rotation is corrupt( every mob if good tank/healer) then wand.
---
Yeah, Classic will be a lot of fun when people have raids on farm after the first 2 weeks and are forced to wait another 6 months for the next tier. I don't think you understand how quickly people are going to chew through content. 
---
&gt;ZG drops op gear. That makes BWL a joke for example.
---
This screams "I didn't play Vanilla."
---
Have you ever played a beta? That's exactly what they do. That's why they call them BETA and DEMO clients. Shows your lack of understanding of how this stuff works. 
---
Just throw enslave demon on the nearest gnome mage. We all know they are legion-spawn anyways.
---
Not a single word in the above post contains my opinion, they are simply dates, nothing more. If someone is supposed to apply logic to the discussion it helps not having the facts wrong from the start, that's the easy part after all.
---
All you are doing is making baseless assumptions about my stance on the topic and that makes you look like some asshat just wanting to call out others for being pedantic. 
---
MC will not be a faceroll to many players experiencing classic/vanilla wow. And that's a good thing. It shouldn't exist as only a speed-bump to pserver nerds who memorize the entire loot table &amp; know every single mechanic.
---
You don’t think it’s a stretch to take that to mean 1.12 forever?
---
**Super Best Friends - Alliance US (EST) PVE - Family/Raiding**
---
Synopsis: Super Best Friends was originally created in TBC to house real life friends in our new leveling experience. During a Zul'farak run, where my prot paladin had a newly-acquired Flurry Axe, I impressed some randoms with my 1337 Dps and invited them into the guild. This bloomed and soon we had many friends of friends of friends! Now I come back 12 years later, having tracked down a number of those friends and decided to try my hand again at running a guild.
---
Focus: **Leveling and PVE** - While we don't frown upon PVP, and frankly I probably enjoy it the most out of our team, we will mostly be focusing on raids, using a system of DKP which fits our playstyle.
---
Playstyle: **Casual/Raid Focused** - Let's be honest, we're not in college anymore, and most of have full time lives, working or taking care of our families, or both. I know I have a daughter on the way, and plenty of us have responsibilities. However, we are all WoW veterans and have a good understanding of Vanilla raiding. Probably looking at the very least 2 raid nights a week.
---
Are we a good fit? - We are a guild with realistic outlooks towards the game. We all want to raid and enjoy the magic that is Vanilla WoW together, but within the appropriate scheduling of our real lives. We are also older now, which isn't a requirement, but understand that most of the guild to start will be around 30+. We are not going to have squabbles over nonsense, be relaxed while enjoying what the game has to offer. We will joke and kid around, but if anyone starts to bother another, it will be dealt with appropriately.
---
If Interested Contact Me Directly. Thank you for reading this post.
---
Damn this show is a year old! That went fast and makes me cry classic still isn’t out!
---
Then the hunter is blamed because you say you are certain you saw an arcane shot fly that way. 
---
Following up on this, as someone in the same boat as /r/Rbish82  --  I know Arms is entirely fine for tanking leveling dungeons, but what about lvl60 ones.  LBRS/UBRS, Strat, Scholo, etc?  Not planning on raiding, just 5/10 mans and BGs.  Will it work as Arms, or would it just be more trouble than it's worth?
---
There may be better BoP professions out there, but an alchemist who can make 40 fire protection potions will beat your engineer trinket any day. 
---
Raid leaders will not care about your extra 10K engineering dps. An alchemist with end game recipes however will be a valued guild member, often helped to farm mats and possibly even have a reserved slot on raid nights.
---
Alchemy is about the team.
---
There arent really any mechanics, and compared to modern wow they are a joke. It WILL be a faceroll. Later raids won't be, but dude MC was made in like a week so ofc its gonna be simple.
---
In leveling dungeons trash dies rapidly to the burst of other classes. Trash mobs don't live long enough for corruption or agony to be worthwhile. Use your imp. Cast immolate, CoR, and then wand. CoR is valuable to increase melee DPS, help the tank hold agro, and prevent runners. Shadowbolt isn't worthwhile; the speed it ads to killing trash doesn't compensate for the increased time your and/or the healer will spend drinking to restore that mana.
---
Warlocks aren't *great* in leveling dungeons to be honest. There's a reason that the Soul Stone buff fades if the granting warlock leaves (i.e. gets kicked from) the group.
---
For me it’s not only this but primarily Elwynn forest. It really takes be back to 2006when I first became immersed in wow.
---
What I understand is building tension and demand by setting an unannounced, later release date. What I don't understand is any necessity around waiting for release: server hardware has only improved since then, and the vanilla software files are guaranteed to be stored at blizzard, right? It's not like they have to recode the original game. 
---
In my head, you just need the original files, a server, and BOOM you've got vanilla wow. So all waiting is to build demand. 
---
Which also doesn't totally make sense because obviously it's wanted, so delaying just denies blizz money in the present future. Idk. 
---
For me, if I had to judge gaming soundtracks, I'd have to divide it into 2 categories, immersive songs while playing video games and just awesome tracks. 
---
Like, Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy's OSTs have melodies that try to convey certain emotions and moods, but Vanilla WoW's soundtrack is more about immersion, its more simliar to something like Metroid in that regard.
---
I listen to vanilla wow music at work when I'm having a shitty day, and it cheers me right up.
---
My favourites from vanilla would be Teldrassil and Ashenvale.
---
Okay, just to be clear, Blizzard developed a demo client, separate from the retail client, but for the full game you're not going to download anything because it's all apart of the retail client?
---
You realize that the retail client doesn't even have the old models and art assets right? You realize all of the textures have been upgraded more than once since vanilla right? When Classic comes out, you will be downloading an entirely new Client.
---
Sorry dude, you don't know what you're talking about.
---
If you ever *did* want to level a Warrior, doing it with a healing friend is the best time to do it.  Plus the two of you could blaze through dungeons given that you'll have Tank/Heals already filled... there will be plenty of hunters/mages/rogues begging to come along, and you can be picky and not choose DPS who will compete with you for gear.
---
I always though summet was 1 june - 31 august
---
stronk warr no run from prey
---
I cant enjoy Wrath's login music because of that obnoxious frostwyrm.
---
Start guild early and promote yourself as a hardcore raiding guild. 
---
They key is to find a dedicated hardcore tank, preferably Tauren warrior or human warrior.
---
If you are 100% serious I recommend making yourself the main tank. Use voice comms to lead and inspire not to be toxic. It’s ok to be mad after wipes but don’t overdo it.
---
I could listen to Totems of the Grizzlemaw for hours.
---
Just because they are the same stage does not mean they will be released at the same time
---
idk, vanilla WoW's music isn't like SE or Bungies soundtrack, those are more melodic and less immersive.
---
WoTLK was the last great expansion. After Cata it all went completely downhill
---
God damn you guys and your insightful comments, I'll never be able to choose. I think portals and teleporting should be the deciding factor though. Fuck all that travel around the world when I can teleport myself there 
---
&gt;Well personally I'd like to experience the patches, or something resembling the patches, that were released before I started playing.
---
I mean ok. I wish many things too.
---
&gt;getting to see WoW release from a different perspective is part of what's attractive to me about Classic.  
---
&gt;The same invariably holds true for anyone interested in Classic who didn't play vanilla at all.
---
No, people who didn't play Vanilla at all won't care since they don't know how it was originally.
---
My point is not that nothing should be scheduled. I don't care at all myself actually. What I do care about is when people scream on reddit that "this is a mistake" or "the game will be ruined without proper content schedule". This is obvious bullshit, it does not matter that much. If Blizzard does it that's cool, but don't freak about it as much as you should for let's say loot trading for example.
---
&gt;If we take this argument to its logical extreme, we're left with something like:  
---
&gt;Make everything from vanilla available at release, including Naxxramas and all world bosses.
---
Yeah yeah "we are right because our God slippery slope runs the world REEEEEEEE". I've heard that already, thanks.
---
&gt;To me, regardless of how hardcore I play, \[...\]
---
Nah, if you don't play hardcore, and have not the schedule of a jobless player, you won't see any difference with schedule or not. You know why? Because there is other stuff to do than endgame PvE in Classic. People will take ages to get level 60, people will level and look for receips for professions, they will farm reps, they will do quests with particular reward / class quests, they will do attunements / farm keys for dungeons, they will farm various sets if they are hybrid, some will farm gold and camp the AH, some will WPvP most of the time, and do raids from time to time, they will play a lot in BGs when they are out, ...........................................
---
Again, most people won't see a difference. Does that mean that I think there shouldn't be any schedule? No I think that's fine. But I would totally understand if Blizzard does not think it's that important, because it's not for the main portion of their players.
---
&gt; Why not let your argument speak for itself rather than dismissing everyone else from the debate? 
---
I'm not criticizing. But you can't ignore that repeating what a vocal minority screams all the time is common stuff on reddit, yeah? Just making those aware.
---
The original music when entering the tavern in Brill.  They changed it, so I mean the version during the Beta/release.
---
Completely agree. Unfortunately my deadline to do so is in 2 weeks.

I've been feeling like playing either Warlock or Rogue. I don't know what advice someone could give since they both seem equally good in most areas (Warlocks having the advantage in leveling, probably), it's really just a choice between melee and ranged. My friends are playing mage, warrior and priest and I do plan on leveling with them.
---
Top 1 - Shaping of the world
---
Though, never used in WOW, even in BfA.
---
You can kite the dragon packs at the world boss spawn point in ashenvale To orgrimmar, one of them has an AOE root that kills any low level and undergeared 60s
---
You can also queue up at any inn.
---
Unless I am misunderstanding. My issue with dropping the BG's is that they come with HW gear. Which is crap and makes the game worse for it's existence. Push it back as much as possible as far as I am concerned. I would not mind them dropping the bg's sans the gear though.
---
Easily. Wow is just not optimized trash
---
Honor system and it's broken gear are introduced way too early for my liking.
---
Allow me

---
&gt; Like have a ton of materials required but change the ones you need so people can't prepare.
---
This. And not just mats; crafted items too. Make it a REAL war effort.
---
(If that was a thing in vanilla, I forgot)
---
The Vanilla WoW soundtrack was actually recorded at the community college near me where I got my Audio Engineering certification at. Crazy that I've been in the same studio that my favorite game of all time was recorded in.
---
I don't think you understand how this works. I never said you aren't going to download anything. Just because you're downloading files that doesn't mean the clients will be separate. Blizzard develops beta clients all the time, some changes make it to live, some don't. That doesn't mean the clients are separate. 
---
The retail client will be updated to handle the old assets, which they've already demonstrated. There will be an option to switch between updated and classic models in the settings. The client will be updated, but they won't be separate. You have two different arguments going on, no one said the client won't be updated. We're arguing that retail and classic won't be separate clients.
---
Change the materials, and not tell what materials until it begins, but TELL THAT THEY'RE GETTING CHANGED before release.
---
Warriors/druids gain rage from being damaged, bubble prevents this, harder for them to get rage gor abilities.
---
"Oh no! Someone told me to use logic!  Better get defensive instead of taking a step back?"
---
 Is that literally what went through your mind dude?  All I'm saying is use a little logic.  Yes, they are "hard facts" but hard facts mean NOTHING without the correct interpretation.  DM releasing in less than a month from the EU release date, means that a majority of the population NEVER experienced a "DM-less" Molten Core atmosphere.  That's REALITY.  That is not conjecture, that is applied logic given the situation.
---
If you're going to get defensive when someone says "googling dates without applying logic is pedantic" then I got some bad news for you when you hit the real world with a real job: Anyone can google information.  In fact most of us do it EVERY day in our jobs in some form or another.  The real separation is the people who use that information and apply it accordingly, and those that just regurgitate it: somehow expecting a random statistic to speak for itself in any given context.
---
They get rage from taking damage. I think PW:S makes it so they don’t get and rage except from their own auto attacks. 
---
I mean, having items being TOTALLY random is also a ridiculous argument.  Instead of say 50,000 light leathers, make it 15,000 light hides. Something comparable.  
---
I don't remember if this worked in classic but you could invite someone to group, mark them with w/e symbol then disband and they would still have the mark annoyingly above their head. They had to invite someone to remove it.
---
Lol oh...
---
By "new engine" do you guys mean they will have the updated graphics too?
---
U shut your whore mouth. Orcs are supposed to be bent.    I realize that whole “whore mouth” thing was a little overboard but still.  Orcs should not walk like homo
---
Finding the correct mobs to grind for Hydraxian rep is an obstacle. Figuring out how to get a quint is an obstacle. Baron bomb is definitely a mechanic. Managing Garr's adds is a mechanic that is a challenge for most guilds. I could go on, but these things all require teamwork &amp; coordination until everyone has done it a dozen times (or more.) It is this teamwork that largely defines vanilla WoW for most people. Having access to DM gear trivializes the majority of drops in MC and reduces the incentive to be there. The game becomes a lot less fun.
---
Elwyn forest for sure, and I didn't even play alliance.
---
Barrens would be a close second, especially the Crossroads music.
---
I prefer to never be shielded ever as a warrior, unless I am about to die.
---
To prevent healing aggro, waiting casting your first heal when the warrior dips below 50% is completely fine. You can make it a smaller heal to bring them up to 75%ish if you are still noticing aggro issues waiting this long. This might happen on larger pulls, or if they are taking damage quickly. If you still are pulling aggro, fade  is your last resort. 
---
Once fade wears off you should be fine. If you are still not fine, shield yourself and run toward the tank. 
---
Clothies for the dude who spans trade chat for 6 hours trying to find a non-melee group for Blackrock, and the warrior for the one fresh 60 in the group.
---
Shhh,  let him think having 5 rets auto attack as dps is good use.
---
Some initial classic soundtracks come to mind:
---
Solstice (Nes)
---
Warcraft2
---
Unreal ('99?)
---
Duke Nukem 3D
---
Most guilds on pservers were running 1-2 druids and 4-5 resto shams, chain heal is just amazing in vanilla.
---
I'm not going to play the ranking game, but there's something to be said about 'Jet Set Radio Future'.
---
You underestimate our power. I will remind you of the story of young Shia Labeouf. He thought their were limits on the internet too. He thought Surely if I put my flag in an open field in an undisclosed location surely no one would be able to take down his flag. Naive foolish and naive. 
---
If it can be done. Some unshaven bastard who hasn't felt the touch of a woman in years will do it. If you think 40 such scoundrels can't be found. You haven't been using the same internet I have. Records will be broken I assure you.
---
So your argument is that classic will be filled with a steady stream of nameless, faceless pugs that you will never encounter again. You are pretending like this is Modern WoW.  Also, you put in the presumption that those who inappropriately roll need won't be spotted by actually rolling need for an item they obviously don't need. 
---
If there is a group of friends who all roll need, and it could be legitimately noticed that all of them could actually need/use the item, and then they decide to trade it to a particular member of their group, what is that to you if they all were legitimate rolls and then they decided who to grant it to? If people are rolling/winning items they shouldn't be, it will get noticed, regardless of whether they trade it or not.
---
&gt;MC will not be a faceroll to many players experiencing classic/vanilla wow.
---
MC isn't just easy for p server nerds, its easy for everyone. Everyone is going in with a ton of information about the game we didnt have in 2004, youtube video, strategies, and etc. 
---
The hardest thing mechanically about MC back in the day is the lack of raid frames. That alone is going to make it a joke, let alone debuff slots and the information we have.
---
Finding correct mobs will be a quick google search and maybe a few hours grind with a party. And these mechanics you mentioned should NOT take a dozen tries to learn. Are you joking? Baron you just run out of group with bomb. Garr adds is just marking them and using proper CC, so maybe the initial pull is somewhat tricky but after that its a joke. Again, i never said there werent mechanics, but they are so simple compared to any other raid that you should only find them fun or challenging if you've never played WoW before.
---
Use it as a healing CD, not part of your rotation. You lower tps, which lowers dps, which lowers your xp/h.
---
Jesus dude, you have issues.
---
And you seems a bit dense too, seeing that you still can't understand that I'm not discussing any rights or wrongs here, safe your wall of text and insults for someone else because I'm not interested.
---
Epic staff in the 40’s? Wouldn’t that be the warden staff, which is BiS for Ferals?
---
Possibly, I think its just more the idea of being a tiny neon colored running punchline and being able to say 
---
&gt;"Yes, I want to roll as *that* thing!"
---
thats also something to consider is the effort required on blizzards side.  im not a programmer but after listening to the Q&amp;A are blizcon i never realized how much "other stuff" goes into getting classic to run.  particularly how data is stored or integration with battle net launcher and a ton of logistical crap that can cause even more headaches
---
BG's are (as of Blizzcon) part of the second Stage of Content release.
---
Stage 1 where Classic kicks off only includes MC, Ony, and DM as "extra" end game content.  This includes all the baseline instances.
---
I just think the upright posture looks better / more intimidating.
---
To each their own.
---
I think people are just better players than back then.
---
Concerning pugs: the guild I was in made cross guild runs since they didn‘t have enough players sometimes and still killed Kel.
---
So to ancertain level Naxx pugs will work.
---
About raiding in general, not sure.
---
I never raided due to my working times and habe no other experience than joining a guild and try to get a raid spot.
---
No, more of a "new engine" in how the game deals with things like mountains/hills and the like. Ever try jumping to the Ironforge Airfield, or doing some weird wall climb to get on the roof of Goldshire's inn?
---
Graphics should stay as-is from Vanilla. And even if there is later a toggle-able option it shouldn't change the engine.
---
If you playing with those friends nearly exclusively, I would suggest rogue.  Remember there is no personal loot, so if you went warlock you would be triple stacking cloth and all wanting the same gear while leather drops vendored.  
---
It would be if he hadn't used +strength in his hypothetical. 
---
I don't think anyone has ever argued that an over geared druid couldn't off tank adds.
---
Ok thanks, I just double checked the screen shot (not sure why I didn't do it before) and it's 
---
&gt;BGs and PvP Rewards
---
For some reason I thought it only said "PvP Rewards" and no mention of BG's. 
---
Thanks!
---
Winterspring
---
I’m just bullshitting man. It does look better. But no changes and all that. 
---
Updated lighting and water shaders, but all the original models. 
---
BETA: YES/NO?  
---
I literally need no other info.
---
Already seeing a few people I know.  Although I wish you could enter multiple guilds or edit your entry.  I ended up posting a duplicate but I was in about four main guilds over the course of the expansion
---
Ah, I must have missed that.
---
I've done the hardcore raiding already mate, back when there were no guides and add-ons to hold your hand. But keep being cool and being elitist in a 15 year old game where everyone has already done everything before you.
---
r/suicidebywords
---
Succubus is a lot harder to manage given range differences
---
Yerp. I remember clicking off shields intentionally in Deadmines because I was rage starved and couldn't generate any threat.
---
UGHHHH! My hype the last week as turned up to max and I have no idea why. I have patiently waited the last year and half since announcement and the time has flown by, except for a month after release which everyday was like "CLAAAAAASSSSIIIICCCCC!!!!!!!!"
---
This last week though, I've just been itching. I need it to go away so that I can patiently wait again and summer will be here in no time. I am not looking forward to a month before release, it will be hell, the days will drag haha.
---
Anyways, you're missing Leeroy.
---
There's a few minutes in the zone music that plays in crystalsong forest that I've used as something to relax since I stopped playing right before Cata.  It's like a flute or other wind instrument playing.  I used it throughout grad school right before exams and it would bring me so much peace.
---
If he goes shadow, he isn't going to give much support to your warrior and you realistically need support on warrior.  He can heal, but has to drop form.  He can dispel and PWS, but shadow is mana limited so he can't do it frequently.   
---
Also remember respecting is quite expensive, so I doubt he will be able to swap back and forth from shadow to healer spec frequently.  
---
You can always have both alchemy and engineering.
---
the music inside the temple is blissful.
---
I believe they were made but never implemented. Probably originally intended as the Tauren Warrior Hero Class. Mark Kern the class developer during that time mentioned Hero Classes in interviews and why they were never implemented.
---
Bit of a sore spot for me. Tauren Warrior was my first character because I liked their WC3 units.
---
It was def a thing when BWL and MC were the only raids out.  And even when we did alt runs later on we expected our locks to come fully stocked.  I do remember having a group go out with a lock and helping them farm a ton of shards at once.
---
Some of the more common mistakes I see from healers in dungeons involve precasting a shield or HoT before the tank has pulled. PW:S is more of a low HP buffer than the extra max hp it is in PvP/solo content.
---
No....not even a little.
---
If you want to discuss this at least do it in good faith.  Try again or dont.  Doesnt matter to me.
---
A bartender's life is a lonely one
---
Seconded!!! Could listen to the FFVII Piano soundtrack forever
---
Yeah, but will it be that way this time though? Everyone having stones for Rag and Nef perhaps. But I don't expect a mirror of 15 years ago where 20 people per encounter needed stones for mediocre bosses like Lucifron. Im expecting we will be better players overall this time 15 years later leading to many less healthstones needed.
---
Im hoping anyway.
---
Ah. I can't wait to PoM/pryo one shot people again.
---
Or play a frost mage.  I seriously can't wait.
---
Remember it isn't just will, there is tremor totem as well.  
---
That being said, in group fights your dots are far more effective as alliance since horde has only priest dispellers.  
---
I'm not talking about Alchemy beeing not viable to raid. I'm just saying if the maingoal is to min/max (more output) ur own character Alchemy will most likely not be the best choice depending on the class/role because there are no advantages gained by having Alchemy urself (excluding the mentioned druid tank trinket, which is a niche case). 
---
Ofc there need to be characters or even alts in the guild with Alchemy, that's not the point.
---
I'm of the minority but I would like new graphics. Same models. But better graphics.
---
Now THAT is something I would love to see. Get health potions, moonsteel broadswords, thick leather boots, mageweave cloaks, etc.
---
Well, 6-9 months for MC, Onyxia, Kazzak, Azuregos and UBRS is a reasonable amount of raiding. I suppose you could merge Stage 3 and 4 into one. It really depends on how long Blizzard would take to release each stage.
---
&gt; My hype the last week has turned up to max and I have no idea why. I have patiently waited the last year and half since announcement
---
Since the demo, I'm like checking daily every thottbot, reading this sub more than daily, checking the discord NGDP bot everytime I hear a notification, just to make sure it's not Classic that got patched into beta. And, daily spamming LOTRO's world chat, about WOW classic.
---
You are correct that they didn't scale, but people often say they do because some private servers are bugged.  
---
I was a warrior tank in vanilla, always decently geared, and was always shielded before pulls in dungeons. I was shielded not because I knew better or worse, that's just what the priests would do, and I never argued. I can remember very occasionally having to taunt a mob off of the healer early in a fight, but not very often. I can say with certainty that having a shield thrown on me never resulted in a wipe, but the thinking and min/max'ing has changed considerably over the years, so it might not be the 'thing' your everyday priest does once Classic drops.
---
Thanks so much for listening and for the kind words :) Glad you’re enjoying the show 
---
&gt;too many of you are gonna want to bank lower levels and the game won’t feel the same for those who will be leveling a few months after release
---
Being ganked and ganking on a pvp server is the whole point.  I had so much fun ganking low levels for them to switch over to their mains and we'd end up with battles in whatever town it was happening in.  Natural world pvp like that is so much fun.
---
Totally feel you on this - the nostalgia for VII does help it a little. IX is amazing
---
I think human is better simply by adding one paladin that class mix.
---
That's a personal preference though. You and I raid to get gear to kill people, but what about the people who raid and don't pvp at all? They really do play to clear the raids more efficiently. Some of those people are also the ones who enjoy alts so they just go play those or farm gold. Some of them simply raid log when they don't have any pve to do.
---
&gt;Is the music of vanilla WoW the greatest gaming soundtrack of all time?
---
That'd be a no. Not even the best MMO soundtrack of all time. Go play Ragnarok Online.
---
It's because BfA was a new expansion, so it had new features to comment on.
---
Vanilla won't have those, we already know all the raid bosses and the lore, so there's not much they can talk about.
---
Would be really strange for them to just come here every week and say "hey, we're still working in Classic, it's still comming out summer 2019". They don't need to say that because it's impied.
---
On the contrary, if they come here to say anything, it's probably bad news. Delays and etc...
---
Ah yes, the good old "insult someone because god forbid I admit I was wrong" bit.  
---

I suggest you have a read, specifically this part:

Most people have a hard time accepting facts or situations that prove them wrong.  But what separates the ingrates from the higher life forms is the ability to accept that you were wrong sometimes and move on.  Something you've clearly yet to master (Hint: that was an insult, but thinly veiled.  Alas no more freebies for you...now or ever!)

Anyhow you're boring..and invariably wrong.  And I mute boring people.  [Good bye.](https://media.giphy.com/media/ceeN6U57leAhi/giphy.gif) 
---
it is very very easy to manage a pet once you have it on a high happyness level. its pretty much impossible to make it run away at that point.
---
A 40 man guild using all of their alt slots as banks just for stockpiling, as in they have no personal alts or personal banks, would barely have enough space to stockpile linen bandages. Just the linen bandages. There are about 30 other mats that would need to be stockpiled, several in similar quantities
---
Lol a shitty grand marshall could be beaten by a good player who has been 60 for a couple days.
---
If you pve only, it is not a big deal.  It is super fast if you do any group content, for example we used to speed run live strat with 5 dps for righteous orbs, and our warlock would come and get a full bag of shards. 
---
PvP can be harder, when you are spamming pet swaps, healthstones, and shadowburn.  Plus its hard to farm shards in pvp and you generally Q far away from places with mobs that will drop shards.  
---
I saw a good solution that attempted to appease the very vocal noChanges crowd: Before the patch, calculate the number of materials of each type currently in existence, and add that to the totals needed. That way, if a guild has hoarded 10,000 runecloth, say, just add x + 10,000 to the total of Runecloth needed.
---
Same. Also currently leveling on a Pserver and it's rare that I ever get ganked by higher level players. Occasionally have a fun stand off with enemies the same level, but that's about it.
---
Here's some great experiences I've had as a Feral Druid in "main tank" situations in classic:
---
* Getting globaled by Chromaggus in the time it took a tranq shot projectile to fire and reach him
---
* Getting crit one shot by giant C'thun tentacles while HP flasked
---
* Hundreds of resisted taunts with no Mocking Blow as backup, causing mechanics to fail
---
* Not being able to make clutch plays with powerful cooldowns, because I had no powerful cooldowns
---
Please don't try and stand around saying Feral Druids are Main Tank viable. KT hits like a wet fucking noodle; any boss that has high tank damage will absolutely trash a Feral Druid. Ferals as MT are exclusively useful in fights where A. Threat is a serious problem (eg. Thaddius, Vaelastrasz), and B. The boss doesn't do so much tank damage that the fight is impossible to main tank as Feral (eg. Chromaggus, Patchwerk).
---
ur absolutely right
---
&gt;Blizzard develops beta clients all the time, some changes make it to live, some don't. That doesn't mean the clients are separate.
---
Okay, I'm going to break this down for you since you obviously have no Idea how any of this works.
---
When Blizzard develops beta and alpha clients for their new xpacs, those builds are sitting in their own branch of the retail repository. There is a current, live build branch, and probably multiple development branches. When these development branches are ready, they get pushed directly into the live build. Now, Classic and Retail are going to be two completely separate entities, Blizzard has already confirmed this. 
---
From a source control and programming perspective, it's literally impossible to have 2 entirely different games (because that's what Classic and Retail are, 2 completely separate games) be running on the exact same client from the exact same repository, because any time the retail or classic team needed to make a change or update something, they would have to make sure their changes don't fuck up one or both games. Why would ANY development team, video game or otherwise, do this? It doesn't make sense. You always keep separate projects in their own repository.
---
What does make sense is to have 2 separate clients that are in their own unique repositories so there will be no conflicts between them, you know, because they're two separate games.
---
&gt;There will be an option to switch between updated and classic models in the settings.
---
No there won't. What there is an option for is to use the new water textures, higher foliage density, higher res spell effects, and their new lighting &amp; shadows. That is different from "switching between classic models and updated models". Oh and by the way, there were plenty of old art assets they had to recreate, why would they bloat the retail client with old art assets they don't need? They won't, because Classic is it's own client.
---
&gt;The client will be updated, but they won't be separate. You have two different arguments going on, no one said the client won't be updated.
---
Yes, the will be separate, because they're already separate. The Classic client was forked from 7.3.5, which is over a year old. All this shit is explained in information they've released in both dev watercoolers from last june and october, their blizzcon panel on remaking classic, as well as information relatively easily discerned from the Demo.
---
Explain to me why it makes ANY sense to have players download upwards of 60gb of data for retail assets that aren't even in Classic? The 1.12 client is about 6gb. I imagine the Classic client will be about the same, maybe a bit more for some of the upgraded textures. It's hilarious you would even think they would be the same client.
---
&gt;I don't think you understand how this works.
---
I love being told by someone who obviously has never worked in software development how these things work. When Classic is released and you're downloading the new client, be sure to remember this conversation to save you from future embarrassment. 
---
It honestly makes the game so much more immersive. A dangerous world enables me to bond with it more. 
---
I get that, honestly I do.
---
But we're talking about a game announced at the same time that also already released with content in it, versus absolutely nothing.
---
I'm not expecting tons of update posts, but... maybe a little? I just want to know some of the things they fixed since the demo and such.
---
If the game crashes on every PC. Of course they are going to bug fix.
---
Their core philosophy is:
---
Deliver an authentic experience
---
High priority on the integrity of social dynamics
---
**Avoid messing with the 1.12 data**
---
I agree - one of the curious things about the time was people not knowing what to do to prepare. We had to go look at the requirements on the day the patch came out and then begin to farm things. When the gathering of materials began it was expected to be a huge grind... that was the point.
---
There were times when I'd go farm some sort of item for an hour or two, then do something else. It was sort of part of the way the world worked during that era, people farming things for a bit and then going to raid or dungeons or pvp, and then back to farm a bit. Honestly it was kind of the first variety of daily quests, since you got those reward boxes.
---
I feel if people are able to over-prepare the entire event will be set down a bit in terms of scale. It's supposed to be a monumental undertaking... something epic, where afterwards you almost can't believe your server farmed all that stuff. On my old server we had both sides farming items for the other faction and sending them cheap on the blackmarket AH. To not be able to experience the slog of the material gathering stretching out over weeks or even months, would be to lose a big part of Classic.
---
Westfall music is my absolute favorite. The nostalgia hits me in the feels 
---
This was obviously only PvE content just like the original slides.
---
&gt; Ah yes, the good old "insult someone because god forbid I admit I was wrong" bit.
---
Nope, the dates are not up for discussion.
---
None of your psychology 101 babbling will change that. So yes, please block me because your replies are cringy as fuck.
---
Soul stones fades if the warlock leaves, really ??
---
So I take it you've never played a p server... 
---
 most hardcore players have MC on farm within the first month of release. Most people dont even farm BIS since MC is a pretty basic raid. Hell I remember being in mostly greens and clearing half on my alt. 
---
Content coming out to fast means a biger gear curve for the adverage players I cant speak about anymore according to you lmfao. 
---
So while you're still trying to get your pointless BIS. The rest of us will be running AQ 20 and 40. 😂
---
I thought [https://barrens.chat/](https://barrens.chat/) was the place.
---
Ele is not viable for dungeons until you grossly outgear them.  You don't have the single target damage to be good on bosses, and you don't have good enough sustained aoe to replace a mage or warlock's aoe plus you are mana limited.  Enhancement in dungeons is generally viewed much better.  The damage is inconsistent but reasonably good and is not as mana limited.  
---
As others have said, healing as ele is fine, and you can contribute some damage.  In 10mans like UBRS if the other healer is good, then you can hybrid it up and add some damage.  
---
Well, it's your 15$/month so...
---
Gaming history is so vast that the music would definitely be divided into subcategories. There are so many iconic soundtracks for so many reasons, it would be wrong to put them against each other. Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Max Payne, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy. Countless NES games. All the Sonic games, some of the DK games. Mario 64... Even modern stuff, plants vs zombies, undertale... There's so much amazing and underrated music.
---
I was also hoping for this. But so is blizzard just going to re release all of WoW again? Loop after loop?
---
Maybe try watching all the explanations and videos of why it's taking so long, you'll probably want to start with some of the Blizzcon 2018 videos and dev watercoolers.
---
Yeah I am well aware, and I am trying to get people to say top streamers because it makes no sense to generalize streamers by the 0.001% 
---
Vanilla WoW? I think the tune that sticks most with me would either be the login theme, for sheer wonder and adventure, or the molten core theme. Spending 6 hours in molten core twice a week trying to down magmadar was harrowing. I start sweating just thinking about it. 
---
My favourite music from WoW in general would either have to be “Mountains of Thunder” from Storm Peaks, or possibly the music from the night bourne sections of Azsuna. 
---
Im personally taking comfort in the low key approach. They arent advertising it or showing it off. Meaning they probably don't expect much of it. Ill take the lack of attention over Activision buzzing around the project poking at it for sure man.
---
&gt; What a stupid fucking question.
---
Well, we are on /r/classicwow
---
It's expected
---
Greatest of all time ? No.
---
But some are cool, definitely paper roleplay material.
---
I really like the dun morogh one, https://youtu.be/hK0qM9hnr-0
---
I never got to run naxx during vanilla as well. Most people skipped it once BC was announced 
---
But, I’m not gay!
---
I moved and don't have a job (and don't need money right now for a couple months) I wish I could just play 2 months of classic before getting a job. God damn i'm gonna get a job then it's gona come out and I will only be able to play a couple hours a day at most
---
I came here to see someone arguing that they wanted to 2her tank. I am disappointed. 
---
MC is going to be trivailized no matter what because of raid frames + debuff slots + talents. 
---
&gt;No BGs for the first 3 months?? Wow, have fun leveling in eastern plaguelands while hundreds of 60s are ganking you for ranks. 
---
I think thats the point. They dont want to ruin people's expectations of world pvp galore by adding bgs too soon, plus honor gear.
---
I thought there was no rank system until BGs. So there wouldn’t be any incentive to world PvP. 
---
&gt;The boss doesn't do so much tank damage that the fight is impossible to main tank as Feral (eg. Chromaggus, Patchwerk).
---
You know druids are actually better patchwerk tanks than warriors right?
---
Well, we got some news 2 weeks ago or so, didn't we?
---
People are exagerating a bit much
---
&gt; you should only find them fun or challenging if you've never played WoW before.
---
Yet people find a way to die to them in 2019, just sayin.
---
Shields should only be used as instant heal or as preventive measure against bosses with huge burst like chrommagus, broodlord and such.
---
Most of KT damage is frost magic and aoe
---
His autoattacks are meh
---
I'm over it, for a little while I was all over all the discords and forums but after seeing or having the same discussion for the 100th time I just bowed out, it was a complete waste of time. Now I just check periodically for an update while spending my time doing other stuff until Classic comes out.
---
No and no
---
The Community should post a 5-6 Stage plan and push for it.
---
4 Stages are too short.
---
Or you can just look at their portait?
---
How do you overgear naxx ?
---
Also he is tanking kt....
---
I played EU Vanilla, very, very few people were 60 by the time DM launched. 
---
Don't forget you can play one handed. Baby in left arm mode in right. 
---
Damn WoW players and their having fun!!! Can't let them jump to an airfield or on top of goldshire!!
---
Nagrand music is, and will always be my favourite. I also love the "Demon Hunter" from Legion soundtrack, its freaking epic.
---
I recognize guild names from my old server, but no players yet. I'm pretty sure most don't play anymore anyway 😣
---
This got me thinking. I was wondering if this was actually possible and what it would take, so I calculated it and thought I'd share my findings.
---
[THIS LINK]https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Gates_of_Ahn%27Qiraj) is a list of the required materials for the war effort. Let's assume there are 6 guilds on the server who are tryharding enough to try to stockpile the stuff. 3 ally and 3 horde. the real TOP guilds. let's say they each have 40 people in their main raid kader and everyone uses their 8 characters other than the main to stockpile everything.
---
In this example, I will be assuming the 3 alliance guilds band together to stockpile the complete mats for the alliance part, and the 3 horde guilds for the horde part, so nothing gets stockpiled double.
---
Total alliance item amount = 1 829 000 = 64450 stacks. thats 91450 total inventory slots needed.
---
Total horde stack amount = 795 000 = 39750 stacks
---
Okay. Let's calculate the amount of inventory slots they have. 
---
3 * 8 * 40 * 220 === 633 600 total Inventory slots on each side 
---
as mentioned above, I am assuming there are 120 people on each side who do this. (3 guild á 40 people per side)
---
let's say only the top guild does it, and they only have 5 characters each to spare (because they have their own alts and bankchars)
---
     5 * 50 * 220 === 55 000 total Inventory slots on each side 
---
much more realistic. And still. You try to farm 5 full bankchars of mats while raiding every day.
---
This whole thing is assuming some more things:
---
- the storage characters store NOTHING other than war effort mats. 
---
- they all have 16 slot bags in the bank and inventory. EVERYWHERE
---
Tales of Symphonia and Hotline Miami are going to win out for me.
---
wtf are you talking about?  get lost
---
You guys should be happy they gave you a release window and not the usual when it's done. 
---
I showed my friends little brother how to make macros and he created this:
---
/train
---
/train 
---
Etc. he spent the last couple of days outside of ironforge bank as a dwarf spamming this before the account was banned. 
---
You're underestimating the twitch effect, plus people have been waiting 14 years for this. I'm taking 10 days off work for it.
---
Same last time I leveled in a vanilla server I didn't want to level again for over a year. If I start now, guarantee i'm not gona want to play classic 
---
&gt; So I take it you've never played a p server... 
---
You guessed right.
---
&gt;Content coming out to fast means a biger gear curve for the adverage players I cant speak about anymore according to you lmfao. 
---
The average player won't be what you considered average player in pservers. But I'm not gonna argue more about that. You'll see by yourself.
---
&gt; So while you're still trying to get your pointless BIS. The rest of us will be running AQ 20 and 40 
---
I've never mention BiS myself anywhere, and I couldn't care less about it, so I'm not sure what you're talking about but thanks for warning me !
---
And also, have fun rushing everything ! I see you're a man of taste and have understood what Classic is all about  😂.
---
But I'm a warlock so I do care about it and don't care about warriors.
---
Honestly you could probably go for a delayed R14(but as warlock you only want 12/13) if you are able to take some time off work or whatever doing the last 3 weeks, not saying 3 weeks straight but taking the day after reset off would be really useful.
---
It will be rough ofc, but honestly it's completely doable people just slur out 12h/day like it's actually the case, it's not.
---
I like your answer the best here.  Use shadow bolt and corruption on bosses though, otherwise focus on single target DPS but also your own efficiency so you aren't just OOM all the time and spamming life tap.  Of course if your wand is trash then.. you're barely doing any damage so maybe you should do a few shadow bolts or corruption. 
---
Definitely be sure to check out the break down of the Nagrand track that we go through on the call then, it’s really interesting where the inspiration for that tune came from!
---
Whatever you do, don't spam corruption on all mobs at the beginning of each pull as you will overaggro.  
---
Vanilla music was great but TBC really nailed it for me. They went from midi to orchestral while keeping that that minimalistic feel that was lost in later expansions. 
---
Modern wow music feels more like music to listen to. Which is great in it's own way. But Vanilla/TBC felt more somewhere between ambiance and theme'ing.
---
If I had to pick a Vannila zone track then it'd have to be [Tanaris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1qEZ7uw0iw). It's some of the least musical music I've ever heard but somehow sounds like a desert.
---
TBC track, I love the elven lullaby type tracks. [The Sin'dorei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaIn5H5vus) and [Silvermoon City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2NMzFAJ4o) are top choices. But honestly I could just listen to the entire soundtrack on repeat.
---
congrats dude Classic WoW is better than any woman.
---
I would love the mats to randomize on every server. 
---
Alliance, Human Priest.
---
there's population requirements to get BR1 yes, but generally speaking what matters is the amount of hardcore rankers per population(population being players that get 15hk's per week). 
---
I have I'm just not buying it really, it sounds like the project is under-resourced
---
"Obviously" you need to look at the literal picture of the slide in this post...
---
Wtf is that comment xD. Overgeared? In Naxx? Lmfao
---
Classic Music really had that pure RPG feel imo.  I’m very fond of TBC and Wrath just because of the quality, with that said:
---
1. Dun Morogh: all tracks.  Super calming, very Warcraft feeling.  Just all around great.
---
2. Tanris Music/Cave/Music I believe is the same.  Really has that  dark mysterious feel,  really feels like your in the middle of no where or deep into some ancient place.
---
3.BRD Music/Ironforge:  I mean, heavy dwarves feels here.  Almost Tolkien-esque.  I’m very fond of it.  Again very RPG feeling.
---
Bonus: Stranglethorn—it really invokes the “im not in Kansas anymore” feeling.  Very exotic and dangerous. 
---
The tier sets are pretty trash for pve on warlock until T2.5/T3.
---
As compare to prebis? It depends on which rank set is available. In vanilla there was a lvl58 blue set for r10, all the way till naxx when it finally got replaced with a blue lv60 set with way better gear. Typically the pvp gear you wear in pve is 2set for the +sp set bonus it gives.
---
No, they are better Hateful Strike tanks than Warrior. That is an off-tank role.
---
What about terrain? And objects like rocks and trees? 
---
There is no clear cut answer here, BRE is a strong contender in terms of 2h fury, but there is also arguments to be made for windfury and slow/high dmg 2handers for hordes. Slam might also come into the equation, but have no personal experience with it.
---
Rule of thumb: human warriors are king with dal rends or ironfoe for prebis. Orc warriors with axe of the deep woods are pre raid bis. After that, both types of warriors get their respective axes and swords from coming raid tiers.
---
Is this private server? If so we don't know the exact values they used vs blizzard etc. 
---
11 should be no task with a decent premade
---
They have higher health pool inded, but: 
---
They can't parry 
---
They can't shield wall
---
They can't last stand
---
They can't Lifegiving Gem
---
Patchwerk can't crit or crush so druid works fine as the main guy as well.
---
It's not like the private server value are completely wrong either. They might not be exact but they should still be pretty close.
---
So you actually do understand, you just don't believe them. Got it.
---
Wipes still happen in MC on private servers, obviously not serious guilds but hardcore raiders live in a bubble if they think no one ever wipes in MC. I've seen a guild disband over wiping several times on Lucifron about 2 years ago.
---
KT auto attacks are hitting the Druid for 1600. Onyxia hits MC geared Ferals for 1600. The auto attack damage on those fights are irrelevant.
---
Frostbolt is the most dangerous ability he has, and that can't crush or crit (ferals biggest weakness). KT just so happens to be a good fight for Feral.
---
Of course they would provide a download of the 1.12 client.  I wasn't suggesting they'd just provide a server and not a place to download the client or promotions for it.
---
MC is tier 1, it should not be hard. The loot isn't even that good anyway except Rag melee weapons and a few other items. There's hardly anything for casters.
---
This is true but when I played in retail classic. This just meant all the allies were gunning for sun rock or 1k needles over the Barrens. Yea you can hide in the sourthern barrens for a little bit but, you are gonna get frustrated real fast doing that.
---
I can't speak for P.S. but at least when I played classic the horde had to deal with camping like that less because we were out numbered 3-1 or 5-1 on most pvp servers. It might sound counter intuitive to think how does that help you not get ganked but it isn't. 
---
The horde used to be a lot more organized and a lot more clannish. If you got messed up by allies camping you. You always had big bruddahs ready to come back you up because A they need more max levels and dont want you to quit and B they remember the same pain and want pay back.
---
I think the alliance side used to suffer from an embarrassment of riches. Plenty of 60's lots of maxx level raiders and at the time on my server in retail they got ganked way less. When you up on the other faction 5-1 they aren't trying to start a fight most of the time. This led to less sympathy and community when it did happen.
---
Too bad too; otherwise Warlocks could make a little money selling SS cooldowns just like mages make money selling food, water, and ports. Imagine setting up shop in BRM and selling SS to passing groups that don't have a warlock.
---
Depends on how crazy other people end up being, but probably rank 8-10 assuming you get your full 28-42 hours of play time a week consistently.
---
*Hateful Strike* can't crush or crit. That's why Ferals are good off-tanks for Patchwerk.
---
I'd love to see a source on Patchwerk's auto attacks not crushing or critting. Mechanically there should be no reason for him to not be able to crush or crit and I can find no information confirming a supposed inability for him to crush or crit on white swings.
---
Ooooh I don't know about this one, will definitely have to check it out! 
---
I just think it’s funny to say someone is an asshole, scumbag, etc for playing a video game the way it was meant to be played.  If you don’t like it, play on a Pve server, don’t call someone an asshole tho for playing the game.  Like what???  
---
That’s like going to metal show and calling everyone assholes because the crowds too rough for you.  People like different things and just because you don’t agree with it doesn’t make them an asshole, scumbag, etc.  Once again, if you don’t like a rough crowd, don’t go to a metal show that draws in a rough crowd.  But don’t call people out because you don’t like the same thing. 
---
I just think your really close minded and calling someone a scumbag in a video game for playing the game the way it was meant to be played is hilarious, especially when you have options to avoid those “scumbags.”  
---
Soundtrack overall, maybe.  But I am biased.
---
For a single song, though, I gotta go with [Baba Yetu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJiHDmyhE1A).  The first piece of videogame music to win a grammy!
---
Priest Shields lead to Rage Starvation.
---
Only use in Emergencies. Or prior to an insanely big pull where you Pre-Shield/Hot.
---
Shield is best used for yourself or DPS.
---
Bit basic but SW and Orgrimmar really have iconic, moving tracks. They give you an incredibly song sense of place and theme.
---
The initial gear is not all that great, sure there are a few pieces that are great (r12 warrior legs for instance). What most private servers do is launch with  bgs and the first bg gear. Then down the line, some time post bwl launch they make the upgraded available for purchase.
---
Why?
---
Have you seen how much armor a fully buffed/geared druid has?
---
i dont want to underestimate the hardcore crowd but i think the strategy wouldnt be to stockpile 100% of everything.  instead keep a smaller percentage, maybe a higher % of a select few and then once in striking distance to hit 100% you turn in everything.  you still rely on the server but if you can turn in 20% of the required resource you can make a huge impact that influences when the gate opens.   
---
since there is faction based turn in that also comes into play but if getting the gates open asap is the case then there could be some cooperation between various guilds of opposite factions to plan turn ins, but each scenario is different.  
---
I have never been big into playing the AH game, but maybe this is a good chance to dive in.
---
Can you recommend any helpful addons or resources to check out for learning about this?
---
I'm pretty set on the #nochanges category, but this makes perfect sense. 
---
Chill, of course everyone is capable of looking things up, but nobody is making a strong case by making unsubstantiated claims and then backing them up by telling the other party to 'go look it up' which is vague at best and complete bullshit at worst. 
---
so that people will really nochange up the mats. It'd be completely different, if people stocked up mats before that, and then... ups!
---
Night Elf music is the best
---
That's definitely something Blizzard is capable of doing and it doesn't sound like a bad idea but I did hear an anecdote that gave me pause.
---
There's a [Countdown to Classic episode](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2018/09/20/episode-70-listener-calls-scarab-lords-vanilla-reunions-tbc-classic-unconventional-tanks-epic-memory-lane/) from a few months ago where a guy said that some private server devs did this with their server. Supposedly the guild that had hoarded the most materials quit beforehand, so the devs bumped the requirements "too far," expecting a bunch of turn-ins that never happened. He said they ended up auto-completing it because population was dropping but that it may have done irreparable damage. 
---
If a situation like that were to arise in Classic, maybe Blizzard could control for last-account-activity or something, but it's hard to say whether those players wouldn't come back for the War Effort just to sell the materials or something. 
---
Maybe a hybrid approach between this and simply changing some of the materials altogether. There's the option of adding tradeable, event-specific items as well. Hard to say which approach is best. They all have potential pitfalls.
---
Only for like 5% of all content they are. Mages are best until full t2, but when AQ rolls around they can go fire and fly ahead of locks again. 
---
Could you throw me a source on that? from all that ive read it seems as though their plan is to do 4 phases of content patches. They might spesify that closer to launch, when more things fall into place, but as it stands atm the afformentioned seems more plausible from what info they have released.
---
The best i did in vanilla was rank 12 i was doing at least 8 hours a day then minimum and this was on a rp server. I Tried for a couple weeks to push into rank 13 but it got to the point it was to unhealthy for me. Now i am a lot older there is no way i will be pushing pvp ranks i will just pvp for fun.
---
Love people like you with zero experience act like he knows the game lmfao. 
---
Again you stat the adverage player wont be this or that but you've never played vanilla or a p server so your option has zero value. 
---
But thanks for talking out your ass you're so knowledgeable!
---
Very cool, but why is there a bunch of post-vanilla servers?
---
I got Rank13 Solo in Vanilla and back then I was still in School. I played from like 1600 - 0200 and did Homework during Queues. Then I slept like 4hrs to 0600 and had to wake up for school where I was until ~1500. But I was on a very small Realm, thats why I could do it solo.
---
Mist is the best WoW soundtrack if you ask me, followed by WotLK. Out of any video game, I don't think WoW soundtracks come close to Final Fantasy, they'll always be top for me.
---
I've seen a couple warriors actually have a macro that they charge in to a pack, whirlwind / cleave and then swap to a shield.  RFD and SM specifically.  They took a good amount of damage but he generated a lot of threat and extra damage every pull.
---
Rage usually isnt as much of a problem for a druid since he can generate a good amount by damaging the mob too. 
---
I'm not saying they are better or worse but the same channel that uploaded this clip has a patch MT clip as well.
---
I remember selling soulstones to method for progress raids. When did they nerf that? 
---
Perhaps, but i do believe there has been a good amount of discussion that the fire/frost/nature spell damage/resist mechanism is probably fairly wrong on most pservers. But just saying as an additional note. 
---
Im in class and then smash tournament till 9-10pmish so I can't really look it up right now. But in the interviews they stated they were doing it in waves and not every piece has to come out at the same time, just that wave 1 will be completed before wave 2 etc. It seems more ridiculous to assume that everything will drop at the exact same time.
---
Guild wars 1 takes the cake for me
---
Sorry to hear that man. We all get to that point where the wife is too old to be worth the effort to sustain. Good luck finding a new one!
---
The time to grind 800g for epic mount (200g discount assuming honored rep and rank 3 pvp) takes FAR less than the time required to hit rank 11.
---
Plus no decent premade is going to let people in if they have 60% mounts
---
No other sub on reddit do I give away upvotes so generously with a smile.
---
Love you guys.
---
So gay post dude.
---
Fall asleep a lot of nights with Stranglethorn Vale on repeat. 
---
A Warrior/Druid tank will prefer to be shielded as rarely as possible because it's a bad hit to their rage generation that translates into a threat loss. It's especially bad when you pull and need snap threat to gather mobs.
---
It is very strong in it's ambiance, and up until BotW I would have considered it the undisputed best ambiance music alongside the Metroid series. 
---
Same. I loved WC 
---
In 2.1.
---
"Soulstones: Soulstones can no longer be used on targets not in your party or raid. In addition, the soulstone buff will now be removed if the target or caster leaves the party or raid."
---
Wouldn't be the first person to do so.
---
Easily my favorite game soundtrack besides Diablo II's.
---
Every time I hear "Sacred" I get goosebumps.
---
My top 5 are probably:
---
1. Sacred
---
2. Duskwood
---
3. Elwynn
---
4. Tanaris
---
5. STV
---
Was it really needed tho ?
---
When I was max level during Vanilla and raiding, all the content was out (Naxx came out during that time for me in 2006). I didn’t only run DM, though min-maxing wasn’t really a thing back then.
---
You can easily 2 hand tank a lot of stuff, and it often speeds up the run. But it does require an intelligent group that understands how to handle things.
---
If that's what the people want and there is a demand for those expansions. I don't see it getting past TBC or WOTLK though.
---
MC isn’t meant to be hard for an organized, experienced guild. I see no issue with it being destroyed easily by experienced players.
---
Nps
---
I haven't, but I will look into that for sure. 
---
Do you have a link?
---
Shields as in getting Power:Word Shield, which absorbs damage and ragestarves tanks, not equipping a shield.
---
2 hander is significantly better for trash or any aoe fights. Even if you take the talents for dw spec, you should still keep a heavy hitting slow two-handed to use for whirlwind/cleave when fighting 3+ enemies.
---
Did not have to do with fading, of which im still not sure that it was in vanilla, the orob would be that you had a 30min cooldown.
---
Non-aoe classes in my pserver guild were *highly* encouraged to go engineering for sapper charges in order to do Viscidus - just wait for the adds to come close together and 100-0 them all at once with like 20 sappers + AoE
---
Because it's a hassle, and because now you run the risk of agroing more mobs running around like a headless chicken.
---
World drop epic boe weapon but you aren't min maxing? 
---
I could see it turn out this way: The gates open on a planed schedule and until that happens you can turn in as much as you want.
---
They very obviously worked on it for a long time before they announced it. First they had to put in enough work to even determine if this project is *doable*. Secondly, no, it doesn't change my thoughts at all, since Blizzcon showed us how much progress they've made (or more specifically, *haven't* made). 
---
Of course, nobody knows how far the people at the top end are going to go. But they can definitely make a huge dent in the progress. especially if they focus on the harder to farm stuff like purple lotus (among other things).
---
Or 100 zebra hooves. rip. 
---
You're funny \^\^.
---
I didn't say you couldn't. I just wanted to see the argument. I mean you lose alot of your threat production talents if you're protection. Lower level stuff and probably most dungeons, whatever, go ahead. Raid tanking... not so much.
---
Meh Classic List:
---
Warrior- Defensive Stance (just before he dies)
---
Paladin- Bubble Hearth (Oops! Out of BG)
---
Hunter- Feign Death (Doh! Misclick)
---
Rogue- Sap (Really, you sapped me three times in a row!?)
---
Priest- Mind Control &lt;/3
---
Shaman- Windfury &lt;3
---
Mage- Sheep (OFC!)
---
Warlock- Howl of Terror (Since removed!)
---
Druid- Casts Fishing Pole inside AV
---
&gt; Druids can't main tank because they take more damage on hard-hitting bosses that can crush them.
---
&gt; Posts a link to a fight where 90% of the MT's damage taken is magical.
---
Good job proving absolutely nothing.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmhVQLfSrUo
---
Then druid is pretty close to being viable MT.
---
Any instance where an attack can't crit or crush Ferals are good alternatives or offtanks.
---
However, Hateful Strike is an exception, because patchwerk just targets the player with the highest current HP and slaps those cheeks.  Because it can't crit or crush, ferals are amazing Hateful Strike sponges.
---
Vael is also an exception, as long as the druid can't get one shot.  Heals are essentially limitless and its a DPS race. Ferals generate more threat so it just happens to work here too.
---
Where a boss's main attack is spells (which a druids lack of +defense or block irrelevant) they work out fine.
---
That however is far and few between. Druids are good conditional offtanks and can tank a very spefiic and limited number of bosses.
---
This isn't TBC where paladins and Bears have the gear and game mechanics in their favor.  Deal with it.
---
--A feral drood from Vanilla.

I adore wow music but I don't know if certain halo soundtracks can be beaten for the GOAT
---
I need to know so that I can plan my vacation days lmao
---
I remember playing back then and being sort of disappointed any time someone tried me to join a 10 man Scholo. Felt like a bit of a challenge with 5 but way too easy with 10. I was even kind of annoyed when they nerfed the trash in there.
---
If you would continue commenting random stuff with nothing to back it up, I gladly will. Never have I met anyone with so much knowledge about the game like you have.
---
Really dislike this. It will starve the game of content for some — I’m not sure who this is designed for. 
---
Pvp players have to wait 4-6 months for BGs? PvE players have to wait 6-9 months for a new raid? And then another 4-6 for the next raid? It’s way too gated. If anything, I’d prefer less than four content releases than more. Let people consume Classic at the pace they want with the content they want.
---
yeah I mean I only rly know one off the top of my head, but I know lots of ppl would always be spamming world chats for rugged/thick leathers cod anytime at a specific price. I’ll pm u the one I used when I was afking. I figure u may take tailoring as a warlock 
---
I really love the vanilla WoW music, but the FF14 soundtrack will forever be #1 for me. There's just so much good music in there. From slower, more emotional stuff to straight up rock/metal. [So damn amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lRjJ72dABg)    
---
Agree to disagree then. I don't view it as scummy because it is something the players are allowed to do as a consequence of the game's design (whether intentional or not). I might agree it's poor design but I don't begrudge anyone for playing the game in a way that the design allows. But, I understand where you are coming from.
---
So that's why thunder fury is a hunter weapon.
---
It's a loaded question. While leveling, the quality of your weapons and weapon skill are a bigger factor than anything else. Generally, a good slow two-handed is best because of overpower and whirlwind. But if you have a pair of blue weapons 8 ilvls above your two hander, they would certainly do more dps... If your weapon skill with them is close to Max. It takes a long time to raise weapon skill from nothing, so for a borderline upgrade it might not even be worth the effort to switch.
---
When dw starts to pull ahead, it's only better for single target dps. It's still better to use a slow two-handed for aoe damage with whirlwind and cleave. 
---
Last time I played I leveled as dw from around 40 on, but I still kept a 2 hander in inventory to swap for whirlwind. Dw seemed slightly better single target dps, but it was also expensive because I had to upgrade my weapons often. Thrash blade was amazing, because as a free quest reward it remained a bis weapon for a long time.
---
RuneScape soundtrack for me
---
Warlocks have no built in speed boost or gap closer. Once you're snared as one, dropping the snare is not all that useful.
---
&gt; You also won't have to deal with paladins which is about the biggest blessing you could get.
---
Only due to seduce/fear dispel (And WoTF + Tremor totem do just that). Your dots getting dispelled aren't a huge deal. Also, a paladin with Curse of Tongues on them is really funny in PvP.
---
Paladins in PvP are really, really good against classes that are destroyed by Blessing of Freedom and Blessing of Protection (Mages, Rogues, Warriors, Hunters). Fear dispel is less of a factor, when Horde has tremor and WotF.
---
Also, Grounding totem and purge is a huge pain in the ass. Getting your voidwalker sac bubble purged is horrific. Getting your death coil/spell lock grounded is maddening.
---
It’s most likely going to be like it was for the demo, an option on the launcher where you usually choose between the main game and ptr 
---
I love ironforge.
---
Hm, either the original trailer music or Elwynn Forest theme. Hard to pick a favorite, because it may very well be the greatest game score the world has heard.
---
Hell no, thats like a month's worth of content after you hit 60. So 5-8 months of raid logging.
---
Breaks down to what defines scummy behavior.
---
I define it as an action that benefits me at others expence
---
Don't think it is the greatest. I personally love command and conquer 2 red alert, hell March. Going to listen to that when I go molten core. Hehe
---
One of the best I have ever heard is my newest game divinity 2. My God this soundtrack is so good.
---
My fav for nostalgia is orc starting zone though. 
---
Perhaps man. I'm not entirely sure as I haven't been exposed to too much vanilla.
---
I'm hoping there's a beta beforehand. If so, that would be a good time for you to check out the different classes and have a better idea of what you want to play.
---
I've always wondered how much armour a fully BiS bear tank would have with all possible buffs and both 25% buffs from Priest Inspiration and Shaman Ancestral Healing.
---
&gt;Thing is, even this isn't necessarily true.
---
I agree. I just wanted to point out that many cases of world pvp involve a player(s) disrupting the activity of another player(s), and that this disruption might lessen their enjoyment of the game due to that disruption. Just the nature of the beast.
---
It's still the best to grind as a warrior but i guess you actually need to pay attention while playing, it's not for everyone.
---
I honestly dont care about DM but i really think ZG needs its own patch.
---
In about 3 weeks its fairly reasonable for a new guild to clear MC. Nef, within 3 weeks after that. As long as you get decent drops in MC, your "gear average" should be something like half T1 by the time you down Nef.
---
AQ40 is pretty big jump from BWL though in terms of gear. I would say its advisable to have 3/4 T2 before Twin emps becomes manageable. Thats a pretty huge gear gap if you jump in straight from your first Nef kill.
---
Thats why i think a ZG patch would be so important, it gives more gear and more time to catchup for AQ40. Its not a big deal for hardcore guilds, but for average and casual guilds this will make an enormous difference. New guilds will also struggle to catchup if AQ releases too quickly.
---
Aside from rage generation, I don't think it's very good for mana efficiency either. You wont regen any mana for 5 seconds after you cast it, so you're not only losing the mana cost of PW:Shield, but you're also losing 5 seconds of mana regen too.
---
Instead, it seems better to just do nothing at the start of a pull, so that your mana can keep regenerating for as long as possible. 
---
Better go mining or ull ruin yourself with engineering mats
---
Depends on the group and instance. If the mobs live long enough, agony, corruption, immolate, wand in that order until dead. You can dot up other targets if you have a good tank but I'd just throw agony on them and go back to the main target.
---
Agony has the best damage per cast and the best damage per Mana at most ranks.
---
However, if the group is effecient enough that mobs die before your first finish, leave off agony. Still dying too fast? Just cast immolate and wand.
---
Chrono Cross - Scars Of Time &lt;3

I think only a tiny minority of players will be genuinely starved of content with this schedule - it’s already considerably more compressed than Vanilla was. Let those players roll alts or take a break and play retail for a bit. We won’t get to experience Classic like this again and shouldn’t be rushing it imo.
---
Go back to retail. Don't need this rush rush rush mentality in classic. That attitude is going to bring in level 40 level boosts and shit
---
This-    
---
I've heard it said and I agree that "Some changes is No Changes, and NoChanges is some changes".     
---
This post highlights that truth. 
---
I am pretty sure you are kidding with the specs. However if you are at all serious. I recommend a single better GPU rather than cards in SLI
---
I'm not calling you an asshole for playing the game. I'm calling you an asshole because you're an asshole. Yes, the game allows for you to be one. No, it wasn't designed with high leveled characters stopping lower level characters from playing by griefing them as a core concept. The pvp part was imagined to be faction against faction in even combat. Stomping low level players is just something that's possible, not something that was meant to be a central part of the game.
---
People at metal shows are not being assholes. If they used their size to block a kid from seeing the band and covering his eyes, making him unable to enjoy the show until the bully stops, he leaves and forfeits his chance to see the band, or find a bigger group of bullies to kick the first ones ass - then that guy would be an asshole. Just like you are when you gank lowbies.
---
I think it's amazing that you feel you are the good guy here by engaging someone in an encounter they can't win, and where the only benefit you gain from it is getting to feel joy by ruining it for someone else.
---
But again, I'm not saying you aren't allowed to. A big part of what makes Eve Online interesting is people being assholes to each other. But at least Eve Online players can admit to them being assholes and owning up to it.
---
You're just saying "what, it's possible to be a bully in the game so you can't call me an asshole when I bully people". Yes, I can, because you are. I've done it too. The only difference between you and me is that I recognize that me killing a gray player is a dick move and that I'm acting like an asshole. It's fun go be an asshole sometimes. It's fine to be an asshole sometimes. But it's silly of you to think that you aren't being one. 
---
FFX original and piano soundtrack. Soo good. 
---
Most people weren’t playing hardcore day 1. The percentage of players who were 60 before DM is minuscule. WoW ramped up over the first two years, gaining millions of subscriptions. By the time most people were playing and raiding, all of this stuff was available. It seems artificial to gate it, not historical.
---
True, but you can't ignore the context in which the behavior takes place. Not to get to RP-ish but If you view the opposing as enemies that you are at war with, then the normal rules of fighting fair don't really apply. Do armies not attack when their enemy is weakest? Wait for them to be full strength? No, and they aren't scummy for doing so. That is the context in which I view PvP servers for the most part.
---
My gear sucks, don’t have any +hit, and I’m bad and don’t care. World PvP is fun though = not min/maxer. I literally just DW bc I got the flurry axe 
---
Obviously you can find someone who is bad enough to lose to anyone lol I'm not sure what that proves. If skill level is even a little bit close, lvl&gt;gear&gt;class&gt;skill. You can have the best warrior/rogue in the world against a bis average skilled sl warlock and the lock will win every time.
---
I mean I can find multiboxers who are bad enough to be 1v5'd. 
---
"Warlocks have no built in speed boost or gap closer. Once you're snared as one, dropping the snare is not all that useful." You could just as easily say by patch 1.12.1 a good warlock rolls a rogue like beating on a kid. Racials in general are far more superfluous then people pretend.
---
As far as your second point. If you are saying shamans are worse to play against then paladins. Well then your point is preposterous and you need more experience. Not saying Shamans can't do anything but every class can do something. Shamans have nothing of significance. If tremor totem or grounding totem are heavily hurting your warlock play. You are doing it wrong. You have a billion spells to feed that grounder and Tremor totem has a 20 yard range with a 3 second pulse delay. It works about 7% of the time. 
---
I’d love for someone to breakdown the effect of 16 debuffs in a real way. It seems completely absurd to me that people think the extra debuff slots are going to have a noticeable impact on anything.

He does hour long videos of Zone music + Ambient sounds from that zone, it's fucking amazing to just put on in the background and chill.

You said product of the year, not planned release of the year. Pretty important divergence. Product of the year includes all active IPs. Planned releases only includes future unreleased products. Are you going to change your mind or stick with product of year? 
---
The advertising industry completely agrees with me and takes advantage of both points I made lol. They know hype is just hype and doesn’t mean your product is good. They know hype doesn’t see reality and is often clouded. They then take advantage of this very irrational human tendency in order to sell you a product. The literal entire job of that market is to take advantage of how stupid people are with hype and sell you products using hype instead of quality as a selling point....
---
What did BFA do? WERE GOING BACK TK THE FACTION WAR!!!!  They generated massive hype from this assertion and took advantage of irrational mobish emotions to sell you a substandard product....almost like how I said they do. Wierd. 
---
Usually you wouldn't 2 hand tank in defensive stance, except for single target fights. Berserker stance, berserker rage, spam whirlwind and cleave, intercept any mob that peels away. By using zerk stance you produce a lot less threat per damage, but you take a lot more damage which feeds you rage and lets you spam abilities nonstop. Done correctly the excess damage is more than enough to compensate for the reduced threat multiplier of the stance. But since you are taking a lot more damage you need a real healer for this, and for certain types of mobs or bosses you might have to just strap a shield on.
---
I'll argue in defense of 2h tanking while leveling:
---
While leveling a warrior often has a very up to date rare 2h weapon but only a green 1hander and shield. Also it's very likely that their weapon skill with the one hander will be much lower, possibly even needing to start from 1 and level during the dungeon. By swapping to shield they take a bit less damage but lose huge amounts of DPS and TPS.
---
MC is one month of content? That’s great that you reckon you can rep up and get your quints in one lockout, then full clear it for three more and be fully geared..  but like the other 99% of the population won’t. 
---
If you’re in a rush, if you demand hard core raiding, this is not going to be the game for you.
---
LMAO!
---
Get the F out of here with this crap of a video. 
---
Again, i dont mind people doing it, and in a sense it is not wrong to do it. But in the end its a game and not real life, so not as much ay stake.
---
Russian burned all of their crops and farms when they were chased by the enemy into theit territory, making them starve and freeze. Effective af and legal to do? yes, scummy? yes, per the definition i set
---
??? This isn't a rush rush rush mentality, this is the truth. You people seriously overestimate the difficulty of pre-raid and MC. They're a joke, you can do it all before you even hit 60 lmao. BWL and on definitely present their own challenges but get out if you think me saying MC is a faceroll is a "retail mentality"
---
It is a council that is staffed with all the R12 players who agree to not one up each other mindlessly and instead have a vote on who gets to rank up next. R13 is therefore granted not earned.

It’s 4-6 months in - with so many people crying out for BGs and the rank 14 grind I don’t think they could delay it any more.

There were 2 flails in legion. they were pretty cool.
---
If you don't get a funny feeling inside your soul when you hear the music from whatever was your first/favourite starting zone, well. You're basically dead. And no not forsaken, like actually dead. And clearly if you're one of these people and reading this then ghosts know how to use Reddit and you haven't realised that you'd died yet.
---
Raiding will be easy anyway so let’s make it as easy as possible. 
---
Rank system will be available from start. 
---
classic wow's soundtrack was the best because i turned the music off and listened to the bands that shaped my musical tastes because i was 16 at the time.
---
also i really like the inn music and the music that played in magmadars cavern

* Warlocks are always the more rare class, they're also more complicated to play. So a Great Warlock and a Bad Warlock are completely different species. And Geared Warlock and Green Warlock are like night and day. Goes from being an easy kill to a raid boss. Besides Hunter, the fastest leveler due to low downtime, and one of the best for grinding gold due to being a pet class.
---
* Portals and Food/Water is super useful, and Mage CC is the best in the game. Not only Poly, which lasts forever, but Snares - and not just Snares but AOE snares... and an AOE ROOT! Incredibly powerful. This all leads into what we all know about how great Mages are at AOE leveling and AOE gold grinding. Oh and a long-range Interrupt!
---
As someone who has played a Mage for hundreds of days/played I am pretty biased. One huge thing I dislike about Mages is how once you're OOM and out of Evocation/Gems/Potions you're screwed. But I only really noticed this in prolonged PvP fights where I end up wanding a flag carrier and hoping someone kills me so I can get a fresh bar of mana. With Warlocks at least they can go forever if they have the ability to regain health. TBH I rerolled a Warrior after seeing Arenas in TBC for exactly this mana complaint.
---
Rip. Sounds like it would be nice to people who really really give a shit about it. So this whole rank thing is like on a bell curve? Only x amount of people get to rank 14, and x amount get to rank 13... etc? It’s not just like overall amount of honor?
---
Not much more than a Warrior. Are you stupid, or what?
---
The DR from Armor of a Warrior tank exceeds 65%. A druid DR from armor in Classic MIGHT reach 70%. I am sorry, but that less than 5% DR from armor doesn't even matter, when the Warrior is UNCRITABLE, UNCRUSHABLE, BLOCKS more  damage than the 5% DR difference from armor, can PARRY hits, can use pots (including armor ones), Shield Wall, Last Stand, Living Gem...
---
Druid's bigger HP pool and marginally better DR from armor is IRRELEVANT.
---
Shield Block ALONE negates Druid's HP pool and armor DR marginal advantages.
---
I wish they would have BGs available on launch but add the ranking system in stage 2.
---
I never said it was difficult. Why do we need to burn through this game in 6 months? We've waited 13 years. If youre just here to raid youre not gonna have fun. 
---
He drops to 1% because the rogues/warriors slacked and didn't interrupt the frostbolt that almost one shot a tank, warrior or not (13K magic damage).
---

Yeah. The news was, "We're working on it."

The Persona and Xenoblade Chonicles series exist, so nah.

---
Almost Bis fully buffed bear with inspiration.
---
Bis druid unbuffed should be around 15k or 16k armor i think
---
with 8 debuf slots there's no rogue poison dots, serpent stings, corruptions, curse of agony's, no shadow priests at all, and I'm probably missing alot of other dps sources that are completely left out before AQ when they added the 16 slots.  You don't think adding all of those dps sources won't change anything?
---
Lets just keep the difficulty as-is and not worry about trivalizing trivial content. 
---
Did I stutter? I RAN OUT OF RFC GUIDES TO WATCH
---
It's true. There's a guide for everything in vanilla now. That's what happens when content creators have no content to spare.
---
That’s why it’s so enticing. Cruising through dungeons, gearing up nicely and leveling *while* being picky with our dps is a golden comfort. 
---
One of the issues that pop in my mind is that will I like it once I hit 60? I don’t mind tanking when it comes to PvE, but I would rather focus on PvP. I just don’t know what to expect as a warrior with pocket heals in bgs and WPvP. Am I a flag runner due to my armor and defense? A monstrous killer? A holder of mid?
---
Is a 2H flail even a thing?
---
Let's hope so.
---
If for no other reason than to piss off the try hards.
---
The people who get to 60 in two weeks and kill Ragnaros the week after are not who the schedule should be designed for. 
---
Yes, they’re going to whine on the forums for more raids but they need ignored and fuck off back to retail. These are the same people that ruined that game over the years with their obsessive min-maxing. Everyone needs to chill and take their time imo. 
---
That said, I would be amenable to moving BWL forward a stage to come out at the same time as Battlegrounds.
---
&gt; You can even bring rets and ferals
---
I laughed
---
There might have been a couple of guys working in the early stages, but maybe nothing solid that they could officially discuss or announce.
---
The only time to shield a warrior is when you have to move out of a mechanic like fire and need a quick instant heal on the tank. 
---
This is true but if you rush to 60 On fresh and plan on ranking immediately then you just go straight to bgs and say fuck farming anything to ensure ur getting full rank points from the first honor week. 
---
Yes it is relative to the players who rank for honor. Not an absolute value required. A shitty system but that is the way it is. 
---
With a pocket healer, I think you'd definitely end up in the "monstrous killer" category.  To my knowledge, Druids were flag runners with mages/healers peeling for them.  Rogues defended points of interest.  Hunters played midfield.  Pocketed Warriors just... killed.
---
Ultimately the cool thing about Classic becomes evident right now...
---
&gt; will I like it once I hit 60?
---
Maybe, maybe not!  But the game won't be going anywhere, you should have time to try out different classes.
---
You don't need much space at all, but I agree it is at least tougher to manage your body aggro while running around.  
---
I've effectively 'swing kited' orange mobs to do a run into a camp to kill the  named boss.  I only cleared a narrow corridor and would just strafe along the corridor.  Used hamstring and warstomp for runners, it worked no prob.  Plus you always have the escape route if you need to- nothing beats hamstring-&gt; warstomp-&gt; RUNNNN if you know a fight is going bad. 
---
But those people are going to clear MC regardless of DM, so who cares? Everyone else, who takes 3+ months to 60, why gate DM? What is gained? You prevent locks and paladins from getting their mounts and you take an option off the table for those that want to run it. It will be months after MC is cleared regardless. The casual players getting a few pieces of DM gear is meaningless and the tribute buffs are meaningless for a progression casual guild because those buffs don’t persist through death.
---
It's up to the Shaman to speak up, but if he wanted it, it's not like he could equip it immediately - so deference would go to the tank. But it sounded like the tank was cool with it.
---
Heroes of Might and Magic II is number one in my heart.
---
What if once the event started, every required mat that dropped worldwide changed to Qiraji Wool Cloth, Qiraji Iron Ore, etc.  And you could only turn in Qiraji mats for the war effort, meaning only items that dropped after it began.  And then each profession could be given the ability to turn Qiraji mats into regular ones to be used in regular crafts.
---
Doesn't have to be named Qiraji, could be something else.  But it seems the minimally upsetting way to solve this problem, to me at least.
---
My god those were fantastic
---
Its FUN for maybe a month. After that it gets pretty monotonous.
---
Last server I was on we delayed turning stuff in so we could have more scarab lords
---
I'm in the same boat, night elf hunter for me (what else would I have made as my first character?). Darnassus blew me away. The very next day my buddy who was already level 35 or so escorted me to Ironforge then Stormwind and I'll never forget that run through the wetlands and finally up to the gates of Ironforge. 
---
I forgot about rooftop camping on Darkshire killing all the NPC's
---
Now I really can't wait for Classic.
---
I just did the math, and with 9 alts and 16 slots in every bag and bank slot, you could have 36,000 of any item (1,800 stacks). If a 40 man guild did this, then that would be a total of 1,440,000 items.
---
For a Horde guild, this would complete the war effort and still have enough room for 32,000 more items.
---
For an Alliance guild, they would still be 1,002,000 items short due to the sheer amount of linen and silk bandages needed.
---
Now this is an unreasonable feat for a single guild to do. However, it's not uncommon for the race to be completed really quickly on a private server as when an entire faction stockpiles. 
---
Can't really farm herbs though.  His point was that you can get the mats &amp; make the consumables if you go herb/alch (though he didn't mention alch, he did mention farming mats).
---
Thank-you. Damn, I was hoping there was something available at a lower level than that.
---
But they don't want to, and only big stupid meanie heads attack other players.
---
We burn through it because its not a challenge. You dont have to be a super no life tryhard to clear up to Majordomo your first week, you just a 40 man group that isnt braindead.
---
I almost always played clothies, but don’t Warrior tanks need BS to forge Thunderfury? Is the idea for them to go BS and Eng and use an alt to mine ore?
---
That sounds badass, this is good to know thanks!
---
I too love making up strawmans as the reason why pvp servers = bad.
---
*That’s* what I was wondering. I know for sure he will stick to spriest until 60 and I’m concerned with him and I leveling together and we have a notion to cause a bit of WPvP mayhem but we find out he quickly is drained from mana and I’m a war without bonafide heals. 
---
I feel as if the war and priest combo has more benefits for PvE than WPvP, pre 60. 
---
On the other hand, an orc rogue + spriest = fart squad. We kill ‘em and fart on ‘em. Plus I feel as if there will be some leverage when it comes to party making if I hang on the coat tails of my lolinviteroguefriend if you want heals brotha. 
---
It is obvious a paladin should be MTing Patchwerk
---
Horde mages can set their hearth to Badlands and just portal back to a main city. Getting to blackrock mountain is a giant pain for horde. Also if you want to semi afk as a horde mage just hearth to Badlands and sell portals. You make a decent amount of gold while being semi afk.
---
Yep I wish more people understood this.  It's why a common "ALL NEED" comes into chat when a boe epic or valuable BOE rare drops.  
---
The best way to do it is have people you know will be good officers and start with them.
---
If you want to start a raid guild yourself, its a long road. Having been a founding officer of a raiding guild, you need to start as early as possible. At the very least, before you even announce that youre a guild thats planning on raiding, you need to find at least 2-3 people you want to be officers. The best way to do that is just start a guild, spam random people for signing your charter if you have to. 
---
When you start, its much easier if your leveling, because the main thing random people want is to be able to get easier groups. When low level theres going to be people that have no idea what theyre doing so theyll just kind of pad out your numbers, which will attract more people.
---
If youre already level 60 its a bit harder or a longer wait. You can still make a leveling guild but youre going to be waiting for everyone to hit 60. Or you can recruit 50+ only, but again, its really about numbers and at that point youve filtered out an enormous portion of the player base.
---
Once youve started your fledgeling guild the main key is be social. Get a TS/vent/discord. This will really help build your core, youll start getting people that specifically want to play with eachother and not people that just want faster PuGs. Youll want to group with people as much as possible and see that theyre committed and decent at the game. Find a few decent officers who say thy have the same commitment to making your leveling guild into a raid guild.
---
Schedule some guild dungeon nights once you have 10+ 60s, gets people used to a schedule and gets people to talk to eachother. Gradually increase your level requirements until its 58+.
---
If ZG is released, start with that as soon as you have 20 people that can make a raid time. If your guild isnt raiding, those non core people who never talk in vent are going to find another guild real quick. Once you have 30+ do MC, pug some people if you have to, again progression is vital for member turnover.
---
As for your questions; yes PuG anyone willing to join at first, its a numbers game at first. If it turns out they have tourrettes, kick them, if its obvious to you, its obvious to everyone else and theyll understand. Like i said earlier, you have to be social to find out who to trust and build your guild with, the only way to do that is to play and talk with them.
---
Depends what you mean by guild meeting, every raid is a guild meeting so if you have anything to say just schedule it at the start or end. Officer meetings will happen as needed, when you first start raiding, theres a loooooot of wrinkles to iron out, theres probably going to be one after every raid for the first few months, after that, weekly, though sometimes theres not much to say if things are going smoothly.
---
In my experience guild events have always been unpopular,even dungeon nights. People barely show up to those because, if theyre in a future PvE raid guild, they still want gear, but a lot of people will just do it on their own time and not show up. BG nights are good, but it depends on whose interested in your guild, really hit or miss. World stuff is generally unpopular, theres no actual reward for it so people just dont want to bother.
---
if tank can hold aggro with pw:s its good on u if u save mana
---
but only do this if u need to save mana
---
more rage = more dmg
---
if warr is suboptimal then the extra rage he get from not having pw:s might not be put to use, in those situations popping pw:s as u noted to save mana is a good idea, (as long as he hold aggro)
---
You have a lot of dps options, so you'll need to mix them up based on the group composition, mobs, etc.
---
IDEALLY you'd be dropping a full set of dots on everybody and those dots would run their course. In reality, that doesn't happen since the single target dpsers will be dropping mobs fast. The good news is, you don't need full dot duration to get value, since dot efficiency is so good and shadow bolt is such shit. In a way, warlocks are really AoE dpsers, since you max your damage by having dots ticking on every single mob.
---
First figure out what you want to do with the primary mob. Here I'll usually just go immolate since the dot duration is shortest and you'll get upfront value with the initial cast. If the group is melee heavy or the mob is a runner toss out a CoR here as well, if not don't bother with agony on the tanks primary, or maybe even secondary target. Then move on to the rest of the mobs. At least give each of them corruption, it's not hard to get value out of them. If they are living long enough agony is good here as well. If you're worried about runners, skip agony all together and just make sure you apply CoR as the main kill target changes. Avoid immolate on the off mobs since there's a possibility the initial burst will pull agro.
---
Save Shadow Bolt spam for high priority targets, for example a mob that heals or an aggressive caster. Also sometimes there are large pulls where it's more important to get the fight under control, for example the large orc pulls in RFC around the Demon bosses platform. Here the smart move is just mashing shadow bolt on the primary target to cut down the incoming damage to the tank as fast as possible.
---
Be aware of the biggest monkey wrench in this plan: shitty tanks. A good tank should be building more then enough threat on every mob with the occasional sunder or revenge to overcome your corruption and agonies, but you'll pull off of shit tanks easily. In this case just shadow bolt and maybe immolate the primary targets one at a time and enjoy being a sub-par mage.
---
Awesome! Elixir of Giant Growth, should be perfect thanks!
---
That's what tends to happen when your MT is sitting at 37 frost resistance.

The WoW soundtrack has some classics but it's not on my list of the greatest soundtracks of all time. While the ambient like OST of Classic has created some memories it lacked on themes for specific moments or places. Most tracks were also rather short and meant not to be played in a loop. While raiding in Classic I often listened to other game soundtracks to give the places an unique feel (e.g. "Fire Temple" from Zelda: Ocarina of Time @ Molten Core or "Streets of Rain" from Silver @ Blackwing Lair).
---
Later Burning Crusade did it a bit better (Matt Uelmen's tracks in Auchindoun \*\_\*). Funny enough as much WoD was a disaster regarding game design its OST is my favorite among all WoW soundtracks.
---
You can get 70% DR as a druid with MC bis. (well against boss its less, but you can still get armor capped meanwhile warrior are still far).  The difference will be much bigger until naxx is on farm and the war get full bis gear from here (mainly because druids only get 4 smalls upgrade in naxx)
---
Also going fro 65% to 70% is actually about 14% damage reduction  : If a boss hit for 10k for example, if he hit someone with 65% dr it's 3k5 damage taken, if he hit someone else with 70% dr it's 3k damage taken : 3k5 to 3k is 14%
---
Also, except on a few boss that can be hard for druid, tank survivability isnt the issue anymore for non casual guild, threat is.  That's why on most boss you either use a feral or a dual wielding fury war. 
---
ngl I got extremely frustrated with people on my server (before x-realm bg's) that would be afk or not fighting (actually doing stuff like capping the mine nodes and what not is ok) for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I felt like it was their lack of commitment/action that caused us to lose literally 99% of AV battles (I played Horde). Don't get me wrong, the bridge SUCKED and it made the game way longer than it should've been, way too good of a choke point, but losing all those matches made the rep grind so much longer for everyone that I almost didn't make it. 
---
Sorry, had to vent about that.

Lupos

Definitely had herods shoulder on my Hunter for too long

Darnassus is very special. It has this Warcraft III Vibe in it's Soundtrack.
---
Yeah that's generally how I've used it too. It's a good tool in your kit for those times when you just want to clear out some orange mobs, but I don't have the patience to keep it up for 60 levels.
---
You need to play a lot

The fate of the fury warrior. 
---
Frostmourne is a bit bigger but the imbalance is even worse on Barthilas, it's 95% Horde. If you completely added both realms 120 characters together you'd have around 52/48 to the alliance.
---
There are other specs that are viable. You're just talking about the wrong ones.
---
&gt;  Wrong. Where's proof of that? Blizzard hasn't released any information about them being separate clients. If you're basing this just off the demo being a separate client, blizzard always does that. 
---
Technically they run on different versions of the same engine. Classic is built on the 7.3.5 Legion engine, so Classic will need a 7.3.5 Client, which is called 1.13 by Blizzard since the Demo. Retail runs on the 8.x engine and therefore needs a 8.x client. Yes they have released information about this, read the Dev Watercooler and watch the Blizzcon Classic panel.
---
Depending on the context you can do all sorts of things with a Feral Druid. I MT'd Vaelastrasz with a Manual Crowd Pummeler after I had insane threat gear from BWL so we could kill him before a tank switch, but if you tried that during progression in a mediocre guild with only a bit of the patch 1.4 MC loot then you're going to have a bad time.
---
Progression is the bar tanks are measured to. If you can't solve progression you can't get to farm. When content is on farm you're just looking for speed, and that's where Ferals can really shine.
---
Agreed. Works as great music if you play d&amp;d as well
---
PvP happened on a PvP server. There is nothing preventing a 60 from joining in on the fun.

What's up YouTube, it's your boy Dissix coming at you again with another of my ever popular WoW Vanilla guides. *Cue 30 second intro with music 87% too loud* Ok so what I'm going to be showing you today (meanwhile he's opening his backpacks in Ironforge and walking around aimlessly) is a quick trick to get over this mountain pass. Personally I think this is a great little trick that's sure to save you countless hours during your play through. And before we get into it let me just say I know I've been slow to upload videos recently I've just been busy you know but that's going to change starting now, stay tuned for giveaways and you can catch my stream over on Twitch Thursdays and Saturdays. So let's get started so what you need to do is walk up to this hill over here and climb up oops I slipped over the edge that usually doesn't happen so you climb up this hill and walk over this boulder not this one here but this one right here and there you have it. Thanks for watching guys don't forget to smash that like button if you liked this video and be sure to leave a comment below of what you thought and if you think I should be doing more of these and what other content you'd like to see.
---
Blacksmithing- Armorsmithing gives some PVE BOP gear, mostly resist gear. BS-AS and Engineering combo on a tank is pretty awesome, but requires a farming alt or tons of gold.
---
Good questions.
---
1) When leveling you will constant have too many shards because you will cast drain soul (the soulstone gathering spell) on every mob you kill to trigger the spirit regeneration spell (cant remember the name). You'll actually want a macro to destroy the soulstone as soon as you get it to prevent you from having too many.
---
2) Soul bags pre 60 aren't really neccessary. When leveling I would typically just carry 10 or less shards. They really aren't near as important to have a lot of until 60. I wouldn't worry about Soul bags until then.
---
3) Pets while Leveling, you will almost assuredly use VW for pretty much everything while leveling. It's life/tankiness/aggro holding abilities are just too good. Succubus and felhound are both fantastic for different pvp situations though.
---
Warlock is a ton of fun and extremely versatile for all different aspects of the gain (raiding, farming, PVP.) They are a ton of fun and not near the upkeep costs of a lot of the other classes (I'll take 20 minutes of ss farming over a plate repair bill any day.)
---
&gt; You could just as easily say by patch 1.12.1 a good warlock rolls a rogue like beating on a kid. Racials in general are far more superfluous then people pretend.
---
*If you have gear*.
---
If you don't have gear (Which is the hardest time in a character's life), resisting that kidney shot can be the difference between getting shat on, and winning the fight.
---
TIL ganking = mass shootings and police brutality.
---
Critical Role got permission from Blizzard to use their music in CR's sessions. They just started using D2 music, and as soon as I heard that act 1 soundtrack I started smiling like an idiot.
---
I was going to say "extra weapon enchant slightly offset by the fact there are 2H enchants that are better versions of 1H"...but I think all the best melee enchants are 1H enchants.
---
Almost spit everything out on my keyboard
---
alliance = EZ mode PVE / Horde = Hard mode PVE        Something to think about 
---
We all had the WC staff.  It was an upgrade for none of us.
---
DM wasn’t available at launch. Releasing it on launch goes against everything Classic stands for yet people are for it. 
---
This is true to some extent.  But let's say you're level 35 and a really good 1H drops.  Now you have one good 1H and 13/175 weapon skill in it.
---
100 soldiers need 100 breastplates.

Think as long as you remember your name, guild and server then others might remember you and add you
---
[Awkward.](https://imgur.com/vimfKoe)
---
Doesn't make anything I've said more or less true. 
---
I'd like to see them turn the "gates opening event" into something replayable, so that all players in Classic can experience the event. 
---
Otherwise, you're pushing every player who wants to do the event into speed-leveling to keep up with the bleeding-edge players.
---
IDK how you do that (maybe it becomes a scenario once the gates are open on your server?), but it's something the team should consider.
---
No, no it is not.
---
I know this is a classicwow thread, but for the time being I decided to play a private BC server, as a warrior (I want to tank a warrior at 60 in classic because endgame tanking imo is something I haven't done and think it'll be fun.  
---
As far as warriors, I don't think much has changed from vanilla-bc for warriors as to the bare metal "warrior". Let me tell you one thing, holy cow leveling a warrior is tough as shit. It's one of the harder things i've done, and I leveled almost every toon in classic and BC except a warrior. But man, tanking is so fun because its such a challenge. Anything that I tank, I actually don't look for priests because of bubbling. I starve for rage a lot, and that shield is an aggro killer for me. If I end up with a priest I try to tell them multiple times no shield unless its a desperate thing, even though I think naturally priests put a shield up on everyone right away before everything like an instinct which happens. 
---
Metal Gear Solid(all of them), Ocarina of Time, Diablo 2, and WoW has the greatest soundtracks in my eyes.
---
[taking out bow] "You would die before your stroke fell!"
---
For WoW, the Barrens song is always with me. I still catch myself humming that from time to time, after years of not playing wow.
---
Must say Divinity Original Sin 1 &amp; 2 are absolutely phenomenal and are my favourite go-to soundtracks.
---
Putting a ludicrous amount of gold in a trade window of a gold beggar and then just do.... nothing. Until they give up.
---
Melee benefits from FR on several fights in MC during progression, but it's not strictly necessary so long as they use GFPP. Ranged DPS and healers need no FR in MC and only GFPP for Rag (two per attempt).
---
Only soakers need NR on Huhu, but for alliance everyone needs NR for progression viscidious or the healers will run OOM.
---
:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
---
Just set the item as a different version.  
---
After the patch all cloth dropped is a new version of the same thing. Just make one white and the other grey.  
---
EG: Only cloth dropped after the patch will be eligible for turn in.  
---
Any other uses for cloth work the same and accept both.
---
I didn't know about this. I have a lot of catching up to do.
---
Far from the Greatest Soundtrack, but definitely a good one.
---
Nothing's preventing them fro getting a mount the old-fashioned way. 
---
Why is rank14 weapon not good for casters? 
---
Because nef staff? 
---
Man, I haven't played WoW in 8 years, and this is the kind of abbreviation/alphabet-soup sort of response my life has really been missing.

Guilty gear gotta be up there too

Guild bank = drama. I agree gbank alts are a pain in the ass, but they're part of makes vanilla stand out.

\#nochanges
---
It trivializes other content.
---
Any night elven zone. Just love those spiritish songs! 
---
IMHO WoW's soundtrack only really gains a profile in BC and Wrath, where each zone, and even subzone and raid, gets its own theme. In vanilla, music is shared between zones and it's more like ambient noise, whereas in the expansions we have very memorable tunes like in the Black Temple, Ulduar, Karazhan, or the Howling Fjord. I also like most of retail's music. WoW has an extremely talented team of composers. Most of them have been at this game for 15 years and they never get samey, unless it's called for.
---
There is an undeniable shift in style though. Vanilla and BC are all more background-ish while in Wrath it gets more brash and flashy.
---
Whenever you look up “best soundtracks”, they are all from games that were super popular and everyone loved. As is the case for WoW, I think the soundtrack is good, but it’s the game that makes it so enjoyable.
---
Remember that failed EA game, SIM CITY? Nobody knows it because most people didn’t play it, but it has, in my opinion, one of the greatest soundtracks of all time: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5GCoc893Vt8
---
Not bs but mining to smelt elementium.
---
Source: made thunderfury myself. 
---
Can FR be used in order to avoid using GFPP? 
---
Right as allies don't have NR totem. Do you know how much NR everyone should shoot for? Or just as much as they can? lol
---
Thanks for the info so far!
---
People regularly down Rags the second week on private server launches, expect *-actual classic-* to be taken much more seriously than the nth private server lunch. I could see it being downed launch week if it is available (I could also see it being gated till the 3rd week)
---
FYI this link goes directly to EU and skips the NA option --
---
here is the real link where you can pick both and see the real full results. my server was missing like 90% of the entries when I used the link in OP without realizing it was already eu-filtered
---
https://vanillafriends.com/find-friends
---
Classic =/= Vanilla
---
Next time don’t be a pussy and respond to me. Did you actually play the Demo? Do you see how the client was launched? They said this wasn’t going to change. Which is literally what I said. The second half of my statement was obvious speculation(regarding why there’s not a forum section)
---
Ah ok, so mining and eng for warrs works then.
---
Because someone came in late, that doesn't mean it's the right way. To people in China delaying BWL isn't Blizzlike, it's the same argument.
---
Oops thx forgot to change it. Fixed it now :)
---
It came out a few months after launch, yes. It was available for launch for Europe. I dont think European guilds has a terrible experience because of that. 
---
It wasn’t available in Europe at launch. Now you’re just making nonsense up so you can seem right because you want DM at launch so it can ruin Classic.  
---

I don't like this, then it becomes a daily and if you miss a day you are behind, you can just farm all day saturday if that's your thing, now you have to farm every day or you're behind.
---
Nice
---
Awesome thanks!! The only reason I noticed was because I was trying to check my old server again and I was like hey what the heck there are less people now!!
---
But thats another good tip for anyone else -- check both eu and NA in case someone misclicked their region! You might find new people listed
---
I know most people here don't like him but the stages of release Alexsensual laid out in a video I thought were very well done.
---
PW:S is the "holy shit, keep HP exactly where it is while I cast this big heal"
---
If a tank might die in the 2.5 seconds it takes for a big heal, a bubble will give you that 2.5 seconds.
---
Anything between 200 and 250 NR I Buffet. Cap is 315. 
---
Dps and healers don’t need FR for MC. You lose too much dps if you wear FR gear. 
---
So with practice and utilizing my abilities I can stand a chance?
---
Watching Classicast just makes me want to play so much more! AAAAAAH cant wait!
---
I guess you realized how dumb everything you said was.
---
Now you're acting like a 12year old with the last comment to feel awesome? Or the I made him stop commenting I'm so awesome?

WAy back when, on my 56k dial-up modem, I downloaded the Night Elf/Ashenvale/Darnassus forest music as a preview thing off the official warcraft site (might've been for Warcraft 3, but the music, as I recall, was similar/same)  I still remember the chills that came over me when the download finished and I started listening to it. :)
---
No idea why it's got a EU flag on it not but it goes to the correct page at least
---
Arms is fine too. How expensive is engineering for pvp and free action pots?
---
No reason to use FR and gimp yourself while you can use GFPPs and kill the boss much faster. Faster kills = less room for error+less pressure on the healers' mana.
---
The thing on Viscidus is because of totems but not NR totem. Horde gets Poison Cleansing totem, which dispels the poison from every single member in the shamans' group. Alliance need to manually dispel every affected member with pallies/druids and take a lot more damage because of this.
---
Because of the nature of the fight (amount of frost hits--&gt;amount of melee hits--&gt;heavy AoE), only your tank and healers need to have decent enough gear to tank/heal the raid. Everyone else is spamming frost attacks/spamming melee attacks/using sappers/AoE. This means that everyone else can wear full/partial NR gear, and more NR means less issues for the healers.
---
Note: I have only killed Viscidus on horde side, someone might correct me but this should be pretty decent.
---
My apologies, I was thinking it came out in Patch 1.2, DM came out came out in patch 1.3, one month after the European launch of the game. 
---
I still don't see how DM matters in the long run when you already have the raid frames, the 1.12 talents and balance, and I'm assuming 1.12 itemization.
---
Yes, if your main goal is to min-max only your character there are other professions and best is dependant of class, but end game PvE is a team effort.
---
And in that end Alchemy beats everything. Even if you have another high lvl alchemist in the guild, a 2nd alchemist is more than welcome since it means more potions.
---
As for “having Alchemy on a lvl 1 alt with money” i honestly doubt most people will be able to do that; since it requires the most valuable resource of all, time. To grind gold, to farm mats etc.
---
Grinding gold in vanilla is not an easy task; no matter what *some* people say.
---
This is what I came to say. Have the mats gathering be a one time thing, but then have the gates reopen every 3 months or so, so everyone can experience it. The entire point of rolling out classic again is so that we can experience things again. Why limit it to only being experienced once?
---
I can at least tell you how a fresh server progression guild typically plays out (I've started in at least 3 that were organized prior to server launch):
---
1. Guild forms and the mad rush to level begins. 60 is priority. Pre-built guilds typically have a solid core of RL or hardcore members already known. These tend to push the leveling as the end game is their only concern.
---
2. Once the core group (built around the main raid classes, because they know what is needed) reaches 60, they start to form the core raid group. Most of the core guild is still leveling and some may even be close but not quite in pre-BIS range of all dungeons.
---
3. The core hardcore raiders will not wait for enough within their own guild to hit 60 so a guild only raid can be made. They will join up with the other hardcore raid guild 60s and created a functional raid group.
---
4. Raiding has now begun, but the bulk of the main guild is still trying to obtain pre-BIS and the core Raid core is too busy to assist with this as they already obtained enough pre-BIS. Some will still help of course, but a "second wave" of pre-BIS seekers must build their own dungeon support structure for the most part, just like the 1st wave did before hitting raiding.
---
5. The patience of the 1st wave raiders runs out. A core group joins with the other raid guild OR makes their raid core split so to form a new, hardcore, raid-centric guild.
---
6. The remaining members of the original leveling guild becomes a 2nd wave raid guild or just a leveling guild, if it even survives at all.
---
I have ALWAYS seen something close to this. If an original raid guild survives to become the front running raid guild, it is because they stripped enough 1st wave 60s from other guilds at the cost of those who leveled with them, but just not fast enough.
---
&gt;  just because you can't understand that difference doesn't make me self-absorbed.
---
Oh, it absolutely does. You apparently have some set of looting morals that you throw out the window as soon as it becomes sufficiently unprofitable for you. 
---
Because, in the end, you only care about the needs of other people in the group as long as you personally are not missing out on something. That makes you self-absorbed. 
---
Just accept who you are and move on.
---
Great info, thank you!
---
That makes sense, GRPP allows more dps, which is less time for the fight to drag on, which means less heals needed, etc etc.
---
Would https://classicdb.ch/?item=9030 help with Viscidus?
---
After you get alchemy to 300, get all the important recipes, join a guild with a raiding team, get a few people to help you with mats, grind 1000g for epic mount...
---
... yes, after all that, you can get alch/engi
---
Yeah those quilboar camps.. level 18-24 can be entirely killing those things if you are twisted enough
---
Alliance use elixir of poison resistance which has no cooldown. 
---
Not everyone needs NR. Just the same 15 soakers wears NR. The rest spam use elixir of poison resistance. 
---
Can't remember exactly how much Shadow Resist I had to stack for tanking Twin Emps on my Warlock, but it involved the entire Runed Stygian set (Tailoring recipes from turning in Twilight texts to the hermit in Silithus), a few blue &amp; green drops from Stratholme undead side, and the Eidolon Talisman BoE that drops off invisible ghosts in DM West.
---
Yes! I agree JSRF has to be mentioned. Hideki Naganuma, The Latch Bros, Scapegoat wax etc...
---
Because the gear and world buffs are far too strong. MC is somewhat challenging early on and having DM nullifies that challenge. Why do you think private servers never have DM at launch, because they’ve learned their lesson of the years. 
---
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING
---
Most of these fuckers started in wrath anyway lol
---
In itself it is not, but it is a retarded way to level and no one does that. Like front backstabbing. Good in theory, awful in practice. Apart from few rare situations.
---
I got you fam
---
https://youtu.be/RqZaFDA7PXY
---
Alliance can get a decent dispelling solution if paladins JoW the boss and then hit it with fast 1H weapon with SoR and fill every GCD with cleanse.
---
Always warms when my heart when they defend it with "I need the money."
---
That's why I always got a crap green/blue for every slot on my warlock :D gotta take in the cash.
---
What's even worse is that gap in time from when you pass on the loot to when they eventually equip it. Part of your brain screams "THAT DICKHOLE NINJA'D" the entire time.
---
&gt; Do you love the music of vanilla World of Warcraft? Is it the greatest gaming soundtrack of all time?
---
No, Guild Wars is.
---
You gimp your raid DPS if you use FR gear in MC. It can be useful as training wheels for a guild that has no clue what they're doing and what consumes are, but you're better off using consumeables like Greater Fire Protection Potion.
---
You don't want your casters gimping themselves with NR gear on Huhuran, especially when they are going to be the ones carrying the fight since your melees are wearing full NR and massively gimping their DPS. GNPPs are your friend here.
---
Outside of this, (2) warlocks want a shadow resist set to tank Twin Emps. Start with high (200+) and gradually lower it by replacing resist pieces with dps gear once you get comfortable with the fight.
---
A noob trap I've heard is wearing shadow resist for Loatheb. You definitely don't want to be doing that. Wear full DPS gear and go all out on DPS and consumeables for that fight.
---
I know Mograine in the 4HM fight does a lot of fire damage but I have no clue whether our tanks actually wore fire resist gear or not when we were killing that boss.
---
Sapphiron requires a decent amount of Frost resist, something like 150-200 at least from my memories.
---
KT is also extremely heavy on raid frost damage, and you want to have resistance over raw health on that fight as Frost Blast (the Ice Block looking debuff that chains if people are close) does 130% of max hp over 6 seconds. More HP = more healing needed. I remember running ~100-150 FrR on that fight. 
---
I can't think of any other fights requiring resistance gear at the moment.
---
As horde the stark transition from barrens to ashenvale for the first time is truly magical.  The tribal drumming and horns give way to strings and choirs, and you feel as if it is a world with limitless discoveries.
---
&gt; Can FR be used in order to avoid using GFPP?
---
Not on Rag.
---
Everyone needs gold, and everyone gets a fair shot at the item, nothing about it personally benefits me more than the other 4 people in the group.
---
I've never actually leveled a Warrior but it made me want to roll one just to finally wield a flail in the game. They looked pretty sweet! 
---
I think they went so far to use the night elf melody all over the place in Legion. And I also just realized that all the great tavern music was only added in BC. What a bummer.
---
Definitely, never used it as horde side has the OP totems but that's definitely what the alliance side would want to use.
---
I am genuinely becoming concerned that there has not be a drop of information for 3 months? 
---
Is this normal?
---
Why are Blizzard not providing any update?
---
Is the game about to be cancelled?
---
&gt;MC is somewhat challenging early on and having DM nullifies that challenge. Why do you think private servers never have DM at launch, because they’ve learned their lesson of the years. 
---
MC is not somewhat challenging early on. Its a joke. Even without DM gear. it takes less than a day on private servers. 
---
Do you know of a private server where people struggle with MC? It's not challenging at all, and can never be because of 1.12 talents, people's general knowledge and skill, and raid frames.
---
Thank you for the great info!!
---
Glad to have you on board, definitely check out the latest episodes and if you like them then head back and check out the older stuff (the show has changed a bit over the past year!) :)
---
You should to a cross post to /r/wow
---
Witcher 3 got a shout out in the call too - definitely amazing work!
---
It is a common loot rule to Need on BOE. You negotiate after with the winner if you want it.
---
It makes sense since it only affects this one event and it recreates the original paradigm by precluding guilds from taking a shortcut. 
---
Oh I see, announce that there will be changes but not necessarily specify what the mats will be changed to? 
---
That was such a special time...
---
There are so many I couldn't go through them all lol
---
I picked some highlights I knew best.
---
Noted, thank you
---
Yep. I used to top the charts in the MC mostly because I didn't wear any FR gear and self-healed with tubers while everyone else was rocking 90FR or so.   I'd tell people about it they refused to believe because all the guides said they need X amount of FR gear.
---
Ashenvale, 100% if we're talking vanilla.  
---
IMO, though, the best music ever made for WoW was written for blood elves.  The Eversong Woods/Ghostlands music is the most evocative stuff in the game and I still listen to it.  It sounds fucking dumb as hell, but that stuff is heartbreakingly sad and beautiful and it tells you, through music, everything you need to know about the history and lore of the blood elves.  Amazing shit.
---
The thing I’ll miss least about pservers is playing with Russians. *From my experience* they always need on BoEs and never equip them and never even answer in party chat because they either don’t give a damn or they don’t speak English. 
---
Not super common, but yes! Primarily is just for the purpose having more reach, since making a longer flail would just have too much leverage and rip out of your (one) hand.
---
/eyeroll, obviously the ones that happen IRL have higher consequences. However, that doesn't detract from the analogy I'm making which is that if you define the "complete experience" as the worst things that happen (in game its ganking, in America its mass shootings and police brutality) then it's a pretty dumb definition. 
---
On my first server, there was a nightelf hunter named lightning. She ran a white cat called thunder.
---
Most people didn't even do naxx since most couldn't clear AQ40. 
---
I'd like it slower for the chance they decide to throw BC in the mix down the road. Just another round of everyone missing content...
---
See, that's the reason why I hate elitists so much on this sub. Spreading all their bullshit that close to no one did in Vanilla leads to make people freak out and ask such horrible questions.
---
IT. IS. A. FUCKIN. GAME.
---
Ahh I see, my mistake
---
It is quite challenging the first couple of weeks. You’re clueless and want an easy mode Classic experience even if it goes against no-changes. 
---
It’s a tacit rule that everyone needs a boe blue or purple in a dungeon group. Regardless if you need the boe or not, you can settle that with the person who wins the roll 
---
I had a Lopez, it was a bulldog pet, Seeya-cobra, Shelldon-crab, Vodka-bear, Pawpaw-cat
---
Sadly in Classic this will be the case with bop items as well. 
---
A warlock with room for EXTRA GEAR in their bags? 
---
Almost a better joke than the main post.
---
I disagree. Anyone who needs on an item that they don't equip gets an insta-ban from group. 
---
lmao
---
Everyone should roll need on a BoE always. Some people think need before greed means if its a legit upgrade you should get it and some people say we both put in effort and the tons of gold that can come from boes is needed by everyone equally.  
---
Regardless of which of those 2 camps you fall under since the item is tradeable before it has been equip'd if the winner agrees with the legit upgrade mentality they can easily trade said item to the person who needs it. If they don't and you roll greed you missed out on your chance of distributing the item how you see fit.  
---
TLDR Always roll need on boe's regardless of who you think should get it because its easily tradeable if "NBG" is your desire
---
And god forbid it was only an upgrade after enchants/gems.
---
I'm afraid you're going to have to define a term for me:  
---
&gt;life
---
Play what you want, I wouldn't worry about leveling too much. If you keep the rogue geared you will do well, and you will have most of the loot to yourself!
---
It also costs a gcd though so the difference is only 1s
---
100% disagree.
---
If I'm playing 2-3hrs a day can I still have time to level a second to 60 for end game? 
---
What good is it gonna do to inspect them? They already rolled need, you can't do anything about it...
---
::bad meme::
---
Well well well looks like we have a good ol' disagree to disagree.  How we gonna settle this one gents?
---
So if edgemasters drops and you're a clothie you are really telling me you aren't clicking need on that shit? Lol
---
Simple we both roll need or I get the loot lol
---
How do I change my contact method? I would like to use my battle tag instead of Reddit.
---
Pfft, I always had enough space, then again, I brought one-two shards.
---
&gt;For normal guilds it is quite challenging the first couple of weeks.
---
There's nothing challenging about MC. Thats why guilds tear it through it a week after launch.
---
&gt;You’re clueless and want an easy mode Classic experience even if it goes against no-changes. 
---
I'm for no changes, but Classic WoW, this Vanilla project, ISN'T no changes. Because you have 1.12 talents and raid frames day 1. Dire Maul doesn't change that. 
---
https://discord.gg/h9Tw58h and we'll process your edit requests!

This is a funny thread. Last night I read another comment about the original soundtrack. I played it on my phone and put it down on the shelf as I closed my eyes and went to sleep. I woke up listening to the Legion soundtrack, but the first few minutes of going to sleep hearing the beautiful orchestra was great
---
That was something I also thought of a while back. Justify it in the lore: C'Thun's awakening shook and corrupted Azeroth and all NEWLY farmed items have a tint of the old god corruption that can be used in the manufacture of new weapons, armor, and consumables that innur the heroes against going insane while in AQ20/40. Items can also be used in the conventional fashion, i.e. they are still the same items as before, just with the added potential to be turned in for the war effort. 
---
A HoT before a pull was never a big deal in my experience.  Shields were.
---
I don't get it - isn't this a textbook use-case for the "greed" button? This is clear in my experience on pservers. You need if the BOE is an upgrade (because you "need" it) and you greed the BOEs (because you want to auction it - "greed"). Sure, you can work it out after, but the built-in system works fine.  No need to overthink this with "always roll need on boes".
---
I seen a nice tooltip in retail a few years ago:
---
NEED: You want the item.
---
Greed: You'll take the item, but if nobody wants it.
---
Random thought lol
---
I like this idea in theory, but I'm not crazy about having to deal with the psychological hold an expensive shiny purple has on someone who just won a roll and convince them to let me equip that staff of Jordan because it's wicked good. 
---
It also makes it easier for a klepto to get away with their greed because they are only risking upsetting one person instead of 4. Why should the other 3 people care? They lost the roll and it's not usable by their class. They just want to continue running the dungeon...just like the guy who plans to sell your upgrade on the AH.
---
Yep, as well as guild membership veto. That same person who can't resist clicking Need on that BOE is the same person who will fail to pass if the raid leader forgets to swap to masterloot. They'll mutter something like "sry is habit" right before they're kicked.
---
Seriously, BoE is game for anyone. Thats gold right there
---
It's weird, I found leveling a warrior harder than a hunter, but easier than a fire mage.  You just have to pick your fights better as a warrior.
---
Exactly.
---
A warlock with shards in a dungeon group? I didn't think such a thing existed.
---
Menopaws
---
Multiboxers will not be an issue in bgs 100%. Follow has been disabled in bgs for many years and there’s no way in heck blizz will go in and reenable follow in them for classic for the bots and multiboxers.
---
For a blue boe, I don't mind so long as they equip it. For an epic, everyone should probably roll need on it to avoid drama.
---
Always click need on BOEs. Just because you're honest. Doesn't mean everyone else is. Hitting greed is only for BOPs that you dont need.
---
Real talk, if edgemasters drops I'll abandon my principles, Need it, sell it, and then pay for a name change. That's 2k - 5k gold.
---
Because some people don't think thats the way boe's should be handled. If an item drops that's worth 1000g and say its a melee sword. Some people think that item should go straight to the melee user in the group if the item is an upgrade. Some think that 1000g item should be free for all to roll on because if they sell it and get 1000g they can purchase an item that upgrades their character just as much.  
---
That's two different mentalities that will end up grouping together and neither one is right or wrong just different. So by rolling need everyone gets a fair chance to apply the loot method they think is correct. 
---
Hshshhaha
---
Get a great mt and treat them right 
---
That's why its so important to talk about loot rules before the run starts. Both ways of thinking and approaching the subject are 100% legit. 
---
I make my own groups and prefer that all roll need on everything except BoPs, because I had my fair share of people claiming they roll need to equip it, then refuse to actually equip it.
---
You now have to kick a guy an hour into a dungeon in which nobody joins halfway through, because everyone needs the first quest items that drop at the start of tthe dungeon (like Wailing Caverns).
---
A shield is only really an issue if the warrior misses a bunch of attacks on the mob, which does happen.  At that point, they'll have no rage and the mobs will move on attacking the DPS.  This can be particularly bad if the warrior is much lower than the mob, resulting in a lot of missed attacks.  If they don't miss their attacks, not a big deal.
---
As a general rule I don't expect a healer to start healing me until 50-60% HP.   If I set the pace right a healer should drinking during the early part of the pull and I should be pulling the next group before the current group is dead, negating any benefit to pre-sheilding/HOTing me.
---
lol yup. And then whoever wins buys their epic mount with it since its worth more gold than OP could farm in 2 months. Winning edgemasters, foror's compendium, freezing band, or ace of beasts, etc. is like hitting the lotto. Hence the community default rule of rolling on BoEs.
---
These items are also 1% drops and drop off random trash mobs, so we are not talking about loot that anyone can farm with an expectation of it dropping. Boss Loot is BoP and higher % usually between 10-50% depending on the table. There are many reasons why the roll need on BoE rule exists. And yes I said rule. This is not something up for discussion it is already decided and has been for a very long time for good reasons.
---
Idk most people honestly didnt raid at all. Seeing someone in raid gear you knew they took the game pretty serious. People way overestimate how good they used to be. 
---
With BoE's you can hash it out later, and reduce the odds of ninja looters getting it.
---
Concur. Though what if it’s for off-spec and you have evidence of use of off-spec?
---
I never played Legion, so I had no idea :(
---
Yep, I hope they'll add tavern music to Classic, or at least there will be an addon for it. I'll miss tauren taven music, it's so peaceful.
---
Many a person rolls need, makes people refrain from rolling need by telling them he will equip, not do so and then just keep it to sell. 
---
You now shot yourself in the leg by cutting the dungeon run short or having to wait for someone to fill the ninja's spot
---
How significant of a problem is the black lotus mafia? Is it as bad as the rumors claim? Is every node known and camped 24 7?
---
It also has a lot of mining and herb nodes. Healers can 2 man it.
---
DM:N is farmable too
---
BOE is need, regardless. 
---
Correct. It’s almost like they should have named the Categories “Need” and “Gree... oh wait.
---
This is too real. 
---
Pretty much. People advocating for full-need on BOEs are falling victim to prisoner's dilemma and are afraid of ninjas, which is fair, but I've never had this problem before, since rolls are announced before the item is actually awarded, and people usually aren't going to risk the current run and their reputation on the server for one BOE.
---
Most people are sensible enough to not roll need unless they really do need something, and even then, if it's of value, they'll usually ask if they can first.
---
Everyone should need on boe blues/epics. Fuck ninja looters.
---
Nobody actually needs a boe upgrade from a dungeon, and in most cases equipping it instead of selling it would be detrimental overall.
---
Additionally the everyone rolls need rule makes it impossible for somebody to ninja and leave.
---
My thoughts exactly. Given all the crap that's been coming out of ActiBlizz lately, where Classic is concerned: no news is good news.
---
I think he was talking about pugs, in which case I agree with him. Too many ninjas out there, so just let everyone in the group know to need on BOEs. If it's a guild group or a raid it's a different story.
---
Yup - exactly. Some items are literally like winning the lotto, and if you are interested in using it then you should pay fair market price. If  4 people all roll greed and then one ninja rolls need and disconnects, they just won the lotto.
---
SO everyone rolls need as a rule. 
---
If you want to be super generous and turn around and just give it to someone, then guess what? You can do like that guy up above described, Roll need, win, and you can do exactly what you want and trade it to that person who "needs" to equip it. Funny that though, much less chance of that happening once someone wins the roll in real life and sees that opportunity for riches lol. Another point is that no one is ever expecting or farming for a BoE since thats literally impossible. You can farm ZG max level on a mage for months and not see edgemasters since its a .01% drop chance off of trash mobs. It is not normal loot from a boss table.
---
Those tense moments before they equip it. Standing there... inspecting them... waiting for them to put it on.. thinking “equip it you son of a bitch”
---
yep, thats my plan too
---
4 hours a day means just getting to 60 will take 29 days at world record speed. At world record speed, getting to 60 alone means playing 16 hours a day if you want to do it in the first reset.
---
Even if you find 80 people who are 30% faster than Joana, that's still 12 hours a day in a week or 6 hours a day in two weeks. And if there are a 100 people in a guild of those superheroes, how many actually go through with this? How many will actually play 16 hours a day and be as fast as they think they are?
---
I'm confident that there will be a lot of level 60 dungeons cleared before the first reset, but the math just doesn't work out for MC, and certainly not for Ony.
---
It's a valid statement
---
A good enough tank could mitigate it, but depending on how enemies were spread out/what was caught in the tank’s aoe, the mobs would instantly aggro on the healer.
---
This is one of the two arguments I like for everyone to need. If everyone needs you avoid a ninja, and everyone does need what the item provides. Not everyone needs it as equipment, but everyone needs the value of the item for one thing or another. 
---
Did I read that right that a healer plus dps can 2 man 3 bosses in DME?
---
You really don't need to do all that it's super mana inefficient, if you're solo it's simply voidwalker attack, corruption and wand.
---
If you prefer the more active approach then corruption and shadowbolt spam is alright too but you'll be drinking more but do what you enjoy dude.
---
Like I said you are clueless. Not much more needs to be said. 
---
i'd say that if they would change / buff bosses compared to Vanilla. However if they keep word and the game (and thus bosses) will be as true to Vanilla as possible. And due to that bosses will be actually even easier than 15 years ago progress wise because they are fully known, Classic will probably have 16 debuff slots troughout, we will have 1.12 talents troughout etc i personally can't call that a progress race sorry.  
---
Threat is a big component of dungeons, especially while leveling because your tank is most likely not protection specced. You can do multi target dotting if you notice the tank has great threat on two mobs but normally you'll only pull aggro and make your tank more frustrated.
---
Yes, your fire totems scale with your spell damage.
---
Need on all BoE's, then it cannot be ninja'd by anyone. If someone genuinely wants it they can ask the group but only if they equip it on the spot, that's what we followed on our server back in classic.
---
Hand over my heart, if I were not playing a class that legitimately needed it -- no, I would not "need" that over someone else in my party who plans to equip it.
---
Realistically what would happen is some other clothie would have already rolled "need" on it, and so now we're all strongarmed into need rolling just to protect everyone's interest.  But if there had been a Warrior in the group who actually wanted it, and I won the need roll, I would trade it to them.
---
Completely Agree!
---
This was meant to be funny, and more suited toward lower level dungeons or BOE blues not worth much, where its fine for a member to take it, situational of course. With that said -- Kang dropped in Mara the other day and you bet I needed instantly on my druid and told others to do the same. We all NEED that gold! 
---
Dang I see someone I used to play with on this, this is awesome.
---
Gonna get the people I still hang with to all check maybe we get a whole network going.
---
Battle Shout is the first thank you should cast after charging a mob for AOE aggro.  It doesn't matter were the mobs are, as long as they're in combat they'll hate the tank.
---
Yes, that's what I've seen. 
---
That's if you solo queue
---
If you're in a good premade you can hit 12/13 with 50 hours a week.
---
Alterac Valley. When your in the 50's I start to get tired of the questing and I just want to hit 60. Its always great when its AV weekend and there are tons of quests to get you through that last stretch.
---
Sfk is stacked for cloth loot. 
---
Great belt, robe and shoulder pieces.
---
It takes a lot of time, but the core of being a good GM is relationship building, being online often and socializing. Also keeping a clear message for the goals of the guild as to not disappoint people. You also need to make sure the leadership of the guild is well liked and good at their class. To be honest, the latter is most important — you can’t create a situation where a a bad player is an officer.
---
From my experience, I have led guilds, but more often I led raids and had a buddy handle guild lead as most of the requirements for guild leading aren’t my strength.
---
I love american beauty.
---
Your IQ would have to be in the negatives if you dont roll need on a BoE that could buy you your epic mount at level 60 
---
There's a built-in profanity filter for a reason.  I would hope it's not reportable.
---
That said, the other faction can't understand what you're saying anyway.  So unless you're going out of your way to whisper-harass them over Bnet or an alternate toon, you should be fine.
---
I remember I got  banned for saying "fag" in trade chat for 3 hours before in vanilla, but they banned me while I was sleeping so I never noticed until I checked my email later
---
Naw, I see Brandon's system there 99% of the time. BoE == all need by default. Like he says since it's BoE you can always work something out later if it's really an issue.
---
Ive levelled several warriors and hamstring kite is by far the best way. It's not even hard to avoid pulling other mobs if you just look around and pay attention??
---
Also the full rage 2 mob cleave is suicide on a fresh pvp server.
---
I remember leveling enchanting and handing out lesser magic wands in Goldshire to random priests/mages/warlocks. Makes people super happy and requires very little.
---
1-10 is going to be a cluster. If they shard the servers or increase spawns substantially you can try to use that as a template but it may end up being faster to find a quiet corner and grind. 
---
If you’re taking time off work or can play 8+ hours a day, you can get ahead of the curve and then use the guides. 
---
[https://vanillafriends.com/](https://vanillafriends.com/find-friends) is the one you want for finding old guildmates. Awesome website by Sams!  
---
Shout out to bchat!!
---
guild wars 1 music will always have a special place in my heart
---
bronze jam is so good too and really catches you off guard the first time you hear it
---
What if that warrior was really really bad at the game?
---
never preshield in dungeons, some priest argue is more mana efficient even though its not, preshield on hard hitting bosses in raid is fine
---
[deleted]
---
It all depends on spawn rates. If it's OG vanilla spawn times or dynamic spawns. That will heavily dictate the best path to take
---
Suckas ...   kidding but not really 
---
Sadly it's very much reportable. I got a warning from a GM for calling someone an asshole. I argued that that's what the filter is for. I didn't win the argument. This was in wrath. 
---
I love 40 mans because - no matter how things are “balanced” along one given dimension you can look at, you will want to bring every class, they’re all useful.
---
Planning the early levels right now is an exercise in futility. We don't know if sharding will exist and we don't know the population numbers for servers. Not only that but the early levels go so quickly anyways you're better off planning the late levels.
---
1-10 takes ~2 hours but leveling just from 39 to 40 takes 2.5hours if you're *very* fast.
---
Some people: "The community is a important part of vanilla"
---
The same people: &gt;procceed to roll on a PvE server
---
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAH
---
I'm clueless? That's precious coming from the guy whos suggesting 1.12 talents, itemization changes, and raid frames at launch is "no changes".
---
if everyone needs on BOEs its essentially a forced greed roll
---
if you take the "high road" and hit greed and everyone else hits need you just fucked yourself
---
cant get fucked if you all hit need
---
nothing stopping a douchebag from waiting for you all to hit greed then hitting need and waltzing off with the item
---
Took my level one Troll rogue Twink all the way to iron forge.  I'd sneak up and get killing blows on 60s after their duels. 
---
LMAO this reminds me of when I got a warning for saying "stop being a bitch" the warning report was sent to our family email and my dad made me do extra chores or something as punishment.
---
It was during the time that the zandalari plague was killing everyone in cities lol
---
Been seeing the normal greed for it in my groups. Need only if you equip asap.
---
Tailoring is mandatory if you’re serious about numbers. Tailoring and Engineering is the optimal route. If you don’t care about optimization, a lot of mages choose tailoring/enchanting.
---
Don't think of it as an item dropping. In reality, what you are rolling is a bag full of gold, regardless is it equipped or not.
---
50% of 40 man raids challenge just comes from herding that much cattle
---
You're just a wrecking ball in BGs and your healers dispells and CC are much more helpful than the actual healing. Warrior with pocket healer in WPvP depends on if they can cc your healer, if they can do that then you better have engineering/trinkets/potions etc. because solo warrior gets crushed by most classes.
---
One thing to note is that rogue isn't great for premade BGs.
---
Oh, this is literally just the spreadsheet we had stickied here for a while...
---
Well obviously the classic crew at blizz hq was watching the stream and a soon as they announced classic they sat down and said "alright lets begin working on classic".
---
*Greed*y bastards.
---
If true, thats sad. 
---
hurmargherhed mehnochurghens ehn no changers ornly claessic no hyopthetiaclskncs 
---
I remember, I always used to click pass on items I didn't need, even if they were BoE.
---
Then, an item named "Greed" dropped. Of course, I did as I was instructed, and clicked greed.... and rolled 100 and won it.
---
It's still lurking somewhere in my old account's bank.
---
Stand next to a bunch of gnomes.
---
You'll probably get a warning first, but cursing in open chat can get you in trouble. I never got banned but got a warning for cursing at people in general chat for being annoying during a roaming PvP night.
---
yes
---
From how he describes each class I second this.
---
To expand on the comments below already about the build-in filter, it is there for a reason, which is mainly to protect kids that are playing. There's a difference between cursing and cursing at someone else to insult them. The moment you cross that line where you are no longer speaking to a situation but you are belittling someone else it is reportable.
---
None
---
Thanks for the answer
---
Lol. Someone whos worked in software development that doesn't know the difference between a demo and live client. Haha, should have said you were a comedian, that's more believable. 
---
Preach!
---
In the entirety of retail I think only one person on my server hit 1mill honor, once, on horde. I don't think it will *always* be people push 1m+ *easily* a week.
---
Tailoring &gt; create chest piece &gt; decide if you want to commit to tailoring on a more public level (recipes etc) &gt; if no, choose literally anything else it doesn't matter &gt; always engineering.  
---
ranking wont be out until BWL / Stage 2, you should easily have epic riding before ranks even come out.
---
"ill equip it when i reach that level i promise*
---
*overpriced in AH two days later*
---
Really? My hunter was impossible to level 1-9, but at 10 when I got the pet, specced BM I was unstoppable.
---
Warrior leveling was very similar to me as my rogue. Needed a lot of food, first aid was always a priority and the first thing to max out, and I never really pulled more than 2 mobs at a time unless I was with a group or healer lol. 
---
Demos never represent the development progress as they are nearly always done long before the demo actually releases. Always updating a Demo to the newest progress takes way to much time to be practicable, so most of the demo progress could have also been from like 6 months prior to blizzcon.
---
Dr House, can tell by the soundtrack
---
Learning a leveling route on an empty server is still effective for use on a packed server. The only difference is that each step of the leveling route is interrupted more with a population around you, it doesn't change the fact that the route you discovered is the most efficient.  
---
The biggest feature of a leveling route is getting ahead of the pack in the first 16 hours. After that, your pre-defined route goes largely uninterrupted.  
---
Pre-planning is extremely useful, don't abandon your research.  
---
We should totally hang out. (Throws alley oop.....)
---
Against average players yes theres a lot of tricks you can use to crush people, but on a same gear/skill/consumes level warrior will lose about 80% of the time as it's weak in 1v1.
---
HOWEVER it's a lot easier to get HKs in general than the other 2 classes and much much much more fun than them.
---
no news is bad devs
---
lol probably.
---
The main job of a leveling warlock is to not pull aggro. You will more easily pull aggro doing less dps than most other classes.
---
A well built feral will be doing twice a warlock's damage against single targets while likely not pulling aggro.
---
Do your support duties, be at dungeons early so summons can help the lazy asses who don't travel early enough. Just know your god status doesn't occur until after you hit 60.
---
Just create yourself a private chat channel to dump all of your cursing, swearing and potential insults into. 
---
You can say whatever you like to yourself there. Doesn't need to be politically correct either. 
---
Except.. it's valuable too all 5 people because of its sell value. 
---
So True!
---
Yeah, my time using adult language in public chat ended in Wrath too. I believe I said the word shit.

---
8.5/10
---
Well done.
---
well that's good to know I'm not really into duels. World pvp fights though are fun.
---
Orc rogue &gt; undead rogue
---
It’s not close.
---
I don’t think it’s crazy for all to Need a BoE in a PUG. Avoids BS.
---
Right. Always need on a BOE.
---
The spell coef is rather small.
---
Only about 0.11 for Searing, 0.13 for magma, and 0.32 for fire nova.
---
There are a couple of vanilla era wiki's which give you the spell coef for all skills in the game.
---
I think that players were able to find items with things like crit rating (there was no crit rating in vanilla, only % and very rarely) in demo.
---
I absolutely adore WoW's music but I gotta put Ni No Kuni as my favorite video game music because Joe Hisaishi is just too good
---
I don’t think it’s wrong for you to have that position, but it is s bit crazy to assume everyone views it the same way. If you feel that strongly about any unwritten rule you should make it clear at the start.
---
&gt; the traditionally hard to level classes like warrior would benefit from this overpopulation as everyone will be slowed down waiting for spawns or working together 
---
the only classes that would benefit from that, are mages with frost nova.
---
These are some solid choices, each has their own fun niche.
---
Druid: FC in WSG, fun all around in AV, sooooo good at duels, interesting WPvP. Sidenote: pve is horrendous. 
---
Rogue: very strong 1v1 WPvP, PVE is strong and fun, fun in AV.
---
Hunter: High skillcap in PVE and PVP = sick plays to be made, very strong 1v1, can solo most things.
---
I cant remember my guild names because I was in a few but good concept
---
I think there is a ban for swearing twice
---
There’s a hundred polls and they’re all different, and Classic will be different again. It’s really a silly thing to be worrying about - play whatever you want. Whether your class is 10% or 12% means jack shit.
---
Name for brokentooth:  
---
Fixedtooth 
---
Based on my anecdotal experience of openly cursing in general and trade chat for many years I would say you have nothing to worry about. The worst thing that would happen would be a silence and I’ve only ever gotten a silence once after trolling general for several hours. 
---
I’ve only ever seen someone get perma banned for chat once and it was my friend that literally threatened to rape someone’s little sister in trade chat (it was a total stranger and he was being a troll) so if you don’t say anything along those lines you should be fine lols
---
Even if a ton of people play class X, that doesn't tell you whether they plan to raid or not. Or what timezone they want to raid on. Or how hardcore they plan to go.
---
There is no poll that is useful for predicting how much competition you specificallly will have for a raid slot.
---
Also might make sense as an accessible PuG raid for people who don't want to invest into serious raiding, but still want to taste 40-man raid. I doubt that it will be on LFR-difficulty level.
---
Id it follows the private server model. The two most popular classes will be Warrior in number one and Mage in number two. Everything else is pretty even with Druid, paladin and shaman in last place. Shaman normally being the least popular class based on the fact only one side can play it.
---
they dont want to distract from the .3 BFA patch. it will come out in the deadzone between expacs
---
Pre-planning is useful and I agree getting ahead is very important. I'm not saying don't plan. Just wait for more info for the early levels specifically.
---
A quest chain that is dependent on finishing an escort/gather (from the world, mobs don't drop)/low drop rate quest is going to be infinitely worse on a populated server than not. Kill quests are effected, just not nearly as much. This absolutely changes what route is the most efficient.
---
Rank 10 is what is going to be realistic for most people, maybe 11.
---
I did the math awhile back with a schedule similar to yours assuming I would be in the top 10% of players (realistic), and the honor loss each week was going to keep me right around the top levels of rank 10 literally forever. 
---
If you want any chance of advancing past that you are going to need to no life.
---
Yes, but assholes wont understand this. Or ignore it.
---
It's really simple - if you NEED the item as an upgrade, then you *NEED* it. If you want it to upgrade your  wallet, then you *GREED* it.
---
Then again, Im not taking the chance with random fuckers from eastern Europe of pakistan or whatever.
---
A really touchy subject for some people. I don’t mind either way I just miss the design philosophy and play style of Vanilla and I don’t get why some people care what other people see on their screens.
---
I heard a recent argument about addons and it was clear to me they did little research on which addons were available during Vanilla and kept on calling what other people use “game breaking”.
---
Yeah, towards the end of vanilla it became pretty common practice. People would just say "all roll need" if a BoE epic dropped, because it was too easy for people to just pretend they needed it and run to the nearest AH.
---
Yup, I remember. And it avoids the nonsense of trying to force people to equip the item. It’s all just unnecessary drama.
---
I always wait it out. Then do a quick inspect or wait to see if they say anything to decide if I pass or need. On a boe epic though i won't be passing on those. Way to much gold to pass up
---
Thank you. I was just thinking, why does it matter? Play what you want, and if you dedicate yourself to learning the class/put in the time, you’ll get to raid or pvp however you’d like! 
---
Who actually equips BoEs from dungeons though? Even if it is an upgrade, selling it is usually the better way to go anyway. That money is almost always more valuable than a few extra stats for a few levels.
---
Could You go more in detail about everything You just said, except for PvE? :Q
---
A lot of us played vanilla wow on private servers, and if that is anything to go by it has everything you listed and we still think it's the stuff of legends. All of the stuff is well deserved.
---
Honestly, this is not worth worrying about. You have 8 classes on your faction, other than druid nobody is a special snowflake that's gonna have a guaranteed raid spot. The differences between most and least played classes pale in importance to playing a class you actually want to be playing. So play what you want to play rather than trying to speculate on what the server is going to look like. As for private server censuses, I'd wager that Classic will have a very different looking population since the majority of players will be returning, new, and coming from live, not private server try-hards.
---
And if you account for the divide in faction, Druid is the least played.
---
See the thing I'll miss *most* about p-servers is the Russians. The crazy Americans are just angry and sad — the crazy Russians give no shits and are consistently hilarious.
---
Probably going to play mage, but one of my biggest reasons that I might not is because of PvP. It just feels so slow whenever any melee can just walk up to me and damage me but i have to stand still and not be hit for 3 seconds to cast a frostbolt. That, and satisfying shatter combos never really happen, as people silence me/dispel/whatever. I don't know though, it just seems really appealing because of all the cooldowns and things that make me feel like I'm in control of the match 
---
Hunter actually has decent theoretical DPS up to BWL whereas warlock is very weak, then they basically start to switch in 1.7(ZG) until warlock is eventually top of the meters in naxx and hunter is bottom.
---
For PvP they are both strong and fun at all levels of content :)
---
devs dont give news, thats CM/marketing. 
---
Well I agree with the rolling need on BoE's thing, if someone really wanted to, they could put the person on their/their guild's blacklist and also put that person on ignore.
---
This is my current plan going into Classic.  
---
Another approach is: duplicate every required item. So before event started, game drops one item, after event drops another item and old items have something to distinguish them (e.g. Battered prefix). They are completely identical except for quest purpose.
---
Back in the day my raid was made in of 3 smaller guilds that came together on the weekend.  We had maybe 15-18 dedicated, good players that were geared and ready.  Everyone else was just bodies.  Frequently we'd have 20-25 people that only raided like once or twice a month, gear was all over the place, no consumables, not great players.  We'd be bringing people in all Blues to BWL.  Sometimes we wouldn't even have 40 people.
---
We managed to clear halfway through AQ with that!
---
You should join the military!
---
I remember getting kicked out of my first PUG because I thaought that Need and Greed were the opposite.   I was rolling Need on green BoE’s because I thought that Greed was the more forceful option.  I didn’t notice the other party members yelling at me in /p until after I got kicked and scrolled back up to understand why.  
---
You can pay for a few more accounts to have them as guild banks. Don't even need to pay subscription all the time, fill up first account, then switch to second and so on. Need some RL money, but who cares.
---
Even random "Crapsack of the Whale" green stuff? I've not yet seen *anyone* roll need on those things.
---
You are going to be disappointed when you roll greed on a boe in a pug and the other 4 players roll need
---
I played with a Russian hunter in a 4 man party last night with no pet. We tried asking where his pet was, but he just replied with a single russian word and never said anything else after that. We ran several elite quests with this guy opening with Aimed Shot and then charging into melee to kite the mobs with Wing Clip, but never tried to range dps or summon a pet. What a legend. 
---
If I was running a full guild group I would AH it then split the profits then everybody gets something. Adds extra steps though.
---
Really it's just their auto attack mechanic. The more flashy class defining ability would be traps and feign death (basically used together).
---
No other class has it.
---
I think you should also consider that mage is one of the most popular mat farming classes, so it doesn't necessarily mean that people main a mage, it might just be their farming bank alt (and there's no reason not to have one). Just my opinion.
---
If you want to tank seriously then you will need engineering for the AOE shield Force Reactive Disk: https://classicdb.ch/?spell=22797
---
Tanking can be consumable heavy and you will spend a lot on repairs on progression. Some guilds help their tanks out with donations and selling unwanted raid drops but don't count on it ;)
---
Casters get better weapons in BWL, most don't consider the extra grind from 13-14 worth it
---
some guilds are going to want to be the first to clear the raid. Not server first, world firsts. The raid will be cleared in 1 reset by the top guilds (they have had plenty of time to practice) so you need to open the gates first to pull it off.
---
I just want the max settings previously only allowed by manually customizing the client through the admin console.
---
I'm presuming this will be pushed to the limit anyway with the new engine. Granted this also means it may be slightly different than real vanilla, but I am sure we'll get use to it.
---
Lupus: Condomdispencer. Since he fucks everyone in a 1v1
---
The only way I see it working is with many different systems in place. First, no active player cap per server at the start but be transparent about what that cap will be in the future. Second, shard the population to be something reasonable but not too lonely. Third, increase the spawn rate of mobs but cap said rate at the start and have it dwindle slowly over time.
---
This, to me, best represents what Vanilla is and ultimately I think Blizzard's goal will be to do just that, represent Vanilla the best they can for new, returning, and avid Vanilla players.
---
I don't think the amount of marketing a company does, necessarily correlates with the quality of the product.
---
Good marketing strategies can multiply the success of a good product. 
---
I'd say the best video game music is from
---
the PS1 classic JRPG "Chrono Cross." 
---
Vanilla WoW has excellent music but the best music in WoW is from the Wrath of The Lich King Expansion in the zone "Grizzly Hills."
---
Would highly recommend this as warrior is brutal to level alone and mage doesn't really synergise with other classes. Good luck! ;)
---
LOL. Ya NO WAY D2 set is out that early.
---
I was speaking in regards to the meme that specified blues &amp; purples. But depending on the group, even crap gear might get needed if theres a shitty ninja in the group lol
---
It's been shared a number of times already. But the founder of said website thanks you for sharing it again regardless :)
---
People have used it for tBC and WoTLK too. It's fine if you really want to.
---
It is enough to kill the game if there was 9 months of MC.
---
For sure. Druid is not a class most people like to play.
---
It is relative - rogues are not 2% more than hunters, they are 15% more by comparison. (12.4/14.5)
---
Beyond that the responses you are looking at are from by and large people that are going to be more educated that the norm (people that are active on a Classic WoW sub before its announce date has even come out) - there is going to a HUGE amount of new players that will pick things with an entire different set of logic than the people who responded here.
---
People that know this game will likely think that Warriors are the stronger melee over rogues - noobs who don't know this game will think that "ninja's are f-ing sweet" and pick rogue over warrior 9 times out of 10.
---
People that know better know that human rogues have the best PvE racial, and Gnomes ( and maybe dwarves...) have the best PvP racial - and yet 90% of the new players are going to pick NE (objectively the worst in both) because they look cool / sexy.
---
Point being - the numbers you are seeing in these surveys are not going to be representative of the live game. Either way, yes rogues are going to be popular.
---
but there could be at least some tweet
---
... unless it's all under NDA, for some reason.
---
Horde side I would assume resto shammy still get the golden boy treatment.
---
You don't know how many of those are people's "main" either.
---
I doubt we'll see 20% mages.
---
No that labeled you a ninja looter. That shit was real serious. People kept lists of names of people they wouldn't group with for one reason or another. Mine were on sticky notes all around my monitor. 
---
Full t2.5 Elemental shaman is unstoppable. There was a High Warlord on Warsong-Feenix while I was ranking that that always had insane KDRs, he would comfortably do 1v3 lol it was amazing to watch.
---
The problem with backstab spec is the lack of good daggers while levelling, whereas dungeon quests throw swords at you every couple of levels.

I always called Teldrassil TEDrassil

1.12 is just the talent, class and combat mechanic benchmark.

The progression content is independent of this and may be adjusted accordingly.

Yes, if you account for faction paly and shaman are always popular classes. Really the only thing you can say is Druid will be least popular.

---
But that instant pyro blast  usually a 1hit k.o. if you cross spec is so satisfying
---
My rl friend always pronounced Sepulcher as "Squelcher", no matter how many times I corrected him.
---
He was the only one though, because he was an idiot that way.
---
KT big frostbolt is not resistible no matter how much frost resistance you got.
---
Hunters are also a good choice for farming, or so I heard.
---
&gt; Karasang Wilds but I think it's something like Krasarang
---
Kasaranka :Ð
---
They are but they take way more skill to play for anything but  pet tanking stuff.
---
"I'm enchanter" for me everytime..
---
Most of what I've found has been through searching YouTube for "ele shaman vanilla" and any combination of PvP, leveling, etc. 
---
Melderon from Defcamp &amp; Melderon on YouTube has done an insane amount of work on Shaman from Tanking to Totems to mana efficiencies of spells.  
---
Completely True
---
Well, it's a fairly popular class, but not in Vanilla\^\^'
---
Balance is just plain unviable. Feral is also bad. Not even Resto excels at what it does, being more of an auxiliary healer. 
---
And without changes, there's no hope of that ever getting better, so it's only natural people switch off and pick something else. 
---
Who the heck is *buying* these things? I was super, super-lucky while questing in Feralas in my late 40's and had an epic sword drop, a [Nightblade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1982) (level 39). I guessed at 120gp as a fair price for it, and it was sold within 10min. I messaged the winner to congratulate and thank them, and ask out of curiosity what they intended to do with it. No reply at all.
---
I assume they bought it to speculate on getting a higher price, but at some point, someone will buy it to equip. Presumably that person will use it until they get to 51 and start grinding the [Ice Barbed Spear](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19106) unless for reasons of racial bonus or talent spec they prefer swords.
---
So, they spent a minimum of 120gp, 12% of epic mount cost, for a weapon they would use for 12 to 14 levels. Is that worthwhile?
---
They could have got the [Diabolic Skiver](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/index.php?item=9475) from ZF for the cost of time only, and it is *almost* as good as the Nightblade. As a DPS warrior, you could get into ZF groups in your early 40's; as a tank (and why the hell do you want a Nightblade?) you'd need to be mid-40's. Unless you have a guildie hold your hand through ZF runs, over and over again, which is still probably a better plan than spending 120gp.
---
I'm grateful for the money, but I just don't see the value to the buyer.
---
And then what would happen is that warrior would turn around and sell it for 1000g to buy his epic mount at 60 because he doesn't care that much about maxing his raid dps. 
---
Only reason I won't be playing a warrior is the time investment - it's huge. But if you can put in 3-4 hours/day for the first 6-9 months then it is by far the most satisfying to play.
---
Also I mained Rogue in Nost and the 'harder to find groups' assumption is only true if you're guildless or cba to form your own groups, it wasn't a problem at all.
---
If you are **only** taking Edgemaster into account then sure, that item probably won't ever lose value. But for other scenarios, its not as simple as that. It depends on the age of the server, the current demand of the item, current value of gold... I'm not saying your stance isn't valid. I think its perfectly valid. I'm just trying to point out that there is more than one way to think of it.
---
Yes, it is the greatest game soundtrack of all time - though it's hard to compare something fully orchestral like that to something 8-bit like Metroid/Zelda/etc, they are sort of in different categories.
---
All the general overworld music of Eversong, Hillsbrad, Barrens, Ashenvale, etc are absolutely amazing.  And actually the music since then has mostly been fantastic too, I just don't have the same nostalgia for it.
---
Terribly saturated as in... under-saturated?
---
Everything they do is under NDA. They're not allowed to talk about anything unless they're approved to do interviews, and its something already announced or something they're approved to announced.
---
If you follow any Blizzard game, there's a reason why its typically the same like 5 people who do interviews with press. Maybe that numbers bumps up a bit when its Blizzcon time. 
---
The ambient-ish Howling Fjord track with the flutes... instant goosebumps..
---
CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES
---
Was that warning because you simply said the word "asshole" or because your "asshole" comment was directed at another player?
---
It's amazing how after 14 years there are still plenty of those names that i remember from my server, now coming back on that site. Not necessarily what class they played, but the names. "that one was a dick", "this was a cool guy", "that one always tried to gank me and the pvp was awesome"... How many retail players can even remember the people they ran an lfg dungeon with yesterday?
---
Totally Agree!
---
Warriors are actually very efficient at farming DME with a healer if you have decent gear. One of you will disenchant blues, the other will mine the rich thorium nodes at the end. Can be about 50g/hr if you both have decent gear and a good rhythm.
---
Are they the tank? Have we wiped multiple times? Has there been drama and bad attitude in chat?
---
It'd have to be all three, for me to deny them the upgrade.
---
Can't say I disagree.
---
Eversong Woods music makes my hair stand up on end... some of the most beautiful tracks ever.
---
What’s NGDP brother?
---
lol I've just found out that it's not Squelcher
---
So this account is definitely a bot.
---
I didn’t say it wasn’t. But all those cloth users and no drops confirms my theory
---
It also appears this guild has Naxx on farm - which isn't a realistic gauge for if a tank is appropriate or not.
---
Hell in ICC we had our Shaman MT H-Sindragosa, even during the Shadowmourne quests just for fun.
---
the battle.net updates, basically.
---
Dual gathering is a decent moneymaker.
---
Tailoring is a good choice for a clothie to make your own gear.  Enchanting or a gathering profession pair well with it.
---
Alchemy is good.
---
Engineering is better, but you make less money with it.
---
I would not recommend Blacksmithing or Leatherworking.
---
Is the chest absolute BIS or preraid BIS?
---
Some of the best are plays on the hunter's name.  For example, a hunter named Cheech and a pet named Chong.
---
They are overpopulated, but most are braindead in my experience... I think all those pvp montage videos make the terrible players pick rogue because they think pvp will be easy or something. 
---
But for PVE if you can get into a raid guild early while they're farming prebis then you're set. Never had a problem myself ;)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ui6mf3lHSU
---
https://youtu.be/2O4FA16PU44?t=106
---
Just don't shield at all, unless absolutely necessary.  The spell is very inefficient, scales poorly with gear, and it prevents the warrior from generating rage.  I see absolutely no reason a priest should use PW:S on a warrior in Classic dungeons or raids.
---
You could downrank it. Rank 1 Corruption will proc Shadow Trance and really, really should not draw aggro from a halfway-competent tank.
---
Put up DoTs, wand.
---
If something will be CC'd, ignore it.  If the tank is worth his salt you won't pull aggro.  If he's not, then just DoT the main target and wand.
---
hmm... 6th november
---
**wowv**  added build 28366
---
and later the same day...
---
**wowt** added build 28366
---
so... damn **FAKE ALERT**......
---
The change 1.) Does not change gameplay at all, and 2.) is not noticeable to other players.
---
The only people who would have a problem with this are clowns that have want to control what YOU do.
---
Corruption first, we want Shadow Trance procs.
---
Okay but the idea that just about any item will lose value in the few days max that it takes to sell something is just not correct. Sure if you wait like 4 months and the item is no longer bis then you'll lose out on a lot of money but that's not a reason to just give somebody something.
---
And no I play with IRL friends and guildies... we still all need roll for rare and epic BOE's. If someone from the group wants the item they can ask the winner who will almost always give a good price or in some cases just straight up give them the item. But like even with my IRL best friends I wouldn't expect them to just give me a boe epic worth a few hundred gold for free cause that's just stupid. 
---
Why, my character from the demo
---
Hunter named Huntard, with a pet named Petard.
---
well, makes sense. Get done with Stranglethorn Vale before 60s come
---
True enough OK, as long as you wait until mobs are in melee range of the tank I would say yes that might be a good use of a GCD.  
---
I used to call warsong gulch...warsong glutch
---
Arathi basin was arathi ba-sin
---
Silithus was sithilius
---
Those are the ones I remember not being able to pronounce back then, arathi always makes me laugh when I think about it because it sounds so stupid to say it how I used to.
---
Eating more. I find it more time-efficent to lifetap down to near-sero health and then eat, rather than drinking. Maybe drink too, if you're really out of mana and health.
---
&gt;As far as I remember it really was not that big of a deal.
---
unless you went to pee, and ended up fapping.
---
It's good until ZG Bloodvine set, so BIS thru MC and BWL.
---
It means locks can use corruption for extra dps and nightfall procs
---
on ally side, as a warlock
---
You never shield the tank unless he is about to die. 
---
If the tank charges I to a pack and isn’t getting any rage, you the healer, will put aggro the tank due to healing threat and will die.
---
I had a healer who called me a shitty tank because he kept dieing to packs due to him shielding me to prevent me getting any rage. I tried explaining to him, but his answer was bad thanks always make excuses.
---
That guy def got a kick from me and we didn’t finish deadlines that day.
---
Sure, I get that. I just don’t see why anyone would think that will change anything in Classic. For Locks, the issue was typically threat management, not trying to squeeze out more DPS anyway.
---
Real life and pixel life are not the same. 
---
If there's a known shitty ninja, kick them!
---
I don't bother with 'preparing for classic' until beta is out, we don't know how many changes there will be that would make preparing a waste of time.
---
Rouge
---
Is this a good place to discuss how I will be rolling on Stam/Int Cloth gear for my Druid while leveling despite casters bitching and moaning that those are their stats?
---
My dyslexic redneck friend butchered the names of literally 80% of the zone names.
---
My favorites were:
---
Tanris 
---
Tanglevine 
---
Hillsbard
---
Mardumb
---
And Syphilis (although I'm pretty sure he knew he was getting that one wrong)
---
Funny thing is he never told me he was even dyslexic until Legion. Pretty sure he hot diagnosed late in life LOL
---
And while I truly respect that and I'm trying to do it as little as possible, it is mostly just talent builds leveling zones, farming / gathering and general dungeons I want to farm for gear. As well as YouTube videos for guides if needed.  
---
I personally and not looking at any guides for raids as I have never touched them. I definitely don't want to spoil that. 
---
If you go into /trade and yell that BillyMcFace, lvl 43 hunter ninjaed some shitty leveling purple, all that will happen is people laughing at you.
---
You answered your own question dude.
---
I always waited to roll til everyone else had back in Vanilla. A couple times I was the first person to roll and clicked greed and I lost out on an opportunity to roll. Never again!
---
Just depends on how active your pvp community is and how big the server is.
---
&gt; **when bored?** 
---
1. 2 hours of trying to jump on top of some building, then when I find out how, I call everyone around to join me there. This was the case on the demo, Sentinel Hill inn.
---
2. using the pirate costume, and then shouting around and "Hey I got Cataclysm already, I'm a human hunter"
---
3. As a warlock: Dueling people, talking with them, then casting \[Curse of Tongues\]
---
4. Abusing every gnome I see, with that auto-sit-stand macro (aka "fucking") in cat form. It worked best in instances and battlegrounds, the fastest sitstands. But, they "fixed" the macro, as sit/stand is now protected and requires a keypress. But, that was a fun way of spending time when deffing the flag in AB.
---
5. Joining a battleground and RPing inside
---
6. And the standard riding around the fountain in Stormwind, or trying to ride through the barrier maze at the bank, on epic mount, without slowing down, stopping or touching any of the barriers.
---
Ythisens went over this on recent classical. The first water cooler went through five steps of approval covering the span of a month before being sent to the blog. People need to realize this stuff
---
Right on the money.
---
It’s been obliquely referenced already but the question you should always ask is “when”. If you’re starting to progress through AQ40, you won’t need as much FR for MC as the baseline of your stats are a substitute form of FR. the general rule of thumb is when you just get into a dungeon, stack it as high as you can as you often won’t have resist gear for every slot.
---
The fun part comes from attacking the other faction and world pvp'ing with that gear you pleb.
---
Druid: Worst output as a healer, uses 1 spell with multiple ranks, can't do normal res, only really needed for buffs/innervate priests/BR/hibernate. Feral DPS is a fun niche tho - requires a LOT of farming and has very high skillcap but the gear wont help PvP as feral isn't great. Not great for premade AB as theres no flag to carry and does poorly in group PvP.
---
Rogue: Top DPS for MC and BWL, fun rotations, lots of gear to choose from (really cool looking gear too). Almost useless in premade AB as its weak in group fights, semi-decent base defender in normal AB but still contributes  less than others.
---
Hunter: mid-range dps until naxx where it becomes bottom, fun rotation, lots of gear to choose from, easy to solo elites and dungeons, only needed in raids for tranq shot so hard to get a spot. Pretty decent in AB, can cause a lot of disruption and eagle eye is underrated.
---
Oh boyo if you think wow players have issues then you should try this new RPG called IRL. 0/10 would not recommend.
---
&gt;to the bottom of the ocean
---
erm, was actually better with the Well of Eternity in Hyjal. It was known as "unaccessible". And, I was exploring it, and, while swimming into the lake, trying to find its bottom, I accidentally struggled upon a random gnome warlock. Then, we started shouting into all possible chat channels, that we are in Hyjal, and we can summon. This way, we drowned quite a nice raid :Ð it turned into the Well of Corpses.
---
For someone who started in 2015 i think you will get a shock how diffrent the game is. Mabe its worth checking some Private server to get a feel what you are getting into
---
OK, so fuck those people and don't cater then entiretynof classic around them since ethey will speed run this shit regardless of what is available to them?
---
Play an instant 60 server to kill some time and know the feel for each class @ 60
---
&gt; sithilius
---
aah well, the new trilogy was quite on time
---
They are fine in PvP, you can look up countless hunter videos showing them beating everything. Viper sting is the bane of caster's existence.
---
The PvE mentality of a lot of private server folk has been tainted, it is not true to the vanilla spirit imo. Hunters may not be DPS kings like a mage but are still sought after due to tranq shot.
---
The reality is you shouldn't pick a class based on their dps numbers unless you are playing in a hardcore guild. Seriously, the raids were not that hard, and obtaining 40 people was difficult, in vanila fashion they would invite people who weren't even level 60 to raids. Obviously it's gonna be different this time around because people have a sense of what is going on, but min/maxing to the point where you are playing a class that spams nothing but Frostbolt.. if you don't enjoy that playstyle why put yourself through that.
---
I can’t seem to find a ton of info on this: for Enh Shaman, how viable is healing dungeons while leveling until prob respeccing resto near 60? Anyone have a read on how fun healing as Shaman is vs Priest?
---
Night elf
---
You are gonna get a vast range of answers here discussing all the various details in some depth. But I'm not that convinced that's where the difference actually lies. When the game started first the focus was on building the WORLD of Warcraft. The classes weren't balanced, the quests weren't great, the progression was awkward and grind-locked but the World itself was deep and detailed. At the time, simply massive and completely unparalleled.
---
But, as is human nature, because the World was the best part the future expansions focused more on the other stuff. The stuff people were complaining about. The classes were brought into closer balance, the questing system was improved (or at least made more straightforward) and progression was smoother, albeit somewhat more linear as a result. But the World became flatter and less interesting.

This didn't happen all at once though, so you'll still find lots of people for whom Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King was the peak, simply because the overall focus of the game then suited them better. To my mind it went over a cliff after Wrath, but I'm sure you can find legions who would disagree with that too. They'd be wrong of course, but that's the nature of opinion,
---
Yes it's an actual MMO where grouping, trading, and PvP matter.
---
Hahaha thanks! You're correct, news is not exactly marketing. But they have a lot of processes and what have you in place, I don't think they let the devs share news without a good amount of marketing staff involved. Just speculation!
---
&gt;  it's not uncommon for the race to be completed really quickly on a private server
---
Can you name one? Because every war effort I've seen has dragged on for weeks. And I've been around for a while
---
I feel that's how it should be, but it's not.
---
I know there are scientific reasons for why the seasons fall on particular days but I don't see why it's so important.
---
Summer: June-August
---
Fall: September - November
---
Winter: December - February
---
Spring: March - May
---
Is so much more simple lol
---
Damn! I knew there was going to be a lot of process behind letting any news get out, but that's a lot!
---
I suppose it's easy to get burned if they day the wrong thing about this project, so staying quiet is a safe bet for them!
---
It’s best until BWL I think but there are tailoring specific enchants I believe that are BiS
---
I form my own groups, or at the very least find a tank first so we can dictate the rolling rules to the group as they join. I also warn the casters that, as a Druid, I will be rolling on gear with Stam/Int regardless of whether its Cloth or Leather.
---
You don't buy BoE rares/epics for levelling, you buy them for twinking. If the BoE has no value for twinking you can generally equip it as it will not sell for much anyway. Needless to say, with Nightblade being a 39 epic, it is a superb weapon for a 39 twink. Pendulum of Doom is better, but that one is even rarer and crazy expensive.
---
A lot of the pros are actually cons and vice versa, because it's ultimately preference that decides whether it is one or not. 
---
For example, there's a lot of downtime, which allows for more opportunities for socializing. If you can't appreciate that for whatever reason, that's a con. If you can, it's a pro. 
---
Similar goes for the need to manually group. For people with social anxiety, that's a con. For people thriving on approaching people, that's a pro. 
---
The amount of effort even mundane tasks sometimes require can give some people a sense of accomplishment, whereas other people just get tired by it. 
---
Server community is a big thing, as servers are isolated. That, too can swing both ways, as people can be a tribalist bunch. It also means less players to do things with, which leads back to the first point: Downtime. 
---
Classes had unique abilities, which on the one hand means that you have a strong class identity, on the other hand, you might need to bench someone for not being the right class. 
---
Personally, I'd say just give it a try once it's out. In the end, only you can tell if you'll like it or not. 
---
Nah man the devs are busy working on the game! Putting out a quality news update is more work and emotional investment than you might realize, especially when they jave to be very tip-toey around what they say they're thinking about classic.
---
This gives you plenty of time to start memorizing all the quests and planning exactly how you want to level your character.
---
Last summer I did ALL the quests in Mulgore for the first time ever and absolutely refused to leave until I did everything I could and got mining/skinning to 75. And I loved every minute of it. :D
---
A true man--living life just the way he wants and not giving a fuck what other people think. Like Boomkin players, I sir salute you Mr Russian.
---
Not the same by any stretch of the imagination, completely different games IMO.
---
I have played retail wow since vanilla in 2005 and left in MoP some time in 2013 because the game had become so unbearable. shortly after I found vanilla private servers and have been replaying this version of the game on different servers for the last 5 years and don't see myself ever getting bored of it.
---
Hard to explain why it's so much more rewarding to play because its just so different... but I hope you give it a go so you can experience it yourself! GL ;)
---
Enh healing is very viable, and actually Enhance tanking is viable too in 5 mans theoretically.
---
I think both Shaman and Priest are equally fun healers. Priest probably has a higher skill cap as Shamans will mostly be chain healing and dropping totems close to melee in raids, whereas Priests have a plethora of healing spells to choose from.
---
PvP healing-wise I would probably prefer to play a 30/0/21 ele/resto  Shaman over a Priest, but it's personal preference really.
---
Precisely. I work in customer service / technical support, there are so many ways consumers can take things the wrong way. Sometimes not saying anything at all is better than trying to promise anyting
---
It's a different game, the pacing and shift in playstyle will be jarring to a lot of people who started recently. 
---
The gameplay is generally slow, boring, and unrewarding when compared to BfA. 
---
You will have to run everywhere, and most quest zones are absurdly far from the next logical hub.
---
Grinding mobs is a viable leveling strategy.
---
Many talents offer minuscule % changes in basic stats.
---
Weapon skill levels.
---
Blues will be rarer than purples are today. Many people will never even equip an Epic quality item.
---
Gold will be valuable again, might consider just running instead of shelling out for a flight path.
---
These are pros or cons depending on how you'd like classic. I'm sure other guys here can add stuff to the list but I encourage you and anyone else curious to at least give it a shot. 
---
Not always that easy. Kicking people and replacing them in vanilla is far more time consuming. If someone is needing on stuff they dont need but the run is smooth otherwise, it's easier to just finish the run and then block the guy later. Unless it's a  max lvl dungeon. Then sure, I'd drop em.
---
The biggest difference between the games. Is that classic wow was made before they decided they knew what MMO's were. The problem with later expansions is they decided MMO's were "raiding" and "pvp". So everything is balanced around just dropping you off at the point of where you can start raiding and getting into competitive pvp. In the new design everything else is just "noise". At least thats how it feels to us classic players.
---
The beauty of classic is that it's not made like that. The leveling is satisfying and demands your attention. It's a real part of your journey as a character. It's not an after thought you are simply required to slog through to get to the "real" game.
---
Dungeons are long and for new players quite hard. Especially if they are un-nerfed. You have to communicate work together focus on the right targets and keep the secondary targets controlled. Dungeons aren't just an after thought their to get your gear for the raids. They are slow and difficult and demand attention in their own right.
---
Even the PVP is more serious. When you can't get on a mount and ride away. Or the guards aren't strong enough to kill all your foes in one hit. The enemy faction can shut down entire zone hubs and they do. This also demands attention and actual fights in the world break out over territory and resources. Everyone who's good and geared who could lead the pvp isn't stowed away in some RBG que. They are in the world leading war bands.  This does go down a bit after the BG patch but it's still a thing.
---
Honestly the greatest part about classic wow isn't the game it self. At the end of the day we are all at our key boards mashing buttons. What makes classic wow so memorable is the social interactions it helped to foster.
---
The world being large meant if you were a Warlock or Mage people might ask your for help. Tanks being hard and no dungeon finder meant. If you were a capable tank. People would greet when you logged in to say hello and foster good relations with you. If you were a healer people would request your services in guild because they can't find one.
---
People needed each other then. It made the game more fun simple as that. Any one just talking mechanics or how many buttons you push. Is missing the point of what made classic so amazing. It's incredibly accessible while allowing for deep levels of mastery. Classic is in short a classic.
---
It also removes the chance that someone accidentally needs.  Even in Everquest on Agnarr the vast majority of loots are need, or you can choose to pass.  All BoE loot is just as useful to everyone in the group as the one or two people that can immediately equip it.  That’s why its tradeable to begin with, so a motherfucker can trade it.
---
On ND we had a Foror's book drop in DM:E, most of the group rolled need on it but the tank was very upset that he lost it and thought he should get it. It wasn't reserved or anything, I won it and I did feel kind of bad because the guy was literally begging me for it but the book was going for 450G on the AH, that's a lot of gold to pass on just to be nice to some random pug that you'll never see again. If it was a friend of guildie I would pass, but IMO when it's hundreds of gold on the line it's free game, that's half your epic mount money right there.
---
He ended up continuing the run and tried to ninja a drop from me but lost the roll, as if ninjaing a BOP pre bis item is the same as an epic that can be bought on the AH.
---
I'm anxious about rolling on a server that ends up being imbalanced or low pop
---
Should be 6 phases minimum
---
Lmfao are you dumb? Unlike you, I played actual Vanilla and have been vanilla private servers such as Nostalrius. You under estimate how long it takes to fully deck your guild through said raid content that is out atm. I am not talking about MC and Onyxia these will be cleared with ease. AQ40 and Naxx and BWL are a different story. You clearly don't know Vanilla's itemization so I won't waste time any more on you. Go google then get back to me once you have more experience and knowledge with Vanilla.
---
shadow priest is the best 1v1 class.
---
Truth
---
For an edgemasters to reach a 2k-5k price you'd have to have a well established economy; not a launch server economy.  Just because market rarity might dictate a higher price, it doesn't mean the server can sustain that price.  Enjoy the AH fees slowly wittling down your stash of gold.
---
I didn't know this, and I'm with you, it really does seem odd.  Blizzard's marketing (the team they just gutted) and PR (the head of PR was amongst the layoffs too which no one mentions - they basically don't have a PR team in NA at the moment, or just a skeleton crew) baffles more often than not.
---
Would a banner ad or small thing somewhere saying 'WoW Classic coming Summer 2019!' on the WoW page kill them? How does that hurt? Or a link to the announcement video if that's not there? I'm not sure.
---
People are suggesting it could confuse people visiting the site, but I really could not see that happening.
---
Do they owe us news/hype? No.
---
Should they still release some kind of news/hype? Yes.
---
80% of your server will be composed of Warriors, Rogues, Mages and Hunters. This is basically a fact. 
---
Warriors and Rogues because they’re top dps throughout all vanilla and they’re good in pvp.
---
Mages because they’re top tier basically in everything from pve to pvp to farming. And portals are a godsend in Vanilla. 
---
Hunters are so popular mainly because they’re so braindead easy to level and they’re also good for farming and solo play. But they’re actually bottom tier dps and not amazing in pvp. 
---
Thus were the hard times.
---
What class beats SL warlock with eng?
---
I would say it's better the old way for people with social anxiety. Because all you had to do was concentrate on being as amazing as possible. Then other people would try to talk with you so they can get your help. In the new game if you have social anxiety. You might get a group fast but you'll be alone forever. Completely connected and completely alone lol.
---
So simple, yet so freaking true.
---
Even though I plan on racing to 60 I hope for a nice slow burn.  I’d be perfectly happy to wait a full year for Naxxramas 
---
Oh god, triggered now about Sulfuras. I got the first Horde one on Arthas and was immediately grateful to the alliance for giving like 6 of them to Paladins.
---
I mean I can see where your coming from, but I never thought of someone as an asshole for ganking me while I was leveling.   It’s just part of the game for me. 
---
I don’t see myself as an asshole when my friends and I would travel to a horde territory, let’s say the crossroads, and take it over, while we waited for people from org to come and try and stop us. I just see it as playing the game the way blizzard intended.  If they didn’t want this happening they would of made all of the servers pve.  Or at least made it so the opposing faction couldnt go to lower level territories and do this (why would they allow this if they didn’t want it?!)
---
I loved leveling in red ridge and some horde would be there ganking.  Next thing you know a bunch of geared alliance would fly over from SW and try and put a stop to them.  That is awesome.  
---
I loved getting ganked and then camped on my alts.  I would always park my main close by and go crush them, or at least try too.
---
Idk my fondest memories of wow are from wpvp back on the day.  If you want to call me an asshole (or yourself one) for playing this way that’s fine.  I just think it’s part of the game and I’ll leave it at that.  
---
The lack of beta is whats getting to me the most. I get they have a full 1.12 server to compare things to. Still i would be nice to get in and get atleast some time in the game and get raids or quests done. Run though the progression they want to see how bad or good it may be. Hell even an open Beta for a week or 2 to get some idea of intrest and how many servers they may need would be something i would atleast like to hear about at this point.
---
it's probably going to be dicey as shadow priest, as the optimal way of having shadow weaving is to bring a shadow weaving healer priest. You're gonna have to go above and beyond bringing every consumable imaginable too. If it really appeals to you I'd suggest finding a guild now that will accept you, that way you won't have to worry.
---
warlock is great but bear in mind you have to farm heaps of soul shards before every raid, and their rotation is boring.
---
I probably wouldn't play hunter if your friend has already chosen it,   you'd just contest each other's loot.
---
It was directed at the player. 
---
&gt; I don’t think it’s crazy for all to Need a BoE in a PUG. Avoids BS.
---
In my experience on PServers it lead to more BS. A whole lot of "accidental" needs on BOP items everyone swears is an accident because they thought it said BoE....
---
Its a nightmare. Im glad to be done with it.
---
Me too i want hight graphics...
---
Warlocks have a very simplistic rotation, and in actuality they are more of a support/DPS class since most of their playstyle is helping others DPS through curses and soulstone/healhstoning/summoning.
---
Hunters have probably the highest skill cap rotation in vanilla, weaving in abilities in between auto shots is actually refreshing compared to the other ranged dps rotations. They also have a high skill cap in PvP, a lot of class mechanics need to be learned and they have a lot of CC options if you master them.
---
Bingo. They’re really two different gamers at this point. 
---
I envy your resolve
---
200+ hours in and still going over here.  The well is only as dry as you make it!
---
Always fun when people in Westfall LFG for VC but say “DM” instead. 
---
Yea I know about the rotation being simplistic in raiding because of debuff slots and sb spam but I meant more of a skill cap in regards to pvp scenarios. I love the fact that they have support debuffs like curses. Hunters seem similar with their different stings and aspects + trapping before combat.
---
Rags and domo 0:
---
I think Horde has slight advantage, but don't forget Ashenvale or Hillsbrad. Both can be difficult for Horde.
---
there are better classes to play if you won't be raiding. Rogues and Mages come to mind. Warriors require gear, there's no way around it, if you aren't raiding you will do laughable damage and be kited to oblivion.
---
I played with this for fun. Here was my max. Inspiration and Ancestral Healing don't stack though.

Sa-fear-e-on

relax cunt
---
You belong on BFA
---
Would it be possible for them to just change the item id on the cloth? Then require that new ID for turn-in. Then you don't need the pre-fix and it looks like wow as usual.
---
Why do you care? You're entire argument is some hilarious retail baby shit. If the top player's want to burn through the content in a year why do you give a shit?
---
How about instead of the content babying you so you can do it "not rushed" you let the raiders do it how ever the fuck we want.
---
Dont downvote the truth people, we do seem to hate using easy and simple measurements. Fudge, I wasnt even taught the metric system in school.
---
You'll see if you ever even hit 60
---
What I think would have been a good idea to do was to have an old school dev diary running.  
---
We all know what's in the game, absolutely, so I'm with you on why we got all the BFA info vs. very little Classic info.  But an extrapolation of the kind of chat we got in the Classic panel at Blizzcon would have been gold.
---
A weekly or fortnightly 300-500 word blog on 'Hey, we really struggled coding mob X this week but here's how we got it in the end', or 'we've been playing molten core all week this week because that's the area we're currently working on' etc.  Just those tiny little tidbits would satiate the community, and not much thought would have needed to go into it.  I mean, even a Twitter account would probably do the trick for that if a blog is a stretch.
---
FF 1 for a pre-1990 award
---
Thanks, I'll check out the wiki. I am curious to see how the scaling stacks up with other classes' aoe. 
---
Set on Dwarf Rogue.. but maybe Gnome Rogue? Thoughts on their differences etc. I like dwarf attack animations but dislike the finishers. Opposite with Gnomes. 
---
Totally depends on the particular item. 
---
Yeah I definitely don't put any blue post in the 'news' category.  We're working on it and we'll tell you soon doesn't do much.
---
Definitely agree.  I still have SAD (social anxiety disorder) but playing WoW back in early TBC and wrath made me learn that its not as painful as I thought it would be to chat and make friends in parties and in a guild.  In retail, its still /possible/ but not as likely.  Every guild I've joined from WoD to BFA, I've never even gotten to know anyone besides their name.  
---
&gt; You now shot yourself in the leg by cutting the dungeon run short or having to wait for someone to fill the ninja's spot
---
Pretty sure you'll fill that spot a lot faster than the ninja gets in a group. Maybe the little thief will learn a lesson.
