I loved BGs in Cata. I did arena 2 and 3 mans but never got the swing of them. Still got my full BiS pvp gear the slow way like you mentioned haha.
---
---
---
No problem :) thanks for reading!
---
And how do you think that WoW token you bought came into existence?
---
My friend was in a band with his dad back when we were kids and it was called Boogereater. Real shit.
---
&gt;And if you look on the history of their recent decisions... 
---

---
Yeah remember all that monetization in Sekiro?
---
No, /p "All need" is common practice and the most fair way of going about BoE Blue+ Rarity items. There's no guarantee that someone who needs on an item will actually use it and not just sell it themselves. And since the value of the item is equal to all members, there's no reason why they shouldn't.
---
 And no, this doesn't go for BoPs as well, vendoring a BoP is the same as throwing it in the trash and any gold gained from it is essentially zero. BoPs should always be "need if you need" because the value of the item is contained to all present members at time of drop, and you lose nothing if you don't receive a BoP that you can't use anyway.
---
&gt; I'm very good at it. If need, then need. If greed, then greed. What more do you need to form deduction and thus an if-then argument?
---
I will walk you through it slowly.
---
Suppose we all agree that  the best use of the system is to all Need on valuable BoEs.
---
Do you think we are unaware of the fact that "Need and Greed are *supposed to be different*"? That would be a very weird belief.
---
It is much more likely that we completely understand the intent of the system, but are thinking on a higher level about how best to use the system as it exists to get the best outcomes.
---
&gt; Unless of course you're talking complete bollocks and just hoping I won't call you on it.
---
I think you are projecting. I think you wildly over-committed to a position you now realise is untenable, and you are trying to bluster your way out of it.
---
That's why you have alts to rotate through!
---
It's the exception not the norm though, 98% of the time you'll be spamming one skill.
---
&gt;yeh just gotta buy all the expansions
---
They only sell the latest expansion, everything else is included.
---
If you wanna play BFA right now without owning any other piece of WoW content it costs you 20$ total and that includes BFA + every other expansion released + the base game + a free month + a level 110 boost.
---
Leveling as Warlock is a lot more intense in Classic than private servers. VW does not hold ANY aggro at all, it might hold for 2-3 levels at each level milestone(10, 20, 30, etc.) when he gets a new rank of Torment, but beyond that(and especially at higher gear lvl with +spellpower gear), it will struggle hard.
---
You are better off using Imp for the DPS, VW is good for PvP though thanks to the bubble.
---
When my beta Orc got to Org I danced my ass off on that bank roof.
---
God bless Org Bank.
---
This depends highly on the item in questions's value.
---
IIRC he had alliance buffs so kings which horde wont have, and he had wisdom over mana spring, but missed out on manaTIDE. Overall seems like a fair representation of the spec and shows just how BAD it is for PVE.
---
What happened to your old account mr beethoven and hows the &lt;BLACKLIST&gt; coming along?
---
actually kind of feel the opposite, at least for certain races like forsaken. Starts out with a very clear narrative and theme (ofc you have your 'kill these spiders' q's as well), lots of interesting lore and stories and including silverpine forrest it almost feels like a standalone game and story about the survival of these broken people that will eventually prevail and get their revenge, or perish and become extinct. Almost like playing WOTLK before it was released.
---
then it kind of fizzles out with crossroads,stonetalon, gather these flowers, kill these elementals, and at least from a RP perspective it kind of feels odd and out of place, like weren't you going to kill Arthas? I guess it plays out differently for say an Orc.
---
Either way there are great questlines at every level and zone, but the i feel like the starting zones and 20-ish feels more structured and complete. After that you're just doing all kind of crazy shit.
---
so for most people, it's 50 every time, but once a month it's 45.
---
Quite simply one of the very best and organized gaming communities on planet Earth. Just the sheer number of amazing people in one place to game is mind blowing.
---
Trust me, you've never experienced the height of gaming until you find a group of like minded gamers that you can play games with and launch huge titles with for years and years and years. No more looking for the next cliche guild in the next big game.
---
Always game with people you know ... always game with friends. Always surround yourself with support, commaraderie and good times. Never allow yourself to be judged or ridiculed.
---
Come as you are ... be who you are ... and let's have a great f**cking time!
---
Peace
---
I wish this was actually effective, but in my experience people don't really care that some lvl 27 warlock rolled need on that rogue twink BiS dagger to list it on AH. It seems like there's only ever repercussions on your rep if you're ninja'ing raids or high level dungeons.
---
.
---
Soo... Kek?
---
Is there a class where procs are the norm? 
---
In retail, I'm messing with several classes and my favourite so far is fury warrior because of the amount of procs and non-consistant rotation, I don't have enough vanilla knowledge to know if they are any non-repetitive classes
---
&gt;Suppose we all agree that the best use of the system is to all Need on valuable BoEs.
---
We don't. So your entire point is already lost.
---
If this is the extent of the opsec safeguards you have in place, a mere IP check, I guarantee you that all your key players will be flagged for investigation and probably banned.
---
This is 2019, not 2006. Virtualization and IP masking is not going to save you.
---
&gt; Any group I am leader of it will be everyone rolls need on anything BoE. Period. It's BoE.
---
You literally said that.
---
Naxx was one of four 40-man raids, one of three "full tier" raids, and the last raid of the expansion. If anything, it represented the most refined implementation of what the developers expected raiding to be in vanilla.
---
Isnt part of classic determining whether or not people are trustworthy or scum of earth? I feel like needing boe rare drops and equipping them proves that and if they dont, now you know who to avoid?
---
Shards are not an issue while lvling.  You get them too easy, since you DS everything for the spirit buff, and you consume them relatively rarely.  It's completely the opposite at lvl 60 pvp.  In pve it's a little better since you still have trash to clear, but if you are wiping a lot and the trash isn't respawned then it'll be painful too.
---
He isn't technically wrong and you are playing dumb if you cant understand that.
---
By his known metrics of the current playerbase (who he was speaking to) the idea of Classic is one that doesnt make sense. The kind of person excited about the latest LFR wing being released isn't clamoring for WoW Classic to release.
---
The problem is you think he is talking to you when in reality he is talking to the current playerbase that is the same group who flipped their collective shit when they tried to remove flying mounts from the game.
---
i wasn't expecting to hit exalted by 40 (or 60). I just figured the added rep from leveling over there would save considerable time compared to farming runecloth at 60. I've gotta level anyways, i'd rather earn 1k along the way then have to farm all that runecloth
---
Those things aren't mutually exclusive. You can work hard, play a lot, and also not feel obliged to play due to daily tasks within game. Any game that makes playing a chore has failed.
---
Is this a system of it’s own?  As in, you are not using a remote desktop software of any sort to run this on that handheld device?
---
Yuck, I plan to level tailoring skinning, make my robe and some bags, drop tailoring, and just ignore the 2% crit, too much work to relevel a skill to 300 for me
---
Reported it thanks
---
If you join a guild that clears MC/BWL in a night then you're being carried.
---
If you put in the work to get a guild to MC/BWL clears in a single night, then you're putting in the work mentioned.
---
Kevin Jordan talked about this in his reaction from Ion's QnA. Basically said once you go for this 'egg timer' design, the game isn't about having fun anymore.
---
I've wanted one of these for a long time.  Classic might get me to pull the trigger.
---
You don't have to buy any expansion. Trial accounts can be activated by merely paying the monthly sub. This gives you every expansion up through Legion, so you only miss BFA. Legion characters are able to make gold too, in fact legion world quests give more gold than BFA ones. You may not be rolling in gold, but it should be enough to pay for a token each month.
---
Eh. I for one liked to bring along a noob or two when farming dungeons for a specific drop so that all the loot doesn't get sharded. That being said it wastes relying on the people not rolling because you're giving them free gear doesn't always go well.
---
Eventually you get a boe epic that wasn't specified in your reserve list or realize how much money you've lost on shards and regret it, but its still fun to help people get some of their first 60 blues. Plus maybe they become not noobs and remember the help you gave them.
---
Memes aside it's disappointing to see them being so negative, they were the biggest proponents of classic a month ago.
---
in classic everybody needs gold so for BoE i have always gone with need as a default. however it is not the instant need i did TBC and WotLK. you would wait and inspect the person if it is a small upgrade or there more upgrades on the way i would just need since gotta make that money.
---
this is for pugs if it is guild stuff or friends or just partly i will roll need and then trade it if i win since you never know when sombody tries backstab the group for some quick gold but i can trust myself to agree to the deal i made and it is better to have more rolls to ensure no ninja looting happens.
---
The obvious answer to people who don't want changes at all is to just stick to private servers. Like yeah Blizzard doesn't really care whether Classic realms are 100% authentic or not, it's about what makes them the most money, and I really wouldn't be surprised if enough of the Classic playerbase demands changes enough for Blizzard to actually implement them. 
---
The hard fact is MMORPGs have never been that popular, and WoW managed to be the only truly successful MMORPG because it's goal was to simplify the formula down enough so anyone can get into it. Given that, I think since 2004 people have become even less fond of grindy rpgs given the prevalence of instant gratification games becoming so massively successful in the recent years, which is why modern WoW became what it is to try and modernize. So I think that, not only will the modern WoW players want more features that heavily streamlines everything in Classic, so will most other people getting into it that aren't the minority of 30+ year old vanilla veterans. Shit I'm sure the OG Everquest players felt the same way about WoW when it came out as vanilla vets feel about modern WoW, trends change is the reality of the situation.
---
Tbh I don't see a difference between needing a pattern for yourself or your alt (unless what it crafts has a skill requirement or is BoP). A flask recipe works the same for whether my current character has alchemy or my alt does.
---
Yep. Its a sad state. At least ff is a blast
---
Don't tunnel vision tanking... On the tanking spec?
---
Yeah no shit. Learn to communicate. Don't take everything so literally.
---
OMG You said the gold value would be more than the stats  but there's no way you could guarantee that statement without because someone could still be wearing a level 18 leather belt! So that's totally not true. Mhmm.
---
I think it was panda jc. Gems going for a half of cut vendor. Even better make necks and rings for 10x profit
---
It's basically a baby laptop
---
You can have your opinion but calling people greedy fucks for disagreeing is a bit shitty.
---
I think its fair to ALL members of the party especially considering that selling a BoE could mean that player is able to buy themselves a Pre-BiS (or sometimes BiS) BoE item themselves. 
---
Sometimes the item that drops isn't pre-bis for anybody so its better off sold to someone else instead of having four other players miss an opportunity just to see the item wasted on a player who doesn't understand that they could sell the item and buy a better one for their class from the AH.
---
Vanilla gearing is too irregular to say whether an item really is worth equipping especially when most people just don't know any better. I would rather see a fair roll and the winner do as they please with it.
---
&gt;I never said how long should they stay out, I said how long can we expect
---
I never said how long they should stay out, I AM SAYING HOW LONG I EXPECT.
---
The model works because of what it is, changing the formula is what leads to them losing the product in the first place.
---
&gt;never underestimate how multi billion dollar companies will screw you over
---
Screw us over? Bruh they are as you say a multi billion dollar company, they are not releasing Classic for the good of mankind. They are releasing it because it makes financial sense and despite the short term advantage of microtransactions in a game like that it has far reaching implications on the model that hurt its overall market.
---
There is no question their thoughts on monetization are based on greed, the point is it makes far more sense financially to create a sustainable subscription model that works rather than trying to wring it out and possibly ruining the original already successful model they have working.
---
No companies are doing anyone favors, all decisions are financial and if they choose not to add microtransactions to classic its not because they care for /u/Unchainedboar but because they think 15$ from 4 million players who enjoy the current monetization model is more lucrative than 1 million players that stomach further monetization.
---
Simple as that.
---
Super neat.  I’d like to learn more about its battery life and if it overheats fast
---
&gt; Most elitists arent as good as they think and like to critique every little thing.
---
This is the truth. Had to turn off a podcast I was listening to today because the hosts, who described themselves as 'elite players' had no fucking idea how anything worked mechanically in the game.
---
No, but I don't care to go into more detail. Our strategy solves every automated flagging system. The only thing left is the human element, which can be solved with "hi again, yes, I'm still playing" and screenshotting the conversations for everyone to read.
---
i think it gets even better after you can pull 3-4 mobs same time with dire bear
---
I wouldnt mind new raids at naxx ilvls catered to offspec gear, ala AQ40. that would be pretty cool.
---
[removed]
---
Argent Dawn isn’t phase 1 though, is it? I thought I heard that, but I might be crazy.
---
I knew about the game but didn’t start playing until after I saw this commercial. Good memories.
---
That's what the math says to do, but to be honest try both and have fun with it! That's what I'm going to do.
---
That's a different guy, but we're friends. Blacklist addon is coming along swimmingly, but I'm not a part of it's development.
---
you need gold in classic lots of it infact even as a casual that 1000g stings real bad. from randos i expect needs on BoE since the gold is too hard to pass up. the only time i expect diffrent is those big upgrades where a easier one isn't comming soon situations where somthing allows you to go do harder content etc. that is when i pass my roll.
---
Your observational skills are truly outstanding. In the midst of a thread full of people arguing over this exact point, you have figured out all by yourself that not everyone agrees on this point.
---
But let us get back to the core issue. Do you understand that buttons on the interface are not Holy Writ, and that the correct way to understand their best use is not to ponder them and try to divine the omniscient intent behind them, but rather to look to the consequences?
---
If everyone needs on blue/purple BoEs then ninja looting is impossible, everyone's expected benefit is identical, and no value is wasted. There is literally no downside. It is a good outcome.
---
I agree that leveling blues tend to be need over greed, but epics should be free roll since that could make or break a mount purchase which imo is more important than a replaceable item.
---
Once you get into endgame and the realm
---
of pre-bis vs. non pre-bis items I say it's better to free roll on BoEs to avoid confusion, complication, conflict and dilemma.
---
The poster of the videos said he plays for 3 hours it gets warm but it has been completely fine for him
---
You think right.
---
Best time to get one!
---
Okay. I don’t like BFA... but that’s actually cool looking. Reminds me of a Lord of Change.
---
Huhuran and Naxx beyond the mind control boss.
---
The sad truth is that the mount ISNT a piece of shit. Its really cool actually. However, with the stigma that comes with it being a store mount, its instantly shit. Sad. You paid for 6 months of game time to get that tho? Do you play retail?
---
It's not going to return to what it was, that's true. They might take a few suggestions from Classic, but it's never going back. People should realize that.
---
It would be nice though if they have some progression servers up through WOLTK. Some have suggested Classic takes a new path, putting in content that never existed. That might be interesting, but I feel like that opens up doors to an in-game store to supplement the income. Once we stray off "authentic", then they can put in anything. There was no in-game store until MoP.
---
According to that "4chan leak" WoW has less than 1 mill subs, making 144k subs a pretty big chunk. /s
---
Rofl Mage is the single most boring class in WoW bar none, if you want to play a class which is literally relegated to 1 button spamming play a mage; the most exciting part of your raid will be the first 30 seconds when open trade with you for water.
---
Consider what gold really does end game, lets people respec and repair.
---
lol. yeah okay. Anyone who becomes "not noobs anymore" is just gonna remember the time some douches tried to rob them of their only opportunity at an extremely rare and valuable item. Probably the only item in that dungeon that has lasting value. I'm really gonna look at those players fondly.
---
They sacrifice their fans loyalty for short term gains regularly
---
I truly hope you're right and they never come in, I just have no faith on blizzard as a company anymore
---
how about double prep rogue with eng? just asking tbh, I read someone was capping flags this way
---
That's strange, he disappeared, you magically appeared, and you're identical. Imagine that!
---
As a tank I will be doing the same as I will be constructing my groups. I will not get mad if the paladin healer wants to roll on dps gear for their pvp set, I will not have issues with other offset rolling it is only fair.
---
Only difference is that all BoEs will be need unless we agree otherwise.
---
Tough to get in groups even harder to get loot.
---
I have never at any point contested that people don't agree on this point.
---
I also have never disagreed that the intentions are holy writ. I specify they're there for a reason, you can disagree with that reason if you like, but in doing so you nullify the reason.
---
You're free to do that no different than I'm free to shit on my bosses desk.
---
i needed on BoEs in vanilla but it wasn't an insant need like you did in TBC and WotLK there is consideration there inspection the player pleading the group.
---
it is better to default on need for BoEs but always considering the situation.
---
Warcraft 3!
---
I don't see them taking the time when going for world firsts after every wipe. Speed runs sure
---
Seems like an awfully complicated way to play the class just to say that you have "10 buttons or less". Remembering a plethora of shift / ctrl / alt keycombos seems like a pain in the ass.
---
&gt;©
---
easier does not mean better. Some like tto be challenged
---
Yeah the current playerbase doesn't want classic, but a huge number of people do, what does it matter if they are in the current playerbase or not
---
They would rather all the people who want classic don't play live anymore cause that just means you will bring that many more people back
---
ITS east, and they are called lashers
---
DPS isn't really something to be worried about.  Feral druids don't need weapon skills and are immune to disarm.  So they're going to have an easier time doing damage regardless of the actual amount of damage.
---
Plus you can heal yourself and get 30% move speed.  Feral is OP for leveling, almost as good as hunters, I wouldn't worry too much about damage.
---
those are not mutually exclusive
---
Killed the beta, not classic
---
Why bother greeding when somebody could just decide to be a dickhead and steal it by needing? Nobody *needs* an expensive epic BoE, anyone could sell it and it'd be useful.
---
lmao its a picture old as time, with a garbage filter on it. 
---
Someone actually gilded this too
---
Wow 10/10 can't believe I didn't think of that one. JEEEZ
---
Identical how? And judging by his last post, there's quite a large gap you're missing.
---
I feel so dumb! lol
---
Your situation is completely different and fair. Your are fairly manipulating the group so you can roll without upsetting others. He specifically said he will take a melee DPS and roll on both DPS and tank gear. That's not fair one bit.
---
Get epic mount, get boe's that are best in slot, cover enchants and tipping the people doing the enchants, raid consumables
---
Why bother not stealing from someone when somebody could just decide to steal it without asking you?
---
I don't get it. If you meant the exact of what you typed then why even type it?
---
Are they still scaling well with agi &amp; str gear in the beta?
---
You're really gonna want to hit that sprint button when you're getting around out in the world, especially pre-mount levels. Don't. Keep those cooldowns ready to go as often as possible. They can make or break an encountered with the enemy faction.
---
You're right, you totally just stumbled into classicwow as a fresh redditor less than 2 weeks old and started posting 50 times a day.
---
I've got what you need!
---
It's a giant chicken, people can't realistically expect it to be good.
---
&gt; I also have never disagreed that the intentions are holy writ. I specify they're there for a reason, you can disagree with that reason if you like, but in doing so you nullify the reason.
---
Okay. So what exactly do you think is bad about "nullifying the reason", that trumps more concrete concerns about getting good outcomes?
---
You claim you are not treating the buttons as a sacred text, but you sure seem to think it is heretical to "nuliify the reason".
---
&gt; You're free to do that no different than I'm free to shit on my bosses desk.
---
What valid argument-form is this, o master of reason and fallacies? *Argumentum ad Crimsonak can shit on it*?
---
Because i'm talking about shit that matters. You're thinking about shit that doesn't matter. That's the difference.
---
Yeah it’s just a mini laptop with console buttons :)
---
Oh I'm not fresh, but /u/beethoventhemage isn't me. I know his new account and I'm not outing him. I'm sure he'll be pleased to know you hold him in such high regard.
---
Yeah, cool... to earn in game as a revard.
---
The difference with some BOE items is that literally the best option for any partner member is to sell it. For example staff of jordan can be used by a party member sure, but that party member would get more value out of it if he sold it on the AH. Anyone can sell it one the AH though, why shouldn't the others get to roll on it then?
---
Cats all the way for PvP
---
It's as simple as this: "Will the players allow it?"
---
The reason why we have to deal with selling cosmetics and other things like that in games nowadays is because people buy it and the people that are against it stopped criticizing developers for it. "B-But it's just cosmetics!" don't give me that shit. If players are willing to pay for cosmetics everything that you don't have to pay for will look like shit. You can see this in virtually any game that sells cosmetics. Just look at Guild Wars 2.
---
As far as character services go, server transfers are the only thing they should allow in Classic. Any more than that will have a negative impact on the community aspect of the game because people can wipe their slate clean with a race, gender or namechange. Part of what makes Classic what it is, is that you know people by their names and characters.
---
I really want to believe in Blizzard and they are doing a good job with Classic so far but there's still a part of me that thinks "if they think they can get away with it, they will do it."
---
That's botting, not account sharing.
---
Eh.
---
Oh I know he's had new accounts since then, he stands out more than anyone else here. LOL.
---
What do I think is bad about diverting from need is need and need is greed? Anything else is subjective. Its really simple.
---
And it is valid.
---
Be careful. I'm sure the neck beards of classicwow will hunt you down for saying games can change over 15 years. 
---
Also I'm pretty sure the mods will ban you for not furthering the "classic our way or no way" circle jerk here.
---
But I 100% agree with you. Times have changed. Those who this classic will be wildly successful as it was back in 2004 are the same people who hate fortnight for being so kid friendly. 
---
"Back in my day, we had to grind for a month, uphill both ways, in order to get a new skin! And we liked it!"
---
It can't be "stolen" if everyone needs it. It's fair game at that point.
---
Of course it's not like you literally cannot auto attack the enemy without engineering, but there are many extremely OP pvp gadgets, so..
---
most fears / snares have a long cooldown so its not that big of a deal imo
---
The fact that you think he's so well hidden is hilarious.
---
&gt;Yeah the current playerbase doesn't want classic, but a huge number of people do, what does it matter if they are in the current playerbase or not
---
Because thats who he was talking to, its who he caters to.
---
This was a response given to people at Blizzcon at a Warcraft panel in 2017, its safe to say he isn't talking to a crowd of people who quit playing 13 years ago. He is speaking to current players and fans still logging in everyday and the metrics show these people are not going to be the ones jumping into Classic.
---
&gt;They would rather all the people who want classic don't play live anymore cause that just means you will bring that many more people back
---
What in the ever loving fuck are you talking about, you assign such petty nonsense logic to this kind of shit when in reality they are a business and would love anyone and everyone to play their game and pay them if they could convince them to.
---
Only a child thinks a company making a product is spiteful enough to hope it fails.
---
Why do people answer so defensively all the time lol. He was asking for a simple confirmation from someone on the beta.
---
Is this your first time using the internet? [Check this link please.](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=classic+wow+gold+to+respec)
---
OK. Then need on everything and greed is irrelevant.
---
WinGPD ftw
---
You need them for tranq shot, but don't expect to top the meters especially in later raids.
---
At least since auto-shot is...well it's in the name, automated, so you can go afk during some fights and still do most of your dps.
---
I seem to recall they actually added a hidden quest that uses that necklace in Legion.
---
Its not about loyalty, again you seem too slow to understand the implication.
---
&gt;I truly hope you're right and they never come in, I just have no faith on blizzard as a company anymore
---
This much is clear, perhaps find a new target for your nonsensical angst?
---
Probably will end up like the vanilla pservers; niche group of ~10k players.
---
just a heads up there are totally pservers that combine horde/alliance, especially one of the more popular insta-60 servers. they can group and talk with each other normally, to make it easier to get groups together for the raids and stuff
---
How is it stealing if everyone wants a shot at the item? If a pet drops that nobody has and everybody wants, why wouldn't everyone just decide to hit need and remove the possibility of someone just hitting greed?
---
No it isn't. If you've got 3 people playing on the exact same machine and a GM whispers one of them, the other 2 need to know what was discussed.
---
To me it depends on what is the best use for that item. If it's for example a BIS twink item for some bracket then the best use for it is to sell it for gold. Even if someone in the group can use is as an upgrade, his best option would still be to sell it since that brings him the most value in other items/mounts etc. At that point I don't see why he should get priority on it since anyone can sell it on the AH.
---
Is it faster than other mounts or something? I can't imagine ANYTHING that would make you say "It's actually really cool"
---
How is it stealing if everyone wants to own it but only one person gets to use it?
---
loool this is some new age asmongold bs, like didn't he just have a stream about it 5 hours ago where he said exactly this?
---
 The norm was, and is, "if you need it, you need" . Might be different from servers, groups etc. But it was definetly the norm in EU. It was, however, also normal to ask "mind if i need?" on BoE's. Now i'm not gonna say that this isn't all thrown out the window when Freezing Band drops or that your system is worse, but the norm was greed on everything you don't need and need if need. People were way more unconditional back then and locked to the rules and etiquette, even if they made sense or not. (Might have changed in later vanilla).
---
Yo, someone toss OP a ban for art thievery.

The only people he's hiding from are the mods, they've banned him like 8 times now.
---
I'm going tailoring for bags and shadow gear, keeping it because I'm lazy. Leveling mining as I level and switching to engineering at later levels when I feel like it will improve my pvp enough to make a difference. I don't know much about engineering.

A fantasy mmo to scratch the itch of a fantasy mmo. How about that..
---
Because I read [his attitude](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6ou1o/does_anyone_know_when_elemental_wrath_gear_enters/esa6s4t/) in the comments below and responded in kind.
---
&gt; What do I think is bad about diverting from need is need and need is greed? Anything else is subjective. Its really simple.
---
So you are deducing by pure reason with no subjectivity at all the designer's intent, and then deducing by pure reason with no subjectivity at all that the best thing we can do is to follow that intent?
---
Like I said above, I wish this was actually effective. There only seems to be repercussions if someone ninja's a raid or a high level dungeon. It doesn't seem feasible for the player-base to police this stuff without any organization; even if people really cared, they just forget in a week and there's no harm to that player's rep. You basically have to become infamous as a ninja for it to affect you. The Classic Beta is different because it's a much smaller community atm and most of those players already know of each other. There's already too many players who are conditioned to need Blue+ BoEs that you end up with the 3/5 scenario I mentioned above.
---
This is a private server, but for example I ran SFK the other day and two BoEs blues dropped in the run. Drop#1 two players rolled greed, I rolled greed after seeing that, fourth guy exclaims: ALL GREED LMAO?, fifth guy needs, fourth says "There it is" and needs himself. Drop#2 all players rolled need. One player actually needed and said so. The player who won just traded it to him after winning and asked to see him equip. The guy who won Drop#1 never spoke and certainly had no intention of equipping the item. It's dis-heartening, but I wouldn't be making a server forum post about that silent dick needing everything in an SFK run. I'd love if people really respected Need&gt;greed, but it just doesn't work in reality. The safe way is all need and if someone really will use it, the winner will hopefully trade it to them. Otherwise, you're just leaving yourself open to ninjas and that doesn't really help the player who will actually use it.
---
I have no idea what you're even saying anymore
---
Oh god I remember this fight. *starts fight*. Oh,  this isn’t so bad... then at 30% “okay guys enrage time” 27% *wipes*
---
The dude sticks out like a sore thumb. The amount of people that use appropriate grammar and boast about week 1 rag kills on this sub can be counted on one hand.
---
Hey mate, I can help a bit with this one. On pservers Druid is actually top 3 in leveling speed behind aoe mage and hunter but still a very good leveler. 
---
The problem for Druid on beta is that their base damage (white hits) is around 1/3 lower than on pservers so the kill speed feels substantially slower.
---
Armor and Stam looks the same but it definitely feels like you take more damage as a Druid on beta than on pservers too
---
It was a great raid dont get me wrong, but it further alienated a lot of the playerbase because of the difficulty and also the gear that came out of it. I vividly recall Naxx geared players carrying BGs single-handedly against pugs.
---
Its a unique model seen nowhere else in the game? Its pretty cool if we remove the stigma surrounding it
---
&gt;If all 144k members of this sub refused to play, that would be about 1% of wow's **maximum** playerbase
---
Just gonna leave this here and bold the important part of my statement because I know reading is hard for the typical classicwow browser.
---
No subjectivity because it can't be any other way.
---
If you think it can. Suggest another way of need and greed that isn't need when need and greed when greed.
---
Need/greed is a system designed to be abused by ninjas in the first place. Greed is a essentially a honor rule that people won't follow if they don't have to. In most cases a person who "needs" it would be better off selling it to have money through their leveling experience and likely will. One of the many flaws Classic has that people don't seem to recall, lol.

That's because FromSoft went into the deal with full control over the project. ActiBlizz is one merged entity used to do this shi\* for quite a few years now.

I assume classic is pretty much ready to release or they would have invited more
---
Either you love him or you hate him, which is it?
---
And yeah, he's not allowed to talk about week one Rag kills anymore. Their entire guild put a moratorium on Reddit posts about their plans.
---
I find raiding fun due to the social aspects, such as competition with other guilds and the sense of accomplishment with others. Seeing time spent finally pay off is its own reward, and doing it with a bunch of friends is even better. Nobody is celebrating with joy after a few hours of target dummy practice; it's about winning and teamwork, and \*doing it on a character you enjoy.\*
---
Personally I raided to PvP, since I like the competitive aspect, and it didn't require as much farming. And in PvP, nothing holds a candle to the awesome power of a well-played paladin who knows how to support a team, and this is regardless of spec. I had the most fun on my paladin due to the sheer number of options I had in a given situation, and how an entire battle could be turned if I played well, even in greens/blues.
---
I think of assassination mostly as a pvp spec, though it does have a lot of dps -- e.g. the extra energy for better stunlock combos, the cold blood to finish somebody off once per 3 mins, extra combo points, kidney shot stuff, etc.
---
Combat was the main pve tree - hit talents, expertise, dual wield spec, sword spec. 
---
Subtlety is pvp - especially preparation (resets your long cooldowns so you can fight another guy or super-pwn one guy).
---
But of course in vanilla stuff is all over the place. gouge is a pvp talent. slice and dice is a pve talent. everybody should have malice.
---
If you're doing a dagger build you need improved backstab, lethality, and opportunity for sure.
---
I remember that the main pvp specs were 21/8/22 and 30/8/13 (or 31/8/12) and the pve spec...not sure, but 31+ in combat for sure (I guess maybe 17/34/0 or something like that). You could go either daggers or swords. (combat swords is what I remember everybody doing.)
---
It's hard to level daggers because you generally can't get behind the monster to backstab. (don't sinister strike with a dagger, it's bad dps since the weapon is too fast.)
---
Combat swords is for sure the most efficient for soloing. (good damage, good suitability, don't have to be behind, blade flurry for 1v2 against mobs, etc)
---
But if you're usually going to be grouped with somebody so you can get behind the monsters, or i guess even if you just like daggers, you could go with a dagger spec. (Grinding with a dagger spec sucks though, you might get off an ambush or a backstab while he's stunned, but then you weapon-swap-macro and ss with your sword most of the time.)
---
He's wondering why youre asking such a stupid fucking question.
---
You are speaking directly out of your asshole.
---
You have no proof of any of this except you own overconfident ignorance.

---
My dude its the internet, you can fucking cuss here, nobody is going to inform your mom.
---
Oh my god that game looks amazing.
---
I wish people understood this to be the norm.
---
I raided 4 nights per week 4 hours per night in vanilla and i did all of it during my spare time after school. 
---
I also had a healthy social life and played soccer on an elite level for 16 year old boys in Sweden.
---
The reason raiding wasnt a "job" for me was that my guild wasnt the kind of guild that forced people to bring a certain amount of consumables or anything. We raided because it was fun and because we thought it was fun we became fairly competent at it. We cleared all content up till 4 hm in naxx (3 wings cleared).
---
"Raiding was a second job" is a lie/meme that somehow started to be seen as truth after people kept repeating worst case for new people over a decade.
---
Because of the way my keyboard is laid out, I usually use 1-4 then q,e,r,f,t for combat abilities together with 12 extrabuttons on my MMO mouse.
---
On top of that I've got alt and Shift modifiers for those 1-4 and q,e,r,f,t buttons, shift+q,e,r,t is stances/druidtransforms/stealth and I'm very happy with that.
---
Still got 5 and 6 bound for stuff like consumables (5 is healthstone/healthpot, 6 is usually some other utility stuff) and I really like this layout. Been using it for years. G600 MMO mouse from Logitech is huge for WoW and other multi-actionbar MMOs!
---
I’m horde and even I think orgrimmar is dogshit
---
Ffxiv just launched a new expansion todya
---
i think it's pretty universally understood that you need on shit you need and greed on the rest. It might make it easier to ninja, but that's the way it goes. These posters above outliners, and there's not some major debate or divide surrounding the system. Just the fact that /u/PropheticEvent would have to explain to his group that 'we're needing on BOE's' shows this. 
---
I ensure you a lot of people would go eh wtf if the  leader started talking about this before a BRD run.
---
I can ease your worried mind by telling you Blizzard has stopped sending invites out for about a month now. So you can just stop checking your email for one
---
goblins were neutral in wc3
---
lol that was kind of my point at the end. I was trying to be a bit flippant. It never really helped you, but it was a nice thing to do and almost never cost you much. Plus if you were farming you were doing it over and over again with a group of people who needed almost nothing, so the person wouldn't usually get just one piece of gear unless they had to go quickly. Plus it made the runs more fun because someone was actually happy when with drops. 
---
I love doing dungeons though, especially the long classic ones. I'll probably still be healing them when I'm decked out in tier gear, so maybe I'm just a bit weird in liking to do this.
---
Oh man castsequence macros, those take me back. I remember entire rotations being reduced to a single button using that. i'm glad they broke that.

because they are forever bis to priests and only a short time for warlocks.

Great business model? What? They overprice all their shit and get you to pay for things that should be part of the initial price. Just look at all their stupid dongles or w/e they call them.
---
People will tell you PRECISELY what to do during raids. Don't sweat it, ignorance is easily overcome here.   
---
Learn the classes by watching people on youtube talk about them. Pick what sounds interesting and never look back unless you are not having fun, and remember that getting wrecked in pvp at level 20 doesn't mean a damn thing when it comes to pvp at level 60. Tons of guides out there. Tipsout and Kargoz are very helpful.   
---
Level at your own pace, because no matter what others will be leveling at the same pace as you too. You will always find people to group with.  
---
Join a guild.

The one Gnoll that spawns just north of the Stonefield Farm was my first encounter with a Gnoll as a Night Elf. I didn't see it as I was running and the aggro sound made me jump so hard that I ran away from the PC. I always salute that Gnoll when I run by today.
---
Dailies in TBC were there to give people a way to farm gold. At the time most people were really shit at it amd dailies were the one thing that let them get their flying mounts eventually. It's a different world nowdays.
---
Who do i contact to make it,but with another country flag
---
Their intended role is not PvE dps.
---
Gimlily
---
I went the other direction back in the day - started as a rogue and then went to tanks/healers. The one I found the most fun was the warrior, for sure. I liked druids a lot too though.
---
Rogues are fun, for sure. It might be a bit one-dimensional after a while but you can always make an alt.
---
Stealth dungeon runs are fun. (you could 2-3 man some bosses with a druid or two, or all bosses with a full 5.)
---
For sure you have to learn your combos. cheap shot, backstab, gouge; wait-to-regen-energy-until-gouge-is-almost-over, kidney shot, backstab\[, thistle-tea-backstab-again, if you're a real dick\], maybe a cold-blood-eviscerate here will finish him off! If not, blind...restealth, just as blind is about to end, cheapshot again and the cycle continues. Man it's brutal. :)
---
Rogue vs rogue duels are all about knowing which cooldown counters which cooldown. he uses evasion? vanish and cheap shot him (he can't dodge the opener, and he can't dodge while stunned). Think he's going to blind? use evasion before he does so you dodge it. Think he's going to vanish? put a rupture on him first so that it will tick him out of stealth right after he vanishes.
---
Man, that was a fun class. :)

Noobnoobnoob

Sekiro is worth a go. There’s a couple other rpg/adventure games on the steam sale that look amazing... can’t think of the names off the top of my head..
---
I was clearing naxx in vanilla. Our paladins wore dresses. You don't need to wear plate in raids. All they cared about were crit heals for free casts. They didn't get priority on cloth, so they had to pick up the scraps but you still wore non plate all over.
---
Ye, people seem to forget that the entire worlds population (well anyone associated with the game in anyway) would need to get a major memory loss and entire databases erased to recreate the true vanilla experience.
---
Eh, if you want to raid endgame you still need to level fast to get into a group with people who aren't fucking around.
---
I never passed any judgement on how it was obtained. Just said it looked cool.
---
yeah i want to play that real bad but I worry I won't be able to beat it before release
---
Well I said loyalty because loyalty does have a financial value, when your fans are super loyal they will buy your next game/coach day 1 without waiting for reviews and such, where as when you are very suspicious of a company or publisher say EA, I know myself at least I won't even consider a game published by EA without seriously checking into it first.
---
Old blizzard before they sold their soul used to be one of those companies where a game is coming out and I buy it as soon as I can.
---
But now their concerns are the next quarterly statement, you can see this by the release dates of store mounts and such for live, they tend to come out a week or so before the next report to pad those numbers
---
Execs at large companies often sacrifice long term profits to make short term goals on growth
---
I'm not saying any of this will happen, only that it is more then possible
---
\*Sad lok'tar\* :(
---
Makes no sense. With that "logic", there's no point in the greed option. 
---
No one "needs" gold. If you want to sell it instead of use its that's what the fucking **GREED** option is for.
---
By end game I mean after a mount and raid gear.  BiS BOE lol tryhard pserver goggles
---
&gt; i think it's pretty universally understood and set in stone that you need on shit you need and greed on the rest. 
---
That was the custom when I played retail vanilla, but I think the argument that it is a bad system is compelling. Also it seems like current pirate server culture is the opposite, and that everyone needing on high-value blue and purple BoEs is the norm there.
---
&gt; It might make it easier to ninja, but that's the way it goes.
---
I think you can try to justify any kind of bad behaviour or system by just waving your hand and saying "that's the way it goes", but it is not a very compelling argument.
---
since noone gave you the correct answer, no. spellhit determines whether the spell hits or is resisted.
---
spell penetration would help, but thats a very rare stat.
---
Boo! Stealing art. Boo!
---
I wholeheartedly agree.
---
I recently resubbed to retail to do some of the story-quests and thought "well classic is soon anyway so im going to need a sub". Sadly i wasnt very surprised to see that the new Mechagon and Nazjatar end-game stuff is highly random and time gated.
---
You need to get X rep to get certain cool rewards that you want to progress towards. You only get rep through timed events like world quests or boss spawns.
---
On Mechagon its even random on a daily basis which "visitors" are on the island. So if you want a specific reward or combination of rewards you are going to hit your head against the table if you realize you missed the day you wanted.
---
In vanilla if you wanted a Winterspring frostsaber you grinded rep whenever you were online. If you wanted the Baron Mount then you just kept doing Strat Baron runs over and over. If you wanted something there was a way for you to grind it - unless it was a raid reward.
---
Today there is almost nothing you can grind without constantly hitting time-gates. Wether it is daily quests, world quests, weekly chests or one of many other things.
---
When i quit (again) back before 8.1 it was because i simply got tired of feeling like i had to long in and do my weekly +10 mythic and the emissarrys just because else i would lose optimization. "Oh shit i didnt do a +10 this week, now i've litterally lost a huge reward".
---
If this was instead lets say something that dropped in a dungeon or i achieved after killing 500 of a certain monsters in the world - then i could just catch up and do it later. But there are only 52 weekly mythic chests in a year - one per week.
---
The difference is that you could progress through pretty much everything up to naxx while being a cheap ass with potions and other consumables. I know because I did so myself, and it's not like I was getting hard carried because of it. Plenty of my guildmates used sub optimal specs. Most progress in classic isn't time gated bullshit, and you can progress at your own pace. In retail everything is time gated around research or worldquests or you get a new chunk of a quest every weekly reset. In order to progress in retail you need to log in and perform specific things during specific timeframes, so it feels like a job.
---
Well, see. Guilds will still be going for dual wield tanks, they still use shields during the fight on the fly depending how the fight is going as well.  Having more boss party does mean less on hit rage generation, but you get that in damage taken rage. With 1.12 healing gear, going to be a lot easier for healers to so heal tanks.
---
Because they are bosses
---
My first ever class was warlock because of Ozzy.
---
Thanks for confirming what I suspected. One more question, are the ferals scale well with agility and strength gear, just like in private servers?
---
I'm telling Susan from HR you called me beautiful. You're gonna be in trouble

Well the people currently playing won't give them anymore money by playing classic they are already subbed

If people come back to play classic who quit they make money

Seems pretty easy to grasp

But not in WC2.

There was a consumable maybe it was SH holy water but I'm pretty sure it was something else that could help with that quest and made it pretty doable.

What you need to do is explain without any subjectivity whatsoever why this conceptual clarity is more important than good outcomes.
---
Go on.
---
Explain it.
---
Without any subjective evaluations.
---
They seem to be scaling similarly but that loss in base damage and survivability definitely hurts
---
It depends whether you push the limits of the class or not. You will perform 100% within the expectations of your class just by applying your assigned curse and casting shadow bolt during boss fights.
---
I wouldn't worry, you'll pick up on the basics very quickly. Especially if you skim through a class guide or two.

The hilarious shadyness of Vanilla raid prep won't be in classic, but I think we'll all be ok.
---
Are you only looking for guns for like an RP thing?
---
6s ranged stun and 6s ranged incapacitate, combined with engineering stuns and a tidal charm, make it possible to take half their team off your carrier. Rogues could probably do a bit more with prep, but combined with the stuff you mentioned, they're by far the best flag carrier support.
---
I mean leeway goes both ways, you have your own leeway as well, you can hit from a mile away too. 
---
As for sitcrit, the private server bug is not the vanilla bug that was replicated. The private server bug is sit, get hit, its a crit, crit procs the spell. The vanilla bug required you to spell batch the hit while seated, and stand up in the window before the batch goes through. Parts of player status is client side, including sit/stand status, damage numbers are server side. The bug has been replicated in classic. You dont proc off of standard afk sitting crits, you need to sit, take a hit, and time it so you trick the game into giving you the crit damage while standing up. 
---
There are multiple twitch clips of paladins proccing Redoubt and Reckoning with sitcrit abuse, which use the same on incoming crit. Esfand was running around on stream reck bombing people in wPvP for a while.
---
100% agree. I'm playing the new BfA patch right now and I'm already sick of those daily chores I have to do for flying, to level my neck lvl... Classic can't come soon enough.
---
which is before wc3 so clearly something changed.  shekels &gt; allegiance
---
Was doing high end raid content in TBC, never really bothered with dailies with the exception of facing rep for my nether drake mount. Sure, they're a boost but it wasn't as bad as WotLK daily quests and rewards, those were a lot more substantial and felt more mandatory to do.
---
IMO, TBC has more going as far as class balance than classic. Hybrid specs are actually viable in raids, itemization still had a trend where BiS came from all raids, smaller raid size just makes it easier to get people together as well. Still hate flying mounts, but just something I accept with everything else TBC does right.
---
Classic is all about the world and the experience. TBC just improved on it all, but you lost some of that community base.  I like both, so hopefully TBC gets the classic treatment too.
---
All you have to do is press X at the right time in response to the swing timer. Once you get a bead on the timing, you can literally watch the auto attack timer bar and press the button when you need to. There are beta videos of spam procs where a player can chain the sitcrit procs indefinitely. 
---
It's not mechanically difficult at all.
---
They do a bit less damage than on PS but they still work the same exact way. There's barely any downtime etc.
---
I'm starting to worry that they perform a bit worse in the end game than they do on PS though...
---
Yeah, of course there are. I know about the timber maw tribe. But the difference is you're not limited to doing something once per day. You can spend as much time on it as you once vs getting your daily 250 rep from a daily
---
The imp is like 40% of your damage lvl 1-10.  Why would you skip it.
---
Just saw this but thank you! :D
---
Black desert online
---
Gotta play a warrior with keys that small. Left half to mortal strike, right half to whirlwind, you'll be good!
---
\&gt;  I mean leeway goes both ways, you have your own leeway as well, you can hit from a mile away too. 
---
Doesn't help if your swing timer is 1.5-2 times slower than the mobs you're grinding on. Which is why hamstring kiting works so well for leveling. But if leeway prevents you from kiting the mob then your reduced downtime between mobs thanks to hamstring kiting is going to be non-existent.
---
No I don't.
---
I only need to explain that need is for use,
---
Greed is for gold.
---
I don't need to do jack shit beyond that. Anyone challanging it does need to explain though. Nice try. Shame it's bollocks.
---
But did you find nessy and hit it!?
---
Holy cow that is impressive, entertaining, and helpful all at once! What a gem of a resource! Thank you

---
&gt;Well I said loyalty because loyalty does have a financial value
---
The loyalty of consumers who dont play their current games to the point that they beg for rereleases?
---
That loyalty?
---
&gt;where as when you are very suspicious of a company or publisher say EA, I know myself at least I won't even consider a game published by EA without seriously checking into it first.
---
That has less to do with suspicion and everything to do with quality control, Anthem didnt fail because they loaded it up with terrible monetization but because its just a lower quality product.
---
We can argue all we want but the fact remains based on critical reviews Blizzard is still a easy bet on releasing a top tier critically acclaimed game.
---
&gt;Old blizzard before they sold their soul used to be one of those companies
---
Still one of those companies, 3 years ago they released the consensus GOTY of 2016, 2 years ago they released the best WoW expansion according to fans in nearly a decade.
---
I know for your blind hate rage you have your nonsensical reasons, just dont be surprised when they break more fastest selling game release records despite your claim that they are not trusted a reliable game developer anymore worthy of trusting day one.
---
&gt;But now their concerns are the next quarterly statement
---
Sure which is why they still spend 6 years developing a single game release and cancel projects that dont meet their expectations all the time right?
---
Its why Diablo 7 is releasing this year right? Because they are a annual release studio that is just gouging their consumers every year selling Diablo sequels since it sold 30m copies in 2012?
---
Oh wait they dont do any of that and your comment is nonsensical bullshit? Weird.
---
&gt;you can see this by the release dates of store mounts
---
They've always been conscious of this stuff you dope, just because you were too stupid to notice it doesnt mean it didnt exist. This is a company that has timed expansion/patch releases for the past 15 years with WoW to coincide with hurting competitors releases. Its why Patch 4.3 released days before the release of SWTOR, why Vanilla WoW launched within days of Everquest 2, this is just sensible business decisions and they do them because they work.
---
&gt;Execs at large companies often sacrifice long term profits to make short term goals on growth
---
No they don't, your ignorance is glaringly apparent.
---
Certain industries absolutely do but media companies like this absolutely do not, its why its often the case for companies like Sony and Microsoft to literally sell at a loss their first few years because they invest in the long term financial gains.
---
&gt;I'm not saying any of this will happen, only that it is more then possible
---
You are saying it will happen, the discussion is never "can this happen in this existence of infinite possibilities" its whether its likely to happen and you have argued yes when I have argued no.
---
I'm sorry but this whole conversation with you is just bafflingly apparent to be born from ignorance and isnt going anywhere. You dont seem to understand anything you are talking about but seem convinced enough to not want to question your dumbass opinion when presented with actual perspective beyond "companies bad!".
---
I cant help you and this is proving to be a waste of time, good luck in your hate crusade, I hope you find a way to reconcile your depression and understand its you who changed, not faceless corporations.
---
Caring about gold is about as dumb as giving it to someone.
---
I dont think you understand that leeway works both ways, and that by virtue of both attack ranges being extended, there's effectively no difference than if both parties didn't have any leeway. If both parties can hit from 3 yards normally, you need to be outside of the 3 yard area of threat to kite. If both parties have leeway and can attack from 7 feet away each, you need to be 8 feet away from the mob to kite it. If both parties have 3 feet ranges, you need to be 1 foot away. If both paries have 7 feet ranges, you need to be 1 foot out of that. 
---
All the change to leeway does is force you to be farther away. At the end of the day, you just need to be 1 foot outside the threat radius. Attack range doesnt change that.
---
Blood and thunder!
---

There shouldn't even be a stigma. There's plenty of neat mounts obtainable in the game, and *a lot* of the time there's recolors of these mounts in the game at some point.
---
What?  The whole point of all the rhetorical questions was to point out that it isn't simple and clear cut as you said. There is some arbitrary line drawn in the sand that isn't the same for everyone. The fact that you think everyone has the same exact answers to those questions as you is perhaps the problem.
---
The parent comment of this whole discussion by /u/snowjob_tv   says all BoEs (which includes greens). As do many other people across the multiple threads this subject is talked in. In fact I'd say it is the most common response, despite me disagreeing with it. 
---
Also sidegrades and minor upgrades of only a stat or two occur all the time in classic. You say this isn't the case, but I recall it happening quite frequently (especially in the early to late 50s). We'll have to disagree on this.
---
I really liked leveling in loch modan and redridge. I don't know why.
---
If you haven't done it before, do it I think. It'll be neat.
---
The main thing though is, if your friends are playing, you have to play with them.
---
So I went out and bought a mmo gaming mouse during vanilla and my response times have always been top notch because of it. If I didn't have that I dont think I would preform well. So if you haven't I strongly recommend buying one and it will allow you focus more on everything else in the game. The second is a mage is super squishy so a warlock might help you out. You should be fine with what ever class you play as long as you are having fun.
---
Post has a /s and you get all keyboard warrior about reading. Ironic.
---
No that is the best part of classic because of bugs
---
Then explain that their best option is to chance rolling greed like everyone else, and a chance at a big payday is better than winning, and being required to equip, and then using a highly valued item for a few days and then it's permanently useless.
---
Who knows, maybe that person is literally leveling their twink and that's their #1 dream item. 
---
The point is, you're trying to remove the whole point of there being a distinction between NEED and GREED rolls. And it's not fair to people who would want to use them. 
---
Of course anyone can sell it. That's why it was commonplace that anyone rolling need on a boe item, or a tradable enchant etc. had to equip it/learn it immediately. No "I'm almost high enough level" bullshit. Either you can use it right now, or you can't. If not, then everyone rolls greed.
---
Thats not what you said, you seem confused by even your own comments and its became increasingly obvious I am speaking with an idiot.
---
"They would rather all the people who want classic don't play live anymore"
---
Thats what you said, you never mentioned a single thing about current players moving to classic, you referred to them wanting classic players not to play live which is just retarded.
---
They would absolutely love to have new classic players want to get back into the retail game buying their new expansions and having more reasons to stay subscribed and possibly buy into their other microtransactions. This idea that they would "rather all the people who want to classic dont play live anymore" is just idiotic.
---
Hey man I'm done, good luck with the angst I'm sure you'll definitely react to being wrong and questioning your feelings on it all healthily.
---
Cya
---
&gt; had to correct
---
Yeah, you had to.  Because if not, we would have had to settle for the top comment.
---
!remindme 50 days
---
You mean should they hold off releasing it until it is a bug-free product?  
---
No.
---
This village is the biggest "city" in game? Uh.... ok. /s
---
Theres still 2 months of dev time and bugs are getting fixed left and right
---
&gt;alexensual's opinion on anything
---
lol
---
The point is Fortnite followed.  They didn't create something new.
---
There's other words for pushing it forward that doesn't require it to be new, because BR wasn't new when Fortnite took it over.
---
Innovate, advance, expand, improve.  Not pioneer.

Get rank 12, 13 if possible but doubt it. Clear AQ 40. Whatever profession I choose actually level it to 300 this time and farm rare recipes. Get cooking, fishing, and first aid to 300 this time around as well. After getting epic mount, try to get to 5,000g as that was a crazy amount of gold in vanilla.
---
Well this is exactly the type of person I expected you to be.
---
Ha! Fair point. I'd be fine with ogres. Hell, I'd be fine with not adding more races period. Better that than us getting saddled with a bunch of poncy, tuskless pointy ears again.
---
That’s a funny looking suramar
---
I played up to cataclysm, and then just played a few times a week in MoP to have the relevant PvP gear 
---
Tried out WoD for a month, not sure if I even made it to max level on my main.
---
I’m pretty excited for classic, hunters have mana again, rogues make poisons, warriors can shoot with a fucking gun when they get snared. (Albeit the damage is essentially null)
---
EYES OF THE BEAST is no longer removed. I’m ready.
---
Yup. The big things at the back of my mind are the insanely time-grind things that were no fun at all - and people easily forget if they didn't play the class back in the day.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1) Warlock shard farming to use basic abilities was awful with non-stacking of shards and "only obtainable from green mobs" requirements. Demons despawning when you zone and such meant a constant resource drain and travel to inconvenient places just so you could DUEL properly.
---
2) Mat farming for each and every raid.
---
3) Repair costs after raids being so high you had to go grind again.
---
4) Respec costs for people who want to use different specs for raiding and pvp. I understand wanting specs to matter but realistically it just means certain classes don't respec much and others need to do so constantly. Allowing free respec at a city vendor would at least be SOMETHING.
---
So many little niggles that were no fun at all. Seriously considering just making a BG twink rather than going the full 60 experience.
---
You could use a weak auras like addon to track them separately, but I agree at least personally that having multiple cool downs like this on one button wouldn't be for me. Easy to customise out though!
---
As long as retail game is strong and doing a good job robbing ppl classic won't have mtx. Look at runescape, retail there is doing good enough job that even after 6 yrs old school hasn't gotten mtx.
---
\&gt;Reaper will be gay  
---
lol, fake.
---
Nah
---
Seems dumb to me to donate to reddit over giving it to the original artist if you appreciate it that much, could just be me though.
---
&gt; What? The whole point of all the rhetorical questions was to point out that it isn't simple and clear cut as you said.
---
The thing about rhetorical questions is that they are a way of weaselling out of stating any actual argument. You can just ask a bunch of dumb questions, and if you don't get the answers you like complain that the person silly enough to respond to you didn't understand the questions.
---
&gt; The parent comment of this whole discussion by /u/snowjob_tv says all BoEs (which includes greens)
---
In context, I do not think they meant greens. They can of course correct me if I am wrong. But I think when talking about this topic people frequently assume that the topic is just blues and purples because greens don't matter. (There are of course a handful of BoE greens that do matter, but they are unusual in the extreme.)
---
&gt; Also sidegrades and minor upgrades of only a stat or two occur all the time in classic. 
---
Pre-60 I don't think anyone should care about "sidegrades". There is no content where you need to fine-tune your gear that much.
---
And speaking personally, minor upgrades add up. I think people should take that thing that is only a +1 upgrade, unless they know for sure they are getting a bigger upgrade soon, because if pass on ten minor upgrades that's the same as passing on a big upgrade.
---
Im wondering why you had to put it in such a rude obnoxious incel neckbeard way fuck asshole.
---
Can holy 1v1 anything if they get low?
---
Feel like every class can run away/cc them and not die
---
I don't have a problem with that. You are advocating for enabling a suboptimal playstyle, that's fine and if you are OK with that then that is your perogative.
---
It's unfair to force that onto others though (without earlier communication) it's basically the same people rolling for gear for uncommon specs such as enhance or ret when a rogue or warrior needs that item.
---
If someone says beforehand what they are doing then that it is totally fine and it doesn't even mean that I don't want to play with you. But if you come up with something after the fact (such as I am needing that item for my twinkle alt) then I would definitely take exception with that.
---
I think it's obvious at this stage that you know you are wrong and are blustering like mad.
---
Have fun with that, o king of objectivity and reason.
---
People keep making this claim and I've yet to see a single picture of Thunder Bluff.
---
That's a verified vanilla video homie. People did use world buffs back then, mainly because at the time Naxxramas was the hardest raid ever created.
---
The Yakuza series is on sale right now on steam, great game series
---
Who would think a closed beta that's not even at lvl cap for the actual game would be dead 2 months before launch right after a major patch drop for Retail and an expac drop from the only other popular MMO in the market? What an outlandish observation.
---
agreed
---
&gt; I think it's obvious at this stage that you know you are wrong and are blustering like mad.
---
Ok me too, I can talk bollocks also.
---
Meh. You're right. It's not your fault. It's the moderators' fault for not deleting every single unoriginal layering post from people who have no other outlet to spout their repetitive unoriginal ideas. Cheers!
---
If you need to bubble him then that's fine. But just don't pre-pubble (or pre-HoT) at the start of the pull. That is the riskiest time for aggro -- he needs to get rage and hit each monster a little. The shield prevents the rage and the HoT tick might pull any monsters he didn't hit yet. Just give it a couple seconds. But his health will be full at the start so you have time.
---
I like pally/warrior. 
---
But the priest is a more versatile and interesting healer to play than the paladin, for sure. Flash heal is the best pvp heal. shield is good too. renew is good too.   
---
Pallies have to choose between "doesn't heal enough" and " too slow". No instants. (maybe holy shock, but it really sucks on all fronts).
---
Having a rogue on you sucks as pally - you can't get him off once your stun is on cooldown, you don't have any instant heals, and you only have hardcast holy-school spells. He's going to kick it and shut you down. The priest can cast instants and maybe buy some time with fear. (I'm talking more about healing your buddies while a rogue is trying to distract, not healing yourself. Though that is important too.)
---
And of course on the priest you can mind control people into the lava. Never gets old.
---
The pally has other stuff, like blessing of freedom. And you can at least get heals off when you bubble. You can stun the rogue or maybe fake our the kick.
---
I think either way will work -- but if you like the priest better, go for it. Playing a pally does get a bit stale after a while. They're both good, though.
---
Talented expose armor reduces even more than 5 stacks of sunder right?
---
As I *just* wrote, no, there's no such thing in vanilla.
---
Zug zug
---
How the hell are we supposed to have AQ if they take the bugs out?
---
Considering your the one who keeps resorting to insults...
---
If I go to bed now I'll get a solid 8 hours. I'll just craft this for the ah before I log, 7 and a half hours of sleep is good.
---
3 hours later
---
5 hours of sleep is just weird, I'll just make it an even 4....
---
Most people are playing for pvp.
---
Mage is arguably the most dynamic class, ironically.
---
Relearning a new keyboard layout is a pain at first but I never found it took all that long.
---
I tend to play with a terrible UI while I am levelling because it does not matter very much and I do not use that many buttons, then optimise it at max level when I have a specific job to do and need to be good at it. A bit of practice on random world mobs and it all falls into place quickly, or at least I always found it did.
---
So it's a free mount that doesnt exist in the game.. Thats lame as fuck.
---
Obviously I'm not going to point out the relatively simple flaw overarching your entire opsec approach that renders it utterly pointless, but the resulting action by the Blizzard team in this case wouldn't involve GM interaction. 
---
It would go straight to security and then to accounts. A GM wouldn't ever be part of the process, because they would never have any need to interact with the player in this situation. 
---
It's all in the server logs. Everything digitally signed is audited nowadays.
---
Good stuff.  Really enjoyed this series.  Actually useful numbers.
---
Like someone said, gear makes a big difference, once you start getting naxx level block gear, shield slam crits can hit hard.
---
But this is a couple years down the road.
---
Heck yes man. All great things Haha. Honestly I forgot about the warriors being able to use guns! Lol
---
Flask recipes are boss drops and not trash right? It's to switch to master looter if you are concerned with someone rolling anyway
---
So don’t do it. Just play casually
---
Search "hunter viable" and a hundered results come up. But youre too fucking stupid to do that. You need your own post, asking the most retarded question. Where did you even learn that word kid? Every class is "viable". Hunters are used in every raid group. Anyone with half a brain would be able to figure that out, so why the fuck do you think asking whether they are "viable" or not is a good question? IDIOT
---
because horde is better for tryhards. alliance is easier, noone claimed they could clear faster.
---
!remindme 66 days
---
I like it too. It's a cute dragon bird...thing. Reminds me of Lunar Silver Star Story.

I had the same initial reaction to the herb prices that some others are, but it makes sense if you’re saying to stockpile and sell at peak. Really solid guide.

Ban OP for art theft

that doesn't look like darnassus to me.
---
Is there a pvp bis list for all the stages as well? Would be very interested if there was.
---
Nice! What kind of business do you have if you don’t mind me asking?
---
Sure but since that is not standard please be upfront about in groups so that people can avoid you if so inclined.
---
Yes. Any other answer is wrong here. It's BOE blue or purple, it can benefit everyone. No way one person should be rolling need on it.
---
My guess is he will reply with something saying how he’s solved this problem pretty soon. 
---
It’s his thing
---
Nice station I like your hearthstone :)
---
17 Hunter -&gt; 25 Druid
---
Sadly couldn’t hit her! She’s neutral and unable to be attacked.
---
Well i guess they just didn't clarify specifics but if he let other warriors roll on tank gear then I wouldn't see an issue.
---
you ninjad it for sure dude. But who cares, it's Beta and the characters will be deleted in a couple months anyways. I wouldn't worry about it.
---
It's a totally different ballgame if you're horde or alliance, though. As a Human priest your fear is literally worthless against an Undead rogue, as an Undead priest it's just kind of worthless, because it depends if their PvP trinket is on cooldown.
---
Then there's devouring plague - an extra DoT spell that does *more damage than Shadow Word: Pain* and heals the priest for all of the damage dealt.
---
It's also worth pointing out that priests have a very low skill ceiling compared to rogues so you can't just out-play someone, apart from the crazy faction imbalance, it all just comes down to gear.
---
I have been looking at getting one of these for a long time. If you don't mind my asking, where did you buy it from? I'm not entirely sure where the best deal is for one if these. Thanks!
---
lvl17 hunter vs lvl25 druid LUL
---
No, it means dusty fart
---
Underrated comment.
---
alliance doesn't clear faster, they have a way easier time, but for competent people horde will always be faster.
---
That doesnt look anything like Ironforge
---
Ty, I want to get a good gaming desk pad and some more warcraft merch to place around it still.
---
*Little better ofc*

Where did you get that map of azeroth

blatant lies

Thats dictated far more by your guild than by Blizzard though.
---
Oh they are holding certain - cough ... unarmored mount skins ... cough  - back for a reason
---
Swirly ball?

---
It probably doesn't suck, but it wont be used at a competitive level.
---
Lol best comment
---
if you type in "warcraft map" on ebay it should be the second listing, and the frame was a $20 walmart poster frame
---
Best in slot is best in slot. Doesn't make any promises that it's easy to acquire.
---
Meh, when I played on a p server a lot of us had forgotten all kinds of shit. I didn't remember anything about half the dungeons. Being a complete noob won't be far off from people who haven't played in a decade. 
---
By the time you get to 60, you should be in good shape after having the leveling time to learn your class along with guides.
---
only since tbc. horde only has troll as sexy race in vanilla.
---
&gt; Enjoy the game, take your time, classic is about the ADVENTURE, 
---
This!  For new players, I can't stress this enough.  The adventure to 60 is really fun.  Read the quests, enjoy the story lines.  
---
Even as an altoholic, I am totally looking forward to the adventure for the 12th time....
---
Mine is super weak but I loved Golden Pearls. They would vendor for 1g but were often up on the AH for less than that. Doubt I made much overall but it was always a fun extra thing to do at the AH and make a little free silver.
---
Thing is, WoW Classic is easy.
---
Maybe you want consumeables onces we get into Naxx or when you are trying to race, but for normal raiding its not needed.
---
Ffxi
---
I’m pretty sure that no services like that existed during classic.
---
They’re literally on the same machine. There’s nothing for an automated system to pickup besides having played for several days straight.
---
i had a discussion with my old raidlead from the first guild i joined on one of the last bigger pservers. he wanted everyone in the raid to pop a greater fire prot. potion. i didnt because, fuck it, i dont got gold to throw it out of the window for shit i dont fuck up for years. after 4 wipes i was wispered by him that i didnt take a potion for the last fights and i told him that i always died after 60% of the raid + MT were dead. 
---
he meant "yeah okay i saw that, but people getting pissed because you dont take the consumables, we told you to take".
---
sure. i take pots because some people who think they know the game want me too, to make em feel better when they fuck up. 
---
i was kicked from the guild for that because i still declined to take those, because i dont need em, just because some people hurt feelings over fuckin fire prot pots.
---
the release date is two months away
---
Its a bis list not a good gear which is easy to get.
---
Engineering for grenades/rocket helmet.
---
You can use rocket helmet to get out of bad situations too, like escaping caster range by helmeting into someone further away. 
---
And don't open with HoJ.
---
Im like 95% it was just server transfers
---
First of all I wouldn’t recommend getting a second hand one for obvious reasons! I’ve seen a few brand new ones on eBay go for decent prices. Alternatively you can use a Chinese seller on Aliexpress but that would mean waiting for around a month to be posted.
---
It really depends where you live some electronic stores sell them just have a browse there is also a subreddit for this product r/gpdwin that will have a ton of more info and users sometimes sell them on there! Hope this helps :)
---
Thank you, I was just saying how its a shame they never made a Final Fantasy Tactics 2.
---
The fact people actually think like this means people are STILL out of touch with what vanilla was.
---
That doesn't happen very often though. Usually the ranged weapons with stats such as ago and hit chance are pretty shitty for hunters and the melee weapons that have the huge stats for hunters are usually crap for rogues/warriors.
---
I can't really think of any dungeon item that doesn't follow this rule (at max level) and in raids disputes like that are usually settled beforehand.
---
The Classic player base is going to be much more hardcore than it was in 2004. Game will also be much easier.
---
I expect a lot more raiders.
---
Played one In classic and on the stress test and it really brought me back.  I miss life tap and drain soul.
---
Soloing
---
Easy leveling, suppression is an amazing rank 1 leveling talent. 3 to 5 points there makes your spells barely get resisted.  You can fear kite elites and take on 2 to 3 mobs at once very easily.  You never run out of Mana, and if you do a good wand and voidwalker makes good work of most mobs.
---
In 5 man's you have tons of utility, only really lacking the easy CC of mage sheep. Although the succubus isn't half bad.  Fear can be useful as a dungeon CC if you are super careful not to aggro another mob.  Your ability to summon, stone and pass out cookies makes you an instant add for most group leaders.
---
Raids are something I never did much of, but as others say they are pretty uppeelr middle of the pack for dps, mostly just shadowbolt spam.  But essential for raids because of their curses.
---
Another reason to play one, is that they are one of the least played classes in vanilla.  Possibly only Druids being played less.
---
I transferred servers in vanilla and I'm 90% sure it cost me money, because when I came back in TBC and my friend had moved servers again I thought 'ffs I'm not paying for another transfer'.
---
Your alt - posts an item that’s worth 10bgold for 20 gold
---
Your main - goes in trade chat saying “I want item for 30 gold”
---
Random person - hey that item that person wants is only 20g on the auction house, I’ll buy it and sell it to him for 30g! 
---
Then wait for them to buy it and whisper you then logout
---
I'm confused this isn't Ironforge
---
I've played in vanilla. I don't need to take my time and read everything. I've done it before. I'm looking for optimized routes so I can get to 60 quickly and raid with guild.
---
Sounds good to me! I have a few Warcraft things on my desk too! Good luck!
---
Also I have an RGB LED strip that plugs in to my monitor via usb that sticks on the back of the monitor it was super cheap and gives a nice back glow! Just a suggestion :)
---
i concider myself pretty chill ingame, i still min max like an idiot and am a perfectionist when it comes down to push my dps. 
---
the guy above just managed to let himself look like one of those bad things he mentioned, even if i dont think he is one...
---
I really doubt people  will need that stuff for MC.
---
MC is going to be easy now that people know the basics of raiding and team composition.
---
Warcraft reforged..  wait.. They are doing it after classic... Retards
---
If they needed more people on the beta they’d invite more people. Obviously they still have a backlog of bugs that they’re working on. If they wait to clear the backlog before inviting more people or increasing the cap then any future testers will be more effective at finding issues because they won’t be focused on existing bugs (also helps reduce time spent filtering through reports of known bugs etc.). This is like software testing 101
---
100% sure you could change server and change your name while doing it (because I did it).  
---
I'm just not sure if you could just change your name.
---
That’s cause not everyone played on potato PCs. Plenty of people had decent computers back then like they do today.  It’s just that your average 15/16 year old didn’t, which is where a lot of the nostalgia is coming from.
---
Lol. /s is way too ambiguous to hide behind. But nice try
---
Yeah, and I think you had to stay in the same Battlegroup also (but I'm not sure).
---
It appears not, honestly.
---
Neither is the case. You got to change servers for free. But it was limited. There was no paid transfer. It was just a means to combat over- and underpopulation.
---
clean
---
Battlegroups didn’t exist in vanilla?
---
Now you’re running two mmos on one sub service. See the issue in a shareholders eye?
---
Early in vanilla, there were no paid services.  
---
One of the first thing they allowed was paid name changes. (They also published the old names of every character who changed on [WorldofWarcraft.com](https://WorldofWarcraft.com), which kinda trolled everyone trying to escape a bad reputation.)   
---
If memory serves, towards the end of vanilla, they allowed for paid character transfer from realm to realm. But notably, you could not transfer from PVE realms to PVP realms because that was considered unfair.
---
The Founding of Durotar, with Rexxar and Vol'jin (and Chen if you do his optional quest!) is probably the closest you'll get to the large scale questing of WoW inside Warcraft 3.
---
It was included in the Frozen Throne expansion, completed at 3 missions, and to this day remains one of the greatest feats of RTS mission design I've ever encountered.
---
Spend all your energy, shift out and back in to cat form, gain 20 from helm, 40 from [furor](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17061/furor) and 20 more because of energy ticking while shifting in and out.
---
So you spend all energy, shift out and back and get 80 more.
---
I feel UC was the best designed city.  A big circle for all your needs
---
That vid is 100% legit - and not 1500 dps - but that's a different topic
---
People were sending us their 'our people did more dps than your rogue in his world first 1000 dps video on patchwork' ever since Aylen hit that mark. So  we got that video before it ever went up on warcraftmovies
---
Dwarf gun skill mostly. Its small but if you can plan a route to include guns its win/win
---
You can still shield when you think the warrior is at risk of imminent death or when he is at very high rage.
---
It’s much more efficient to heal though. But during fights like Twin Emps, efficiency is not a priority.
---
Not true, the thing you're refering to is something else that was indeed implemented to combat over/under population.

Same here for Ironforge. I had just made the Wetlands gauntlet as a budding nelf huntard, but couldn't even go through the dueling area without massive video lag. A guildie let me /follow her to get to wherever I was going (flight path? can't remember!), but even then she had to walk the whole way because my character would keep dropping /follow. The whole time I was thinking *damn, this person I've never met is being a truer friend than most of mine.* Now I think back on it as a fond memory.
---
This one always gets ya
---
Don't ever say delay again
---
That doesn’t look like Stormwind....
---
Okay but why have titan panel and meters and all that crap installed? That's not lowest settings nor lowest resolution.
---
Battlegroups existed in vanilla.
---
No More Nexus-Haomarush-EU, spent thousand of hours dueling with guys that raided there, Beastye, Kadaver, Akina, Crazyarrows.. 13 years ago! Memories!
---
I don't see anyone mentioning how world drop boes are inherently class imbalanced. 
---
Need to use really benefits warriors for example with edgemasters, cloudkeeper, stockade pauldrons, alcors, etc.
---
Warden staff to ferals, elemental mage staff to mages, freezing band to mages, and teebu's to warrior/rogues are the only other big ticket ones I can think of.
---
How do those of you arguing for Need=Use feel about this baked in class imbalance?

So you ask Reddit but google it? Shitpost.

Add wow tokens &gt;&gt;&gt; back to private servers. Not going to pay a sub if P2W is a thing. Same for friends. Paid services are another beast. Wouldn't bother me too much, just annoying that they still charge for them.

Also not true ;

Character Name change:

' The **Character name change service** (called just "Name Change" by [Blizzard](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Blizz) or "Paid Character Name Change") was introduced in late October 2007 and is part of [Character Services](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Services) support. It allows a [player](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Player) to make a one-time change to the [name](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Character_name) of a [player character](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Player_character) for a one time fee of US$10 or €8 (£6).

Dont let people on this sub and wow forums discourage you from playing. Only people concerned with min-max, and rushing to 60 are the ones asking questions and comments on here. Most people are not going to be playing that way. If people in game find out you are new and never played wow before, they will probably overjoyed, not call you names. Private server players are way more elitist than classic players will be, and even they were very kind to people that never played vanilla, or wow in general. 
---
My brother never played wow before until pserver, and he had a very pleasant experience. He even tanked rfc and wailing cavers; and the grouped stayed and helped him wipe after wipe. I was not involved, i wanted to let him make his own experience when he played, instead of drag him everywhere and ruin the game for him.
---
I would just keep playing on a private server until you have all the controls and movement down. Dont keep questing and leveling, just practice learning the game play. Change up some of your key binds, so you use keybinds for your main abilities, instead of clicking them all. Use mouse to turn and A D keys to strafe, if you want to practice that.

Correction:  Greatest City of Dirt Huts In Azeroth
---
Seems like name changes were introduced a year later in 2007
---
Any great shaman+warrior will obliterate an equally skilled paladin+warrior. There is no contest.
---
It’s just that playing a great warrior is very difficult and playing a great shaman is next to impossible.
---
The shaman combo has huge one shot potential and they get to kite the paladin combo to no end.
---
I’m doing the opposite, I’ve been playing the game on the frontlines my entire life, now I am going Shaman
---
yea those mages spamming their frostbolt are really impressive
---
&gt;"Seems like something that would fall under the "low droprate items" note that OP put."
---
Read before replying, thanks.
---
Iirc there was a video floating around of a blood death knight on retail fullung tanking the first boss of uldir on one of these things.
---
It turned out to be a paid video to show off yhe ability of the handheld computer but still pretty rad
---
me a holy paladin- oh nice, a BIS list
---
looks at list, sees no +mp5 or +heal
---
hmmm back to cloth
---
That doesn't like anything like Ironforge
---
That lands me on a 404 page. At this point I am actually questioning if you are making this up. No offense. But could you - please - supply a bloody source?!
---
Of course they did
---
I typically rush to 33.  Then I PvP a lot.
---
I had a character transferred from another account with same family name in Vanilla.
---
Them being on the same machine doesn't matter at all. In fact, it's not even relevant to what's actually being examined... hence, my firm belief that a GM never need get involved at any point in the investigation.
---
The first time your guild members realize they've been under investigation will be when they're met with the 'This World of Warcraft account has been closed and is no longer available for use' screen.
---
Grinding was hella long. Dont forget the first mount comes at lvl 40 and the 100% speed at lvl 60 (not cheap). I'm hyped too but pls, dont do an undead rogue. Everyone is an undead rogue lol
---
That's how I see it. Granted, current retail wow has all the fancy mounts to collect cash from people willing to buy them. So there's still additional monetization.
---
But the way I see it, haven't subbed for over a month in a row to WoW since TBC (tried all expansions with exception of MoP and BFA for one month) so if they keep classic servers at just that, it's money they would have never seen.
---
Super rad! 14 year old me would probably faint if I seen this way back then
---
I've got four characters planned.  I'm going to hit 51 and hang out in AV.
---
Same, over the years I’ve grew tired of the PVE portion of the game and look forward to more world pvp. I don’t care enough to do world firsts cause, mainly, they won’t be world firsts cause they have been done 15 years ago, but let the kids have their fun.
---
Same style, different flavor. Both are support tanks. Shaman are more about supporting by helping people kill things faster, while Paladins are more about cleansing and healing and taking some hits while they do it.
---
You'll upset alot of people who have put in leave.
---
The hell it doesnt land on a 404 page..?  I think you're the one trolling here.  
---
Then just google ' **Paid character transfer service (old)**' and it's like the fourth link.
---
I would tell them it's an upgrade, that my intention was to Need, and then do that. The nuance being that I don't want to come across as blindly rolling Need after they tell me to Greed roll without giving any justification for my action.
---
G is auto run, obvi. I even try to auto run in FPSs with G. I end up cycling through grenades a lot.
---
The risk of drawing it out too much and losing the momentum, having a game bleeding raiders and low populations servers is much worse than releasing it 'too quickly'. The original timeline of 3 major content patches over 18 months was clearly too slow, and people will go through content much much faster this time around.
---
Misread what you said sorry!
---
Why are you slow ? read my prior comment again.
---
&gt; "The thing about rhetorical questions is that they are a way of weaselling out of stating any actual argument." - /u/DragonAdept 
---
The whole point of rhetorical questions is that you don't actually want them answered. I was pretty clear that my point was that loot etiquette isn't simple, and that I don't expect that excessive number of questions to be replied to. There is no one catchall for all groups. This is an argument I directly stated. Just look at how many times you have to use "I think" and give a subjective response. That is my point: that answers to those questions is in fact subjective.
---
&gt;"Pre-60 I don't think anyone should care about "sidegrades". There is no content where you need to fine-tune your gear that much."
---
Cool so i guess you don't care about gear from brd, lbrs, and st, which is what i targeted with my comment about the earlier comment about side grades. Once again you've reinforced my point that the line we draw in the sand is subjective. You need to include caveats like at 60, for epics, for twink gear, or for something else. 
---
&gt;"In context, I do not think they meant greens. They can of course correct me if I am wrong. " 
---
Nice. Even if that's what he meant, it's disingenuous to say that need all BoEs is never said.
---
&gt; "If you were stupid I guess you could argue that. But why would you?" - /u/DragonAdept 
---
I don't even know why I replied to you after this. Could you be more condescending?  To be clear, I don't expect you to reply to that and am not referring to just this one quote.
---
Ya I don’t think you understand the difference between the ones designing the game and the ones designing the monetization strategy.
---
3 minute mage might be fun.
---
This is me. Got to mid 50s on a warrior. This time I’m focusing on just one character and I’m finally going to get some of that classic endgame
---
With a rogue you could ambush vanish ambush and most clothies are almost dead at this point. And the only item that really matters for that is your mainhand weapon. 
---
A warrior can blow people up too but you need to stack some crit gear, so considerably more gear dependent. 
---
I guess it depends what experience you’re looking for really. I enjoyed both during Vanilla.
---
what about you just don't reply? everything you said was false
---
its really a shame blizzard removes the og mounts.
---
Why level 33 specifically?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/0140053012--505003115315051
---
This is what I would do for full PvE resto.  A lot of fights you can safely go in and melee with your weapon for a little damage, but mostly to get that Omen of Clarity free max rank heal.  2 points in Nature's Reach can go wherever you want.
---
But everyone pays monthly to play this game.. why should they have a shop in the first place? Theyre just trying to double dip, it really is sad.
---
Stop acting like Classic is some insanely hard game. IT'S NOT!
---
For The Alliance!
---
STV.
---
You arent going to hit 51 until phase 3?
---
Well, they've been doing this on Retail for months now, so whatever automated system you think catches different people on the same machine playing the same account, doesn't work.
---
Is there a download link for the rogue icon as well? It's fantastic!
---
I am definitely going to take my time. I haven't even decided if I am going to do dungeons or just quest, grind, and craft my way up. I didn't do all the raids back in Vanilla but I did a good chunk and I am just not sure I want to go that route again. But ya never know...might get sucked back in after I take my leisurely stroll to 60.
---
I’m not in the beta so I can’t say. All I can say is my experience from actually doing it and vanilla many years ago. I always felt they were plenty strong for leveling
---
Here is picture of the greatest city for fourth one you must seek another post.

---
see how things turn out? have you played a blizzard game in the last 10 years?
---
If you wanted to change your name back then you could make a level 1 on the server you were going to transfer to with the same name as your character. It would force you to change the name after the transfer was complete.
---
I did this a lot, post one or 2 full stacks then a bunch of short stacks for the same price. Worked like a charm. My bank alt got a lot of hate mail.
---
&gt; Odds for the ninja to ninja: 20% chance.

Imagine asking a question you already know the answer to, so you can feel superior to people answering your question incorrectly.
---
Your motives seem questionable!
---
Rogues could have the potential to steal last hits but their stun locks won't one shot or global anyone. A geared warrior on the other hand is what you want for one shotting. 
---
With the info given I'd say warrior. They are a pain in the ass to level though.
---
I said one hung and asked a question.  Go fuck your self nerd
---
That's exactly what I did back then ;)  
---
That's why I'm confused if you could pay for a name change only or not.
---
A warrior with a pocket healer is the most dangerous thing in a BG.  Doubly so if that healer is a Pally.
---
I always wondered people praise geared warriors alot. But I'm wondering about geared rogues. Aren't they hella scary aswell ? Since Ambush damage should be pretty high especially on clothies right ? 
---
I wonder if you could way in on that since you said you played both. Rogues who outgear their opponent should be petty damn strong right ?
---
More like 1 month. MC is a joke mechanics wise especially compared to current raids.
---
What a weird filter. Storm Stormwind is barely recognizable.
---
For pure impact in bgs warrior is far better. Rogue is simply too reliant on cooldowns to be a strong bg class (although they still do have their niche). End game organised bg gameplay for a rogue is sitting at home on def, you often go 2 3 minutes without seeing an enemy player. Warrior end game organised pvp gameplay is charging into the biggest group of enemies you can find and splattering them with dedicated support.
---
Lol yes. This video is ridiculous.
---
I should note that it was a mythic kill and that it doubled as a comentary on both the state of the raids and the over simplicity of class design. Not relevant to the thread but just something id throw in
---
As you can see a lot of people said false information -- so I had to verify myself -- welcome to the internet (trump supporter right?)
---
It bothers me so much that you put spec after class.
---
Our raids would usually start at 7pm and we would raid till around midnight. We would do this usually 2-3 nights a week.
---
Most of us had jobs at the time and sometimes you would still be finishing dinner as the raid was forming but it was loads of fun.
---
Your link is missing a ')' character, that's why it's broken.
---
Maybe it's an NA Vs EU thing?
---
Because on the server I played on, back in vanilla, we used to all need on BoE, so no one could ninja (EU servers)
---
That’s crazy! props to that guy thanks for the extra info  :)
---
What desk I'm in need of a simple one like that.
---
Not a single one of those things is required to play the game though. Unless you are cutting edge, you can miss a day without a problem.

In early vanilla, rogue's had an active ability to detect hunter traps which had an animation with a swirly ball. https://youtu.be/aUeMoaTzghU

Except if you know its false, then you already knew the answer. 
---
And if you're so untrusting that you're just going to google it anyway, the point of this thread seems moot as you could have just started with Google and saved yourself a lot of trouble.
---
I think you just wanted to tell some people that they're wrong.
---
That's a weird way to paint Ironforge....
---
If I have selfcast selected in my interface, is it necessary to include an @player clause to use a spell on myself?
---
For example, is this a waste of space:
---
/Cast [Mod:alt,@mouseover][mod:alt,help][mod:alt,@player]Healing Touch(rank 4);
---
Multi monitor borderless gang reporting in to laugh at your alt tab bugs
---
Well classic released loaded to the rafters with bugs so it'd definitely make for an authentic release.

---
It’s not a paintover. There’s aliasing all over.
---
1 on 1 a geared rogue will obliterate most people before they know what is going on. So if you love small engagements rogue is great, especially if you’re one of the first rogues on the server with a Perdition’s Blade. 
---
The reason people praise warrior is because they’re amazing in group engagements. A rogue’s strength lies in their burst and ability to get openers; in a prolonged encounter where you survive the burst and the rogue blows all of their cooldowns they become lackluster.
---
A warrior is the opposite. In a big engagement like Blacksmith battle in AB they will simply wear you down. The longer the fight goes on the better they get as healers dump mana into MS’d targets.
---
What did I know was false? That there was No paid services? Of course I knew this part........ even my title is mentioning it -\_\_\_\_-
---
The mount is actually pretty cool and I have a 6 month sub anyway so I got it for free.
---
I know people hate store mounts but I am perfectly ok with Blizzard giving cosmetic things to people who are long term subscribers.
---
Alliance is actually more populated because casuals pick the "pretty" races and a lot of hardcore guilds depend on Paladins.
---
For the Horde, forever.
---
100% going to take my time with it. Gonna try quest in every level appropriate zone, and do every dungeon at least once on the way up.
---
It will probably mean I'm levelling on green quests a lot, but it's been 12 years since I've done Level 60 endgame, another couple of weeks to get there isn't gonna kill me.

Aliasing? LOL

So the first ')' doesn't get used by Reddit.
---
That was the hidden message from this post.  I want the beta so bad, I got a 6 month sub currently wasting away because I thought it would increase my chances of getting into the beta.
---
The more I think about rushing the less interested I am in doing it. I’ve grown into the mindset that I want to take my time, and read the quests and recapture the spark from when I first started. I will be playing without any addons since back in the day I was too retarded to know how to use addons. I’m going to get all my profs up while leveling and really focus on making friends. Classic wow is like a good cigar, you gotta sit back and slow burn it to really enjoy the flavor.

Think it’s more about the principle of giving praise to those who deserve it.

I refuse to believe.

---
Most people won't even be 60 in 1 month. 
---
I give 6 months before the PUG community is leveled and geared enough for regular MC clears.
---
I'm not saying it could of been sustained.  You argued that people prefer the early version of the game AKA Classic.  But the peak sub was in WOTLK.  A lot of us see the game getting ruined post WOTLK thus the player exodus.
---
It's not a unique view of mine many vanilla players have the same view.  It wasn't just going to an earlier version of the game it was going to the best version of the game because it got ruined.
---
It isn't like Civ 1 2 3 4 5 because the changes they did in Cata permanetly changed the old content and then it was no longer available.
---
Nothing like a bit of hubris to think back on when you're all forced to reroll on different accounts, only now way behind the curve.
---
Cheers
---
I couldn't agree more. Would be nice if they removed it. Atleast on PvP-servers. I mean, griefing is second nature to ppl playing on pvp-servers, so there should be more ways to do it.
---
I know you won't believe me but I'm in the beta and it isn't that thrilling.  The servers have been a complete ghost town for awhile so you are pretty much playing solo which isn't that fun at all.
---
Also once you hit 40 there is nothing to do and I doubt they will increase the level cap anymore.
---
If you want the classic experience you will get a better one by playing on a private server right now than being in the beta.
---
This is the case, and the smart thing to do. I never actually had anyone steal anything from me though, so I never bothered. 
---
That was before there was character transfers and renaming though, so probably even worse of an idea now. Maybe I'll switch it up and do that for classic lol.
---

---
those are rookie numbers :)

Yes.  6 months of game time, rotting away like my lvl 1 undead rogue that hasn’t waken from his tirisfal glades crypt yet on the beta.

---
Did you bind the hearthstone the kitchen or the crapper?
---
17 hunters need to be nerfed against 25 druids, delay the game
---
Why is it working for me?
---
They were introduced in one of the later patches.  It looks like it was patch 1.12, so right near the end.
---
Yeah c'mon guys.
---
Wrong. If classic is out for say 2 years before a tbc server, and you really cared about rating because you want rank 10, you might not be involved in DHKs for a max 1-1.5 months. After you hit rank 10 it doesn’t matter.
---
Before you say “ohh but rank 14...” 99% of us don’t give a damn about that because we know it’s unattainable for a normal player.
---
DHKs are fine
---
Really? Of all the things to complain about this is the one you're planting your flag on? Wow.
---
IWD solo challenge has been my go to lately
---
so much fun
---
I am currently dabbling with the 💰ilver h🅰️🧲d server and it has front stabbing...  I can’t resist the urge to use it and a frontstab spec since it increases leveling speed immensely.  I want the beta where I KNOW mechanics are closer to what I will get on August 26th.  I want to use combat sword spec and know it’s the meta.
---
That's why I only click from the spellbook. Having action bars is just QoL bullshit
---
Reserve what you want, but be a good tank and be geared to make the run fast and easy, if you show up in crappy gear and reserve stuff and want to roll on everything it’s not worth it to pay you, as you need the group as much as they need you
---
Nah man I love the game no matter what. This is just one of my suggestions. I’m sure will all have fun no matter what!
---
The sit mechanic doesn’t work on blizzard servers. That’s a private server mechanic. The way it really works is when you get parried you get attacked. So if you’re dual wielding and getting parried more often you’re taking much more damage.
---
There will never be a cross-faction raid of any city in Classic if DHKs are left in the game as they were.
---
BUT, you're wrong about DHK's not being a majority part of the Vanilla experience.
---
Game launches: 23 November 2004
---
Patch that introduced DHKs (1.5): 7 June 2005
---
First TBC patch: 5 December 2006
---
So DHKs were part of ~74% of the Vanilla experience.
---
They should still be changed so an entire raid doesn't get them when one person kills a civilian, but DHKs *are* #nochanges.
---
1-15 months lol come on dude. 
---
I’m not concerned about rank 14. I just don’t want my ranking to be stifled by a fun rate on enemy city!
---
:(
---
Title is misleading this is a picture of orgrimmar not Stormwind
---
Ugliest city in warcraft
---
PC specs? It looks a little slim :P
---
Dude it just does not matter. "the best during raiding" is kind of irrelevant given that the raid needs the other classes' unique mechanics as well. It's not like people are stacking 28 warriors because they do more damage. If you go look at videos from the top guilds back then they took a mix of classes to handle various mechanics; topping the meter just doesn't really matter the same way that it does in retail. You'll be able to raid and you'll clear the content regardless.
---
What if they said “here’s a free account, level this Paladin to 60 so we can MC buff ourselves with blessings”?
---
Nah, you’re right. Alliance is shit.
---
Are you wanting rank 10 to come faster? I’m confused at your post.
---
Wether they are in the game or not, if you are grinding honour you won’t be participating in raid battles anyway because your time would be spent grinding honour.....
---
*runs out of opinions on why it won't work when it clearly does*
---
*decides to quit the argument*
---
Okay, kid.
---
What you would do as I recall is practice a boss until you were close to a kill and then zone out and run around collecting world buffs if you felt like you were close enough that the world buffs would put you over the top. Do private server guilds go get world buffs when they're learning bosses for the first time? Is there even a learning process now or are you expected to know the strat in advance? If you were going for a server first kill in those days there often was no video of the fight available or any information about strats or anything like that. All you knew was perhaps a number of guilds in the world who had killed the boss, but you had no real idea how. It was sort of like the first 100 or so guilds to kill things faced a situation similar to what now only the first five guilds to kill things face, where you're solving a boss with zero outside information about how the fight works.
---
[Example.](http://ropetown.com/ropedkp/viewnews.php?s=fb63aa03101ea3a6c5e528ce925e803c&amp;start=69)
---
And then after the first 50 or so kills someone who had done a fight would do a written breakdown of the fight and add it to wowwiki or post it on EJ or whatever. At any rate, no, not everybody was world buffed all the time for a bunch of nights of repeat wiping.
---
We only get one flag?

After the recent proof that this is just stealing someone’s work without credit we need to send this picture to the shadow realm. Op deserves no karma for this!

And the fact that raiding a city and killing a faction leader negatively impacts your quest for honor so terribly that no one would dare risk it doesn't bother you?
---
I feel worse when I get less than 4 hours, but I can get some more done if I just stay up and don’t sleep and I’ll feel better roughing it out with no sleep. I can take a nap tomorrow when I get home before the raid. 
---
Tomorrow before raid: I need to farm/craft xyz, repost my auctions on auction house, burn up some of that full rested bar on my 3rd alt, and there’s plenty of time for sleep in the grave...after I get BiS on my three mains.
---
Well the leader should just /roll 1-40. Easiest and most effective way for any non gear. Obviously gear is just rolled for individually.
---
The smaller raid sizes made it feel like you had more of an impact. I thought tbc was a good balanced game to me and really hope it comes back too.
---
Where can I buy this??
---
With peoples knowledge of the game I suspect guild leading and raiding will be smoother. Throw in some quality of life addons.
---
I don't care about mudhuts and sand. I want to see glorious Alliance cities.
---
Just collect all the gear with Master Looter and give it out at the end of the raid or at the end of 2 hours, whichever happens first.
---
Why do you say nochanges then ask for a change?
---
OP is a bundle of sticks
---
Doesn't matter as long as the rules are set and communicated before the run starts.
---
That's what we did back in the day, just roll it off yourself so the raid keeps moving.

If you have the selfcast by default in your interface, then you don't need the @player (in most cases). You should be able to ditch that last conditional clause.

I'll acknowledge that Thunder Bluff is the most scenic city (it really is majestic) but Undercity is the best city. 
---
Also Gnomeregan could have been the best Alliance city but it got overrun with troggs and lepers and basically became a meme city because of how bad it was. It might be sad if it wasn't so funny.
---
I've never heard of a pug where the crafting drops are not reserved. You take them for the guild to make fire res sets for tanks and help guildies out with other MC craftable stuff like the healing belt. You also need an absurd amount of lava cores to reach exalted with Thorium Brotherhood. Usually you pick an armoursmith and boost him through the rep. From what I can remember the cores lose their value fairly quickly while the essences, especially essence of fire is much more valuable.

So this was on the stress test last week leveling as an orc. I had just finished the quest to kill Kul'tiras Sailors and Marines and wanted to die and spirit rez to get back to Razor Hill a bit faster. I died just outside the keep near the front door, kind of on the south side. Much to my disappointment, I appeared at the graveyard down at Sen'jin Village. So I decided to ghost run up to Razor hill and spirit rez there. So I ran up and used the spirit healer outside razor hill....but as I came alive it teleported me BACK to sen'jin and I had to make the run a 2nd time, alive this time.

[This is probably](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhefoEzVZGcVZV) the best PvE seal fate dps build, but more realistically you just go a normal PvP build because that's really the point of going sealfate daggers (to do pvp and pve with one spec ok). If you were just strictly after a PvE build you'd go combat daggers.
---
When the beta was first coming out, many interviews said it would be for the initial two weeks. They also said that the absolute cutoff was phase 2, so like usual, theres a lot of wiggle room that Blizzard can play in without lying.
---
Has there been any word on weak auras or some similar addon being usable in classic? I would've expected to hear the screeches of \#nochanges. I'd rather use weak auras than the janky cooldown timers we had in 2004 though... so much more elegant

Do note, none of these specs become viable until AQ when you have enough crit chance on your gear.

just popping in for a quick well ackchyually, they bone at least twice in the book Arthas: Rise of the Lich King!

---
It isn't "missing" that part. It's that the filter botched it so bad, it just blends with the rest of the pic.
---
I ran this build with pre bis and felstriker and absolutley did great dps. Much more viable in PVP too. Like you said way more fun than combat swords. But i have a feeling if it wasnt for having felstriker it wouldnt be as viable
---
I started playing Magic Arena because of nostalgia. Its pretty fun even as F2P!
---
In Vanilla we had ret pally, shadow priest, balance druid etc all playing and clearing ZG, MC, and about half of BWL. If you're wanting to just have fun in Vanilla every class/spec is viable. I had a blast in Vanilla and me and my friends were content with clearing ZG and running BGs.

I think you could probably redesign that area to make Alterac its own zone as well as the area surrounding Dalaran.

If classic is successful it'll give blizzard members that have pushed against monetization a leg to stand on. It should also be discussed just how much the subscription model produces. At **13$**/month for the **cheapest** subscription plan every **1**million subbed players is **$13**million a month! that means **$156**million a year! Its very difficult to predict just how many will sub in august and even harder to predict how many will maintain that sub. But even with the most efficient subscription a moderate player base(1million or so) becomes a massive asset(yes the supposed 1.7mil for retail also is a large asset). I personally think we will see numbers close to 3-4million(I know this is bullish) players during the first year which would ***potentially*** create enough revenue for classic to potentially surpass retail versions, it wont set records or approach the 12million peak(*which was 10yearsago!)* but we also have to consider whether the *profit:revenue* (lets remember profit and revenue are not the same thing) ratio is higher with classic than with modern expansions, but this ratio is also hindered for every player already subbed to BFA that also participates in classic which will complicate those numbers quite a bit. I would expect some interesting info in the Q3 report concerning subscription revenue.
---
I know *exactly* how you feel.  I was set to be promoted from Private to Corporal the day 2.0 hit.

I actually like the dichotomy of it and there's a sense of cruelty to the Belfs that make them more like the kinda monsters you don't expect, kinda monstrous on the inside. Their mana dependency, twisting of the light and horribly self centered tactics all in the name of survival made them feel perfect in the Horde.

No, that's a really awful spec. I listed better ones in [my comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6tak6/seal_fate_pve_build/esb2sia/).
---
If you're going for a PVP/PVE hybrid build, then [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/30530310501135-3023-05005003) or one of the other specs I listed is your answer. If you don't do any group PVP, you can take the points out of Imp. Kidney Shot for more Imp. Poisons.
---
And then I cast Frost Shock! Love AR.

Unfortunately the dwarf skill makes no measurable difference, not taking a bow upgrade never makes sense for a dwarf hunter. I know it sucks because most weps are bows, but that's vanilla wow.

---
It's not a change, since there were periods in Vanilla without Dhks and also with Dhks. So both scenarios is authentic. Which is better? I would say without dhks, since they killed city raiding and didn't serve their intended purpose.
---
that was my favorite part of vanilla honestly. I did most things epic marathon style until I was done or over the course of a few days. I never liked the feeling that I had to log on everyday, stop at a certain point and move on to other things.
---
Hey, I agree, they're stupid as hell, but you have to admit they have an amazing business model. They pull in millions of suckers every year to gobble up the crap they peddle. The fact they have a dedicated following and are the most profitable company for computers and phones means they did something right, even if it sucks balls.
---
They got to where they are by being good at the business and then once Steve Jobs died it all went downhill fast.
---
I'm a very casual player so it doesn't really make a difference for me,I'm just super excited to play something very nostalgic to me.
---
I can understand why this would be a problem for you more dedicated players though.
---
Retail wow tries to make playing a habit. Motivation can vary but habits often keep you going. Customers that have a strong habit are the wet dream of any business.
---
Was herb alch all through vanilla as resto druid (i did have IS)farmed the ungoro circle and the felwood routes just fine
---
Going in fresh with everything being new will be the best. Although you won't be competitive right away I think the adventure always outweighed that in classic.
---
Meh, there are corporate sponsors at stake. Some people care about that enough to stay hushed so others don't ruin the plan. And many of us are/were EVE players, but when you don't need the cash, it's the fame that matters and no one outside of EVE gives a shit about EVE (except the few times it's made the news and that's usually just Corp names).

This is copied from Oto's Rogue guide. You can find it on google (I can't directly link it here)
---
Just to note, this talent build is aimed for naxx level gear pve. There may potentially be better builds for lower levels of gear but that requires a lot of math that I don't know how to do.
---
From my experience playing on pservers as seal fate swords, its really not worth it until very late bwl gear levels or AQ and requires world buffs. Daggers having a significantly higher crit chance will definitely play out differently. 
---
Some slight changes I would recommend but may be wrong or play style based, so take it with a grain of salt. 
---
* Daggers rotation doesn't eviscerate that often, take Murder instead of Imp Evisc, put the extra point in Imp Poisons
---
* Drop lightning reflexes and take Imp Gouge instead, it is WAY more usefull. 
---
* Imp Sprint can be a lot more useful than Endurance, but this is a bit more play style oriented.
---
* Playing an Alliance rogue *might* want Vile poisons over Imp poisons since you will use both weapons and horde uses only the offhand (due to windfury). Math required to verify either way.
---
You bought a 6month sub in hope for a beta? 
---
Dude! Do you wipe your ass with cash ?
---
You don't need to pick up mining. As long as you have a way to make money you can just buy the ore you need from the AH. 
---
The real solution is to just take Herbalism on your main and then level an alt to be an Alchemist. You only need to get the alt to 35 to reach 300 Alchemy. Farm the herbs you need on your main, and mail them off to the alt to craft your potions. 
---
You can slap Tailoring on it too, then you have both the Transmute from Alchemy and Mooncloth from Tailoring cooldowns which you can use every few days for free money. 
---
It only takes a few days to level an alt to 35. And once you get it set up then you're done, and reaping the benefits every couple days when your crafting cooldowns come up. You can do this with several characters too, and get a good amount of passive income flowing.
---
&gt; You have a ceasefire agreement with the other faction
---
No we don't.
---
Posting on the wow classic subreddit calling someone a nerd like its a derogatory word lol
---
The same fake leaks, now in video form for your viewing displeasure!
---
If imp poisons is better than vile for some reason than fair enough, but I think it's pretty obvious 8 pts for ambush and imp KS are terrible raiding talents.
---
Improved gouge and kidney shot for PVE? Also keep in mind I haven’t played in years so I may sound like an idiot asking these questions.
---
yeah no healer ever went to pick an herb, got jumped, and then popped rocket helmet to just end the fight
---
Funny, neither does the current team.
---
That's quite clever. I like yours better than mine, my only caveat being it should use \[nocombat,@player\] to force the Rejuv to target self.

---
Usually, in BGs, fights are quite short. Most of the time, a healer will die or win a fight (with support around) before running out of mana. Since paladins are mostly healer in BGs, they are targetting 1st from the other side. So, survivalist talents are the one I would choose 1st.
---
I was a big noob in Vanilla and I got to the end of AQ40 before I quit due to timezones and high school. You'll be fine man. Find a class you like first before you go all out and level it and enjoy the ride. :)
---
I said IF they didn't agree in that specific scenario (i.e. a fresh server with fresh 60s).
---
If it's an upgrade for a character and they can equip it, it's a fair roll. I think it's unfair to deny someone an obvious upgrade, or a BiS for them that no one else in the party can actually use just because they could sell it on the AH for money.
---
Nah, that's pure greed at that point.
---
What you said I agree with if the server is a little older and yes, people could sell it for other Pre BiS or BiS gear, because at that point there will be plenty of people buying items and more of them being sold on the AH
---
In a fresh server most people will just equip the BoE to get that gear advantage.
---
I'd say warrior for both. You will die more but it's easier to charge in and 2 shot or execute a low health than waiting for cold blood or stealthing into moving targets. 
---
Cold blood is a good setup, but 3 min CD and waiting for opportunities will get you like 2 kills per BG.
---
I had pretty much stage 6, but had a spire of twilight 2 hander instead for the weapons... I liked the look of it better!
---
I'm so sad that I actually leveled that character for a bit post vanilla and lost some of the gear... i also race changed it to panda for some stupid reason... 
---
Would be great to have preserved it for sentiments sake.
---
You do realize that mobs damage seems to be significantly lower on beta then on the good Vanilla servers right? And this will likely carry into raids as well, considering it's the same in dungeons (Mobs doing a whole let less damage than on private servers)
---
I can't wait till the top 2-3 private server guilds absolutely wipe the floor with the retail kids as well as with world 1st clears, the salt is going to be glorious.
---
You do realize your posting on a 15 year old re released MMORPG reddit forum. Hate to tell you this but your probably a nerd to my dudes.
---
Well it worked in the original, and it works on the beta. Taking things from people that need it because you want to sell it, and are worried others will sell it is fucking asinine though. Instead of there being a chance of someone screwing the group over there's a 100% chance the group screws someone who needs it over. That's objectively worse.
---
Companies aren't your friends. 
---
You'll grow up and realize this eventually, but they all just want money at the end of the day.
---
Yeah. Most of the fun as a Paladin comes from getting creative and surviving/helping your teammates survive things it seems like you shouldn't. All these blessings, seals, and auras that seem useless individually can be really effective when used at the right time. It's true they don't get much in the way of offensive abilities, though. (I do love aoe grinding though!)
---
Why? If it's an upgrade, then it's an upgrade. If it's high value that just means it's probably BiS for that person.
---
Why deny someone that if they can use it and it's an obvious upgrade for them?
---
Gear upgrade for someone &gt; Selling on the AH.
---
Again, Need BEFORE Greed.
---
Hopefully the alliance doesnt have any oil in westfall or we can expect a full horde invasion to stop the defias bandits from producing weapons of mass destruction
---
I find playing rogue to he very helpful to others. I often find myself playing the role of "doctor", and humanely euthanizing every gnome I come across. It also helps keep their population in check so they don't throw off the balance in azeroth.
---
On my server we rolled need on BoE's because like they said its impossible to ninja. People easily lie about needing upgrades and then sell it for gold just so they get defaulted the item. In some cases people will even switch out gear to make it seem like they have a worse item to garner more cause to their "need" although this is much rarer.
---
At the end of the day everyone can use the gold from the item to make their character stronger. Someone who can equip the item doesn't deserve the upgrade automatically when someone can attain an item of equal power via trade.  
---
We wouldn't even discuss needing on boe's it was just known.
---
I tested this in the Beta a few weeks ago: 
---
1. Created a Gnome, died to wolves in Coldridge Valley, walked my ghost to the Kharanos spirit healer, and was rezzed in Coldridge Valley.
---
2. Same as above, except I logged out at the Kharanos spirit healer, logged back in, and was rezzed back at Coldridge Valley.
---
3. Died again, walked my ghost over the Dun Morogh/Wetlands mountain skip to Menethil Harbor, got on a ship, arrived in Darkshore as a ghost, walked to the Darkshore spirit healer, logged out and logged back in, was rezzed back at Coldridge Valley.

Lmfao burnt out on classic from watching streams ? Just no lol.
---
What about the Hydraxian rep? They aren't going to be doing that quest line while leveling. They have to kill certain trash in MC then kill certain bosses. That's gonna be a lot of waiting around for people who have been up for a week straight.
---
That’s not Darkshire.
---
I wipe my ass with linen!  Srsly that stuff is gonna FILL the AH
---
There will be a handful of private server guilds with tons of experience that destroy all the raid content, but that is mostly because they will be playing 10-18 hours a day and have experience clearing the raids. The average player, 99% of people in Classic will get smashed in AQ/Naxx just like in retail Vanilla.
---
I always followed that rule, my guild followed that rule even if we brought people from outside the guild into the runs.
---
If it's an upgrade that can be equipped at the moment then they get priority roll on it.
---
Need BEFORE Greed. That's always been a thing even since Vanilla.
---
Saying "No you can't have that obvious upgrade for you gear because I want to be able to roll on it so I can sell it on the AH" is just an absolute dick move.
---
Classic wow was magical. I remember when the game first launched there were only a few level 60s and a lot of the level 60s wear rogues who would spend all day ganking lowbies. so whenever we would be attacked we'd call for the high levels in our guild to come defend us. 
---
To me that's where classic wow really shines. in the very beginning where nobody's super Op and the universe is alive with activity
---
It’s absolutely worth buying for people like me who are coming back for 8.2 after a long hiatus and plan on playing Classic, since it’s the same subscription service for both, I’m guaranteed to be playing at least casually the next 6 months.

Beautiful, clean, effective. See you in STV.

No, give people the choice to play TBC.  They will eventually discover that [raid] balanced classes and controlled game-play go hand in hand.  Vanilla is the only version of Wow in which you define your path and therefore the only version with permanence.

---
&gt; Daggers rotation doesn't eviscerate that often, take Murder instead of Imp Evisc, put the extra point in Imp Poisons

Disagree. 2 crits while SnD is up means you're using Eviscerate and it should always be what you use Cold Blood on.
---
&gt; Drop lightning reflexes and take Imp Gouge instead, it is WAY more usefull.
---
Agree.
---
&gt; Playing an Alliance rogue might want Vile poisons over Imp poisons since you will use both weapons and horde uses only the offhand (due to windfury).
---
You honestly don't want either if you're putting effort into consumables. A Flask of Supreme Power alone makes using Shadow Oil better than max rank Instant Poison even with either talent from Assassination.

Yes, pointing out the lack of sustainability and threat generation is clearly just saying "u bad!11"

For leveling they are still very good but nerfed maybe 10% only. Also rogue is down there with warrior and paladin for leveling (aka they suck too). So I'd say hunter, lock, then druid for best levelers with AoE mage somewhere around there.

I remember in vanilla people telling me that my warrior could not dps because fury was terrible and that I should just tank.
---
17% you can make up 16% but 1% will always exist hard coded.
---
I've already gone into why no one in the group will have been awake for a week straight in other comments off this one. They'll be getting full nights of sleep, especially the night before the raid.
---
The 7 people that will be handling Quintessences are being powerleveled to 60. They'll have 3 days to get to the 2nd to last part (Honored with Hydraxian Waterlords). Then we simply kill MC trash and reset over and over until they have the rep, they get summoned to turn it in, come back, we kill the bosses (including the 4 they need), they get summoned again, they come back, done.
---
This guy is way too gullible.
---
Zin'rokh Destroyer of Worlds would like to have a word with you.
---
95% of pugs will have legendaries &amp; crafting mats reserved, and all other items MS+1. Meaning anyone can roll on a piece of loot if it is for their main spec and they haven't received any loot thus far. but if someone receives a piece of loot, they aren't allowed to roll on other items unl everyone eligible for said piece of loot have already received a piece of loot. Meaning, if a warrior wins strikers mark, he is not allowed to roll on BRE if it were to drop, unless every other warrior in the raid had also received a piece of loot.

---
Yeah I’m thinking if there’s any downtime on one character like waiting for a mob or something I can switch over and play another for a bit. 
---
I want the warrior to be my main though, but I definitely want to play other classes too. Then again I might be completely underestimating the time investment that would take LOL.
---
Honestly, I think WC4 absolutely will happen but maybe not until Age of Empires 4 or "Age of Mythology 2" coming out around the same time. Just a gut feeling but I do have hope!
---
I find it hard to believe that the average player is still playing at 10 fps 150 ping while keyboard turning and clicking all of their spells.
---
I'm really excited for Blizzard to change Arms Spec to focus on healing and then we can just run stuff with a group of 40 warriors as WoW was intended.
---
I pay for a gym membership, but I can't use the cycling machines there unless I fork out some extra money on top. I also have to pay individually for each weight I want to use past 40kg. It's fine though because they use that money to buy new sets of weights for people to buy access to.
---
Hell even Obsidian Edged Blade looks cooler in my opinion.
---
Layering is going to be...less than fun for community building.

---
Don't you need phones now to even get in the convention or something?
---
Obviously. Everyone can do wathever they want. Didnt thiink I need to say I was joking by pointing out the fact that rogue are the most chosen alt
---
SF is really a PVE/PVP hybrid, but even if you're only using it for PVE, yes, these are the talents. The reason is because of your other choices.
---
Imp Gouge might not be used in raids, but neither will 3% dodge. Better to take the one with far more utility out in the world.
---
Remember, you're not using poisons in raids at all, so Imp. Poisons and Vile Poisons are useless to you. That leaves Expose Armor (not allowed), Remorseless Attacks (useless outside of leveling and even then pretty useless), and another point in Murder (but still 2 points in Imp. Kidney Shot).
---
The 3% extra raid damage in kidney shot is more valuable than 1% self-damage against mobs that don't really show up that much once you have the gear to spec SF.
---
Even hardcore guilds in vanilla didn't consider using consumables until late AQ40. What casual raiding guild demanded that you spend hundreds of gold to run BWL? Did you just join a hardcore guild and assume that every guild was like that?
---
they dont play it
---
His resolution was pretty high.
---
Fuck. I love reddit!
---
Yeah, but 7.7 FPS.
---
Excellent input.  I do like that they're not played much.  I never thought I'd have so much trouble deciding a class to play.  The warlock and mage are just really on the same level in my mind.
---
The 3 classes you talk about are all super fun to play. I plan to rush a lvl 60 then do something else that I'll lvl slowly, enjoying low lvl content and pvp. I'm a die hard horde fan so I wont be able to roll a pal. I like pal honestly. I wish you good luck and a lot of fun !
---
Just need WiFi such as hotspot for on the go ya?
---
Fun fact, the Tram is taking you East to West too.
---
It suggests that because you want threat. It's going to hold your DPS back for the start of raids. However it'll be pretty expensive at the start since Axe of Deep Woods is pre-bis for orc 1h fury.
---
I avoid that place like the plague while leveling.
---
It's fun and I love WPvP but as a leveling Warrior I'm just too easy of a target solo for any opposing player.
---
LOK’TAR OGAR!
---
I was only basing Rez off of dying on boats and being Rezzed when they zone. Although it may be different if you don’t release...
---
Either way I know spirit healers don’t work in classic and didn’t later in vanilla.
---
So this doesn't exactly compare, but I have a surface pro 6. I tested with private server and the wow beta. It's crazy how better the beta runs on it compared to the private server. Blizz definitely optimized classic better this go around. I'd say it has a fair chance to run classic better on your setup than what you expect.
---
I've always embraced.  Though I have a knack for winning most of the time in world PvP.
---
Even better, use esdf for movement keys and you open 2 extra keys as well.
---
It's always nice to alt-tab back into the game only to...find yourself...drowning...R.I.P.
---
&gt; Disagree. 2 crits while SnD is up means you're using Eviscerate and it should always be what you use Cold Blood on.
---
I guess I should clarify. Assuming Combat daggers, you actually don't really eviscerate outside of Adrenaline rush. Imp Slice lasts 30 seconds, in 30 seconds you get 15 energy ticks of 20 each. That's 300 energy, which is 5 backstabs. You should Slice again to refresh and not use eviscerate.
---
Given that OP is asking about Seal Fate then yes you will be using more eviscerates due to backstabs high crit chance and proc'ing seal fate for additional combo points. That being said, (I dont know the math) I still say its very possible that 2% overall damage might outweigh the 15% evis damage. (Yes I know its only certain mob types, but it covers everything in T1 and T2 minus 3 bosses)
---
In fact, I might. My girlfriend wants to play a warrior (to MT for raids, no less), so they've been on my mind. Maybe I'll do some research into it.
---
Are you THE Shadow panther? Like from vanilla/BC era?
---
A group of about 120 people all coordinating to put the first raid group into MC and get a WF Rag kill in week one? Yeah, it can be.
---
But judging by the few pages of your comment history I bothered reading, your definition of fun is just arguing with people over shit no one cares about.
---
Good luck ever being happy in life. I doubt it will happen, but some forever alone people seem to manage it.
---
95% of pugs will have legendaries &amp; crafting mats reserved, and all other items MS+1. Some pugs allow +1 to be reset for domo &amp; rag, so people don't just hold their rolls for the last 2 bosses. [Check out this forum post](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=31311) for a good idea on how to properly organize a pug.

There definitely should be a stigma. I try to avoid playing with anyone that has paid for a store mount with real money because it's a great indicator that they suck at the game
---
&gt; and a lot of the time there's recolors of these mounts in the game at some point.
---
Store mounts that don't currently have available recolours: 
---
Sylverian Dreamer, the Dreadwake, Vulpine Familiar, Hogrus, Warforged Nightmare, Shu-zen, Mystic Runesaber (arcanist manasaber is similiar but not the same), Enchanted Fey Dragon, Heart of the Aspects, Luminous Starseeker, Iron Skyreaver (closest is Skyterror from WoD pathfinder, but doesn't have any armour), Winged Guardian, Celestial Steed. 
---
Store mounts with available recolours: 
---
nice try buddy fork out 34 bucks for the next completely unique mount we make (or 85 bucks if they do more of these 6 month sub ones)

I use 3 monitors at work and would never go back to one in that regard.

However at home, I prefer one monitor. I like to be immersed when I game, more monitors are just distracting.

I can Alt-Tab just fine when I need to.

This sounds a lot like me, especially reaching 60 with only a couple weeks till TBC drooped.

I would suggest the Obsidian Isometric RPGs as well. Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny.

If you have an iPad you can download an app called SplashTop.  It’s pretty much a RDP with programmable buttons if you buy the productivity pack.

Total cost of both apps is around $30.
---
No one should go SF in T1 and T2 over combat daggers. It's really only viable once you start getting gear from AQ. And Murder is useless in Naxx.
---
But even still, 10% pre-crit damage to eviscerate is better for SF than 2% overall damage against some mobs.

---
I just don't get why. Dishonorable kills are very much in the spirit of vanilla. They add a real, meaningful consequence to killing civilian NPCs but they don't stop you from doing it. You can raid cities if you want, but you have to accept the possibility of a DK. If anything they aren't a severe enough punishment because they don't really have any consequence for people who don't care about rank. If you've played some popular private servers you've probably witnessed this, as several towns are camped pretty much 24/7 and all the NPCs are killed the second they spawn. Good old world PvP, right!
---
My exact thought. Imagine the poor souls that unknowingly rolls on that server and being the opposite faction. Fucking steamrolled by elitist minmaxers with their t1 on first month... oof!
---
The raids were tuned for 25 people so I can totally see it being pug’ed by 40 non-optimal classes
---
http://imgur.com/a/fhEVabi
---
&gt; Your "min-maxed" dagger spec has imp KS over murder so yeah...
---
Yes, because Seal Fate doesn't start outshining Combat until Naxx where Murder is mostly useless. Imp. Kidney Shot can save so much time on trash that it's worth it over a small increase in your own DPS outside of Naxx.
---
I just saw Final Fantasy Tactics.
---
Let's discuss. Tell me more.

I’m rushing mostly because my work/real life is not conducive to WoW. I have a few days off at launch and that weekend the wifey and kid will be up at her parents, so I have a few days to power level to get to 60 ASAP.

---
An absolute shame.
---
Final Fantasy 12 is ^kinda a sequel.
---
I really want to see a Final Fantasy Tactics PS4 remake, the model/animations/attacks could look so cool on current gen consoles and the gameplay would be soooooo smooth.
---
I agree that you shouldn't do it in T1 or T2...but OP already said in another comment he wanted to know despite that fact. And its 2% damage to every mob in BWL and all the bosses but garr, geddon and rag. Plus the trash in MC thats elementals. It's not "some" mobs. It's damn near everything, at least in raids it is. Not saying that I agree or disagree, Just that I would rather see the math behind it than take your word. Rogue damage is primarily auto attack and a flat 2% is pretty good.
---
i looked it up, he actually missed the phone call from zach snyder offfering him the part because of wow not his audition
---
Do you have any substantive point to make, or are you just insulting people and insisting that everything is subjective?
---
I had heard it was originally supposed to go to Darnassus and that's why there was so much underwater and the east/west orientation.
---
Both, getting gold for spending real money causes Inflation of items because you can now buy them for gold you didn't earn in game by actually working the economy. If 500 people on a server sold 5 wow tokens each for 500 gold a piece that's 2500 gold per person. They then buy epic items off the ah and materials, now driving up the prices making players who didn't have this bought gold struggle to buy anything, inflating prices as people try to take advantage, and gold farmers now farm the shit out of items posting them for insane prices that these token sellers can only afford etc.. Anyway it forces inflation and hurts the economy.
---
So let me get this straight, most of classic had DHK's including the patch we are going to be playing on. But you don't like it so you want to changed! That isn't no changes. Next time read.
---
I know you meant in the WoW timeline but I instantly imagined a raid where you visit Blizzard's offices and kill everyone in 2006.

Found a comment he responded too about Classic, he said “I am in the Beta, and I’m excited to re-explore pre-cataclysm Azeroth but it’s not something I would play regularly as I’m more interested in story progression.”
---
Not "nobody like OP". OP needed because he needed. Not to ninja.

Though all-needing to prevent ninjaing was common, it was done specifically so the people like OP who *did* need the item could get it.

---
You are correct in that they might try to monetize it later on. And you are right that some forms of monetization might kill the game.
---
But the tcg mounts is not it. A bunch of people would quit, thats true. But if as you say in your example that there are more people playing classic than retail then "no changes or i quit"-people will be a small minority.
---
Looks like more soul and effort went into this than bfa
---
That's a very good point. I absolutely despise dailies and they are the reason I'm not sure anyone remembers WOTLK fondly.
---
What is the point of arguing about a couple percentage points of damage in raids where using the spec will mean doing 10-20% less damage than you could be doing with another spec?
---
OP wants it for fun. Much bigger CB+Eviscerate numbers is more fun than negligible improvements to all his numbers.
---
And if you need further convincing, the guide you're referencing says Imp Eviscerate is better than Imp Poisons and he always chooses Imp Poisons over Murder.

One of the worst. All of your abilities that would help you as a flag carrier (Blessing of Freedom, Cleanse, heals) are just better suited for casting on someone else while they carry the flag. The only saving grace is that you have more armor than a Priest or Warlock, so you're not the absolute worst choice, but you're not good either.
---
Druid is the only choice if you care about this. Mage, Warrior, and Shaman (Ghost Wolf) can all do it to some extent too.
---
Yeah, but that involves weighing *potential* profit, delayed gratification, against the instantaneous gratifaction for a player receiving a direct upgrade.
---
Rogue is not a chart topper. Warrior is.

Nah Brah you will Do fine. Me and my friends are Rollin slow and steady, what's the rush to 60? We have months to enjoy the game, quest do dungeons and tune our characters. When we want to raid we can hop in a guild that suits our needs.
---
If you join a group for a dungeon you haven't done, just tell them your new. Honestly most people will be glad to help. Just don't pull mobs and attack what the tank attacks, or says to kill First. I would rather a new guy do less dps and pay attention then try to show off and fuck the group up causing a wipe making us run back.
---
Let the hardcore people go nuts, and find a guild closer to your roll and enjoy the difficulty and commitment/ reward for playing.
---
No, I work in Policing and know how annoying that is when you hear another officers music in his cruiser playing when they talk on the radio.

---
Much better. Playing the beta didn't even get my laptop warm. I didn't realize how much they've jacked up processor/GPU requirements over the 15 years until then
---
What does that have to do with whether its warlock bis or not
---
I agree, That's why headphones work great.
---
&gt;itemization still had a trend where BiS came from all raids
---
But no decent gear came from dungeons in TBC.  This was the worst part of the direction Wow took after mid vanilla.  Beyond being boring, "Do raids, get better gear" also shut down theory-crafting.  WotLK was worse for sure (BiS only came from the latest raid) but TBC started the treadmill trend.
---
In early-mid vanilla on the other hand BiS was a crazy mix between crafted, quest rewards, world drops, dungeon drops, and raid drops.
---
Honestly my Classic goal is to hit 60 with every class.  I really don’t care just a ton about raiding.  My plan is exclusively Horde with the exception of the Paladin.
---
My original main in original WoW was a Druid.  Im really looking forward to doing that again.  Then I’ll do Shaman.  Maybe a warlock after that.

---
I really want to know where this idea that “warlocks are complicated” came from, OP.
---
In raids warlocks have the most brain dead easy rotation in the game, you press shadowbolt and stay behind the tank on threat.  *You literally can’t have a simpler rotation* unless you went afk after a /petattack
---
On any other class I'd be excited for it.

Random fun fact, if you head to this location in Classic, you'll leave General Chat. And if anyone shift clicks your name or views you in guild or friends list your zone will be "Unknown". Dieing here will send you to Sentinel Hill, Westfall (Alliance), or Crossroads, The Barrens (Horde). Nice way to teleport from Azshara to Westfall if you're okay with the repair bill and 10 mins of rez sickness

You will Find someone in game, in vanilla I had a group I played with for over a year, and we still stay in contact now.

If you have a consistent play time it's pretty likely.

If you had to pay for professions, classes, gear, raids, dungeons, battlegrounds, Arena, then yes, that's equivalent. You completely missed the point.

We usually ran 3 (Marks). We typically had more mages, rogues and fury warriors topping DPS then hunters.
---
Thanks! I'm trying to decide how and when I'll be using the macros to help funnel the decision trees I write. The one im describing is more of a part of a raid healing macro, so it will be multiple ranks of HT with different modifiers.
---
Let me sub to only classic then.
---
Which is why it’s not a big deal.
---
How bad is it compared to dw fury?
---
&gt; And ultimately, unless you're in absolute full best in slot gear, ALL YOUR LOOT IS TEMPORARY
---
But no other loot holds the same monetary value.
---
Even in pure healing gear paladins can do quite a bit of "finish" damage, it is just that their sustained is low.  Realize this is 1.12 paladin, not launch paladin so you get hammer of wrath, a ranged execute.  Even with no spell power you can judge, divine favor holy shock someone for around 1k damage, so in just-hit-60 hp ranges of 2800-3800 hp, you just need somoene to be at half or below and you can finish quite quickly.  So you either need to giimmick in some more damage to increase your burst, or just tank someone while you do chip damage to get them into burst range.  
---
You should almost always beat warrior from chip damage, and can outmana all non-priest(mana burn hurts) hybrids as well as hunters.  You might stuggle to finish if the hybrid turtles, but they for sure cannot finish you.  
---
Bad rogues are quite easy and can be chipped away like warriors, but amazing rogues will dominate you with nothing you can do about it.  Middle tier rogues you can beat by just using gimmick weapons and rolling dwarf.  Skullforge reaver is a 1h from strat that puts a 30sec dot on the rogue that should prevent restealth resets.  
---
Priest will typically dominate you with mana burn. dispel, and fear, you can't really outlast warlocks and they control you too well, and mages are impossible to hit as a paladin.  Wearing spell power over +healing, an activated spell power trinket, and being engr are all required to have a real chance.  
---
Grenade + gnomsih death ray can kill a lot of classes, comboed  with hoj with your finisher.  Six demon bag and the meteor trinket from AQ have similar but not quite as high of burst potential as death ray.

I love all these people talking about how they used to play with such low framerates. During Legion I was barely pushing 10 fps with LOWER than lowest graphics. Next time you're in game type "/console renderscale 0.3". THAT is what my game had to look like to fight Argus the Unmaker. Seeing the swirlies in the last phase was a nightmare. Btw "/console renderscale 1" to set it back to default.

There's not a single in-game thing that's **required** to play. You can add that "unless you are XXX" clause for basically anything.

But that's not the point in this thread. The point is that some progression is time-gated in a way where you can't catch up and if you skip some dailies/weeklies, you're gonna be behind, no matter how much you're willing to play in the future. It's about people wanting X and X requiring them to log in daily if they want it ASAP. That's what feels like a chore.

For those that don't know, Michel Koiter was an artist who worked at Blizzard with his twin brother. He died from sudden heart failure with an unknown cause about 8 months before World of Warcraft's release. He and his brother are considered some of Blizzard's most influential artists of all time.
---
This is *The Shrine of the Fallen Warrior* in The Barrens. There's the body of an orc warrior left there with this poem available upon inspection (written by his brother, René Koiter):
---
&gt; Where once a hero set foot on his native soil a monument has risen
---
&gt;Where now part of his essence resides a mystical boon will be given
---
&gt; Upon the monument the runic initials MK have been engraved
---
&gt;To honor all the journeys and battles the fallen one has braved
---
&gt; A hero's enduring spirit transcends many worlds beyond our own
---
&gt; Only those with steadfast dedication find a bond with this unknown
---
&gt; Travel the continents and scour the lands for the shrine standing tall
---
&gt; For in the presence of the monolith the warrior will be with you all.
---
He also has a hidden memorial in a StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty cinematic.
---
That's like the Algalon the Observer of the raid.
---
The DPS gap was my experience as well. The time cap on the first boss in BWL caused some heartache. The first phase with all the mobs was a bit of a learning curve after how easy MC was. That said, my guild migrated from EQ and after dealing with the bullshit that went into PoTime and the attunements for Omens of War it wasn't too difficult. It did cause a lot of heartache for other guilds on my server though.
---
&gt; What is the point of arguing about a couple percentage points of damage in raids where using the spec will mean doing 10-20% less damage than you could be doing with another spec? 
---
Because that is what the OP asked about? I agree he wants it for fun and that's fine and all. But why not try to maximize the output while still accomplishing what he asked. 
---
&gt; And if you need further convincing, the guide you're referencing says Imp Eviscerate is better than Imp Poisons and he always chooses Imp Poisons over Murder. 
---
Neither of those comparisons is what I was talking about. We were comparing Improved Eviscerate and Murder.  
---
Basically Murder is better in T1 and T2 and Imp Eviscerate is better in AQ and Naxx. 
---
That being said. A seal fate build being run in T1 and T2 I could see going either way due to SF using more eviscerates than a standard combat dagger build.   
---
I haven't said anything regarding poisons outside of my initial comment.
---
A fellow orc warrior!!
---
Okay, you moonlight as a paladin, who are despicable and I charge them every time despite knowing I'll probably lose. But, I am still proud to call you my brother.
---
Thanks! Like I said to the other guy people bitch it takes me time to pull in dungeons.
---
1. caster form
---
2. cast rejuv on me to help build a little aggro
---
3. pull the mob with faerie fire
---
4. transform in bear to tank the mob
---
5. depends: LOS a caster or charge or rage
---
Boy it sure was exciting to do 20+ raids of the same dungeon before I finally won my class leggings. Man that was such a fuckin blast, let me tell ya!
---
You basically just agreed with him. Yes you were behind because you took a break, but because of the way systems worked in Classic you could "catch up". Compare that to retail where if you take a week off you are permanently behind everyone else by 1 week and there is no way to make it up.
---
Hit up a higher level hunter to help you with your axe.  Let him know you'll put him on your friends list for future dungeons that you'll tank and he'll almost certainly help you to through it.
---
I didn’t take it as him saying that raids would wipe. To me it sounded like he was just stating that it’s a lot worse, which it is.
---
I’ll never understand this way of thinking but I guess I don’t have to. It’s like, as a warlock, if I refused to wear bloodvine because I wanted to look cool during a raid. 
---
I just wouldn’t feel right purposely doing worse just to know my character looks neat. I guess I just feel good knowing that I’m doing my best and helping my fellow guild mates. 
---
I’d feel selfish purposely doing worse. I also feel good seeing that my performance is good. I don’t really see how someone could finish a raid, see their lower numbers, and think nothing but “Man I sure looked sweet that raid. I bet my guild mates noticed too!”
---
&gt; Basically Murder is better in T1 and T2 and Imp Eviscerate is better in AQ and Naxx.
---
Again no.
---
Oto has clearly done the math.
---
Imp Eviserate &gt; Imp Poisons
---
Imp Poisons &gt; Murder
---
Therefore, Imp Eviserate &gt; Murder
---
Yeah, you don't *need* engineering. If you can stand losing the few 1v1's where engineering might have helped you out, then I say don't pick up Engineering.
---
Have a friend.  Someone to explore with and do quests with.
---
This is NOT a solo player game.
---
zug zug
---
Back in the day, Vanilla WoW was coined as the great casualizer of the MMORPG genre.
---
You'll be fine. Grab or find a bunch of friendos, read the quest texts and have a blast. Classic's gonna be an awesome ride, and new players will be a plenty. Also not everyone's gonna remember everything anyway, so you won't be alone with your lack of knowledge. It's been 14 years for many, and some have never played at all.
---
Maybe this is because I only played Vanilla and never touched a private server, but needing on BoEs with the intent to sell is not how I remember it being from vanilla at all.
---
Now I can understand why it got to that point (it just takes one asshole not following need=immediately equip to piss of the folks who correctly greeded), so I can see how everyone needing is a safety measure.
---
However, in a proper setup a person's ability to equip an item should always trump someone else's desire to sell it for gold. But that only works if everyone is 100% honest and greeds when they don't intend to use the item.
---
It just seems to me that BoEs=Need is a product of people being selfish and trying to call it "fair."
---
Eyy I'll be leading a guild like that. Still working out the details though, my friend is a resto druid who wants to get Atiesh just for the lols but with enough time everyone can get one. (Of course he has no special priority, whoever earns it most gets it first)
---
The best part of learning that fight was repairing shit resist gear
---
lol yikes
---
It really just comes down to how much you value PvP. If its a huge part of your enjoyment in the game, I think it'd be silly to not get it. 
---
But you definitely don't need it, especially if you're not actively seeking out PvP.
---
There are some cool addons that make it controller friendly. Check out consoleport!
---
Warrior needs to worry about thing like being healed and cleansed. Shaman just needs his enemies to be foolish enough to step into the THUNDER ZONE 😂
---
Is that a prebuilt PC DansGAme
---
What is so hard to understand about "Need = You can (and will) immediately equip the item upon receipt"?
---
Sure, it's ripe for dishonesty, but if followed by honest people there should be no misunderstanding or confusion.
---
I'll be leveling two characters. Be sure to have your non-active character always getting rested experience.
---
The vendor-valuable-items thing can be solved by getting some sort of auction house addon - that way you're not spoiled on what the item is, but you know what it's worth.
---
For retail there's TradeSkillMaster which has a PC app giving your addon constant updates on the state of auctionhouse prices. I'd be *very* surprised if there were no port or some other, ingame scan based auctionhouse addon.
---
Also, not knowing where to quest is part of the experience; It's a huge world, explore it, ask around and have some dynamic fun! Or just look it up if you're annoyed by your lack of progress, that's always an option!
---
Going for world first technically doesn't exist this time around. Even for those that never experienced classic... Raiding, in the end, is basically a formality at this point.
---
You and I have different definitions of sealing.  He didn't lock that up, just hit it once or twice.  Also, book lore for a video game.
---
That makes sense. The story is what keeps me invested in Retail. Although I'll ditch it for Classic in August I will still keep up with the story via WoWhead. I gotta know where things are goin!
---
Thanks for the background. It humanizes our shared experiences in Azeroth.
---
I like the maul of the redeemed crusader. Fookin huge.
---
Imagine being this concerned ❔
---
Are raids going to be much easier now that everyone should be able to function properly? :p
---
&gt; Saying a lot worse makes it sound like it’s going to cause the raid to wipe.
---
this is the most "you" thing I think I've ever seen in my life
---
&gt; #showtooltip
---
Why every macro I use just type "#showtooltip" in chat
---
There is no gear on the store that looks like any ingame gear. I think There are only three helm appearances you can buy and thats it. Other than that they only sell mounts and pets and retail has 400+ of each of those so who cares if 10 of them can be bought.
---
I hope it's the crapper.  Priorities are important.
---
He’s exactly why blizzard does it. Might as well suck money from tards
---
Just woke up at 05:00 am with the 1 and 3,5 year old... 
---
So yeah, wow classic is gonna be interesting.
---
You totally forgot lifetap, too. And in-combat consumables! That's, like, 5-6 buttons!
---
Jokes aside, Classic PVE isn't the most complex thing. Its combat system is slow, simple but very charming and kinda rhythmic at times. PVE Warlock has a few things here and there, like multidotting on bosses with several adds and AoE, but that's it. 
---
Make sure to understand ABC - Always Be Casting. Never skip a Global Cooldown!
---
If there's just one LW, they keep it. They're the one who bothered to invest in leveling that profession. Any non LW who thinks they deserve a chance at that leather is just being selfish and trying to validate it.
---
If we're talking dungeons: Apply DoTs if enemies live for a while, then spam Shadowbolt. Use Hellfire (Or Rain of Fire if health or cleave/AoE damage by enemies is a concern) for big trashpacks.
---
And for raids, apply your designated curse, spam Shadowbolt till OOM/You have to move, then use lifetap. If you wanna do the whole Shadowburn thing and apply Corruption, you also have to focus on that I guess.
---
It's not deeply complex or anything, but there's definetly a fun playstyle to be had here for some.
---
After quitting a bit into Legion, just far enough to get my legendaries for all my max levels...
---
Restarting this game feels almost like something new. Not  100s to 120 new, but it's fun for a while... like Classic may be.
---
Which will be more fun by raid progression time? Betting that the aq leadup farming will break servers and friendships, if the first tier does not
---
To add on to this: Red Dragonscale Breastplate is arguably better than Robes of the Exalted while you're in MC and BWL. It's still not plate, but it's as close as you're going to get.
---
Punkrat recently did a video on these. I hope they bring them back! (even though I honestly doubt many of these celebs have the time for WoW)

Then you hear the birds start kicking off and you may as well just go and fix yourself breakfast.

Is 36 mid-life crisis prime time? You're still young enough to be a pro athlete. It may be close to the literal middle of your average life expectancy but mid-life crisis is more like the middle of your *adult* life.
---
You're not old yet, dude. You're only old to the Zoomers. But they eat Tide Pods for TikTok views so I guess all that means is you're old enough to know not to do that.
---
Pally/Lock
---
I dont think I said they were casual, granted they werent too hardcore i didnt play with them at all, they just told me i needed that and i quit.
---
I hated the dailies. There were so many, by the time you complete them you have several hours of the game logged, no time to do anything else and you're burnt out.
---
My hopes for WoW is that it's reimagined, the same game however, they go a different route with the storyline and updates. If they do anything more to it.
---
are we talking about macros that works on the beta or original client?
---
I agree, I was MT of a competitive guild, it became a massive burden and I left in tbc because I was burnt out
---
I plan on living to be 100 so 50 will be my mid life crisis. I need to save up cause I want a custom chopper, a tricked out CJ7, An MR2 MK1 with a fully built NA 3VZFE swap, with rolled fenders, fat tires, and a lot of weight reduction.
---
By lefting him jn any cities is that right ? Or he have to be inside the inkeep ?
---
Next time you have time could you make that run as a ghost from Coldridge to Darkshore then die in Fatigue? Dieing in Fatigue as a ghost moves your corpse to your ghost's death spot. I've never tried that to another continent...
---
Your ghost might be sent back to Coldridge but then your corpse should be in Darkshore ready for you to respawn near it. Preferably youd be sent to the Darkshore Graveyard, but the limited testing I did on the Stress Test had my ghost get sent back to the original Graveyard.
---
Obviously at this point its slower than running on foot without being a ghost, but SCIENCE!
---
I recall that exact daily loophole you are talking about, and I also recall the dailies sometimes resetting when the servers got quick 15min restarts.
---
Off topic but since you know your ***, do you think robe of the archmage is a must for raiding for mage? Robe of winter night seems to be on par as a boe and I dont want to level tailoring for 1 vest?
---
These people won't have anything left to do on 60 aside from raidlog or grinding honor.
---
That guy is annoying af
---
What the what is a TikTok?
---
"LFM Class Leads, must be Asian"
---
That being said, I wish it was that easy to find good people
---
Looking forward to someone testing if this can be abused to threat-dump for all mages by using Divine Intervention on the mage who starts the ignite chain.
---
This was one of the first easter eggs I found in gaming and I used to take my alliance friends to go see it. The backstory makes it even better.
---
What sort of shitty gym do you go to???
---
Not a game, but im hitting the gym 6 days a week, up from 4, and redoing my game room. Mix those in with some guitar and more family time and busy season at work and times flying.
---
The beta is more likely to be shut down by then lol.
---
Well, on the bright side, classic WoW is likely to have a much older player base. I didn't say better, but older.
---
I don't even know.
---
It works out, less money spent on servers.
---
Nope, I’ve had 60s on multiple massive private servers and reached rank 8 on one. Alliance always had significantly faster queues
---
Deserves a ban
---
So actually, all his combat builds minus one are for T1 and T2. All of the combat builds except one run Murder. And the one that doesn't he clearly states is for Naxx. 
---
He then goes on to list the Seal Fate specs which run Improved Evisc. This is due to AQ and Naxx not having the mob types that support Murder. That is why you spec out of it, not because it is less dps, but because the talent just doesnt work on the mobs in AQ and Naxx.
---
So I agree he's done the math given the scenarios the guide is for. And his math clearly supports Murder being better for all combat swords/dagger builds prior to AQ/Naxx.
---
&gt; Imp Poisons &gt; Murder 
---
Where did you get this from? Cause its wrong. 
---
The scenario that the OP asked about is not listed in his guide as he states that Seal Fate is only viable with AQ and beyond, which you stated and I agree with.
---
Fk that...Ima use my **OLD** Phenom 2 x6 /w 7850 power edition till the 7nm APU's come out and slap on a nice twin fan tower heatsink and OC it to the moon.
---
Then ima play classic/+/TBC/WotLK and wait till Star Citizen comes out to upgrade to a monster machine.
---
SC will be out in 50 years. I regret purchasing stuff early
---
Give it time.  The rut started in classic.
---
Why stop there? How about each race/class combination plus all future races and classes, allied races, AND any potential future races that may come in this future or any possible alternate reality? You dont need any free time until you die anyway, right?
---
Still requires a raid team for some of the quest parts alone, not easily pugged.
---
Objectively false
---
I don't. I liked supporting the project and want it done right.  I can wait as long as it takes.
---
Man, reading this made me unreasonable mad. This is what, the 6th store mount added to the game in BfA alone. In a subscription based game. That ALSO have you pay the price for a full game every other year. But instead of adding the mounts as in-game rewards to incentify gameplay, they toss them on the shop. Just like the lunar festival mount, there’s even an event in-game to celebrate the event, with a bunch of shitty rewards that everyone has at this point, why not add the mount there to have people excited playing their game. Nope! Add it to the shop. Or this mount which could’ve been a drop from a world boss like all the MoP ones had, people STILL kill those bosses weekly, it’s STILL relevant content. Or perhaps show cooking some love by adding a recipe that teaches you how to make a delicious snack, which when placed on the ground summons a mount for you to tame.
---
This would make you set goals, and feel good when you achieve them. Now you could tell me that you feel just as rewarded by giving more money to blizz for a mount than when ashes of al’ar drops, or the big love rocket finally drops, but then I’d say you’re full of crap honestly. The mentality that this is okay behaviour is so frustrating. I’m not even playing BfA, and I’m mad about how they add recoloured mounts as in-game rewards, but make completely new mounts for the store.
---
I mean that's um, one way to react
---
37 and I feel the same, but I am single with no baggage so I will play just as I did in the Marines.
---
These worries are completely valid. As soon as this happens, I’ll move to the nearest private server and pretend classic never happened, who knows.
---
Another part of me feels they probably can’t do that if they plan on putting BC out too. That would get really messy.
---
Ooh this looks perfect for guild Discord Emojis. Looking forward to your future ones!!!
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but why was Naxx outside of thunder bluff?
---
It was. Its a paint filter from Photoshop, or maybe coral painter. or other art software.
---
 Paladin is the only reason I can think of.
---
Exactly. I keep seeing people talking about going for world first blah blah. Nah, same raids from 15 years ago, nothing different. It’s been done. People are going to rush to 60, do some raids and then talk shit about how’s there is nothing to do. Retail spoiled a lot of WoW players and I know for a fact a lot of them won’t like classic. I for one am excited to relive those days.
---
If you had to separately pay for professions, classes, gear, raids, dungeons, battlegrounds, Arena, then you'd have a point. You completely missed the point. You're not playing World of Mounts, and you have access to mounts that do 100% the exact same thing. You still have **all the ability to play the game** with that mount as an Epic Gryphon.
---
There are more than enough world boss drops, world event drops, rewards, gold-purchased, and achievement mounts.
---

---
Oh ok cool. I thought there might be some trick but thank you!
---
Min/max'ers must absolutely roll need on everything. That rare item will probably help them reach end game content appx 1740.8 seconds faster if they equip, or they'll get their epic mount nearly a half day faster if they sell it on the AH, which clearly makes it a bis (best to sell) item. Roll need on everything or consider yourself a casual...../s
---
Most inns work for gaining rested xp.
---
Warcraft 2 still plays well too if you can set up dosbox
---
Modern WoW killed the need to ever speak to anyone, let alone actually role play.  I think the RPers are looking forward to Classic.  I’m considering it myself.  I’m not a big RPer, but it is nice immersion every once in a while.
---
Loved reading this. I’m glad you’re able to play now !
---
Dude same I'm a wreck. Everything same.
---
Take that Mr Trump.
---
1% crit and 8 Mp5 is a pretty big difference. Robe of the Archmage remains best in slot all the way to ZG, so you're going to get more than half a year out of it depending on how soon you hit 60 and craft it.
---
I could see this being useful for doing some easy farming if it's portable.
---
Oh my bad, your anecdotal assessment of the realm population on an unlicensed version of the game is more accurate than legitimate beta numbers and realm pop number. 
---
/sarcasm
---
I got my ilvl700 purples in 4 hours in bfa, what a blast!
---
i agree! Ideally if they make any content past classic, id like to see them reuse the TBC content, but redesigned to stick to the classic pillars (so no flying, no daily quests/time locks, no lfg, stuff like that)
---
«There are more than enough world boss drops, world event drops, rewards, gold-purchased, and achievement mounts.»
---
Uhm, not trying to be an ass here, but what is the logic behind this? Okay, well there’s more than enough transmog gear out there in the world that won’t affect your «ability to play the game» so let’s throw a bunch of them on the store too, shall we? And while we’re at it; there more than enough hairstyles available for free for you to enjoy the game, right? Let’s put hairstyles on the store too! See the problem with your argument?
---
Paladin is boring af to level. 
---
A word of advice to those ready to play Classic. Make sure you have a good show to watch on your second monitor or TV. 
---
There's going to be a lot of travel in this game where you don't do shit except run or fly for like 5-10mins. 
---
Having something in the background will help pass the time.
---
No argument here.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'll feel obligated to.  But I'll feel obligated to further my character, not to meet my daily quota.
---
Way too less people knowing about the nicker
---
This almost ruined OSRS for me. I hated logging on, getting my battle staves, teleporting and getting my sand, checking miscellania, then getting to play the game. Mobile made it tons better, I do all that stuff on the toilet at work. Then if I want to play more later I can.
---
Paladins are pretty mana efficient. They're also pretty much dedicated tank healers, but they don't do very well for group healing. This is something that was addressed in later expansions. 
---
Paladins in a raid setting can coordinate on who has what buff in order to maximize talent options. 
---
You have several useful Blessings (like Freedom and Salvation) that are very useful for the raid overall. 
---
You'll want to have several in a raid and you'll almost always be useful and bring something to the table.
---
FYI weapon skill reduces the chance the attack will Miss, Glance, Dodge, Parry, Block?
---
Range attacks can only Miss ....... so weapon skill is very weak.
---
Question, why can’t you use instant poison in raids ?
---
I’d suck a fart out of bond’s ass.
---
It doesn't affect me playing the game, and it gives the devs more money to work on the game I'm playing, so sure. The logic is that it doesn't matter what other people look like as long as they dont have any advantages over me, and they dont. Let them dress up as unicorns if they want, that has nothing to do with me.
---
Classic WoW also stimulates China's economy.
---
Can't wait to give them all my money.
---
Them kicking you was the right decision.
---
Jup same here invested in SC and Elyria, just so there would be a community driven game done right for me to play one day. thankfully classic is nearly here, so don't have to wait that long for such an experience once again.
---
Yeah, I'm sure he loves that Classic WoW is going to bring back an entire industry to China where American and European citizens funnel their money into China for useless digital currency.
---
I highly recommend duo leveling for Classic. 
---
It will protect against bad luck pulls, make it easier to form groups for dungeons, and you'll be able to do quests faster among other things.
---
If you want to go holy spec playing with your buddy, that should be OK. Just know that your solo leveling capabilities will be hampered.
---
You guys act like end game can't be completed without some optimal min/max bis nonsense... Stop stressing over things that don't matter.
---
I dont care for the pvp weapons. Much better 2h from raids imo.
---
I sure hope so man, I took 2 weeks off work for classic, super hyped for me, I hope they don't fuck it
---
Ok thanks
---
World PvP is one of these ideas that sounds great in theory but in practice it's just a bunch of assholes ganking lower level/gear players.
---
You **need** a mechanic to prevent this.
---
You mean Peaceblooms?
---
Lol
---
What a sad perspective to have. F2P mobile games do this, maybe you ought to try those? Not my cup of the, personally.
---
Jesus, I didnt know that. Media is fucked
---
yep, on private servers, nearly everyone rolls need on items worth a lot. On every private server I've played in the last few years that's just how it goes.  Only rolling need for upgrades sounds good in theory until you have this happen to you and realize that this is the norm and there's no point in putting any amount of trust into pugs. My guess is this trend will continue in classic.
---
Thunder bluff looks different to how I remember
---
&gt; guilds who want to push world firsts and clear at the beginning of each phase they will for sure be minmaxing.
---
Raids are going to be easy for hardcore guilds. They will down it the first week, then have 4-6 months to farm up consumables for the next race.
---
This. 1000x this. Been saying this for a while now.
---
It definitely doesn’t feel like much of a project anymore.
---
The rotation does not change from 25 to 60. Activate soc and autoattack. Judge when soc is almost over, activate new soc.
---
Holy pve is spaming flash of ligth and cleanse.
---
Holy pvp is alot of fun since you have alot of armor and neat pvp spells.
---
Found the fortnite faggot
---
People will have a lot of time to farm up before nax arrives though.
---
You won't need consumables for the first few phases.
---
What private servers have you played on? I can assure you that the norm is for everyone to roll need on items of high value. There's always a few people here and there that are not familiar with this or disagree but they are greatly outnumbered.
---
20 servers at first, then they closed all of them except for 2
---
Lol, sure. I didn't realize that the main drive of wow was collecting different colored horses. Why would a company want to get paid for things it makes? Should we not have to pay for xpacs because there's a subscription? Why in your mind do you think that they shouldn't get paid for extracurricular products they make?
---
&gt; Not having most of the game world be barren because everyone is on the newest island.
---
This is what makes things interesting for me. To scratch the WoW itch i actually subbed for retail and was leveling up a blood elf warlock and i run into some people here and there but for the most part its empty!
---
It did not work in the original lol. It was already prevalent to need BoE Blues/Purps in vanilla, especially the twink BiS stuff. It happened to me many times in vanilla. Personally If I won something someone would actually use, I would trade it to them on the expectation they equip then and there. If you roll greed assuming people will have integrity and only roll need to equip, they will prove your wrong every time. In my mind, the person who will equip the BoE has a better chance if everyone needs, cause then the greedy player who will sell is rolling against everyone who’s nice enough to just give it to them.
---
I fucking hate daily quests so much.
---
His point is that you can spend an entire day farming or split it up as you like.
---
In current WoW, you have to log in every day or you miss out on the daily reward.
---
Y'all some jaded mother fuckers. They didn't have to give you anything.
---
Not sure of horde ones, but [Hakurai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akqzzAA7F08) covers alliance 1-60 in pretty good detail.
---
It is going to be a bit rough, but I get why they are doing it. I'm just glad that it's going to be temporary. I only hope it doesn't last long.
---
I’m having a hard time not going back to try that game

Go Warrior if you liked the old school warrior feel.
---
The kiting isnt as big of a problem in organized pvp as it is in 1v1s. If wpvp 1v1 is your concern, you can always use consumables and engineering to make up for your mobility. You could also go gnome to help even more.
---
Because you are hoping one day WoW will be good again and want to have your character ready for that.

Fantastic idea. I also assume there will be many warriors the same level looking to complete it. I may just /who Warrior 30-40 and form a 5 man to finish it.
---
Like I was saying. TBC had it's flaws, but I enjoyed the class balance and raid encounters. Really, class balance was the biggest. Enhancement shamans, shadow priests, ret and prot paladins, DPS druids, etc. Gave a lot more options for people to play.
---
Sure, dungeon gear wasn't BiS, but you had mixed of crafted gear, and all raids had relevant gear (grull and draginspine for my rogue, still never got it either). But my gear was a mix of crafted, PvP and raid gear.
---
That is the standard you're gonna find yourself leaving groups more than people  ot grouping with me
---
Perfect thank you
---
For me, everything was on a case by case basis and most things were recommendations. Most of my guys were skilled players and knew their boundaries. I would suggest things and do them myself as an example, but if you didn't die and did your job, I didnt care how you managed it. But if you screwed up regularly, and there were ample ways for you to avoid it through consumes or other means other than RNG, yet you consecutively avoided doing so for whatever reason, those were the times I'd give ample warning that if this happened in the future, there could be repercussions.
---
In modern WoW, your mount and transmog collection are the only form of persistent progression in the game. 
---
Paid mounts poison that well.
---
I agree with much of what you said, but I remember getting into arguments with my guild about none of the mages taking certain arcanist pieces because blues were better.
---
We were definitely more ignorant about gear, but still had a decent understanding. This was pre aq.
---
You dont get DHKs for killing low level players
---
That HP looks really cool. I like the small sliver of light in the middle.
---
I disagree but to each their own.
---
I always like the horde pvp 2h mace. Big lollipop
---
I'm the grand scheme of things, I like 40 man content but I always felt we were dragging dead weight with us. The big wake up call is looking on private servers for classic what happens when you get a full dedicated group together.
---
While everyone is having a hard on for classic, the raiding is going to be a joke. It took my guild months to clear naxx and it's going to be cleared opening week by guilds in classic. 
---
Still going to be fun though, I always feel expansion on expansion on expansion eventually adds too much "new stuff" that you detract from what originally made the game fun.
---
hitting more often is never weak.
---
You can also get both Warcraft 1 and 2 at Gog.com, and unless I’m mistaken you can then run them without Dosbox.
---
You will likely enjoy the game more simply because everything will be fresh and new to you.
---
Then you should
---
Charge, rend and hamstring are big too
---
You overestimate the difference between vanilla and retail
---
Warcraft 1 and 2 is availible at gog.com
---
https://www.gog.com/game/warcraft_bundle
---
Because he is telling other raid members to do the same stuff and they might die.
---
Easily the best pve game on the market
---
You don't need to be a tailor for bloodvine. That just lets you get the crit which isn't important enough to drop something else. (Imo)
---
why wont that piece of shit just disappear
---
Do you mean underestimate?
---
This seem right. Which is why they ended up adding spell pen to gear and enchants in tbc. Which is ridiculously confusing to calculate worth.
---
So here's the difference. In TBC, you still needed to run various level 70 dungeons, then heroic dungeons, then some of the early raids, in order to get sufficient gear to raid the "current raid content tier" ie Black Temple etc.
---
The first change to this was with Sunwell when they added high level epics you could buy with badges earned from heroics and Karazhan, as well as Magister's Terrace, which was a level 70 dungeon + heroic, at a somewhat harder difficulty, that also dropped raid-level gear.
---
That was the start of the "catch up mechanic", where the later raid patches would also add new dungeons with better gear to put you on par with people who ran the old raids. For instance, when Wrath opened Icecrown Citadel, it also added 3 Icecrown Dungeons that dropped gear equivalent to the Ulduar Raid (10 man version).
---
In Classic and prior to TBC-Sunwell though, you still needed to gear, and attune, normally.
---
You not only get stronger as you level, you feel stronger.
---
Level 20 cat form, 24 Rake, 26 Dash, 30 Travel form, 31 Faerie Fire in feral form, 32 Ferocious Bite, 36 Pounce 40 Innervate
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm and 5 points in Furor changes the way you play completely
---
Every few levels you get an impact-full new ability, Every talent point in feral tree feels like it does something. Even in Balance tree on the way to Omen of Clarity. 
---
That progress of new abilities and ranks changes your rotation keeping leveling experience fun.
---
It is kinda expensive. I think i rather buy a laptop. It is a cool little device tho.
---
Allmost the first post about gpd win 2 is about its battery and screen issues 🤔
---
Team solidarity is a good enough reason for you to take the potions.
---
So that's what hell is like.
---
What does that even mean? How does having progression-earned mounts get muddied by owning purchased ones? Blizzard **only creates those mounts to be sold.** Without that incentive for the company, the only mounts we would get are the ones that are gotten in-game already. They wouldn't have made the one in the OP.
---
Lol xr bgs were in vanilla because they were necessary
---
Last time I played them which was probably 3 years ago, Warcraft 1 was dosbox. You could find a Windows copy of Warcraft 2 b.net edition, but I had trouble getting it to work with new windows, so I went dosbox with that too. I'll check out GoG, because that would be a lot easier.
---
Ah right, I haven't bothered with dailies in a long time so I've kinda forgotten how they work. The only "daily" thing in vanilla would be the cooldowns for tailoring, alchemy and leatherworking. 
---
Well there are lots more but they are kinda player created.
---
Ima call bullshit.
---
it is weak if you are not using a better bow just because of the extra weapon skill. All I am saying use the highest DPS weapon gun, bow, crossbow, or anything in-between.

The point isn't that you should follow these norms because everyone else is doing it. Rather, because everyone else is doing it, you are forced to follow along otherwise there is a very high likelihood that someone will roll need. When everyone is abiding by these rules, you are only shooting yourself in the foot by not following suit.   
---
I started off on the moral high ground of only rolling need on upgrades when I began playing on private servers. As time went on it became obvious that while this sounds great in theory it's just not worth the risk.
---
Owning the game.

i don’t know if this adds anything to your life to hear, but, death to the horde.
---
I've been arguing from my memory that Prot Paladins are incapable of tanking most raids as the main tank.
---
Is it possible to do any raids (not counting UBRS)? Are there any ways around say not having a taunt?
---
You get them for killing civilian NPCs of the other factions like quest givers and i think flight masters and stuff like that
---
Dude, it’s past midnight, pretty sure blizzard doesn’t pay overtime to shill this hard. Just give it a rest. Sometimes opinions are wrong and shitty, and that’s exactly what we have here. You’re wrong, you’re justifying idiocy, and it makes you a little bit of a bad person. Re-evaluate your opinions or just shut up because you’re making yourself look like a moron sucking off a multi billion dollar corporation.
---
If a lot of people lack the incentive to play, but instead of adding more incentive, they lock cool rewards behind a paywall, I find that incredible greedy. Had the game been F2P I’d be very understanding, but it isn’t. The game is already behind a monthly subscription AND expansion fee.
---
Why it would be okay for them to then add microtransaction as in mounts, pets, hairstyles or transmog is beyond me. This should be provided in the game, making it better. To me, it feels like they ACTIVELY make the game worse to play by adding this to the store instead.
---
But our opinions obviously differ, and it doesn’t seem like we’ll come to an understanding. As long as they don’t bring that shit to Classic I’ll be happy to pay for a sub fee.
---
If you’re decent at it, the first play through only takes 30 hours or so, and multiple playthroughs aren’t really necessary. It is really good. If you’re into that kinda stuff
---
I've read that having someone reliable that will show up every week is a lot more important than having someone that will theoretically rank higher on the charts.

Oops. I guess my sleeping meds are telling me it’s time for bed lol

If you're Horde, you don't use Poisons on your Main Hand weapon because you won't benefit from Windfury Totem.
---
But even on your off-hand, or as Alliance, or as Horde without a Shaman, there's still a better option than Poisons.
---
[Shadow Oil](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3824/shadow-oil):
---
&gt; When applied to a melee weapon it gives 15% chance of casting Shadowbolt III at the opponent when it hits. Lasts 30 minutes.
---
[Shadow Bolt Rank 3](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=705/shadow-bolt) is:
---
&gt; Sends a shadowy bolt at the enemy, causing 48 to 56 Shadow damage.
---
So that's:
---
0.15 * (48 + 56) / 2 = 7.8 damage per swing (not counting spell crit chance from Intellect).
---
For reference, the [max rank Instant Poison](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8928/instant-poison-vi) is: 
---
&gt; Each strike has a 20% chance of poisoning the enemy which instantly inflects 112 to 148 Nature damage. Lasts 30 minutes or 115 charges.
---
So that is:
---
    0.2 * (112 + 148) / 2 = 26 extra damage per swing (not counting spell crit chance from Intellect or World Buffs).
---
With 5/5 Improved Poisons:
---
    0.3 * (112 + 148) / 2 = 39 extra damage per swing (not counting spell crit chance from Intellect or World Buffs).
---
With 5/5 Vile Poisons:
---
    0.2 * (112 + 148) / 2 * 1.2 = 31.2 damage per swing (not counting spell crit chance from Intellect or World Buffs).
---
You might think, yeah, Shadow Oil sucks, but here's the catch: 
---
Poisons do *not* scale with Spell Power. Shadow Oil does.
---
[Greater Arcane Elixir](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13454/greater-arcane-elixir) = 35 SP for 1 hour.
---
[Flask of Supreme Power](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13512/flask-of-supreme-power) = 150 SP for 2 hours (there is no melee DPS flask in Classic).
---
Shadow Bolt scales with Spell Power at a rate of 3/3.5 or 85.71%.
---
So now we have:
---
    0.15 * [ (48 + 56) / 2 + 185 * .8571] = 31.6 damage per swing (not counting spell crit chance from Intellect or World Buffs).
---
Already we've beaten non-specced Instant Poison, but I promised you those talents were worthless, so now let's consider the debuffs!
---
[Curse of Shadow](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17937/curse-of-shadow) = 10% more Shadow damage on the target.
---
[Improved Shadow Bolt](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17803/improved-shadow-bolt) = 20% more Shadow damage to the target (Shadow Oil doesn't remove a stack of this, otherwise your Warlocks would scream and cry).
---
 1.2 * 1.1 * 0.15 * [ (48 + 56) / 2 + 185 * .8571] = 41.7 damage per swing (not counting spell crit chance from Intellect or World Buffs).
---
So with two consumables, a level 24 alchemy consumable is now better than your level 60 class consumable.
---
But that's not all!
---
You've gone through the trouble of getting 185 Spell Power, let's add some [Dragonbreath Chili](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12217/dragonbreath-chili)!
---
&gt; Use: Occasionally belch flame at enemies struck in melee for the next 10 min.
---
The flames do an average of 65 damage to all targets in front of you and can crit and has about a 5% proc rate. BUT, it has 100% scaling with Spell Power.
---
Curse of the Elements = 10% more Fire Damage on the target.
---
Improved Scorch = 15% more Fire Damage on the target.
---
    1.15* 1.1 * 0.05 * (65 + 185) = 15.8 damage per swing (not counting crits).
---
So now, with 4 consumables, two of them very low level and easily made, you're doing over double the damage your Poisons would be doing.
---
Oh I plan on taking my sweet sweet time. No rush to 60. Not even sure I’ll have time to raid like I did way back. So the journey will be the joy this time around.
---
I'm not sure how that is relevant. This is wow classic.
---
I love blood elf paladins!
---
Approximately how much cloth does it end up taking to get to exalted? I never did the turn ins back in the day.
---
Even though they are in the CC stage? Sure it went far and beyond the original scope, but there is quite a bit that is playable now.
---
Yeah, at least two other friends and I are just going to play together 2-3 nights a week and maybe a longer session on weekends. Take our time and do as many quests as we can find and all the dungeons together as we stroll towards 60. Not bothered with raids, with maybe our largest gear goal being a dungeon set each.
---
When we're not on as a group, we'll play alts and mostly just try to make gold or gank people in wpvp - whatever float our boats on the night.
---
Not until you can transfused mana from 19 druid to stay casting more than auto attack for a 7 min fight.
---
There's no substance to that answer. You 100% avoided it. Why should they not get paid for it? Do you think they would still be making those mounts and putting them in the game if they weren't going to get paid for it?
---
DTC!
---
When you look like the elephant man you are just going to have to accept that everyone you meet is going to be late getting to somewhere.
---
For me personally i dont think you ninjad. If you needed and equip it you good. If rando took their time to help me and this happened id be stoked karma hooked them up.
---
Not as fast tho
---
Alliance, priest, prefer dwarf - NA - looking for someone to casually level and chill with.
---
I prefer someone with decent english, Just to make communication smooth
---
I'm surprised there aren't more leveling vods. I have found 0 for priests. I'm sure a lot of people would watch them just no one making the content.
---
Vanilla WoW warriors topped the DPS charts more often than mages.
---
Yes, a lot of the store mounts are cool looking. 
---
What's sad is that the mounts you get in game are literally regular recolored horses.
---
&gt;If a lot of people lack the incentive to play, but instead of adding more incentive, they lock cool rewards behind a paywall, I find that incredible greedy.
---
There are a TON of rewards not behind a paywall, are they not incentive? Are new raids and dungeons not incentive to play? New gear doesn't entice players? Knowing there's regular updates and stable servers aren't a good reason to play? How long should they just eat the cost of paying employees to develop new mounts?
---
For me it's "Watching the gnome mages/warlocks destroy the damage meters" 
---
No way I'm playing that shit race. I'm leaning Alliance and I'm thinking of playing mage or warlock but I really don't want to play a gnome. It might even influence my decision on what class to play as I'm also considering Paladin, Priest, Hunter, and Rogue.
---
1. Go to the office supply store like Office Max/Depot or Staples.
---
2. Buy whatever chair you want regardless of price.
---
3. Make sure to get the $7.99 3rd party protection plan and keep the receipt in a safe place.
---
4. After a couple months or whenever something about the chair annoys you, file an online claim against the chair. "It squeaks, the padding is wearing out, and the leather is starting to show signs of wear" will do. No need to lie, just list it all.
---
5. They'll send you a check for the full amount of the chair minus the protection plan.
---
6. Repeat and sell the old chair on Craigslist, paying for your Wow subscription.
---
I've been doing this for about 3 years now. My ass is always in a $500 Serta Big &amp; Tall chair that is only a few months old.
---
Test just performed and the result was that I rezzed at the Coldridge Valley graveyard.

Dude this post is great. I played WW2OL too. That game was the shit. You can have a midlife crisis whenever you want btw.
---
You equip it... It's need. You don't it's greed. Simple. Any other arguement is just ninjalooters trying to justify their thievery. Now if a hunter needs a cloth spirit item over the priest and equips it... Well idiots are a thing. Just have to create your blacklist
---
Retail players will struggle. They have gotten used to easy mindless leveling/tanking/dungeons  and wellfare epics. But they havent experienced being 10 years behind pserver players in experience/knowledge. You could argue everything is documented, but actualy playing the game for years while having every little detail in fresh memoru makes a huge difference.
---
Don't by leather chair :/ I learned it the hard way
---
Too late? How much work would it be to change a small zone with nothing else going on and no other connections and rotate it 90 degrees?
---
I never said that I wouldn't. I simply am asking if anyone know of strong guns to use from 30-60.
---
I bought an off brand gaming chair and I don't recommend it. It's a kinsal brand it was $200 it's a pretty cool racecar chair though. I still use it and can sit in many hours although my butt/back get sweaty and the butt part gets kinda sore... I've seen a lot of threads on reddit recommending the ikea Markus for a good chair around $200. Or finding a lightly used office chair. I feel like I could have gotten a better chair for $200 that's not a gimmicky racecar "gaming chair".
---
I would be careful with that kind of macro. If you spam it trying to charge or while charging it will spam.
---
You can try this one. It idea is to only send the message if Charge is on 15 sec CD..... you will need to play around with the macro, I don't have beta to test it.

Ret DPS has a very important role in a raid - if anyone does less damage than the Ret pally, you kick them because they suck so bad they got out dps'd by a ret pally. :)
---
Lower dmg? How come? Would that influence raid dmg?
---
You'll probably have better luck in the [weekly thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). Not even sure the mods will keep your post up.

Buying a token on retail wow does not affect the classic wow economy in any way as there is no gold exchanging hands on classic.
---
I don't think anyone has a problem with people buying wow tokens on retail to pay for classic as it has literally 0 impact on classic.
---
Start letting people buy tokens using classic gold and it will affect the classic wow economy.
---
/slowclap
---
The point of doing this is that you and other people get geared fast. Warriors rolling on dps gear is not unheard of since you use mitigation and threat gear, and you should communicate with other people and see what they need from the dungeon, a bis chest for warrior and hunter is not the same for rogue, so you form the group that  there is the least overlap possible or you farm bosses for things everyone wants, like Truestrike Shoulders. If Painweaver Band drops from general Drakk that is another story, because every non caster wants that item, and if everyone is in greens dps classes get priority on non farmable items like that
---
Ill take any hints i can get - The pointer is much appreciated
---
I think someone linked the full list, but mostly what is available on the AH at the time. As a hunter you can get by with a weapon 5+ levels below. You don't suffer as much as melee folks.

But for real, I think they're too busy pushing patch 8.2 and sending out a beta invite wave would kill the Retail hype. If we get ANY more invites, it's after the World First race for Azshara is over with.
---
LOL sorry I thought of something and asked on a blog during work, I havent played since 2006 when I was 13 and never took the game that seriously  You and your "just go search it""holier than thou" attitude, you're just sad,  especially when there are people on this thread who've actually given me good information and explanations for their reasoning. You've had no input other than shit talk. You're the type of person No one wants to play this game with no matter what class you roll. glhf
---
They would have to change retail wow a LOT to market it toward the classic community. Most of the classic community will absolutely not play retail while there's things like CRZ, sharding, LFG, LFR, a shitty leveling experience, class homoginization, and an in-game cash shop.
---
Herman Miller embody or aeron, I own both and they are worth every penny imo. My aeron is over 15 years old and still looks new
---
They're totally going to. I expect them to go up to WotlK and stop there.
---
They'll probably open the new server, then copy over chars from classic, keeping the two separate.

World of Warcraft Classic Beta

It wasn’t in 05 when 4 members of your raid were from Lebanon or Pakistan 30 people clicked and keyboard turned, 7 were specced properly, 12 had the right gear and somewhere around 5-7 we’re afk at any one time.
---
Oh let’s not forget no one understood debuff a and you’d see rend and MS on bosses and all of your strategizing and raid prep was done in /raid and /g.
---
It was hard then—those who had their head screwed on game prepared—cause they strapped the raidctoctheir back. 
---
In classic, I’ll be using greater fire pits, mana pots and regen elixirs/oils as needed in early content. Throughout I’ll be stockpiling the full consumables.
---
I’ll have full consumables for AQ and Naxx progression when fights begin to call for them—especially if blizzard progresses server fast enough such that getting bus between tiers isn’t reasonableZ
---
Yup
---
1. They are being paid for it.
---
2. The better the game is, the higher the sub numbers become, the more money they earn.

I think the failure of communication here, what he may be trying to convey, is that *both* types of items are the same **direct** value to the player that *needs* an upgrade no matter what - other people gaining the (indirect) value in gold doesn't lower or change the status of the immediate (greater) value it has for the player looking to equip it.

As someone that has experienced all of the major private server launches in the last few years, I can say that at least for me, this has nothing to do with rose-tinted goggles. I love the chaos, it builds hype and makes the game feel that much more exciting.  That being said, at a certain point, it can be a little much. Like when a recent TBC server had an average of 15-40 mins of uptime before crashing for nearly two weeks.   
---
The most fun server launch I have experienced was when there was very little dynamic respawn, 11k people online at all times and a 20k queue when the server first launched. Everything was so exciting. I would actually prefer having a mild queue over no queue (Assuming everyone else is also having to wait in said queue).
---
Dark Edge of Insanity, anyone? Animated eyeball ftw.

If it’s any consolation, I just went through an unnecessary quarter life crisis that I invented myself. Age is a dumb number that we are obsessed over which eventually loses all meaning once we realize how silly it is to worry about such a thing. I’m 26 and about to dive into WoW again and I couldn’t be happier. Best of luck to you (and if you’re really going to couples counseling, I respect that a lot)! 
---
PS - FOR THE HORDE
---
Yeah, I don't get this post at all. So little effort put into it, and I just don't know what to say. It doesn't stimulate conversation, and doesn't have any substance. 
---
At least say what frames/resolution you're going to achieve. At least post the PC specs. I think you could have spent half of what you did and come out with a good PC. Ryzen 1600 + a 580 or 1060 setup would probably run you 800 dollars for everything. Monitor included.
---
Pfft. If you're hardcore, and I'm sure most of the sub is, you'll play classic on a dual core amd, a 5200 5gig hd, and a 3:4 crt that flickers when you bounce your knee in bgs.
---
Oh, and none of this special keyboard or mouse bullshit either. You'll play with whatever garbage came standard with that low-grade Dell, and you'll like it.
---
Subscription costs are to have access to the servers, that's it. You pay $60 for the expansion's content. Are the dungeons, raids, BGs, arena, quests, gear, etc not worth $60? 
---
The subscription isn't for Blizzard to continue to create content, any future patches/content released that xpac are included in purchase of the xpac. To use the servers costs $15/mo. It's ridiculous to think that it's malicious of them to have employees that create additional content after the xpac is sold.

There is no such thing as "gaming chair".

Mid-life crisis is mostly about adult men finally having the money and stability to buy the shit they’ve wanted for years. A guy whose last kid (born when they were 32) finally leaves home at 18 will be 50.
---
Professionals in their mid-30’s who don’t plan to have kids can be in a similar position with their life-style and financial situation.
---
Gaming chairs are a gimmick and are tailored/marketed towards kids and gullible man-children. There's no such thing as a "gaming" chair. Don't believe the hype because DXracers and similar types are overrated garbage. If you're sitting most of the day do your back a favor because nothing is worse than having lower back pain by the time you're in your mid 20's. Check out stuff from Herman Miller and Steelcase. A quality chair will last you a long time (you'll save money in the long run).   
---
I own the remastered 2016 version of the Herman Miller Aeron and I couldn't be happier.   
---
Some recommendations  
---
HM - Embody (most expensive option)  
---
HM - Aeron  
---
HM - Mirra 2 (cheaper option)  
---
Steelcase - Leap  
---
Steelcase - Think  
---
All Herman Miller products come with a 12 year warranty btw. Not too sure about steelcase though.

It could well influence raid damage, assuming it doesn’t even out in late game. A big chunk of feral damage is white hits so if it doesn’t even out if will really hurt dps

The Markus from Ikea. I can't recommend it enough to people. Super comfortable and ergonomic without breaking the bank. You will see it in a few top 10 lists as the budget option versus the professional office chairs that are $800+
---
why are people still going on about BETA invites... statistically you arent going to get one so stop literally crying about it
---
Dunno about other demographics but I've exclusively played NA Horde and I have never encountered everyone in a group rolling need on a BoE blue. At least, not without announcing it quickly first to establish the status quo for all, or better yet having established looting etiquette prior to the instance.
---
To answer OP's question, as long as you equip the item you rolled Need on immediately, I am ok with it. Happened for a Fiery War Axe in Zul'Farrak once. No drama at all involved.
---
&gt; While everyone is having a hard on for classic, the raiding is going to be a joke. It took my guild months to clear naxx and it's going to be cleared opening week by guilds in classic.
---
This isn't rhetorical, why are people saying that the clears will be so much easier now?  Is it just because the players will be better?
---
I think my friend will like this guild.
---
This is so wholesome.
---
What's a goblin?
---
Dude 14 year old me would have fucking died and begged my parents with every fiber of my being for whatever contraption did this for my birthday
---
Shitpost from a shithead
---
I would take Official damage meters with a grain of salt. The meta has shifted drastically since there has been years of theory crafting done on Private servers. I know "private servers got it wrong" but it would still be worth checking those out. You might get a better picture of what to expect with modern knowledge of the game.
---
Quel'serrar, definitely
---
My point is that there are many other iterations of wow that were imbalanced. It's not something that is exclusive to vanilla.
---
This right here is gold. Thanks mate.
---
I would expect slow progression.
---
Blizzard is going to need time to prepare for what they do after Naxx.
---
If it’s a raid, then priority would be with the main spec. If your holy you won’t get to bid/roll ahead of a warrior who can use it as their main spec upgrade.
---
If you are in a pug, you’d prob need to say you want a 2H so want to roll.
---
But even pugs it’s main &gt; off spec.
---
Gotcha, so more catch up things. I remember it was always possible to skip gearing up if a guild would carry you, but you actually needed that help rather than being able to catch up in dungeons or PUGgable stuff.
---
Yaya :)
---
Ahhh the magic resist mobs of vanilla. I think those big purple elementals in Wailing Caverns were I believe the first true sources of frustration and contempt for caster dps in WoW. They essentially were nothing more than cheerleaders in cloth.
---
Resist! Resist! Resist! 11 damage (40 resisted) Resist!
---
Compression doesn’t make the kind of jaggy edges that this image has. That’s a filter. I do this shit for a living.
---
Similar here. Farmed 4H for a couple months. We got Sapph once during the prepatch, though, wiped on KT a bit, but it was mid-December so raids were missing a lot of people.
---
Everquest’s 20th Anniversary Time Locked Progression Server “Mangler” that is only currently on its 1st expansion. 
---
Experience the game that influenced many aspects of WOW while you’ve still got some time to kill before classic!
---
Do you honestly believe that the servers costs $15/mo per person to uphold? They aren’t hardware-based anymore, they’re cloudbased - much cheaper. There’s so many examples of games I could give where the server upkeep seems like a nonexistant problem. I could say fortnite for example, they don’t have a sub fee, how om earth do they manage the costs of all the millions of players online?! Or Nost, how many hundreds and thousands of players played on that private server without paying $15/mo? While I don’t have the official numbers I would bet that over 50% of the sub fee is spent on salary to the art/design team that creates the game. Ergo better game = more subs = more money.
---
Yes definitely making my son farm for me. It builds character.
---
so when you join this hypothetical guild you tell them you are only healing till you get some gear and benediction/anathema right?  Because otherwise yea it a dick move, this might come as a shocker to you but normal people don't enjoy being lied to, and taken advantage of.
---
When someone tries to present being a liar and a manipulator as "MAN IM SO COOL" people disapprove, weird.
---
A fully Naxx geared player was equivalent to a level 70 from BC with full 5 man blue gear.  I was partially Naxx geared on my rogue and missed the opening few months of the BC expansion so I got to experience leveling up without equally geared competition around.
---
I was one shotting nearly everyone that picked a fight with me while I leveled.  I was killing level 70 gankers when I was 63.  I was hilariously op.
---
Okay I think you convinced me to go for PvP aswell xD
---
Not until TBC at least, because for Horde it was always Silvermoon City (or parts thereof).
---
Rule number 1 of program: If it works, don't fucking touch it. To spin the entire instance around 45 degrees could:  
---
Utterly destroy npc/pet pathing and nav meshes  
---
Remove props that weren't noticed to have moved and now exist in the black void beyond the walls  
---
Kill your parents  
---
Screw with player/npc spawn points  
---
Alter object rendering if cells and inheritance didn't get properly altered  
---
Game terrain is a bitch to fix.
---
THIS is what an unpopular opinion looks like, folks. Take my upvote.
---
We’re a guild. But only around 6members atm. It’s made up of friends, and friends of friends.
---
We are norwegian, but we are going international, ofc.
---
Wanna join? We are alliance, we’ve got a discoed too.  Ur more than welcome:)
---
Yes. You may find a larger/more dedicated population to it on non-RP servers, but there are/were progression raiding guilds on RP servers, even in Vanilla.
---
Decenthealer would have been more accurate
---
Sounds good, i'd love to give it a go :)
---
I think your version is just some old outdated 2006 shit. For a looooong time it's been that everyone needs. 
---
The reason is because it is foolish to use an expensive BoE while leveling unless you're already on an alt. The gold acquired from selling it on the AH is always going to be better than the 5 levels you might spend with that item. Therefore, since it's pretty much agreed upon that everyone, even if they can use it, is just gonna sell it and that it would be really stupid to equip it, even if you can use it, everyone rolls need.
---
I don't see Ironforge here. #clickbait
---
and BoE blues and purples are always need
---
I’m a game artist for a living. Thought I smelled photo filters on top of a 3D model or something... which is totally fair game. An image is an image as long as it comes from your own head. I hope people can recognize that difference. 
---
This though? This sucks giant donkey balls. Don’t. Steal. Work. At least it was only reddit points at stake.
---
the man, the myth
---
I'm actually gonna raid. My computer was too laggy and I wasn't mature enough to commit to it when I was a lad but I know I could do it now and hopefully really enjoy it.
---
1st glance, I thought the map was your monitor hahaha
---
This. Wearing BiS fighting other players wearing BiS with everyone having an infinite supply of consumables + engineering items will NOT give you an actual representation of how it's going to feel in classic.
---
I was thinking the same thing which made me reconsider rolling pally as my first character. Apparently tanking raids sucks as a prot pal and I prob won't get in any raids as a ret so I'd have to go as a healer but I'll only be able to roll for items I can use as a healer. Not to mention I've never been a fan of healing. I think I'm gonna level a mage lol... or at least a warrior so I can actually be able to roll for those tasty 2Hs
---
I think you shouldve put an /s, bc it took me some time to realize what youve meant and some people will just downvote and go on c:
---
After watching a few YouTube reviews and reading a couple reviews this sounds like the chair for me. Thanks a bunch mate
---
That's not addressing the bug, that's stating that the private server bug isn't legitimate. There's more to the bug than just pressing sit. The private server version of the effect was sit to get crit. That post is saying you cant freely press sit in combat to get crit. You couldnt freely sit in combat to get procs in vanilla, and you cannot on the classic beta. 
---
The 'bug' I'm refering to is not the private server version of the bug. Blizzard has addressed the private server bug and it is not in the game. You cannot get crit while seated to proc redoubt, bloodrage, etc, that was never in Vanilla in the first place. 
---
Break down their terminology and compare it to the way that guys are proccing it now. "Being critically struck while using /sit to sit does not cause abilities like..."
---
This implies that incoming criticals while seated do not cause abilities to proc, and that this is the intended effect. It is. Good thing that the way the legitimate vanilla version of the feature has you taking hits while you're standing up, eh?
---
Clarify?
---
Because regardless of the specific piece of loot, assuming blue/purp BoE, the price is never set in stone anyways - so there's no guarantee of any value. Even the same piece of loot compared to itself doesn't necessarily "hold the same monetary value".
---
Consider also: the only reason a BoE becomes worth selling is *because* it has value as an upgrade and piece of loot. Whatever pricepoint it gets put at is proportionate not just to its rarity, but the demand for it from players who - and here's the kicker - **need** it.
---
Depends a bit on who is leading it. There's people that are more open about it, but sure you're missing quite a lot of potential groups specially for the typical BRD ironfoe/HoJ farm.
---
Thx. I wanted to know if I had to be inside the inn or simply inside the city. Have fun playing it !
---
Not fantasy but for me no man’s sky has been an awesome trip!
---
There was a Countdown to Classic episode where a former member of Death and Taxes was interviewed, and in the course of it the answers to this question came up. He was with the guild throughout their AQ40 progression, but not Naxx. 
---
#1. Threat generation
---
Players at the time knew that Fury warriors could do very high damage. They knew the potential of the talents in the tree. The trouble was that Fury warriors had no way to drop or decrease threat, so raids were leery about having them going all out. Rogues and Hunters on the other hand could drop their threat, making them more attractive options. As players got better at figuring out how to maximise threat as tanks, this became less of an issue. 
---
#2. World Buffs
---
The player being interviewed pointed out that stacking world buffs just wasn't a thing at the time. Later on, in Naxx, it did start to become prevalent, and co-incidentally that's when Fury warriors started to show up more frequently. That's because world buffs benefit physical DPS classes more than magical DPS, and of the physical DPS classes, it's Warriors who benefit the most, due to the mechanics of rage. Doing more damage = more rage, more rage = more damage. So with Fury warriors having the highest potential physical DPS, it's small wonder that world buff stacking pushed them to insane levels.
---
I'm somewhat tempted to get a GPD WIN for Classic...
---
Then again, I just got done modifying some Chromebook to run Linux that'll run Classic without a problem.
---
&gt;Do you honestly believe that the servers costs $15/mo per person to uphold?
---
No it doesnt cost $15 per person, but they are far from the first company to charge more than their overhead for a service. They have parent companies to pay, and the employees are most likely salary so they're getting paid whether people are subbed or not according to their contract. Fortnite isn't WoW, and the subscription cost helps keep out the riff raff that comes with F2P games. It's been that way since vanilla. Nost had other realms that would sell gear for money.
---
Thing is HPaladin/Lock one of the strongest PvP combos in vanilla. Playing with Paladins on your side can be GAMECHANGING in BGs and, if you get one to heal bot you, you will be immortal while topping kbs and dmg and no downtime.
---
Nothing horde has for Locks is close to that. Also horde locks have one more enemy class that can dispel their dots in pvp than alliance do. For these reasons, Alliance Locks are actually stronger in group PvP.
---
It's not the worst thing in the world, I used to play it with an Xbox 360 Controller via Xpadder or some other kind of keyboard to controller input emulator
---
Kenshi does a lot of RPG elements right, but its a mix of RPG and base building. 
---
I would describe it as steam punk mount and blade (though its isometric view)
---
It can be buggy and crashes sometimes but its good fun... Worth a look.
---
Sorry, was a ypo from my side as i just got of a rather long nightshift - i am EU, and in fact, norwegian :)
---
WoW!
---
Hell yeah brother, cheers from iraq
---
+Healing is just a stat. /s
---
They released this mount right before end of Q2 to frontload a bunch of money to "fib" the numbers essentially (because to get it you have to shell out money for 6 months' sub on the spot). There's a lot of things you can say about it, but one thing's for sure, Activision's influence continues
---
A fraction of the playerbase will hardcore raid. Even a fraction of this subreddit will. Vanilla is much more casual and on your own time, any way you slice it
---
Addiction*
---
We all know how difficult those Molten Core runs are.
---
You seriously didnt get the sarcasm?
---
Source for melee being nerfed on private servers?
---
Pillars of Eternity I and especially II. But really I recommend both.  And Divinity is just a treat, great pick.
---
You missed the whole point of the post, read it again
---
9gag?I guess you meant 2008
---
&gt; But everyone pays monthly to play this game.. why should they have a shop in the first place? Theyre just trying to double dip, it really is sad.
---
You can buy it with gold dude. Buy 2 tokens, turn them into Blizzard Dollars, buy the mount.
---
I don't understand why so many people whine. Transforming gold into $$, it costs you about as much as most BFA cool mounts.
---
I really loved doing dailies on Ilse of Queldanas
---
I've owned gaming/racing chairs for 5 years (got the 2nd one for free) and have mixed feelings on them. They definitely aren't that comfortable sitting for long periods of time. I would recommend shopping locally and getting a mid range office chair before buying a DXracer.
---
Nicely stolen and shittily rebranded Photoshop there, OP! *clap*
---
Terraria
---
Only Runecloth quest is repeatable, and that cant be done until level 50.
---
Gnome Mage &amp; Warlock.
---
Dwarf Priest.
---
That’s a fair point. We’ll see. I think threat may the biggest issue with boss kill times
---
The Warriors in my guild geared the same way you see in the BiS guides.
---
Dispel the notion that nobody in Classic knew how to play their class, because that’s not true at all.
---
The biggest difference iirc was threat, with Warriors often needing to use Cleave/Hamstring to dump rage instead of Heroic Strike. And this was with Salvation on a MT with TF specced into Bloodthirst who would dual-wield and pop Death Wish during fights.
---
Question. What is the difference between sitting down with this device or sitting down with a laptop?
---
Do you plan on playing in the bathroom? (which isn't a bad idea, got my Gameboy with Tetris there.)
---
But still, sounds parents are stressed out, when they don't have to be.
---
To me it looks super stretched. Like the sword was made half the size and first but they decided you stretch it out . Looks horrible
---
Makes me convinced that PServer drop-rates were buffed when people don’t realize this.
---
When I was in highschool TBC was going strong and my parents had just gotten divorced. I spent 80% of my time with my Dad, who absolutely HATED WoW. He would try to find any excuse to ground me from my computer, and one such instance lasted 8 months. During this time I would play at my Mom's boyfriend's house-- and because I didn't get to play all week most of the time, I would basically play 48 hours straight. That moment of "oh fuck" when you see the sun popping up and the birds start chirping and you realize you gotta go to school soon-- so then you fake an illness so you can stay home and sleep / play more WoW yay
---
Benediction/Anathema easily.
---
Day behind? Why is it an issue? Sure, if you're so hardcore, go for it. I wouldn't care if I would be year behind with flying. And raids won't require anything, we are not in TBC.
---
The problem is that when you're out in the world or in a dungeon or whatever it's not feasible to go check what the actual value of a BoE drop is on the AH before the roll is over. So it's better just to assume it probably holds a decent value.
---
The reason the item holds value is because someone out there believes it holds that value, not because it's that valuable to anyone in the the current party.
---
Benediction swag
---
I'm talking about available Naxx bosses as well. AFAIK most of them are loot pinatas and only few are really challenging.
---
After all the ranking warriors have better.
---
High warlord's greatsword
---
Unfortunately the Enhancement lists are pretty bad. Enhancement is not a DPS class. Totem twisting is very mana intensive. You need some caster gear.
---
Private servers give bosses stupidly high armor to curb the melee dps.
---
If you don't go in blind you an reach level 60 in 5-6 days.
---
Stinger of Ayamiss.
---
In vanilla I was free to bid using my DKP on many 2H because they were considered pvp weapons. I remember losing Ashkandi to a hunter.
---
I was going to say the same thing. I’ve used Splashtop to access my PC from my phone/iPad for at least the past 5 years. I wouldn’t do any serious dungeons or raids with it but I used it to knock out world quests, profession stuff, and the AH from my desk at work through the entirety of Legion without any issues.
---
Stop and show my gun to Gnomes
---
Tauren Druid.
---
wow, what are the chances of seeing two people from a tiny little country like norwegia? I bet this never happens
---
bruh
---
have they fixed leeway yet?
---
It's not true mobile support and those little Windows handhelds won't really stand up in raids.
---
Source?
---
Why would you play a game that you’re logging into by force. Lmao just stop playing
---
Good luck and have fun! :)
---
We're the same age. 2 kids now. Shocking to think its been 15 years since vanilla. Im excited but theres the responsibilty to at least act like a father once and awhile.
---
If leeway is in who will want to play anything but PVE, That's a hard game to get into.
---
I'm playing TBC right now and I'm literally not doing dailies. Still plenty comfortable gold-wise.
---
Thanks I've been looking for a good Orgrimmar background!
---
So you’re already expecting people to tell you’re wrong and already dismissing their opinion?
---
You sound very delusional. And are you even a German player or just someone who googled ‘wow vanilla german’ two days ago?
---
So not only is it improbable, it sounds actually impossible
---
So not only have you admitted that you're going to account share, you're also going to buy gold. I wonder what else you're going to do to for the EULA-breaking trifecta.
---
There is a massive difference in vendoring an item and selling something thats intended to be tradeable for in this case big money.  Your issue is that they made it tradeable.  But if was bind on pickup the ONLY way to get it would be to farm for the drop.  It being boe gives you the option of buying it on the ah.  Need/greed is primarily on bop drops need for main set greed for offset/vendor/disenchant.  Play with a guild your in and its a lot better than grouping with all randoms.
---
You can play almost any game from mobile or tablet so idk how this would be any different.
---
Bot, obviously.
---

Still hard for me to decide which one is more psychotic, April or Lenny.
---
Do you work for Herman miller?
---
Cmon man
---
Ash'kandi, sorry Ass Candy, is the GOAT
---
You ever think about playing the game as intended? Like one person per account, every input is done by the player etc?
---
Dude these are amazing. If you could doodle the concept art as well that would be epic
---
I think this shall be my new goal in classic, which I haven't done before.
---
Look up all the Easter eggs in game and visit them.
---
Eli is a great name for a boy! Wish you guys all the best you seem like a man who deserves it :)
---
I hear Orgrimar soundtrack when I look at this
---
I play retail as well... I love Mechagon too. I will miss my 7th legion warfront set on classic. But I would never buy something from the store. I play the retail for story (without it I would quit in WoD) and whats backstory of this crap?
---
As soon as classic will be released, nobody will see me again on retail so yeah... no point to buying this (I rather pay subscription monthly so I can quit anytime... I know how Blizzard can  destroy something)
---
I will go for this.
---
I don't see no Undercity here
---
Hopefully they're smart enough to realize that people bailed on wow for private servers before, and they can do it again.
---
*cheating to get WF rag kill
---
You show us how Classic WoW can be played on PC then we'll believe you in the fullest.
---
Teamfight tactics just came out. I didn't think I'd care because I;m not usually one for that type of game. Then I played for 13 hours straight yesterday and for the past 7 hours since I got home. It's pretty addictive and fun.
---
It made that 12 hours fly by, which means I only have to do that about 58 more times and classic will be here. :)
---
I find these macros are annoying because you have to keep updating the macro when you get new weapons.  
---
What I like to do instead:  
---
Reserve three ActionBar slots, one for your 2H, one for your 1H and one for your shield.
---
Then write your macro as (code might be wrong, writing this from memory)
---
    /click [equipped:shield] ActionBarButton 14
---
    /use Overpower
---
Takes some finessing to get the write actionbar button but once it's done, all you have to do is drag your new weapons onto your reserved ActionBar slot, and your macro doesn't need to change.
---
I think you can use /fstack to get ActionBarButton numbers.
---
What is a Zoomer and tide pods??? You mean those for washing your clothes? What the fuck?
---
I'd assume not since he literally mentioned one of their direct competitors
---
You ever think about only eating food your farm yourself and powering your house with a bicycle?
---
In life, you take advantage of every opportunity. Every action is allowed, some just have the risk of consequences.
---
I choose to evade those consequences and use money to make them trivial otherwise.
---
What are you talking about lol. It was pretty much known to everyone that you max out +hit first, then go to the other stats. Do you think people were stupid?
---
&gt;Again I never said Prot talents provide you with midegation. The midegation you get comes from gearing for midegation and being able to tank well in that gear because your Prot spec.
---
You said that prot takes less damage than fury. Do you know exactly how much of a difference there is between the specs?
---
Prot gets only three talents that reduce incoming damage:
---
1)10% more armor - seems like a lot, right? Actually, no. For a warrior in pre-raid BiS, this talent provides less armor than Devotion Aura.
---
2)+10 defense - stacking defense is for raid boss tanking, 10 less defense won't make or break a 5-man dungeon run.
---
3)Imp. Shield Block - same as above. Good for raid tanking, not necessary for 5-mans.
---
And that's it. That's the difference between damage taken by a prot and a fury warrior.
---
It looks great and ok it might work on retail.
---
But.. I can't imagine for example playing any healer effectively or PvP. Maybe raiding as a Frost Mage or Farming as a Hunter etc yes, but otherwise hitting limitations relatively soon no?
---
basilisk eyes with a quest exactly like this allowed me to switch Shattrath factions, come from hated to exalted with scryer- in order to increase my tank gear setup for the sunwell raiding.
---
I have no intention of cheating myself and I'll have no way to prove anyone else did.
---
Call it what you want, it's still going to happen.
---
As the alliance you would be a NE hunter in premade BGs. Shadowmeld is too good for objective defensive so you have to use a cat for prowl. 
---
I see some hunters advocating for the wolf but I do not see how you can get around Howl’s limited 15 yard range [wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24597/furious-howl). In pvp you want your pet to cause spellpush back which means your pet will be further than 15y away from you. You do get the opening shot but Howl adds just 50 flat damage. Meaning the max use you can get from it is 50 dmg per target hit. 
---
You could call you pet back and forth to buff you but as Howl has a 10s CD it would be extremely micro intensive and you would only gain 5dps overall output per target hit before factoring in crit minus the dps and spellpush back you lose for not having pet on target.
---
Ugh, I keep having the urge to play a druid so bad. But the only reason I'd want to is to be balanced, and I don't think I can take the pain of trying to pve as balanced, or trying to pve as resto and constantly swapping specs for balanced. 
---
Side question, is it hard to find a spot in dungeons as a resto druid? Seems like without a res they might not find groups so well.
---
There is and they are great. I'd suggest checking them out.
---
Nah, Dwarf Hunter &gt; Night Elf Hunter for PVP. Stoneform that Blind!
---
I demand a large Quest Hub for the Frostwolf! :)
---
but the best group co op challenge concept still resides in BC era, the 10 player zul aman speed run mastery - this allowed player skill within group play to grow till the most honed teams were able to clutch success and earn the war bear for every player in the team. the game has lost all of its magic for co op, at a high challenge level with excellent skill curves within class design and interplay between the classes and roles, you could have the same exact content functioning for progression, farm status, and ultimate mastery levels, which was INCREDIBLY satisfying. The meaning of your guild or team drained away as the game wandered further from this co op ideal rather than providing more of it as additional expansions emerged.
---
A few seconds absolutely can be crippling when pulling, though. That's a few more seconds that dps would have to wait to be able to DPS since the tank isn't getting rage and therefore not getting threat. Those few seconds can add up if done throughout the whole instance.
---
its not possible... I read forum... there are a lot of topics where ppl are mad they cant buy it with ballance. You need to use your credit card this time... atleast if I understand right
---
In retail vanilla, way back when, I wanted to have a horse on my nelf. So I started in the human area, and researched what quests would give me Stormwind rep. In swamp of sorrows I did the repeatable quest for days, turning in some quest from a box. I still needed a metric ton of runecloth at 50. Only reason I could afford that was a highly inflated server and 2 gathering professions. 
---
So yea, I've done the journey of a off-race mount in vanilla, it is not attainable at 40.
---
Well, taking a boomkin to a raid can cost you what, 200-600 DPS depending on content? The overall DPS loss caused by the prot paladin's low TPS can literally be a few thousand DPS, And wiping because your tank has shit mitigation? Priceless.
---
Is the city behind that giant piece of shit?
---
Well, a little bit more about me.
---
I played only a little bit during vanilla. My main was and still is DoomOracle on US Cho'Gall. I didn't hit the level cap until BC, and only raided a little as a warlock during that expansion. I basically did Kara with a friends and family guild, pugged Mag and Gruul, and occasionally got pugged by guilds doing SSC and Eye. I think I saw the inside of BT once before the huge Wrath prepatch nerf (and long after attunements were finally removed). Typical casual raider.
---
Since the F&amp;F guild kinda stopped trying to raid after Wrath came out, I jumped to a progression guild for New Naxx. They got OS3D 25, and the Undying before Ulduar hit, so I stuck around. Early in TOC, the GM quit and the raid leader (who was an asshole) stepped up. Instant mass exodous. I moved to a better guild for TOC and Zero Light progression. Then THEY lost their GM and transitioned to a 10man guild. I didn't want to raid 10m so joined a guild called &lt;Pie Chart&gt;, which was a top 100 guild. I stuck with them through ICC progression and got a nice US 19th on LK25H.
---
I was for a brief time one of the best geared warlocks in the world, which is ironic because I always said I was more interested in progression and the achievements that came with it than with gear. I put up a few good parses, but there were FAR better locks than me. I was simply more consistent than most people. I was also lucky that Yogg0 and Lich King in particular favored warlocks due to mechanics.
---
Anyway, I had to move across the atlantic after the following raid came out (some dragon sanctum, can't remember the name), and I wound up canceling my subscription since I really couldn't play at that point. I came back part way into cata, and raided casually (10m with SOME heroic progression), but the toxicity of the guild drove me away again.
---
Since then I went back to school and got a BSEE. Now one of my classmates (also a bit older than the other students) dragged me back to WoW because he wants to raid in classic (as a prot warrior I think). I found an old guild (founded in like 2007) that's still active on my server and joined up. They seem like some very cool people, but I'd rather be in Classic.
---
I want to raid. I'd like to run my own guild, but that's not set in stone. I see you also want to lead. With a 40m raid there will be *plenty* of room for solid leadership (GM and raid lead along with officers, class leaders, etc). I'm probably being too honest, but I must confess that I'm a bit wary of putting a bunch of effort into a guild that's going to be GMed by someone I don't know, but it's *possible* to sway me.
---
If you want to talk a bit more deeply about plans for Classic WoW (including what nights we'd want to raid), my battle tag is Falcrist#1348. There's a discord associated with the guild I'm currently in, and maybe we can arrange a meeting with the 4 of us... or more if I can recruit some people.
---
Oh yeah thats why ever since the store mounts have been added, we have been seeing more and more "recolor" mounts be added into the actual game, while all of the actual unique and cool mounts are added to the store.  The existence of store mounts adds a financial incentive for blizzard to make other mounts shitty
---
I'd definitely get an off brand DXRacer chair. I did it and it is great. It beats every office chair I've ever sat in and was easy to put together. Having a real gaming chair makes my long sessions so much easier.
---
The way around it is to accept that you're a hybrid, and hybrid means you're a healer who can occasionally off-tank under the right circumstances. Those circumstances include farming a shitload of consumables (needd to fix your mana + threat problems), carrying multiple sets of gear at all times, and choosing talents that allow you to fill both roles within the same raid. You might also want to consider starting your own guild as well.
---
You'll be in the same bracket as geared 60s so good luck doing av at 51.
---
Is this real? LOL
---
everyone on average is far far better, know the encounters, and know what gear is the best. in actual vanilla most people had no clue what they were doing, were still learning the fights, and probably clicked spells.
---
Having a good weapons while leveling vastly improves your leveling speed / experience. So yes it's does matter. Wingblade - outlaw - omen/ vanquisher - thrash blade is the usual progression 👍🏼
---
I joined Tenacious a while ago, and I've loved every minute of being here. Made great friends, and we've killed some great enemies together.  
---
For those looking to find a great gaming family, you should check out Tenacious.
---
The reason couldn't have been, oh, idk, the *burning legion*?
---
asscandy, hoe
---
He literally says he'll just use it for farming and leveling and do the rest from his PC. At least atempt to read before posting.
---
We’re having a baby in November, I think levelling to 60 and beyond is going to take a very long time..
---
Wish I could afford a chair that expensive, damn
---
Same here. I don’t give a shit about min maxing and I had my eyes set on dwarf priest from the beginning because dwarves are the best, and support classes are the best. I’m in fact disappointed that a lot of people will be rolling this class/race combo because I like being unique.
---
I don't know if the guild I'm thinking of will be casual...
---
With Battle.Net accounts having parental controls I would be surprised if that's not against TOS.
---
Yes. The 3rd party protection plan providers bank on the fact that you'll forget you ever purchased it and never make a claim. It costs far too much for them to have the chair shipped anywhere or to send someone out to repair it, so they just write you a check.
---
amazing graphic way too small even on a tauren
---
Well the threat only getting applied to one mage since all the others ignite get absorbed into his, i.e they dont deal any ignite damage, but yeah, DI will definitely reset that mages threat and it's a thing people do , healers don't benefit insanely much from world buffs so having one of the paladins die is not a big deal
---
I don't know how nobody has mentioned [Maladath](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19351/maladath-runed-blade-of-the-black-flight) yet. 
---
This weapon is by far the best looking one in the game.
---
6 months lmfao. if by that you mean that 99% of players with any interest in raiding whatsoever will have it on farm, then sure. most people will easily be able to pug it in 2 months max.
---
&gt; there are a lot of topics where ppl are mad they cant buy it with ballance.
---
That's the 6 month thing.
---
It's on the Shop as a separate item.
---
Tbh I feel anything that can be an Orc should when taking PvP into consideration. If the class can’t, go Undead.
---
But IMO Stun Resist &gt; WotF; your mileage may vary.
---
It definitely does not, the texts are anchored to the nameplates, MSBT does not do that.
---
Could be \[Nameplate Scrolling Combat Text\]([https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nameplate-scrolling-combat-text](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nameplate-scrolling-combat-text))
---
Almost all Two-Handed weapons are for PVP only. You should have equal consideration to all other classes.
---
All Paladins have this problem, although Pursuit of Justice lets Rets at least catch Warriors. Just accept your role as the PvP tank and consider it a victory when you make someone run away. You'll get plenty of kills in group PvP to make up for it.
---
Most zones in WoW are downscaled versions of the "real" version. The Barrens was supposed to take like a week to cross entirely if I remember correctly.
---
Not as a warlock. That's one of the main reasons why mages destroy you early on.
---
Yes, but the point is there's no real BIS race for both PVP and PVE when it comes to Rogue. Undead will win over Orc many times, Orc will win over Undead many times.
---
Ya this. Other paid mmos have huge shops that spam you as soon as you login and some popular ones sell player power. At least on wow you get it for free if your subscribing anyway or can just buy it for ingame gold.
---
Well you got paid for the service. I wouldn't call that a scam.
---
&gt;Wearing all plate is fine if you at least pay attention.
---
You're opening pandora's box. If one person is allowed to do it, the whole raid is then entitled to do it. I wouldn't want to be part of a guild thats okay with letting all of its members, especially its healers, slack off and purposefully do worse just so that they don't have to wear cloth. Especially if they are even the slightest bit interested in downing bosses in a timely fashion.
---
Guilds exist where people wear purely the armour they were supposed to, and they are on RP servers where people wear all the dungeon and tier sets for raids even if they are pretty bad/poorly itemised for most.
---
&gt; you'll already have cleared Naxx a hundred times
---
100 times is probably an exaggeration, but the splinters had about a 33% chance to drop. So you'd be looking at about 8 full clears of the place. Say you weren't downing 4 horsemen, Sapph, KT, and one other boss. Suddenly it'll take 11 weeks on average.
---
 Glad to see I'm not the only one that thinks so.
---
That industry never left or died.
---
You can’t buy 6 months game time you need to setup a subscription to get the mount for free offer but you can buy the mount directly with blizzard balance
---
Hunters hardcounter rogues. You don’t need Stoneform. Being able to shadowmeld yourself and stealth your pet is much more valuable. Orc&gt;undead always.
---
Just pick what you want and try to be the best of that thing that you can be.
---
Want to be an Alliance warlock? Don't try to be the best player in the game, just aim to be the best alliance warlock that you can be. Even losing can be fun if you're playing a class/race/faction that you enjoy.
---
WORTHLESS TIME SINKS :D LMAO
---
"tell me why that cant or wont happen"
---
It absolutely WILL happen.
---
Is Ironforge behind that pile of stones and feces?
---
using those swords makes whirlwind hit like a wet noodle, for no apparent benefit
---
&gt;You can do the same with berserk stance and intercept if you havent already.
---
No, it isn't really cool. It's a dumb fashion statement.
---
But it's a game. All you're gaining by messing with the system is a false sense of superiority. You won't earn those achievements yourself, as least compared to how most people think you should earn them. Which makes those achievements practically meaningless. You do all this stuff to get server/world first raid boss kills for example. Do you think most people will really care about that when they find out you did things they/Blizzard consider cheating? It's like steroid abuse in sports. When people find out what you did surreptitiously any respect garnered will be lost. It's the epitome of stroking your own ego for practically no reason.
---
&gt; Every action is allowed, some just have the risk of consequences.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; I choose to evade those consequences and use money to make them trivial otherwise. 
---
That attitude can have very destructive short term and long term effects that go beyond your desire to stroke your ego. You seem like a sad, short sighted and selfish person.
---
It was diminished into a shadow of what it once was.
---
Good luck with that one. Blizzard has killed the botting scene compared to what it used to be.
---
Trade you for a healthstone
---
I’ve been keeping an eye on it, seems like they’re finishing the single player as a priority right now
---
Bro it's a fact.
---
I played on a non german server at that time but still remember all the posts about it back then.
---
The german servers were dead because the game was too hard for them, a lot of ppl returned in tbc but mostly joined the 3 servers i mentioned.
---
I'm going dwarf hunter too but just so you know NEs naturally start with 8 more agi so its pretty dang close
---
Priest DI? :thinking:
---
Are you stupid? That will never happen in BFA, but even if its retarded to do that because there are always catch-up mechancics.
---
Praise the priest! I'll be life tapping so you can top the healing meters
---
This should just be deleted, not just put a source sticky on it lol.
---
I prefer World of Duty
---
The classic  [fiddle game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_confidence_tricks#Fiddle_game).
---
😂
---
It's a piece of shit no matter how you slice it.
---
Yeah but that was just an april fools joke.
---
Dual wielding fury warriors don't use a lot of that
---
You're bad. Pretty much all paladins who managed to tank at least a few raid bosses accomplished that by stacking defensive stats on gear.
---
Sunwell Plateau.
---
For WoW yes. But they moved to other games. That industry is still very much alive. There's so many games where you can sell digital items for gold. WoW isn't the only game for this on the market.
---
It's a dumb complaint. It's literally cheaper than some ingame mounts if you buy it with gold. It just involves an AH trip.
---
The thought of playing wow without a mouse is like nails on a chalkboard to me. i guess if you’re on a pve server. but you’re just so limited in terms of mobility.
---
I've had an IKEA Markus for 6/7 years and it was good
---
I too thought the gaming chair was more of a gimmick but convinced by a friend I bought a Maxnomic, and damn it was worth the price
---
If you can spend the 200 extra than my take is go for it, in their site there is a wide selection with a great guide explaining what model might be the right fit for you, mine is still in perfect conditions after 6 years despite being a big and heavy guy who sits on it even 10+ hours to day
---
Playing FF14 myself.
---
The problem from what I recall wasn't the mobs inside the dungeon, it was getting a group to organize and go to said dungeon as Alliance, at that level, because Silverpine Forest is a bit of a hike from Stormwind/Ironforge.
---
This is the internet, do you know how many stupid people are on it?
---
Also, no, you can't convey sarcasm without tone, generally.
---
they use it literally every single time its off cooldown, as soon as possible. Bloodthirst &gt; Whirlwind &gt; heroic strike.
---
Yes Acti-Blizzard will monetise Classic in addition to the sub fee (because companies don't want some of its consumers money, it wants ALL of its consumers money.)
---
These will be the form of current services like server transfers and maybe even race changes, not initially but maybe once Phase 2 drops.
---
Tokens will be introduced as well, to combat gold sellers but also to respond to demand from players.
---
any dutch people on here able to tell me if you guys find it weird or annoying to be called a “Dutchman” or is it normal?
---
One word: Ashkandi.
---
"Oh Staff of Jordan dropped? I'm gonna need it because it does slightly more damage than WW axe"
---
-A warrior, probably
---
How are people out of touch? You can't take someone's experience and then tell them they are wrong. That's not how it works. That's like me saying that you are wrong about how you feel about your parents. I can't say that.
---
That was my experience, I remember it well.
---
No, by 60, every difference in base stats is negligible.
---
My favorite part. He lectured people about how ganking lowbies isn't cool, and you should never do it.
---
Who ever’s painting or drawing it is, it’s beautiful. Definitely not the greatest city (I think we can all agree about that objectively speaking)
---
There's gotta be a lvl 17 hunter around somewhere to own him
---
Play through some of the SWTOR class story lines
---
Psh scrub, I type all my spells.
---
OP is the guy you hate topping the scoreboard while the enemy team captures flag after flag and all still maintain a positive k/d
---
dont do this kids
---
Hmm. I remember unending farming of the many raid consumables and the ever important gold.
---
I'd argue it's pretty feasible to pricecheck. In my vanilla experience, even without addons, it was as simple as asking someone.
---
Your second paragraph basically just restated what I had just said - that something has value because someone values it - but denies the context of the MMO, aka *why* that someone would believe it holds value: because it's an upgrade is definitely the biggest reason for that belief.
---
All-needing a good BoE for the purpose of selling when someone in the party needs it as an upgrade almost isn't even anti-ninja - it's *everyone* agreeing to potentially ninja from the person that actually needs it. The anti-ninja defense of that philosophy only works if there's both A. reason to believe it will get ninja'd *and* B. if the item is subsequently given to/rolled for by the people who actually need it.
---
It's turning "Need or Greed" into "Greed as Need".
---
The thing is, you'd need to scale down even more. The Barrens is already scaled down, but the Emerald Dream version of The Barrens would have to be scaled down even more, to maybe 1/10 of the size.
---
The sound of your life wasting away
---
I learned a lot from this! Thanks!
---
I don't want to change your mind, we all have our own opinions!
---
79 bucks at Walmart. I bought the chair like a couple years ago and I love it don't ask me why. Before that I had a silly ass computer chair with speakers built in
---
I did a ton of research and everyone was saying:
---
**Budget:** ikea Markus or staples hyken
---
**Expensive:** Herman Miller or  Steelseries 
---
I went the budget route and chose the staples hyken over the ikea Markus because it was on sale for $100 off and I am quite happy with my purchase. Very solid chair.
---
That's hilarious
---
That shit was ruined for me for being a BOA. Claymore wins yet imo
---
No, it doesn't work. It did in Vanilla for a while, but was eventually removed. It doesn't work in the Beta at all, not actually and not visually.
---
chu say
---
First I'm concerned that if you played Vanilla, you are probably above 25-30 years and still use 'bro'
---
Then I don't get why you're afraid or expecting to hear people saying you're wrong if it's a "fact"
---
Then 'game too hard for German' is like... hum... stupid? because it wasn't hard enough for French so should I conclude that French are tougher than Germans? 
---
Are you German?
---
Dont Google it because your YouTube ads will all spontaneously become an ironic meme/clickbait dumpster fire
---
I want to read quests, and Level Up all Proffesions. No hurry
---
Rogues using Flask of Supreme Power?
---
wat.
---
Yep. That's the Vanilla way.
---
People in classic use to play the game to play. Hense how i leveled to 60 as a holy paladin lol. Im not sure if your trolling or not but its sad that people will be playing this time around to play the meta not the game.
---
Office chairs, thousand times better than gaming chairs and 1/4 price.
---
i'm 27 and i can use whatever words i want.
---
No it's not stupid because most germans are roleplaying scrubs who cry about every little thing.
---
i'm not but i've met many of them over the years.
---
Streamers had there fun, Blizzard got the attention it wanted. 8.2 is now out. Classic is a thing in the past for blizzard invite wise. They need you back playing 8.2 now.
---
It's a lot harder to get away with as an adult.  I was deployed in Iraq for WoW launch, came back and hit WoW hard for a solid 12 months before I had to make a choice between keeping my job or killing C'Thuun.
---
Stolen, OG artists name removed, Filter applied. Disgusting.
---
Noblechairs are the best - but ~400€
---
Ummm....wheres your second monitor???
---
No you won’t
---
Sadder that some dumb-ass actually decided to gift gold over this, I think.
---
OP doesnt know what warlocks had to deal with. If they didnt log on early enough they were fucked on shards.
---
By many, you mean the minority.
---
Because the majority will need 3-4 months to 60, which isn't exactly rushing.
---
No lies detected
---
Where did he even state that it would make him feel superior to others? You seem to be projecting that onto him with no evidence whatsoever. Maybe dude just doesn’t feel like farming gold for 100 hours when he could just spend a couple hours wages.
---
many people were new and the raidlead wanted to have them learn the mechanics and what not. i dont think its good to throw gold at learning phases. do some of those and if it feels like the raid can succeed and call to pop the potions is totally fine for me. but wasting consumables on learning especially early in the server, where there isnt a stable ecconomy isnt optimal.
---
hahah i had the same issue with Ironforge. I had my friends go to the AH for me cause my comp was so shit it could barely handle SW.
---
I've done some digging online and now understand that there is a different methodology being used, from the private server method of staying seated (or prone/flat-footed for all you DnD players) for proccing an enrage-like effect.  Now triggering the crit by sitting but being in a standing position when the blow is dealt.
---
This plays heavily on the new (old) spell batching delays and seem a like an unintended consequence. 
---
I wonder if Blizzard will stop you from using /sit /kneel /lie in combat to stop this.
---
We pay for the expansion. We pay for the subscription. Idiots pay for the mounts
---
i hope so, if not its a evil i need to face then. life isnt always fair haha 
---
it all gona work out (hopefully)
---
Its basically vine 2.0
---
there's a bracker 51-59? or was it 51-60 ?
---
You put the wrong picture, that’s not Ironforge.
---
" So im a bot!" i always die when he says that.
---
Other comments he's made. It's clear he just wants to get ahead of everyone else as fast as possible and clear content as fast as possible, even if that means cheating.
---
I'm not gonna deny that everyone needing isn't about greed. All I'm saying is that it's about acknowledging the fact that these specific items generally have a much higher monetary value than other upgrades, which alters the balance of whether the upgrade or the gold is the most prioritized factor when deciding who should get the item.
---
If you think the upgrade is the most valuable no matter what, fine. But many people will argue that they'd rather have 30 more gold than a 2 dps upgrade for two days.
---
Yes you will https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/alterac-valley-battleground-classic-wow
---
Vanilla Boomer\*
---
UI addon's name? Is that addon still available?
---
If the guild is serious about pvp at all they will probably give some priority to giving it to warriors first, because ret is an 'off spec' for premades still. In my experience only about half of warriors are much interested in pvp (mainly because respeccing is such a pain) so ret shouldn't be too far down the list.
---
Realistically if you're 100% gonna play Classic anyway then you've only paid 2 months worth for it.
---
And like me, if you're subbing early for the name reservations then its even less.
---
Not at all
---
Just hope your counsellor makes the same realisation as you, that WoW is a fine private vent as long as you're in control, if you can't convince Monica. You need it and your marriage needs it.
---
Do what you can not to worry Mrs by hyping about it and wearing the t-shirt. Go to bed when she asks you to. Know what's important.
---
The kids can play too. It's fun for the whole family.
---
My only gripe with Classic is that I'll probably be forced to pay for three or four accounts. I'm not letting my kids have some half-arsed p-server experience.
---
Its from Ikea, I have the same one. Can look it up if you cant find it.
---
 2H weapons can be better than dual wielding as a Warrior if you don't have good 1H weapons. Warriors also desperately want 2H weapons to rank in PvP. Holy is the best spec for Paladins to rank in Classic. Any serious guild will give the 2H weapons to Warriors first before Paladins. 
---
&gt;You should have equal consideration to all other classes.
---
This will only happen in casual and some semi serious guilds.
---
Just to set one thing straight, the in game looting structure is there for a reason. Ninja looting is defying that structure. 
---
There is a huge difference between rolling need on something even if it’s to sell it and having loot on master looter while telling your party they will be able to roll on an item drop and still taking it regardless. 
---
You did not ninja.
---
... so what did you choose
---
&gt;People who haven't tried osrs but looking forward to play classic, why?
---
Classic is an actually decent game, while runescape was a poorly designed grinding simulator with potato graphics iirc. 
---
It's almost like one was designed by a large team of experienced game developers while the other one... wasn't.
---
??
---
What I use as well, can't bring myself to buy anything more expensive. 
---
The high back is good for taller people (I'm 6'2" and my head is slightly over the top, so really tall people may want something else) and the mesh is good for avoiding the dreaded sweaty back
---
But Male or Female?
---
Get beaten up by a small, thick asian women called Mistress Lulu, could also be an option less pricey.
---
It's also pretty nice pulling a group and letting them kill themselves from Holy Shield, Ret Aura, and Conc ticks.
---
You're drinking after every pull most of the time, but you're killing a bunch per pull.
---
First time i ever tried naxx, i was on my friends account. He had to work night for some reason. I wasnt even apart of the guild. So he gave me his account info. Didnt want me to go for gear. Just needed me there for attendance and DKP I got to play his dwarf priest. Now being only a BWL raider/ working on AQ at the time. I had no fucking clue what i was doing. I faked my way through the spider wing. Then we got to Instructor Razuvious....I guess they didnt plan on going to him that night so he didnt tell me what i needed to do.....So while they were going through the pre fight they mention what i had to do. I had nooooooooooooo fucking clue what i was doing. My time came to MC one of the students.....whoops instant wipe. I had no clue where his MC button even was. It was great. Got screamed at on Vent,( made a account with his name). Stayed silent. We wiped 3 more times with me being the issue. I get kicked from the guild cause i wouldnt talk in vent, when being asked questions. Oh man......explaining to him what happened he was so mad. But he could only be mad at himself. Ruined our friendship and they want to keep playing, cause he got black listed from out server. Sorry Waxman.........i really am for that night still
---
Pro tip: put receipt and paperwork in a plastic sandwich baggie. Tape said bag to the bottom of the chair. You'll never loose it.
---
Ok.. so you were 12 years old back then, you never played on those servers (nor speak German) and you pretend to know "facts" about the german server population because of some post you read 15 years ago?
---
And me, who was 20 and played on non-english server back then should listen to your vague souvenir of something you didn't experienced? 
---
If you have the minimum amount of wisdom, you should maybe now say "well ok, I don't really know, it's a feeling I have but maybe I'm wrong and you probably know more than me on this subject"
---
Haha, my thoughts exactly xD But thanks for the info, I'll cross that off my list then.
---
Where are the bodies coming from? If I'm locked to my guild's raid why would I bother to go to a pug? If people pug 40 man raids on private servers I find that surprising, and not because its hard (it isn't) but because I'm surprised anyone wants to bother.
---
Or just take a photo of it on your phone and put it in some cloud.
---
I agree, but I don’t think it’s enough to justify running those dungeons repetitively until you get them. If you do get them? Awesome. If you don’t? Not a huge deal. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
That’s exactly the point you doofus. They sit to take more damage. It still works on classic, but it doesn’t proc certain abilities. 
---
They still want to take more damage, how is this a hard concept to grasp
---
I'm playing those two I think not well known games, which rekindled gaming for me:
---
Grim Dawn - ARPG, true spiritual successor to Diablo II. Devs are releasing new patches and it's supported.
---
Pathfinder: King Maker - cRPG, was bugged garbage on release so many people put immediately bad mark on it. Devs fixed bugs and it's now best thing I've played since Baldur's Gate II.
---
I never defeated C'Thuun.  Didn't begin raiding again till Karazhan and had to pull back after Vashj and KT.
---
People commenting here are obviously hardcore as fuck. Lol not wanting to miss dailies? Bitch, I stopped subbing to WoW before BC because I wasn't playing for WEEKS at a time. It's the subscription cost you're paying that makes me feel like I need to play all the time or I'm wasting it all. 
---
Lol endgame stuff. Who else didn't even make it to 60? As a kid in school I just didn't have the time.
---
It is included with Win10, No?
---
Wrong. Serious guilds don’t care about your PVP aspirations. If it’s a PVE upgrade, fine, but if you’re going to use it for PVP, you roll just like everyone else.
---
I don't like the store either but how tf do you think buying a mount makes you bad at the game?
---
In PvP you only compete against your own faction with ranks so minmaxing faction doesn't matter.
---
I’d argue time is way more valuable than money here. If someone can save possibly hundreds of hours that they can then spend with their family or friends, why shouldn’t they have that option? It is, like you said above, just a game after all. Plus if a handful of people spending money on gold or items is enough to destroy the game it would have already died in vanilla.
---
I'll probably do the absolute no-life grind (talking about 18+ hours a day for a week), but strictly for practical reasons. Gotta get to 60 before the semester starts...
---
Classic is just a huge grind as well
---
I speak german and was reading the german sections awell as the english ones.
---
Uh you guys clearly have never seen finkle's lava dredger. [https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/344327-finkles-lava-dredger.jpg](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/344327-finkles-lava-dredger.jpg)
---
I tried OSRC, it felt like the sims with potato graphics . I bet it's cool, I may try it again, but I was turned off at the beginning and I am an old school mmo player 99-current
---
Your best bet for 2H weapons is to go after the 2H weapons that Warriors aren't drooling over like the Earthshaker, Spinal Reaper, Zin'rokh, Destroyer of World, or The Untamed Blade.
---
Still a 12 years old who never played on those servers and pretend to know 'fact'
---
And it's obvious you have a grudge/hate of german for some reason that make you say very stupid things
---
Nice one mate, glad you found something that works for you and cheers for sharing. 
---
In a similar position to you, being a first time dad and working a long week (including overnights at work). I resorted to using an xbox controller to play WoW meaning I could then play it on my laptop wherever I happened to be. It was clunky at first and took some adjustment and practise but it meant I could play when I’m at work when there’s nothing left to do, or downstairs when the baby’s napping for example, so I’m not cooped up in the office to play. 
---
All the best mate, enjoy fatherhood ;)
---
As a Runescape player almost 20 years ago that only got into computer science science in college because of the bots we made in grade school....
---
Fuck Runescape.
---
I’d rather play a nose picking simulator.
---
That “game” is barely a notch above Neopets.
---
Do you know how many hours that would be of grinding? Unless you're incredibly rich already this is simply out of reach of most players, just like the Long boy.
---
"But it IS obtainable, just put in the effort"
---
The difference between this and the long boy is that the long boy isn't on the store. It's not worth it to grind all that irl time away to finally spend it all on this mount when all the prestige of owning is ripped away because other ppl skipped the effort and just paid for it. 
---
That's why I don't like the store. I want to feel the prestige and show off the effort I put in. Not have people mutter 'shil' as I walk past.
---
False prophet. I listen only to Salzman, also from accounting.
---
What I read about both classes in Classic and some of my preferences (some points might be wrong or inaccurate):
---
Mage:
---
Pros: Easier leveling, utility Kit (food, water, portals), AOE spells, better gold farming, top ranged DPS, flashy skills, good defense skills (ice barrier, blink, poly, nova), less mechanics to avoid in raid, better duel class, strong at BGs, cheaper pre-raid BIS.
---
Cons: Easy but boring PvE Rotation, squishy, only DPS role, cloth armors are kinda lame, overpopulated class, lots of downtime due to mana recover.
---
Warrior:
---
Pros: Best raid DPS, you can both Tank or DPS, PvP beast when you have a pocket healer, more races avaiable, awesome looking armors and weapons, less squishy than mages.
---
Cons: poor solo PvP, harder rotation, no escape skills, very gear dependent, hard solo leveling, needs a pocket healer no PvP, hard to farm gold, stance dance looks kinda clunky, overpopulated class, more macros than mages, higher repair costs.
---
In your opinion, why should you roll Warrior over Mage?
---
damn when i was reading all of these in my head i heard exact voice for each one !
---
Ashkandi is really good for hunter in pvp.
---
That's some mental gymnastics to justify cheating. Everyone has things that take away from their time to play the game. Does that mean everyone is entitled to cheat? It's only a handful because only a handful have the lack of self awareness necessary to rationalise cheating. The game wouldn't be very fun if everyone cheated though would it? If you're basically paying someone else to play the game for you, why even bother playing in the first place? Because it boils down to the cheater wanting a superficial feeling of accomplishing something, despite not actually playing within the confines of what is considered 'fair' for the average player.
---
You are masochistic?
---
When people are crying on forums because everyone left their server it is kind of a fact that the server is dead.
---
It was not one post, not two posts, it was pages filled with crying.
---
But whatever it's obvious that you're trying to defend national servers, keep living in your box, i have no clue about your french servers because i can't speak french and therefore haven't read the forums.
---
TL;DR: Your class is so boring and easy that even while leveling or raiding, you can read and write incredibly long essays about why your class is the best.
---
Paladins: proof Blizzard cares about players with disabilities.
---
I’m sorry but in the 2019 meta of classic wow where people are much better at the game and much more knowledgeable, engineering makes a big difference. If you’re a hardcore player it’s needed. For everyone else you don’t need it, but it’s still hugely impactful. 
---
If you’re properly utilizing engineering and are a good player it becomes very useful. Tons of items that offer a variety of utility: interrupting a cast, getting away from your enemy, closing a gap, ccing your enemy, getting huge burst, spell reflecting fire, shadow or frost...the list goes on. When used in the right hands, engineering offers very impactful utility.
---
Pray Blizz lets them add staves...and make a holy DPC caster build.
---
When in doubt always choose female.
---
No, Paint and [pain](https://pain.net)t.net are two separate applications.
---
Priest Disc/Holy hybrid spirit build.
---
Except now the gear is just boring. You chase a never ending item level, where every single piece of gear feels the same. You know that piece of gear with item level 400 is going to have the same exact stat allocation as any other piece...throw in a little rng for a socket or titanforging.
---
That's actually a really awesome transmog o\_O Is that from retail or what?
---
Yeah I'm with ya on ff14, also lets you play for free up to lvl 35 I belive?
---
Da fuck is a transmog? I've only ever played classic. It's from molten core.
---
The weapon is. The rest of the gear isn't. Hence why i asked. Never mind.
---
Wooosh
---
Ew, this is Legion.
---
You should roll warrior because you want to play one
---
Came here looking for this.  You have to PvP all day every day for the high ranks. Have people forgotten this or are they deliberately ignoring. It to make a point that classic is somehow less of an obligation and grind?
---
The winter spring quests puts a big whole in your post.
---
Had friends writing their master's thesis spamming frost bolt. Trash is where homework is done.

Pvp gear being so strong better than dungeon for raids was the start of the downward trend for loot reward for me. I know 60 pvp gear was decent for raids too, especially having a r14 wep but even on a busy server there might be two dozen people at absolute most with this kinda gear in raids
---
That's a terrible annology 😂
---
I feel like you're getting downvoted by people who missed the reference entirely
---
Why not ?
---
I think it's not only shit, because it's a store mount and so on, I am also mad, because they put these dumb things into the game that have NOTHING to do with the lore and are not explainable. They are destroying my immersion. So they are all shit, no matter how beautiful they look.
---
Orc rogue has the advantage over an undead rogue
---
I wish guilds like yours were more common.
---
I find your lack of taste to be disturbing...
---
&gt;Wrong. Serious guilds don’t care about your PVP aspirations. 
---
How am I wrong? Serious guilds will have people pushing for R13/14 because the gear is good for PvE. Phase 2 adds PvP rewards before BWL is even out... Naxx40 won't be out until Phase 6.. AQ40 won't be out until Phase 5.
---
The serious guilds will 100% be pushing players to R13/14.

Sadly this doesn't work anymore
---
I have tried osrs and its a clicking rock sim.
---
I prefer PvP, PvE is mainly another form of leveling for me.
---
How much worse would a warlock perform before phase 4 compared to a mage? Should I just roll mage if I dont plan to raid for years?
---
God I wish I could In clutter my desk. Every time I do it only lasts a week lol. Papers, figures, wires and shit everywhere lol
---
You're not denying them an upgrade. They can buy it from the winner.
---
Thats just insane! 
---
I only spent €1.2k :)
---
Pathofexile
---
&gt;First of all, tanks sit to take crits purposefully 
---
that doesnt work on official servers, at all.

dont insult people when you are getting stuff wrong, friendo

Female Tauren has the best animations in the game.

I bought the noble chairs hero last year and owned a maxnomic pro chief before and I prefer maxnomic tbh

---
I can play on english server, not a problem.
---
I was just curious to know how someone could pretend there never was more than 2 German server with 1k players. The answer is that some edgy 27yo guy with a hate of Germany remind posts he read when he was 12 yo about servers he never played and say it's "fact" because he can't even imagine that he could be wrong.
---
But yeah, you alread contradicted yourself since from never 2 servers with 1k population we are already at 3 with high population and since you didn't play, you have absolutely no clue about how many medium server at peak hours there was  (or do you remind a post from 15 years ago about it?)
---
Eh it happens, just some youngins who haven't seen the commercial lol
---
Buying it doesn't make them bad, it's just a red flag that I avoid. Same way I try to avoid people who say "I raided at a high level back in BC" or people who wear titles like Crazy Cat Lady. Just indicators of people being casual/low effort/not caring that much about their personal performance.
---
I'm in Europe and it starts on a Monday. So I think I will play from Tuesday afternoon, but might take the Tuesday off so I can play a lot after the worst launch issues are over.
---
Well at least the 7.2 zones are cool :)
---
If my only concern were which class is just the most _fun_ to play while levelling (ignoring how good they actually are, as well as ignoring utility and other concerns), which would you recommend? Which class just has the most fun and satisfying rotations while grinding through mobs?
---
Have you tried looking for a Twitch streamer playing Priest on beta? Might be able to find their past broadcasts for 1-40 at least.
---
I think at this point you should just take your own advice and understand that it’s just a game. Some random dude buying gold doesn’t affect your life in any way unless you let it, it just means he doesn’t have to waste time grinding gold for his epic mount or to level his professions. Who actually gives half a damn about that? We’re all given the exact same opportunity to do it, only the majority of us that refuse to don’t sit on some moral high horse looking down on others for spending money to save time. Get over yourself.
---
&gt; 4 day 20 hour
---
ayyy
---
Why would you trust the interns?!
---
zin rokh is very nice for woyer
---
Oh man, not Robin.
---
&gt; and understand that it’s just a game 
---
That's why Blizzard doesn't care that people buy gold or account share. Oh wait.
---
Lmao the secret is not to. They don’t stay around long enough to see you deny their merge requests on Git.
---
Not listed: shaman and paladin.
---
Guess once you pick a class, then you are stuck to which race.
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion but hunters should have priority over other classes like ret or warriors because the hunter actually has the weapon equipped in pve. They will just be stat sticks to them in raids but that benefits the guild more than a ret or warrior having it in his bag for pvp. No im not playing a hunter
---
Ya boi.
---
I loved playing via controller on TV.. made for easy Warrior leveling.
---
ran out out colors lul    
---
imo race is fine, picking faction is way harder xD
---
I thought Rend was useless, its not even on my bars.
---
For the Horde 💪🏻🤙🏻💪🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
---
[Horde](https://imgur.com/gallery/9Q4X6aU)
---
Rogues arent that good in BGs
---
they do
---
That's exactly what I felt in BFA and why I stopped because I hadnt lot of time to play and felt bad missing optimisation you speak about :(
---
I got a Mirra 2 refurb off eBay with all the bells and whistles for around half the price of retail. It’s built like a tank and I’m so glad I didn’t go down the racing chair route. Get a chair that’s good for you, you won’t regret it.
---
Check out Kargoz on youtube
---
Pretty sure Tauren females can squeeze into some spots that males can't.
---
Holy crap I want to tank now.
---
Nah, horde is the only choice.
---
That looks like a can opener for backsides.
---
For PvP is very useful. Especially to keep druids and rogues out of stealth
---
I noticed smite priest is not mentioned. It factually does more dps than shadow priest.
---
Its fine. Most people wont remember them that well even if they played back in the day. I played vanilla and did a lot of dungeons and on a private server i couldnt remember shit. Wasnt a big deal for early dungeons but after lvl 50 i was concerned with the high level raids, i was concerned people might be hostile because i dont know which way to go and stuff like that (especially if i was gonna tank so i wasnt even plannong on doing them. But since i was a druid people just randomly whispered me and asked if i wanted to tank a dungeon so i ended up doing it. Turns out most people were rediscovering these instances right now too and the ones that werent were really helpful in telling us where to go. No one was toxic in the runs i was in
---
Don't fall for the trap and buy some jank made to look good on a stream. Bucket seat "racing chairs" are just that. Made for racing where you have your feet lifted up on pedals. If you are sitting on this with your feet on the ground the blood to your legs is cut off and your legs will go numb, which is more than a little uncomfortable. 
---
Chairs have been made since the inception of carpentry, there have been chairmakers for hundreds of years, ranging all prices - find something from one of them and avoid these fad chairs like the plague.
---
DID SOMEBODY SAY
---
What is omegalul?
---
To be honest I'm going to buy it for the game time. I'm in the beta and will play classic after that so for me it's ok I will pay it anyway.
---
Look at what this great MMO became , a mount collectible game ... This is the hype of 8.2 ? Mounts ? Pet battle ? Solo dungeon ? Seriously ?
---
A bit sad, meaning that casuals will not even reach 60 but the content will be deployed
---
Love the idea of having a zone below wintersrpring filled with waterfalls from all the snow melting!
---
Great job as always!
---
And Tauren/Troll Shamans have the advantage over Orc Shamans. I guess Orc Shamans suck huh?
---
Nowhere lol
---
So can we change the title to reach the new goal, which is 2500? 😉
---
Anyways, thank you all for signing the petition. Be sure to share the petition with others so we can get those much needed signatures!
---
Breath of the wild master mode. The world feel so dangerous and you can Explorer for weeks and still find new things.
---
Zin'rokh won't be out until Phase 4. Ashkandi and BRE is better than the Zin'rokh I believe.
---
At least some dailies in TBC, you can farm extra things such as eggs for the Netherwing mount rep. I got exalted in 4 or 5 days and got the mount. But nothing beats classic because fuck flying mounts
---
Not enough IQ, smh 😡
---
I don't suggest working on enh BIS at all, it is the MOST server dependant coding class in the game.
---
your vanilla pvp experience has very little bearing on how classic pvp will be - people are generally much much better now. any private server pvper will tell you how important engineering is
---
He literally said "everyone has decided it's fair game" so it's absolutely not the point you're claiming.
---
The point you're making is the same as the one I'm making, except I'm saying by conforming you're contributing.
---
Probably cold leather and/or no sweaty when no breathing holes in leather
---
Warlocks for sure.
---
4 of the 5 people in your party have names ending in “on”
---
Yes and include the name of the weapon after the numbers.
---
Like
---
'''/equipslot 16 battle axe
---
/equipslot 17 shield of the wolf'''
---
I tried that. Unfortunately it's almost all group or duo leveling.
---
That what i was wondering. I'm with you. Every Warrior will be 100% dw fury. They don't need twohanders.
---
&gt; Some random dude buying gold doesn't affect your life
---
Ingame it does, I'd rather not have a world crawling with bots or chinese farmers. The majority of the playerbase enjoys a fair playing ground, this is why bots get banned and accounts deleted for using these methods.
---
I fully agree with what thimmy3 says here, justifying cheating because "everyone can buy a bot or chinese farmer" topkek
---
What? Are you okay mate? Should I call you an ambulance? I mean what the hell is even this.
---
wotf dispells plus gives you an inifity for a few seconds so no double fear shenanigans.
---
    /cast Charge
---
    /stopmacro [combat]
---
    /yell HELLO
---
But in your case it's better to use a script like Sprint_ca posted earlier.
---
Cant tell if you are joking right now....Zoomers are GenZ kids. The kids of today. And yes, the tide pots to wash your clothes with.
---
Every Warrior that isn't dw fury is not worth raiding with anyways. Twohanders are Pala/Shaman items (and ofc Hunter items).
---
I mean I'm definitely on the stoned side but I don't think an ambulance is needed. Thanks though
---
implying kids still leave home at 18 nowadays lmao
---
The real issue is you don’t have to kill the NPC to get the DHK. One asshole can ruin it for everyone else. Also after they removed DHK in TBC they didn’t see a sudden spike in players camping NPCs so it really was never a big deal to begin with.
---
Unless you want instant PvP queues and the easiest healer role in the game.
---
Would be like Iraqis in  Alaska
---
Vermintide 2, best L4D2 style horde game. Set in the fantasy version of Warhammer at the start of the end times, the ratmen have flooded out destroying all in their way, all but five.  
---
Melee focused combat with limited ranged weapons for taking out  special threats. I love that game to death.
---
It is also on sale on steam right now! Do yourself a favor and check it out!
---
can we not
---
"everyone I don't like is an incel neckbeard reeee"
---
If you are going to equip it, you roll need and prove that you bound an item. Unless you stolen something clearly not for your class/spec (clothes on warrior etc) it cant be considering ninja looting in those circumstances.
---
Pink Floyd  is the best class
---
Damn we are really getting bored waiting for classic huh
---
Lots of good metroidvanias recently .  Celeste , salt and sanctuary , bloodstained...happy to see the genre make a resurgence .
---
ZOOMER VS BOOMER
---
Pog
---
I generally want to agree but theres something about IF and its stumpy inhabitants that does it for me.
---
And what is their role then? Sure as fuck ain't healing or dps, they have like 2ccs, so it's not ccing either, they don't bring anything special buff wise so it's not like the "1 per raid winter chill mage"...
---
Just read about your justification on botting/cheating and now this? You're one fucked up individual lol
---
For me the interest in the story ended with the end of MoP, legion had some interesting bits but nothing really good
---
That'd be amazing. We need to start a petition to have this change made in classic. Give people a chance to experience the best of both.
---
Sure but levelling alts in time you can’t be at the computer sure is a nice perk.
---
A gamling chair is an overpriced office chair, just get a good office chair and you'll get more value for your money.
---
Good stuff mate! Congrats on becoming a dad!  Never really thought of the controller idea before glad it works for you :) we have to get our wow fix somehow lol
---
Wow thanks man appreciate it :)
---
&gt; Do you know how many hours that would be of grinding? Unless you're incredibly rich already
---
You can sell M+ boosts and make several hundred thousand an hour.
---
&gt;The difference between this and the long boy is that the long boy isn't on the store.
---
You can sell Tokens until you have 5 mil gold.
---
&gt;That's why I don't like the store. I want to feel the prestige and show off the effort I put in. 
---
You can buy Kel'thuzad runs with gold/$$ too, rest assured.
---
Thanks a lot! :)
---
Whhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeey 420 m8 fun stuff rite
---
I'm really curious as to why people think server transfers are OK. I think there should be no transfers at all (paid or free). Only way a character ever gets to a different server than it was made on is margers.
---
Why do you think so? If he's dying at the point when it's a wipe, pots ain't gonna save him, and people dying before him WITH POTS should be ashamed.
---
I was always the top DPS in my guild without flasks and pots. I don't have money to throw at that shit. Should I have been kicked for that, even though I'm still doing my role better than anyone?
---
Those are ergonomic office chairs, not chairs comfortable for laying back and chilling while enjoying flight path or while gaming with a controller. Also no crossing legs
---
Oh and btw, Herman Miller is the equivalent of apple in office chairs, ridiculously overpriced for an outdated product (aeron)
---
It's only for NPCs that you wouldn't get experience for. So, as a level 60, you can kill flight masters but you can't kill that level 23 quest giver without incurring a DHK. It's a decent system but the worst part is how much you can tank your rank without even directly harming civilians as anyone in the raid group gets them if only one person is doing the killing. If you're going to raid a city, vet everyone you're including to eliminate trolls wanting to tank the rank of other players.
---
Yeah basically I’ll be able to use it in situations where a laptop will simply be too big or in your face 100% on the toilet lol think of times when people are all sitting around in a social setting with their phones out just mindlessly scrolling through Social media I could be grinding mobs :)
---
So, in other words, no there is no way around it, and you can't main tank even with absurd levels of consumables.
---
Druids are hybrids, and they can main tank raids that you out gear / burn consumes on at least.
---
(Hell I'd argue warriors are hybrids too because Fury is viable for dps)
---
I wish they'd given paladins a taunt.
---
Thrall*
---
What's art about that
---
As someone who was about 12 when Vanilla came out, I never got to experience the game in its infancy. My parents werent really into the idea of monthly subscriptions for games back then. WoW has been an on and off thing for me ever since WotlK and I would love to go all out in classic now with a real guild and all my boys back together. Sadly at 25 I am very busy trying to get my life to a decent and comfortable spot. Please enjoy the game for me and all the other people who are now bound by responsibilities.
---
|-|4\/3 |=|_||\|
---
Oh and good luck with your counselling.
---
LOL that's a great idea. Lore wise you can justify anything thanks to the gnome / goblin technology. 
---
At some point they got tired of size jokes and decided to unite their science to make the ultimate joke. So after years of R&amp;D financed by the Noggenfoger elixir money they came up with this Tesla Polarity inverter switcheroo machine and changed the locations of all cities and quest hubs in the world

The list badly needs a proper bis list for prot warriors
---
Classes like Hunter are very broken, game breakingly broken right now. They have been fixing problems like one per week or so but there's just so many problems still. I haven't paid attention to other classes if they're as broken as Hunters.
---
Female Nelf with DW GM Longblades is still my vanilla pipe dream. Just the right size, Claymore is like overcompensating for something.
---
Guy just wanted to tell someone he spent 2k on a pc, is all
---
That’s not the role of a prot pally in a raid environment. They’re add control, not boss tanks.
---
This is what I mean about fundamental misunderstanding. It’s like making a BiS holy/disc priest set with spell damage so they can smite harder.
---
Murloc RPG &lt;3
---
Nah that's retarded, people who do a DHK in raids just make everyone leave the raid and communicate through general chat. I remember that all the time especially high rank players.
---
&gt;I assume if it takes four to five days of /played then this will last me a couple weeks.
---
It takes 4-5 days for an experienced leveler who has leveled to 60 multiple times already. It's going to take you 6-10+ days /played to hit level 60.
---
still no good pvp in ffxiv?
---
Thats a dps wep
---
You’re welcome :)
---
I dont know classic will have little obligations to log on such as silithid farming. 
---
As an emphases on efficiency becomes the norm and popularized bu those at the top end. people will end up logging to do efficient tasks to remain relevant. Even the casual guilds that will have reqs not needed for the content they consume. 
---
We have seen this in most mmos and even osrs efficiency is one of the more important things. People dont dick around anymore. People set goals and timeframes for completing tasks. 
---
I feel we will enjoy the game because of its better more rpg design but we will still play it as efficiently as possible and in turn that means logging on for obligatory tasks.
---
No Classic and Classic with cosmetics shop are equivalent to me. I am not playing WoW in either case.
---
As someone who used a shitty box store office chair provided by my office at work and temporarily a gaming chair at home and unsurprisingly started experiencing lower back pain issues, I couldn't recommend the HM embody more, but I'm sure any on this list along with many others are worth it. Chairs are furniture that will last years, that you also spend multiple hours a day with and they are an investment in your long term health, so don't skimp on it. 
---
The biggest problem with my embody is that I loved it so much after buying one for my work that I needed a second one for home.
---
You get 10% hit with affliction spells, shadowbolt is destruction
---
Roll on a PvP server, and gank low levels. It's far from supporting people!
---
Imagine the income if they could make wow classic for mobile ios and android 😮 It would revolutionise mobile gaming there would be nothing like it although I'm pretty sure I'd lose my job as I'd spend far too long on the toilet on wow.
---
Explain the meme to me. I just don't get it. The context and the usage. I tried looking up at knowyourmemes but I can't grasp it.
---
...I think I'm not with the kids anymore.
---
well this time I know to quit after Wrath
---
still plenty of materials in ER to make a reference, even if you dont get the exact figure. 
---
Subscription, licensing, and other revenues represent revenues from World of Warcraft subscriptions, licensing royalties from our products and franchises, downloadable content, microtransactions, and othermiscellaneous revenues. 
---
So last quarter was 1169m, if wow have only sub 1m player you would get a figure far short of that.
---
Another way is to look at Blizzard MAU for last ER, which was 32 million total. Wow still contributes at least 10% of all atvi revenue due to being categorized as prime game, so very hard to see how blizz can fall below 1m and still retain that prime spot. For reference, OW lost that spot a few ER ago.
---
Obviously these ER is lagging, no way to know for sure what it is now until the next ER. Even if you applied the worst sub drop in history of wow, you would still be far ahead of 1m sub.
---
Anyone who has played the game enough knows what's valuable and what isn't. AH values don't fluctuate that wildly.
---
Regardless, you can't apply the same need/greed rules to a green of the Monkey as you would to Edgemasters or Staff of Jordan.
---
Raids are so easy that there is no requirement for every Pally to go Holy. You will obviously not want multiple Rets in your Raid, but Ret-Specc and Heal Gear is fine.
---
And the Min-Max Nerd Warriors will play DualWield Fury anyways, so they are no competition for 2H Weapons. 
---
You will get your Weapons, no worry.
---
Why would a Warrior not roll on Zin'rokh or a Spinal Reaper?
---
If you're actually concerned about your health (posture, spine, fatigue, circulation, tennis elbow) please don't buy any chair that says "gaming."  Get an ergonomic office chair that you can adjust to fit your body.
---
Just try to be communicative that youre new. Some people, and myself regrettably Can see someone underperform and assume theyre just slacking watching Netflix and trusting to be carried rather than being inexperienced.
---
Being inexperienced in classic is Great, youre at the state of mind we all wish we could regain! Make some friends and do shit that tickles your fancy, If that is leveling, climbing all the games mountains, or becoming a legendary fisher
---
nobody uses 2h as a pve main spec (maybe 1 arms), therefore every 2h should and will be just offspec
---
I've grown to the realization out of the group of people I'm playing with. I can easily beat all of them to 60 but that wouldn't be fun.
---
"Do I have to?"
---
Tiresome non-argument.
---
The amount of times I done this lol
---
Gives parry rating tho
---
Im buying a laptop for when im on vacation and to use a second screen
---
Atiesh.
---
He asked for class+race, not class+spec.
---
Because of human psychology and your refusal to see it from the rls point of view.
---
Rl knows you dont fuck up, Rl knows that Johnny thundercock and his friends fuck up. They use pots, you dont. Rl gets bitched åt, its his Primary job to keep the raid together, he tells you to drink a pot to keep harmony. You refuse. Youre pissed, Johnny thundercock and co is pissed, and the RL is the most pissed of all because hes stuck managing fucking children over a 5 gold investment.
---
And THAT is why you were kicked I'd bet.
---
It's the opposite. Vanilla had a way more permissive API, you can make a 1button macro that will mostly play the game for you, you just had to spam it.
---
The fact paladins don't even show up on the picture is telling...for ret anyway.
---
Depends on the context. Though even in the context of "that f*****g Dutchman made us wipe again", its not annoying.
---
During that PvP segment almost every opponent was trying to run away/escape. His opponents looked like worse players than 2005 Vanilla videos... which is fine if he didn't end that segment with 'I want more of this' while pretending that was some good PvP.
---
Warlocks are pretty good in pvp. The hassle though is having to renew soul shards all the time
---
Are you talking best at all, or inside each faction?
---
Classic wow: the "least" content but the most to do, current wow: the most content but the least to do.
---
A very significant portion of the wotlk playerbase was vanilla players. As in millions. Including myself. There was less than 2 years separating vanilla and wrath. These players did *not* all or nearly all bail with the introduction of MTX. If you go to a subscriber number graph, the release of the  spectral horse mount or w/e it’s called does not coincide with any playerbase dip. 
---
FWIW, I also quit about a month or two into cata, around when they nerfed dungeons and TB quit. But like most who did so, it was clearly because of a bad xpac and the sundering of the world I loved, not because of MTX. 
---
By ratio and absolute number, wrath probably held a lot more vanilla players than classic actually will. Let’s not act like is some special principled quality about vanilla players either. The average player isn’t going to act all that different from the average gaming consumer, and I bet you’d be disappointed by how they vote with their wallet if things like this came up. The community would get up in arms of MTX were introduced, more so than most, but I bet plenty would stay. Depending on what it was - eg WoW tokens - some members of the community would even defend it. Save this comment, lol.

Less keybinds
---
I think when blizz developed vanila they gave half of cool things to warlocks. Pets, summon, eye you can control, health stones, soul stone, fear, curses... warlocks got SO much interesting stuff.
---
Not the case on beta. Staysafe tested this, even with Imp. VW, it still loses aggro to 2 dots and wand.
---
I just heal
---
I can stomach that. If I run a build that isnt shard dependant I can go with maybe 5 per bg which means like half an hour of grinding per day of playing bgs.
---
I am much more worried about gear. E.g. mage is kind of good at any gear level while lock isn't.
---
... I'm not the original dude...
---
Inside each faction
---
This time around I will go for warlock. Free mount at 40 let me go for tailoring and enchantment without worrying about not having enough gold at 40 and I like the support stuff warlocks bring
---
Prob preference. Both really good in pvp and pve. Special mention to dwarf priest for fear ward
---
6 months lol, back in 2007 fresh launch servers already have pug clear 3 months in. Leveling will also be so much faster now that people follow guides and know how to skip noob trap quests. There will be addons pointing arrows for you and mark on map what to kill, with path that can get you to 60 under 6 days. instead o fumbling around on thottbot.

Curious; in pvp what tree did you spec into the most holy or ret? Does anyone do prof for base defence / flag carry?

If you play « tryhard », a lot of classes can play around procs. You can wait for a Crusader proc to use your CD’s for example. Not sure witch one is heavier on that side from the top of my head, sry

Are you sure about a wind serpent in ST having 1.2 attack speed ? I checked on petopia and the only sub 2.0 AS wind serpent is arikara which is actually not tameable in vanilla
---
depends on the tank PWS can be really beneficial for a smart bear. ex. If a bear shifts out and back in to gain rage(from talent) then having a shield can be really nice if they miss time their shift and take a hit in humanoid form.. However PWS is far from an efficient mitigation/heal in most sitations and its use will often be situational highly dependent on the synch between heal/tank. Many warriors will throw a fit if they get shielded even if they had high rage and some people seem to believe its directly impacts threat(it only reduces rage generation). I personally hope to see more bear tanks than history remembers which typically don't get rage starved like at all so PWS becomes a much more viable emergency button(especially since they'll be more sensitive to crush). that said the playerbase is more knowledgable and knowing how to optimize rage generation for warriors will like have a large impact on tank skill levels.
---
I agree, every fricking chair thread someone says don’t get a Dxracer, (which is the worst gaming chair of them all) and recommends a Herman Miller.
---
They are great chairs for work, they allow you to sit comfortably and work. But for a gaming chair I want to lounge, less ergonomic and more lazy.
---
What do you recommend?
---
Probably not, but dresses are BiS until T3. So you might not be very popular wearing T2 chest instead of guardian saint. On Nost I wore head, chest and shoulders T2 just because I fucking love that set. But it was a terrible guild so that's probably why they allowed it.
---
What do you mean about the threat ceiling sorry?
---
So true lol
---
Shoul shards are mostly a problem in pvp
---
Maxnomic is probably the best gaming chair brand.
---
You’ll definitely have a much easier time finding a group for anything as a shaman
---
Same here. Spent around 3k for a complete new setup.
---
I guess I'd play horde races since the horde cities are awful
---
I'm gonna say dwarven priest is #1 on Alliance. That one may be the clearest one.
---
thats not Dalaran
---
How so, if you actually think rogue levelling is slower i have no words. Melee leeway also screws up your hamstring kiting and you do the kiting to save hp for your next pull. Who do you think kills x mob faster? A guy with 2hander that has to kite and time his 3sec auto, or a guy with 2 fast weapons spamming sin strike? I thought it was common knowledge priest and warriors are slowest levellers. Find me a 1-60 speedrun where a warrior beat a rogue, gl

If you repeatedly save jpeg files they become compressed and distorted based on personal computer settings when you save the picture. OP posted a pic that has been saved as jpeg then reuploaded multiple times over multiple PCs
---
Is classic gonna be the new doom? Classic for calculators when?
---
I think it's down to melee or ranged playstyle, and archetypes. I was never fond of the quintessential magician with robes, nor do I prefer ranged over melee, so I'd probably go warrior between the two.
---
Then again, warrior archetype is as plain as the mage one, and he's very dependant on others, so I'd likely pick a third class haha.
---
All 3 are the easiest classes to level with hunter, so wouldn’t worry about that. 
---
Mages will be better dps in raid so long as debuffs are limited on target, then it gets similar. Warlocks will be fewer so prob easier to find a spot. 
---
In pvp, both are good. But both need a pvp spec to do work.
---
This was not in my contract!
---
Bull or Cow
---
Judging from your list, I'd also recommend:
---
\- Planecape: Torment and possibly Torment: Tides of Numenera (haven't finished it yet). P: T has tons of text but probably the most amazing plot I've ever seen in an RPG.
---
\- Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny, for that Infinity Engine style goodness :)
---
\- Torchlight 1 and 2, most fun I've had in a Diablo clone !
---
Also, if you're looking for an old but amazing RPG and don't mind the graphics, try Betrayal at Krondor on GoG.
---
Somehiw when i ask a question with 300+ words i get removed for low effort. But slapping a filter on a 8year old painting and not citing source or author is worth a gold

I love the look of that sword

I believe WoW classic has similarities to cooking. If you wanted a hearty snack, before the convenience of microwaves (WoW Retail) you most likely had to heat or cook your food and maybe learned and enjoyed certain parts of cooking.
---
But now they come take away your microwave and you just might miss the convenience of some modern features of MMO's. It really is just different strokes for different folks

why would that be weird ? how is it different from frenchman or englishman for example ?

You can tell Monica you're having a cheap midlife crisis all you want but when you've been sitting behind the computer for 5 hours and she starts nagging and you go "just one more hour" that's where this becomes expensive.

People really forget how many families this game destroyed back in the day. It's actualy pixeled crack and those who don't play it will never understand how you can dedicate entire weekends to a video game.

You're still going to give it to the warriors and rogues
---
fuck you
---
We have a paladin tank atm and he's doing fine as OT, even tanking bosses sometimes. Huhuran is nice because you can start with the paladin tank and his single target threat is actually quite good as long as he has mana, which lasts about as long as he can survive the stacks, then he just bubbles and throw out some heals the rest of the fight. The primary reason is for AoE threat though. There are few places in raids where that is needed though and it's all possible to tank by warriors, just very annoying and hard.
---
Threat generation is a big concern in classic. Threat ceiling is the amount of damage you can do before ripping aggro.
---
With Blessing of Salvation that aggro ceiling is much higher. It reduces aggro by 30%, meaning you only generate 70% as much... So you can do .3 / .7 more damage (~43% more) before ripping aggro... I think the math is correct lol it's late here.
---
how can you live a life where you have literally no time left for yourself ? sounds awful
---
I think that depends how you look at it. Yes people will obviously clear content a lot faster in terms of /played, but I think the far majority of the playerbase will have a lot less time on their hands, than they had 14 years ago.

$800 on a chair man so sad.
---
For PvP you wear plate, with few exceptions. You can get away with wearing a few pieces of non-plate, but going into PvP with your regular raid healing gear will be an awful experience. Being able to shrug off rogues and warriors is a huge advantage for Paladins and that's not something I'd wanna give up. 
---
I've always valued intellect, armor and stamina way more than +healing and crit for PvP. In fact, I'd probably rather wear a full suit of green BoE "of the eagle"-plate than wear BWL cloth.
---
I really hope you are trolling, hf in 1-30 when missing half your autos and do 0 dmg if you are unlucky with drops. Also the nature of rage-gen relying on your gear vs steady energy regen is significant. You are actually so clueless i hope you’re trolling. Btw ur a shit rogue if you think its Harder lmao
---
Zin'rokh won't be out until Phase 4 when ZG is released. You can get Bonereaver's Edge in phase 1 which is BIS for 2H until AQ40. Then in Phase 3 you can get Ashkandi which is better than Zin'rokh.
---
Hey it did the job just about! Lol
---
You scum bag
---
What do you mean "monetization to stay out of it"?! They're already charging a monthly subscription for a service that you could have for free from private servers!
---
I’d be feeling the same way if they told me to swim from Kalimdor to Narnia you absolute knob jockey. Run away and go play with the buses.
---
Keep in mind that Joana did everything solo + he didnt have ANY rested exp. My last 1-60 run took 5 days and 20 hours while i also leveled alch and herb on the way. But that was with alot of rested exp and help from higher level friends.
---
So a 5 days played is not at all impossible if you level to 60 over the span of say 2 months.
---
But yeah. If you plan to actually experience the game while leveling your played estimation is very realistic.
---
i was just joking, some clown downvoted both of us lol
---
Oh hey look. I asked this exact same thing and it was removed because it wasn’t “about wow” 🙃🙃🙃
---
They are quite good at holding on to the flag, just not the best at getting it back to base. So you can very easily get the flag out of the room and then drop it and the druid takes over.
---
Lol! I love it, thank you, definitely a new consideration that one.
---
I tried it, can't get into it. It feels like a modern mmo where I'm simply not scared of dieing, I can 2-3 shot mobs at low levels and it's just not fun.
---
Im turning 30 this this year, and wow classic and the 2 vacation weeks im taking for the release is a lot cheaper than the motorcycle i bought :)
---
They certainly do get beat out by rogues on Alliance early on.
---
yep
---
I'll roll priest and heal at 60. I'd never play warrior because I hate getting hit. Rogue is fine I guess as I can sneak around stealthed and decide my fights. Warlock is a bit too slow for me, dotting and waiting while voidwalker tanks. Mages need to drink all the damn time and I do that plenty enough as priest anyways. Shamans and their 10 second buff totems... (it's like paladin but for ADHD only). Paladin won't work because I'm horde. Druid is mobile and does everything fine but isn't amazing at anything. Hunter is mobile and fights far but I'll keep an eye whether those bugs get fixed or not.
---
All in all, I'll main priest and possibly have druid, rogue and hunter alt.
---
Good idea. I'll also do just one bump out of this eight ball, too.
---
So now its your chanve to do what youre due xD same as me. Hahahaha. I completely skipped ahn qirraj but then i got up to pathwerk at naxx. Looking forward now to progress through everythingggff
---
Sulfuras though.
---
Duskwood solo lvling, the music and vibe is scary now haha
---
dungeon grinding has never really been worth it if you're talking about leveling
---
Not sure sbout other quests, but as a dwarf hunter I had to go to IF or kharanos from SW/Goldshire for my first hunter quest.
---
Everyone else's battlestations always look so freaking clean and professional, like they're adults with all their shit together.  Mine is a rats' nest of cables and mismatched hardware that looks like a hacker's lair from a movie.
---
You’re doing this with only 2 people and are going to keep pugging the other 3? This will be vastly slower than questing
---
Hunter weapon meme never dies huh
---
Yes, I am talking about leveling. Do you have Beta access, and have actually tested this?
---
I'm fine with it :)
---
If you're not a 100% no lifer like monkey news don't rush to 60. Especially the first time through,  it will burn you out.
---
Wow so is there no pvp until then except for wpvp and duels?
---
This was initially where high elves landed after the sundering, so could do some abandoned ancient High Elven stuff, and it's also where n'zoth is so maybe some old goddy stuff too.
---
How would I do that being 2 hours away from home every day? Take my laptop? What’s the point when I could just do this it’s a lot easier

How about redoing azshara as if it had a content patch like silithus did?
---
Run lbrs for ubrs key.
---
When you take a job, do you do it with the intent of staying there for the rest of your life, regardless of if you decide the job isn’t a good fit, or you find a better gig? When you’re interviewing, would you tell someone “yeah I’m just here to put experience on my resume and earn a paycheck while I look for a job I actually want to do?” Lol nah. If guilds are gonna treat raiding like a job, so will I. It’s a mutual transaction. I heal, I get paid in DKP, I spend my pay as I see fit. And I can quit whenever I feel like it, for whatever reason.
---
Add control situations are so few and far between that taking a prot pally just for this role is not really sensible. I guess that if you really wanted, you could occasionally tell your 30/21/0 pally to put on T2 and spam Consecration, but even that is not needed.
---
Just get something that's breathable (no leather. you'll sweat), and with good lumbar support.  Gaming chairs are a gimmick.  Find something that's comfortable.  Gaming chairs are designed to look nice on instagram and twitch.
---
no, but I played vanilla for its entirety. consensus is that running dungeons is slower
---
Combination of work, baby, a girlfriend and the other things that come with being an adult.
---
The usual (and most successful) way these things are done on "those" servers is via soft reserve. 
---
What is soft reserve? It means that every player reserves one piece of gear before the raid starts. Multiple people can reserve the same item (usually whispered to RL or put in a discord channel). Whenever a soft reserved piece of gear drops then only the people who has it soft reserved rolls on it. If gear drops that no one has soft reserved, then it's rolled main spec over off spec. If you have previously won one piece of gear on MS&gt;OS roll then people who has not won anything yet takes prio over you if they are also rolling, preventing one dude from hoovering up everything with lucky rolls. 
---
Raid leader usually takes every BoE (fair since its a fucking PITA and a lot of work to lead pug raids)  and the bindings are looted to the MT. Some dude has recently completed his TF afrom just pugging and maintaining like a boss. 
---
Sometimes a portion of gold from the BoE stuff is given out to tanks/highest dmg/highest healing, to act as an incentive for people to actually try/get wbuffs before raid/use consumables. 
---
What keeps people from just leaving after getting a piece of gear? Blacklists. Loot'n'scoot is unforgivable in pugs, and these retards should be shunned forever. I once had a guy do it in my AQ20 æpug and then he did it in another pug as well. That gets your ass blacklisted and you will soon find yourself unable to join pugs, because yes these blacklists are shared. This is where the social aspect of WoW comes in and punishes this kind of behaviour. 
---
TL;DR: Make sure you know what you are doing, get solid tanks and keep them, otherwise you are fucked
---
That’s because humans can’t be hunters.
---
I agree it's kinda pointless to call it shit without providing feedback, but at the same time I can't really blame him. The problem is when 1 person tries to make a guide for every class in the game, even though he has only really played 1 class, and probably never even got to naxx with that 1 class either. Everything is going to be off. Sure if 100 different people give him feedback on what is the better setup, then the site can be better, but at that point why not just look at a bis list created by someone who actually plays the class, knows the in depth reasons behind every choice, as well as alternate pieces to wear. When someone puts fist weapons for a class that literally can't equip fist weapons, it's time to stop listening to advice from that person.
---
Honestly if anything comes with adjustable lumbar support you will be fine, mine are just elastic latches that go around the back. I can take off the pillow bit at the top too.
---
That lumbar is awesome though. You can either have it lower down or shove your ass right back into the chair and have it supporting the curve.
---
Felt kinda weird at first but they really help and I have no back pain at all.
---
The back on each of those chairs is way too short and provide no support for your shoulders. I would guess they're made for 6'0" and shorter people.
---
That it doesn't work, since someone always needs either accidentally or on purpose. The all need conclusively solves the BoE problem. And again, greed / need is for dungeons, not for BoEs.
---
Are you only talking about PvE?
---
Eh 37-41 SM Cath is like as high as 30k xp/hr doing farm (5x+ at a time) runs. No way you can make that much in STV questing.
---
&gt;I've tried asking Kargoz on his youtube videos and stream, but he always seem to ignore the question - but as leveling speed is pretty much his niche, I'd love his take on it also if someone manages to get in touch with him on the subject :)
---
​He did a stream recently where he watched that video, took a minute to find it as for some reason he unlists a lot of his youtube stream vods: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/444961189?t=01h09m49s
---
I was only listening in the background, but from what I remember he was unconvinced it was faster than duo levelling or a good levelling class with a well planned route, but obviously it has the advantage of not needing to know quest routes, can't be pvpd etc if you can consistently get 5 dedicated players online at the same time
---
Reschedule your couples counseling for later in September. One week in you’ll barely have started !
---
Both PvP and PvE. But dual wield Fury is better than 2H Fury anyways so I'm mostly talking about PvP.
---
I also played in vanilla, and my /played to 60 was waaay higher back then on any character than it would be today. This is the reason why I'm looking for beta testers to confirm. We sucked back in the day, especially together as a group (at least that's in my case). But after seeing the video from u/hakurai I got interested in the thought - as grinding mobs is a big part of leveling anyways.
---
All I want with this thread, is to actually corfirm it with beta testers.
---
That's not what Ironforge looks like.
---
Top end guilds care about their warriors ranking. If you’re in a casual guild who doesn’t gaf, then yeah.
---
and the remaining 45 levels?
---
I got a super old and low back chair that was just a random chair. Cloth material so much sturdy than any other chair i have see will last forever. 
---
I don't know how a head rest would feel, are they even useful ?
---
Horde just wants everything don’t they. Alliance can’t have anything nice it seems
---
I understood all that. I just disagree with all of you who think rolling need, if you are gonna sell it, is okay.
---
You sweat like a fat man cause they can't breathe.
---
Also, unless you're paying a thousand bucks for your leather chair, it'll just be a thin leather veneer that will flame off over time and look terrible.
---
My general idea was to find 3 likeminded people. So that we would grind the same dungeons over and over with the same group until someone has to go - and then be replaced with another. We have 3 other friends who's planning on going DPS, but they're not sold on the idea of dungeongrinding as it's so much slower than questing on privateservers. It is with this, that I am asking beta testers to verify/bust what the video is saying
---
I hear if you are a big (tall or weight) the hyken material just doesn't handle the weight. Are you lighter?
---
Remote Desktop viewer is an app that allows you to play on your computer while on your mobile phone. No need to take your laptop anywhere.
---
it's a big meme that "we all sucked and didn't know what we were doing back in the days"  
---
not everyone sucked. a lot of people did speculate. consensus is that it's slower. sorry buddy
---
Is this taken from beta? I've seen the mage farms, but I don't count that in as they're twink geared and r1 players.
---
Why do you say ZF is slower? I thought ZF was one of the "go to" dungeons for safe XP, as either way you'll have to grind mobs at these levels - and ZF is filled with mobs.
---
true but I doubt every woyer will have a brie or asscandy, Zinrok is great for those guys that came in late to the party or dont do 40 mans.
---
The guide may not be perfect, he may require help but it’s not like 1 single person knows the intricacies of each and every class at each and every level, as well as all items available at those levels across all the regions. The point here was that the boy asked for guidance, got met with rudeness and despite that OP replied once again asking for help only to receive a message longer than the actual answer would have been that just bashed OP. If you have nothing positive or constructive to say, take it elsewhere. All Fendick had to do was explain why it was wrong, provide a link or two and then OP could have worked and improved from there.
---
It probably would, novelty idea.
---
undead war has that stronk RP value though
---
He /u/wicketywack
---
Thank you. I'll definitely check that out. As we don't have beta access - planning a good route is a hard task, while dungeons is straight forward. We've managed to get good timestamps on 1-10 and working on 10-20, but this is through private servers - which sadly is not accurate.
---
Tonnes of old Naxx screenshots and videos feature world buffs fam. I’ve been looking into this question for a long time.
---
Nice and minimal, like it.
---
&gt; That’s because humans can’t be hunters. 
---
Ok so from that comment I take it that the gnome warlock in my example would be able to pick up the class quest from the goldshire warlock trainer?
---
Greatest? That's a bit of a stretch don't ya think?
---
if you're going deep retri you might as well ignore holy and just use bandage during bubble lol, your heals will be poop!
---
You can have both alliance and horde characters on the same realm? :/
---
We really need RP/PVP server. I do not understand why Blizzard refuses to make just one on each region :-(
---
I think your fps dropped when taking screenshots but I might misremember.
---
Disableing my addons didn't improve my fps by much but it was pretty playable apart from Vael where I'd usually be at 1 fps.
---
I'm actually going the opposite way with classic. I'm just going to focus on playing lots of characters, pvp and 5 manning dungeons with hybrid classes.   It's been nearly nine years since Cataclysm changed the game forever, I'm looking forward to just levelling characters the most now.  I'll probably have a rogue for each race combination, maybe a warrior or two and definitely one of each hybrid class.
---
Not on PvP realms.
---
Undeads have WOTF, that's a Charm break with 5 sec immunity.
---
Druids, Warlocks and Rogues have PVP trinkets that break Charm.
---
Shamans have Tremor Totem, but you usually destroy it while Seduce is casting or use pet macro.
---
Warriors can **NOT** break charm. Berserker Rage makes you immune to Fear/Incapacitate, not Charm, and Death Wish makes you immune to Fear only. 
---
As Destro with Succubus, Warriors are among the absolute easiest class to kill.
---
The hardest classes will be those that have good counters against burst. E.g. Priest, especially healers with Blessed Recovery/Martyrdom when you crit, PWS to absorb burst, and heals to kill your momentum. Frost Mages are harder with Destro too, they have Ice Block and Barrier to negate your burst.
---
I've said it before: people are sleeping on Warlocks just like they did back in Vanilla. Saw a census of the Beta where they came out as the least played class along with Druids, at 8%.
---
Demonology is the absolute strongest build 1v1 in the game, SM/Ruin works well in PVP, and Destruction beyond T2 gear can easily crit 5000+ damage with Soul Fire. That's pretty nasty combined with a spammable CC you don't even need to cast yourself.
---
&gt;Sorry but at some point people just lack the base knowledge needed to have a meaningful discussion about a topic.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I would essentially either need to A) Redo the entire list myself, or B) Write an entire pallytanking guide to explain where he went wrong.
---
&gt;I have neither the time nor inclination to do either of those things, but I do have the time and inclination to let potential pallytanks know that this list isn't good.
---
This guy is going out of his way to create BiS lists in his spare time, and you come here on your high horse spouting BS without contributing? OP is the hero we need, not that we deserve. He doesn't play a prot paly obviously, but he creates lists for *all* classes for easy reference and access. Either stop whining or put in some fucking effort, but too be frank I prefer you do the first, since people like you probably can't make a half decent list in the first place. I hope you get ninja looted.
---
Dxracer is like the chair version of beats by dre. Low-tier overpriced shitty product marketed to dumb people.
---
big if true
---
Then a developer overseeing class design was like - are you really giving them all that shit? Then boom - soul stones were invented.
---
Yes, as long as the race can be the same class as you and it’s part of your same faction you can still pick up your class quests.
---
Race doesn't matter in this case. Why would I include it?
---
I think there are limits. This sounds like a bad call on RL's part.
---
They arent just hiding their server choice for name reservations. They are hiding their choice for as long as possible so they can get ahead of the pack before the spergs/enemy faction spergs try to mess with them.
---
I second PF:KM. My only concern is wether I'll be able to finish it before classic, BIG game.
---
Which was TBC
---
Ashbringer
---
Mandokir's Sting slept on
---
Not to mention the amazing 2% hit shoulders from the 1st boss in UBRS
---
That isn't exactly a paid name change, though, nor would that have been able to happen until *after* server transfers were a thing, not before.

They’re not drops, they’re quest rewards, it only takes 1 successful run

Hi 20 year old me. Enjoy your comfortable slouched pose while gaming because listening to others with back pains for that exact same reason is for suckers.
---
At 28 your first real back pain will pop up but you'll chuck it up to a strain until it gets gradualy worse over the next year and before you do anything about it you'll be 30 years old taking days off from work because certain movements will be completely off limits.
---
If you want to lounge just take the first oversized chair you like and throw yourself on it. If you want to avoid back problems later the smart thing is listening to people who fucked their backs up by sitting like shit.
---
It's up to you in the end.
---
Oh right, apologies.

In my (admittedly terrible) defense I had just woken up and was redditing in bed.
---
Don't phone and post kids.
---
I always thought this would have a range issue but I guess not I’d still rather have a handheld console type contraption over a smartphone or tablet guess I’m old school thanks for the input though :)
---
At 29 I'm starting to feel like this a bit. I've decided against marriage at 24 and focused on my work. Currently I have a semi-successful contracting business which started almost a year ago and just started to realize I have handful of cash to piss of if I want to.
---
I'm just probably going to move to Amsterdam when the time is right.

I thought he meant dwarf males. Daddy titties. 😤😍👅💦💦🍆

EI capping N CP, GET THERE, IT'S THEIR SPAWNABLE!!!

Oki doki

Jobs done...
---
I am in the beta, give me 4 others
---
I must have just been making it up to troll.
---
But bubble has a long cooldown. Even a deep retribution build will need some gear with mana regen. 
---
For me, any spec of paladin are just healers wearing plate in PvP/BGs. My main focus in BGs, no matters the spec of the paladin that I am playing, is healing my teamates and waiting for the rogues to come to me. Once they see a paladin hit them back and understand that do quite a lot of damage, they know they made a mistake.
---
Rolling need on BoE prevents ninja looting. It only needs to happen to you once to feel terrible for not doing the smart thing here and rolling need.
---
Warlocks get a free mount because their spell and pet books cost so much. Unless you completely ignore the skills except for voidy, it costs a ridiculous amount of money to keep the pets up to date.
---
I never said any of that.
---
If it takes you the same time to level to 20 as a warrior as it took you to lvl to 30 as another class. Then you are absolutely crap at warrior. Even if warrior is the slowest, that huge of a difference in leveling speed is ONLY a player issue.
---
Great thanks for the reply.
---
If you're on a pvp server and you don't rush to 60, you're not going to spend your leveling smelling roses, you'll be pushing daisies under a level 60 rogue's boot.
---
That isnt and wasn't the norm ever on any server I've played on.
---
Ch-chandler?
---
Lucky you! Would love it if you were to manage to test it out somewhat :) My way of tackling it would to maybe level two characters to be able to get into RFC and then maybe get to level 20 or so on both characters. One with only dungeongrids and another with questing and grinding. Hard to do without 4 others indeed, as the lower level zones seems dead in beta.
---
Yeah, but then what if they don't equip that 300g item? Gonna take it from em?
---
Man what about pvp? If im 60 warlock how much hit cap do I need? And how many do I need to put in Suppression
---
Thats a weird painting of Ironforge
---
i like kiting,blinking around, freezing etc. big mob packs with a frost mage.
---
I mean, in all fairness i think people check those guides, because All classes feel so different from retail. Plus most classes is like, once you pick them you are stuck to 1 or maybe 2 things you specifically really excell at, so people wants to know 100% for sure what their class is capable of before picking one
---
Combat dagger is on par with sword
---
&gt;Holy damage can not be partially resisted though, either fully resisted or full damage taken, if you are a Paladin or Priest.
---
Isn't that a private server thing?
---
To not take a big fat shit on the thread starters question.
---
And yes, it DOES matter. You responded with something that is off-topic.
---
Nah it's the Azuresong Mageblade which I wielded up to 4HM.
---
The issue is that the 'bugs' Alexensual talks about are simply things that are different from his experience on private servers. 
---
His opinion on anything Classic related (or unrelated) is trash.
---
No, that's how it was in retail classic
---
No It's on topic. Any race that can be priest can use that and be great at PVE, and PVE. I'm assuming the OP isn't stupid enough to not understand that.
---
Classic won’t be cheap. Sure the price tag if $15 a month is low, but it’ll cost much more.
---
Wowhead, while not perfect, clearly has it labeled as a tanking item.
---
Yeah mine is like fake leather and mesh in the middle of the back it's a lower chair. There's no way I could have that High headrest

fyi; you can queue up your next blizzard while you are casting the first one. just press it to get the aoe marker up and click it as soon as the first one is finished :)
---
If you view your game as a job, you feel yourself forced to do (unless it is e.g you're a content creator) you should maybe stop playing fir a while, no matter of classic, retail or any other game.
---
Richest class
---
Hell yeah.  I'm going warlock this time I love with 1 to 35 after my rogue maxed. Too much fun love the post
---
So many cool classes are nightmare for an altoholic like me, god damn.
---
Hell yeah love this post. I'm going warlock this time. I leveled 1 after I maxed out my rogue .
---
I'm going to play protection paladin, I don't care if they are not very good at raids, inefficient or slow at leveling, it's what feels right for me.
---
I'll be getting a ZG bat once ZG opens. 1.0 attack speed, dive, and screech.  Shame they lost their movement speed =/
---
You should try to not get hit. I did 11 gnolls at that location at your level. If you had just 1 or 2 more mobs, youd die there.
---
Prisms are able to separate white light into their individual colours because each wavelength of light moves at a slightly different speed through the glass medium. 
---
Unfortunately, Rets wheelchair moves so slowly through the prism that it becomes internally reflected within the prism. It’s forever trapped - unable to escape.
---
I think that it's more likely we will see microtransactions of Classic fails. The success of the game is predicated on them not being in the game, so I think if it brings in a bunch of subs they can justify leaving well enough alone. 
---
But if it fails I feel they're going to want to bleed it dry for every cent they can get.
---
I have had 2 steelcase Leaps and 1 Embody. Both great chairs. Gave the embody to the wife. The leaps and Aerons can be found at most office liquidation stores, and I would highly recommend buying used.
---
What else would we be called?
---
I usually go into the middle of the pack when i use Frost Nova just to make sure I get all of them with it. The range is probably bigger than i am assuming though, so i will try from further away. Thanks for the help :)
---
He didn't ask for "great", he specifically asked for BiS in terms of class-race combos.
---
How is that a compromise? Soul stones are one of the awesome bits of being a warlock.
---
And make your name, and your pet's name something like Illiliiliilili
---
Nah man. You’re just wrong. Fury warriors sit to proc enrage. That doesn’t work on retail servers. Do some research.
---
Even though I am not a fan of daily content, I gotta admit, that personally for me the sunwell isle in BC was the thing that happened in terms of open pvp so far.
---
I am not sure if it was explicitly designed for that, or if it offered enough space to explore it.
---
Unlike the blizzard approved fun that is Retail.
---
Definitely, I was just not ready to give up my Fel Infused Leggings which took me so long to get while I was still king on trash and top/mid on bosses.
---
Ofcourse I know better now. :)
---
Deep vois?
---
original version had +sword weapon skill on it making it BiS for sword rogues and warriors in offhand
---
I lvled exclusively in SM from 30-40 on the beta. We had 30-45k xp/hour. We were 3 mages, 1 warlock and a healer. Around 37 we switched a mage out for a warrior with the ravager axe and did SM cath only. Its blazingly fast.
---
You just don't know what you're talking about. A lot of classes used dungeon gear and even quest gear in t4/ t5. Not to mention crafted gear that required primal nethers or badge gear that required more dungeons... And killed theorycrafting? The addition of gems, haste, armor pen and raid comps to name a few, certainly killed the complexity of vanilla wow.
---
And I answered him. I already said I assumed he could figure out that I meant any race. Why don't you ask him if he understood my meaning instead of attacking someone who had good intentions.
---
Eyes of the Beast.
---
classic has fixed the consume as u can shift consume shift in one button within a global
---
How do you keep them up to date?
---
Tbh, ogrimmar is a clusterfuck of a city. Undercity is the best vanilla horde city, past that, silvermoon I adore.
---
The Star Carft II cinematic is called Fire and Fury, his name in on the dog tag of a fallen marine.
---
It's hard to find in decent quality, but there's a link to the cinematic here:

I couldn't sack because I was providing imp for the soak group, bloodvine is my bad yes but Vanilla was a different time.
---
The downside of being a cloth caster with zero mobility spells is pretty unattractive though.
---
its what they say yes... question is if they really keep the word. I do not believe today Blizzard.
---
Check out the big brain on Brett
---
It doesn't matter what he understood. Answering "any race" is off-topic when his question is about which 1 race is the best.
---
Also, "attacking"? You think this is attacking? Grow up.
---
I promise to give Hunters a chance. I'm keeping an eye on you though.
---
Why don't you pull the panties out of your ass and quit stressing over what other peopel are discussing.
---
Atleast you dont have to grind necklevels for all alts. I was an altoholic before bfa  now I barely log in.
---
Hehe it's addicting watching classic clips. No doubt a good grind spot for mages at that level. 
---
 I would think though that in order for aoe grinding to work you really need to be ahead level wise considering how many players there will be. Otherwise you are not going to find complete packs of mobs like this but instead have to resort killing them one at a time. Maybe layering will make it possible I guess even if you haven't leveled crazy fast and left most players behind.
---
warlock master race
---
You can eat with stealthed as a rogue the same way a NE does it with Shadowmeld lol
---
I had dial up until halfway through cata because the only other option was unfeasibly expensive satellite... Then dsl came to the area, but it was from a company based in Florida and they didn't dig the lines below the freeze point so no internet sometimes for days at a time and definitely not at night during winter in upstate N.Y. (which means half the year). They've apparently fixed it now but I moved 5 years ago (I had to relearn how to play as I went from 400-1000ms to 15).
---
I've never played original WoW and am a fairly casual player of MMOs and trying to understand classes and the traits/talent tree system is pretty confusing at times. 
---
What's worse is the perceived meta it feels quite limiting. Personally I've had an interest in feral DPS, but have read that this is "not optimal" at best and downright useless shit at worst.
---
It would suck to be peer pressured into not just a class but a spec within one too just to have a higher chance to participate.
---
Still gonna play holy priest.
---
And i mean if and when we get a TBC realm people will deal with melee being unwanted and the stacking of hunters warlocks and shamans.  
---
It's not balanced but it's how it was.
---
I've a low table and I sit on the ground. No chair at all. Makes it easy to fall back and roll about.
---
Armor is extremely powerful for tanking and PvP. Besides that, only stats matter
---
Where else would I store them?
---
Anyway, this convo is probably done for the both of us. Have a nice day.
---
But it is not Ironforge
---
Tbh, nothing ever worked smoothly in classic, and it was bug infested, I don't especially care unless it is game breaking bugs.
---
Truer words have never been spoken.
---
jiu jitsu is a way better midlife crisis. I don't fully understand the mechanism, but it seems that practicing murdering people for 6-8 hours a week makes you a much nicer person. Monica will secretly think it's hot, too.
---
Sure. I still have no fucking clue why you bothered to respond in the first place. It had absolutely nothing to do with anything you could possibly be affected by.
---
Been a priest since I started at the start of TBC, only fitting I main a priest in classic
---
So anecdotal retail evidence?
---
and they probably don't need them to be alive right now
---
They set a limit on spells usage with something else than cooldowns, that's the compromise.
---
Is this a troll? U can't exchange gear once you loot it to someone it is theirs. If he picks it up it is bop to him. There is no trade window.
---
You should count that in. They are making it seem way harder than it is. And they did it poorly too. See my other reply.
---
It usually spawns at the bottom of another boat, but for a free bag that takes you into 3 other areas for exploration -- it's worth it.
---
Is that BFA I see? I feel so sorry for you already.
---
&gt; Unless you completely ignore the skills except for voidy
---
Which is what you should do. Only buy voidwaller skills until 60, then buy the max rank spellbooks for whatever demon you use in dungeons/raids.
---

I’m very into wPVP and won’t mess with cities and towns because of them, they were a horrible addition to the game.

Thats gonna get you killed on larger pulls. So try over and over til you get a feel of the range of frost nova. Also dont blink at the start. You dont need to and it costs a lot of mana.
---
Also get the increased range talent in frost as that affects the frost nova and blizzard size.
---
You have to buy books from the Demon Trainer NPC and use them to learn new ranks of pet spells.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?search=grimoire#items:0+5+1](https://classicdb.ch/?search=grimoire#items:0+5+1) 
---
To buy all the books from 1-40 costs 18g 30s, without accounting for honoured discount. That's just pet books, not class spells.
---
I hope you know how different the score screen is.. I’m pretty sure it doesn’t even show damage done
---
Why would I mean soul shards?
---
Yeah, that's true. Aside from a few key pickups like Seduction, and Spell Lock, it's really pointless to buy post pet spells.
---
You can play feral dps and hit top 10 dps or even be the best on some fights. If you're a team player on top and willing to off tank, collect a heal set and decurse/toss some heals out on certain fights, and put insane out of raid time in farming mcps as regular consumes, you will be an asset to a team. If there is a single lazy bone in your body and you want to melee dps just go rogue or war
---
Yeah, I can see that you have no clue. Don't worry about it, it happens to everyone at times :)
---
Grad marshal vs pvp vendors.
---
If you decide to grind rank 14 that has a lot of prestige. If you don't, that is fine, because nobody expects you to grind it out.
---
Pvp vendors in bc offered you decent gear for low effort, which makes you look bad for having blue dungeon gear.
---
To be honest, both systems have its weaknesses, but the daily system is inherently flawed.
---
If they were to introduce daily boosts like the rested bonus that is non binding, that would be great.
---
For me it would be feral druid. You are a complete package and very strong both in PvE and PvP. Can do anything. Best tank imo until endgame( easy to hold aoe threat, can regrowth and rejuv yourself before pulls, cc with hibernate beast etc). You can heal dungeons as well just keep a healing set in your bank. You can stealth and avoid ganks. At level 21 you will have +30% movement speed in cat form. You have travelform as well making getting a mount not such a massive deal if you miss it. They are just great. 
---
 Last one I played was on a private server. Had a fantastic time until I hit level 60 were I didn't enjoy going resto spec. There are hybrid specs though that can work for both farming and raiding but if you want to be the best you can be you need to go resto.
---
Weird.. thats not Ironforge.
---
thats a cool goal actually, something fun to do every now and then when you cant be bothered farming or whatever
---
This is the response of an idiot.
---
Not you, the guy above and below you haha
---
yeah warlock is awesome. all the abilities and pets. the low mobility is covered by their tankiness as a clothie. only annoying thing are the soul shards.
---
That item got me depressed, I hoarded dkp for 8 months with 100% attendance because another warlock was riding my ass, never saw it drop and our guild disbanded. 
---
The next week there was a PUG BWL with 80% of the guild and it dropped... I rolled a 1.
---
Sadly I have hundreds of stories like this, my lootluck is tragic.
---
I’m seeing so many people get bogged down in YouTube poop man. Literally pick a class they’re all fun and have different strengths and weaknesses. That’s one of the things that was great about vanilla.
---
Don't forget their class mounts
---
I don't really see how alt-tabbing would do this. Can anyone explain?
---
In holy, Paladins are the most mana efficient healers in Classic and are required for their buffs and auras in raids. 
---
In Prot, they can effectively tank most dungeons. 
---
Ret is viable for questing.
---
Why would anyone go Fury for Raids? That completely gimps you in PvP. While 31/20 is Solid for everything!
---
Agreed, dwarf hunter &gt; shadow meld any day of the week for pvp
---
Interesting idea, might be worth for the commute to work and back and my breaks.
---
I am currently thinking about farming timbermaw on more than one level 19 char.
---
So there is that. 🌝
---
The overplayed classes are the « meter » ones. Stuff like rogue and furywarr. 
---
Any healer will find a spot in raids, as changing spec is expensive and a lot of people would rather dps for pvp/farming/fun etc.
---
Okay that sounds pretty nice, thanks dude
---
Not play FFXI instead
---
Peel off the white thing in the case and it will be perfect! Love hoe simple and efficient it is, love the map on the wall!! 10/10 good sir!
---
what is that hearthstone?
---
Playing Night elves in Tirisfal would feel really awkward...
---
The super soaker is the best
---
Still gotta have time for yourself, trust me.
---
Orc for the Bloodfury
---
Ah ok. Fuck managing soul shards again, I'm going warrior this time around.

---
such as...?
---
If you enjoy tanking you should go warrior. You will do a lot of that even if you eventually plan to be a fury raid warrior. Also since they are not as good as a mage solo it might lead to you being more social instead of grinding away on your own. I had planed at first to roll a warrior but now I think I will go lock. I liked the idea that if I rolled warrior it would probably lead to me getting to know more people. As a lock for example the class is so good leveling solo that I might play more alone. Would be same with a mage.
---
Umm.. didn’t they say they trade BOP items the first 2 hours in raids? Also not all items in MC are BOP, most are BOE on trash mobs
---
Yeah. I hate arenas because it's the Call of Duty of game modes. Rated BGs are great tho.
---
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
---
Enjoy your day :)
---
Well it's a good thing we aren't talking about things that Blizz would or should add and are talking about total fantasy class/race combos.
---
You win to fill up a bar with an RNG reward.
---
That's the weridest interpretation of Ironforge I've ever seen.
---
Lol, wut?
---
Is the holy reach talent (+ holy nova aoe) necessary for a priest healer? I found a guide that claimed 21/30 for a priest provides the most healing but it had 1 in holy reach and 2 in renew. Was wondering why.
---
Both dungeons and raiding can be a challenge, if you can't change your sleep schedule going very late to bed, then I wouldn't recommend it.
---
Latency is not that big a deal, the game is made to be playable on hihg ms, and americans have played just fine on EU pservers for years.
---
I, actualy, kinda OK with soul shards. I just want so we could stack them, at least in 10 items stack, and it'll be perfectly fine.
---
Finally a decent reply. I don't, and I hope you have a good evening.
---
That video by hakurai uses Warrior the slowest solo leveler to compare EXP values. Also to grind to 60 that's going to be *a lot* of dungeons. If it ends up being slower than questing your looking at 120-300+ hours of just pure low level dungeon grinding.
---
Sure. If you want to play on NA you can play on NA. Like you said though, raid times won't be perfect for you, although there will probably be guilds that will do raids on EU accessible times. Latency will be worse, that's something you'll learn to live with, but it's far from ideal.
---
Riiiiight, and that happens like every...... never.
---
Yeah, if you want to AoE grind as a Mage, you're gonna have to try super hard to get ahead of the pack level wise. Once you're ahead and you have uncontested packs, you can stay ahead pretty easily.
---
They have mech suits in a backpack that pop out and transform into the shape of a bear/cat and the gnome controls it from the inside..
---
Malalath was definitely one of my favorites. Looked pretty awesome in my offhand as a gnome warrior paired with thunderfury.
---
Or shamans, so it was probably a faction neutral post.
---
* Delegate.  This will help you to keep it from taking over your life.
---
* Have an officer for every role (caster/tank/melee/healer/hunter)
---
* Have individual officers to handle recruitment, loot system, website/discord, grievances, etc.
---
* Make sure that you have two officers trained for every important task so that one departure doesn't cripple you.
---
* Over recruit.  Don't wait until you need a class, keep an extra or two on your roster. It's better to have a list than to not be able to raid that night.
---
* Any guild that intends to raid, but not at the cutting edge of content, needs to be prepared to lose  a steady stream of their best and brightest.  It's not their fault really, nor the guilds that headhunt them.  It's just that they want something your guild can't give them.
---
* Have a set, and specific, application process.
---
* Use a DKP/EPGP/SK system and not loot council if you want to keep drama down.  People are more likely to walk away from a guild if they think favoritism is going to keep them from ever getting loot than they are if they are sitting on a mountain of DKP/good ratio/high priority.
---
* Make a website, and a discord server.
---
* Hold officers, and yourself, to the same rules, and standards as everyone else. Including their conduct outside of guild chat/raids.  That guild tag means they represent all of you, not just themselves, and any ninjaing/ksing/trolling/etc that hurts their reputation will also hurt yours.
---
* Have a clear grievance procedure, overseen by at least two officers, so grievances against officers can also be handled fairly.
---
There are other countries where adding -man is deemed offensive, I’ll let you figure them out.
---
Kittens from Stormwind
---
Heroes of Might and Magic III - Very hard campaign to complete if you haven't played the game before, as the entire map is covered in darkness and you have to explore blindly (except for some hints if you listen to the story), should keep you busy till Classic.
---
I’m not sure if I want to play shaman or warlock right now, I want to do some “medium-core” raiding and pvp on the side. 
---
Obviously warlock would be forsaken, but for the shaman, I’m not sure what race I should go. I plan to play ele/resto spec.
---
There is a spec, but it isn't viable.
---
Can't we all just get along?
---
Are these quotes still in game? Please let them still be there, pretty sure they're not vanilla though.
---
Way worse, 2h suck on alliance.
---
Do you have a good vid of someone doing 10+ consistently? I kind of want to see more examples in case i roll mage.
---
Questionable, but not terrible, gear choices for some of these sets (read: things have been updated a lot in the recent weeks) and fairly poor mana management overall. Also, 100% SV?
---
Zoomers are the reason the gaming industry is so garbage right now. There's a reason they're called that, and it's because they're all ADHD squirrel-chasing windowlickers. My 9 year old brother is no exception.

Soupasoka, a mod here and a great youtuber has a 1-60 leveling series on YouTube

I'd be interested to see what the raw dps of a BiS geared Boomkin with all buffs and boss debuffs looked like when stacked against other top dps classes.
---
You have a very skewed image of the average player
---
Tauren priests.
---
Racial ability 1: A sun beam shoots out of the Tauren's hands, healing those in a cone in front for x health (basically a healing version of cone of cold)
---
Racial Ability 2: Fear Ward, so horde can have it too.
---
you spelled axe wrong
---
except boomkins?
---
I only have 4 classes to choose from because I have my heart set on rolling Tauren
---
I counter back with the worst gf ever and an appropriate freakout

https://youtu.be/jgGu5-Z6D2E
---
deciding for somebody else whether their upgrade is more valuable than the gold value is wrong
---
they can make their own decision and roll greed if they decide they would rather have gold
---
Cool I'll check it out. I dont plan on leveling with others much for launch and I want to see that instead of the duoung that I see mostly.
---
Better than no representation my friend, also they are talking about messing around with mobs, not the aspect you described.
---
Aslong as you're prepared for the occassional Canadian to say Canada is the best place to live and then a subsequent mob of americans raging in chat you'll be fine. Raid times won't be to much of a stretch just poke around the guild thread I myself work nights(so ill be looking for an early aftnoon raid) as I'm sure a hefty number of other players do so there should people to play with at all times but you might have the advantage in grabbing resources at low pop times which will give you quite an edge. Latency I played GW2 on an EU server for a time and while noticable at high traffic times it was far from crippling, modern tecnology has eased this substantially and with artificial spellbatching windows you'll nptice it even less.
---

What is the best class and race for easy lvling, fast traveling etc?
---
I  just want to have fun, i dont care about late game stuff,raiding i want  to spend more time reading quests, lvling professions, have easy time  beating mobs. I want to enjoy classic for its world, quests,  social  features not grinding and running for hours.
---
heresy

Not from the beta no. But i did consistently kill 8-12 mobs at a time.

Don't worry about any of this.  Wait for classic.  Log in and enjoy the journey.  You'll be putting in a lot of time with your character and everything will start to make sense by the time you hit level 60.  There is also a ton of information available to you now that we did not have in vanilla.  Most players won't be speed leveling, those are the minority.
---
Paladin
---
Of course they do, they literally take a critical hit on purpose and take 2.5 times more damage, are you dense. Yes they get enraged by it but the side effects are much worse than partying a bit more.
---
Tis life and death itself, not only a sleek staff but two great looks in one.
---
a raid without shadow weaving? poor soul, you have my pity.
---
Warlock too slow? Do you even wow?
---
City raids are unplayable lag, and by the way, we crashed the world servers twice on beta Thursday morning in STV with 40 alliance vs 25 horde.
---
Shouldnt be an issue with shapeshifting
---
You need to up your reading comprehension. They sit and take the crit on purpose, which is much more damage than a few more parties will EVER do. You people are fucking dumb as shit
---
I was like, well since you actually recognized him when he said Gravius then he might actually be real, then I realized that name is on the fucking photo. Are you dense ofc it's a troll....
---
Because they spend an hour cleaning it and raking the photo st an angle that show it perfectly.
---
Given it an hours gaming and it will look like he'll again.
---
CTRL + F

"Skyrim"
---
"Zero results"
---
You people sicken me...
---
Chicken feed. It can be a good source of early gold for alliance toons
---
Careful that there might be an inertia effect. Social erosion is not instantaneous (for a while your pals will still be online).
---
As the problem takes some time to become visible, players don't realize directly that something is wrong. 
---
Once they do, it is already too late for the devs.
---
If you think about it, Warrior is the only „true“ hybrid in a sense that it can fill two pve roles. Not to mention that it exceeds in both.
---
Unlikely as they could have someone reviewing them all day and flagging actual bugs.
---
It's the bekant series from ikea.
---
You can get it either with or without electric engine for raising and lowering it.
---
Costs about $120 for the version without engine and $400 with it.
---
I might still have a Radeon 9800 Pro for your build
---
That's basically already the case with Badlands.
---
Its some video sharing thing
---
At least get an ultra wide curved monitor then. Op certainly has the space.
---
I had no idea. This is awesome. Thanks!
---
I disagree, nearly everything in mythic raiding comes down to gear, ilvl, tiny dps/hps %s just look at the kind of prep Method does and how "unkillable" some bosses are pre nerf like Fetid Devourer, Wow is not a skillful game when it comes to PVE.   
---
Mechanics are fundamentally not HARD to do, some people might have a hard time multitasking both pushing the limits of your DPS/HPS at the same time as doing the correct mechanics but its really not hard, its not a very skillful game to begin with and it was never ment to be, WoW is a casual MMORPG where players themselves are the content, or thats how it used to be...  
---
Casuals with luck can get similar gear to people in method but the differance really shows in Neck lvls and theorycrafting (which doesnt matter cuz people just copy what they do anyway)   
---
The system of Vanilla and maybe TBC (but mainly vanilla) where Items are static and not purely "ilvl" based with an easy to predict stat distribution is much preferred where items like Lionheart Helm is the best helm until TBC basically due to massive Hit Crit and STR , or Onslaught belt which is from MC and still BiS until i believe Naxx where u get Girdle of the Mentor.  
---
Its shitty because in retail the progression is so much similar to diablo seasons where every patch they raise the ilvl and you change all of your gear eventually, you're just playing each patch like if it was a diablo season and everything was wiped and u start over. and thats really shitty.
---
heal through raids on weekdays then shadow life on weekends.
---
Dont they have zero mobility in classic? Sure you can dot up all the things and life drain, but moving slow can be painful for some.
---
Same here
---
Maybe I’m crazy but I’m actually looking forward to farming mats for alchemy and cooking
---
Any class you pick can be useful and fun. Not necessarily and spec :)
---
You don't *have* to be optimally efficient. The game is about having fun. Have fun.
---
+1 Grim dawn
---
"hey i wana do rank 14 as retri can i get this 2h?"
---
its the same as a warri says that .nobody will say no. its not like warrys get them shoved up there ass if they dont plan on using them
---
Warlocks might have low mobility except for the free mount, yet they still manage to be faster than most other classes.
---
ye they dont have mobility but they get free mount at 40 just like paladins, theyre still one of the fastest lvlers in the game most people say theyre 2nd after hunter and druid 3rd. Theyre incredibly strong in PVP and really useful in PVE/Raids (their damage scales crazy after a while but struggle with hit % pre ZG patch)
---
They also allow you to hold onto peoples' souls.
---
That one rogue who ganked you in STV, when you get him back a few levels later, you steal his soul and you have to put that Soul Shard in the bank so he can stay in purgatory for the rest of time.
---
Paladins can assume any role in a 5-man, although Retribution can't compete with pure DPS classes.
---
In PVP they're among best support classes: BOF, BOP, BOS to negate many CC's, strong dispel, high armor, mana-efficient.
---
Paladins definitely shine in groups though. Since most their abilities are reactive or passive, they're not very dynamic for solo play, and their offense consists mostly of auto-attacking. Because of this, they're notoriously boring to level. On the other hand, you'll have an easier time finding dungeon groups, and gearing a Paladin is easy since they occupy a niche: Mail/Plate and Shields that are not physical-oriented are almost exlusively yours.
---
There are pros/cons to every class, but picking a hybrid if you're casual seems like a solid choice. Paladins are definitely not useless.
---
I think you still can but it would take a lot of work. Because you can have multiple accounts linked to a single battle net ID. So one account goes horde and the other goes alliance.
---
Implying you aren't running Destro/Demo imp spec while leveling!
---
from pservers/vanilla is fine if it's the same technique
---
I don’t think they need more people testing the 1-40 content.  They don’t want 40-60 content to compete with the 8.2 raid about to come out.  
---
The classic release date seems to be strategically placed 7 weeks after the new raid opens up.  
---
The beta will last at most 4-5 weeks after the raid opens.  
---
There is not a window friendly to retail streamers to increase the cap again.  Maybe I’m wrong.
---
How the fuck is Esfand pulling the DPS he is on the beta right now?
---
I would also recomend even when your on CD a well placed Pyro can steal you some kills on rooted/slowed enemies.
---
The only place for money shops is in a game like PoE, where that's a way to support the devs because their game is free to play.  And even there it's purely cosmetic.
---
MMO's on the other hand have players that value their appearance, not only because it looks cool, but because it shows others you killed badass bosses to get it.
---
This in turn makes the new players passionate about wanting to be that guy and keeps them in the game for a long time. Shops where you just pay to look like that devalue the experience and mean nothing in the eyes of others.
---
Have most people been hitting the bong a little too hard?
---
Warlocks are OK levelers, top 5, but not second. That's Hunters, with Mage number one by a mile.
---
Yes, I know that. But I have seen Paint.net on fresh Win10 installations. I thought it is shipped with it.
---
Holy paladin is also the best PvP healer in the game. Although horde arguably has better PvP racials, alliance is generally better in organized PvP just because holy paladins are so amazing.
---
Reserves will happen and nerds will find a way to sell UBRS boosts.  count on it.  
---
Hopefully they fail, boost sellers are what ruined retail.  Rated BG’s, Arenas, Mythic+, all ruined by the best groups collecting US Dollars from people to progress.
---

---
all you need man
---
Is this much slower? Because it sounds like a more fun option.
---
Good.
---
It's a big game, don't make it all about how well you might do in end game raiding.
---
The WSG jumps seem to work fine in the beta from what I have seen from streamers.
---
I have not watched any videos of AV,though. Are you sure they are not in there?
---
I just recently got my heart set on hunter. They are the most time efficient class and between kids and work that its the most important factor for me. Doesnt hurt that i can go out of my way taming pets and thus adding a tiny bit of content. Also, night elf with shadowmeld is going to be a godsend when i randomly have to afk to tend to the kids.
---
Yeah. As if running to MC back in the day required skill.
---
Yea. It's too slow paced gameplay for me. I don't want anything super intensive button smashing but casting siphon life and corruption and waiting gets very repetitive and but boring. Especially if it's all the same while both leveling and at 60 (unless you start raiding and cast shadowbolts only). Slowly rotting enemy away isn't my playstyle. I like healing as it's like a minigame of its own. Warlocks are amazing and have tons of tricks but it's not my class
---
Yeah, that's why I'd love to get some real data on the matter before starting :) My friend is a warrior, so if it would speed up his leveling while slowing down mine, I'd be fine with that.
---
well theres that
---
World record 1-60 was set by a Hunter..
---
afghanisman? ameriman? meximan?
---
Depends on what level range you're in. If you can stay ahead of the curve and keep the mobs you're killing about 1 level below you, its the best way to level. 1 shadowbolt followed by 4 imp 1s firebolts + shadowburn is pretty low mana and high damage.
---
Imps unfortunately run out of mana quickly though. Its indisputably the best for PVP though. Nobody expects the imp burst.
---
If I dueled my imp 1v1 I would probably lose to it. 1s cast time, increased dmg from demonology, so much kickback on spells, and they cost no soul shards!
---
My favorite thing to do was use Unending Breath in Southshore, swim out to the ocean, then just send waves of imps after people questing for Murlocs. That guy got me so many HKs!
---
I believe this is referred to as having "good taste".  Something those dirt dwelling heathens don't understand.
---
You can dot while walking.  Mobility.
---
Play any colour you like..
---
cheers dude :)
---
There used to be an add on like this in Wotlk but it was quickly shut down by Blizzard.  It was making raid encounters trivial by 'painting' on the ground telling you where to stand, where to move etc.
---
&gt;But to answer you about the "we sucked" part - go look at any video from that time, and tell me how much nonsense people were doing. 
---
"Everyone sucked back in the day" is the biggest meme I've ever seen for WoW. I've played this game since launch. There will always be a lot of players that are mediocre at the game. It's like this is every video game. 
---
For example if you look at the CS:GO rank distribution you will see 31.95% of the players are Silver. A good CS:GO player would consider Silver to be the lowest of the low. 34.68% of the player base is Gold Nova which isn't much better than Silver. So 66.63% of the player base would be considered mediocre by a decent CS:GO player and CS has been out for 5 years longer than WoW has. The rest of the player base would be considered okay to pretty much Shroud.
---
It requires time to improve in any video game anyone players. You don't just pick up a game and instantly become a good player unless the game involves no skill. There were many good players however most of the good players put in tons of time into the game.
---
https://youtu.be/DgV-FPWuWQk
---
This mage is still looked up to today. In 6 months most of the mages you see won't play anywhere near this good.
---
Hunter or Druid i would say. Both can solo lvl easily and has speed increasing abilities:
---
Hunter - Aspect of the Cheetah (increasing movement speed by 30%) - learned at lvl 20
---
Druid - Travel form (allows you to travel 40% faster) - learned at lvl 30
---
Voidwalker + Affliction is fast as fuck. Other lock specs run out of mana or don’t have the tanking capabilities.
---
bugs in beta? Big Brain?  
---
Brain Bugs?! Frankly, I find the idea of a Bug that thinks offensive!
---
Share whatever you’re smoking mate. Mage is like fourth behind hunter, lock, druid.
---
I wonder what server first on virtually every pserver after vanilla was.. Hm...
---
But I've always played priest!  #NOCHANGES
---
More sensible than having a pally boss tank.
---
15 years ago, the record was set by a hunter. Since then, Mage has been server first on virtually every pserver that mattered (and attempted to be blizzlike).
---
You will see good mages dominate leveling speeds in classic if melee leeway and blizzard delay is fixed.
---
Herbing and mining combo, just sell sell sell
---
[You have a lot to learn young Padawan!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O_pNDc73MM&amp;feature=share?t=11m03s)
---
holy fucking shit  
---
no, not 'any' race is bis with the spec you listed. dwarf would be better than human, undead over troll.   
---
christ
---
My Rage fury MAXX was still completely capable of playing Starfleet Command 1/2/OP...Even if I didn't upgrade to Diamond 2d/3d, then to dual 1950 XTX a few years later.
---
Pservers have dynamic respawns which make aoe farming easier. We'll see how it goes on classic
---
This may get tl;dr so if you skip over me that's cool.
---
Kind of stumped on what to roll when classic goes live - i've got a varied history with the game up until 2011 when I more or less quit (came back once in 2014 but it didn't stick with me so I bailed after a month). I mained an offtanking fury warrior through '06, had a priest on the side after giving in to the Shadow hype, but hunter had been my first 60 while playing with online/irl friends. I was late to join TBC and wanted to play a prot paladin for tanking and AOE after binging on wowhobbs videos, but after befriending a druid and priest couple who tanked + healed, I had to stick to dps. Then during wrath I couldn't get into raids as ret (go figure), so I ended up being a healer through all the 10man content (normal, some H modes) since I'd given up on tanking at the time. Had a rogue alt too which was pretty fun, and took to the class well.
---
Till now I've dabbled in pservers over the years, but I suffer from altitis and never got to the endgame. I think the closest I've gotten is on hunters, but burnout and RL get in the way so I'll hop from class to class and get kinda frustrated with myself at the whole thing. With classic finally coming I've convinced the same friend who got me into the game to come back, and since they're interested in leveling a shadow priest I figured rolling warlock was a no brainer, but now I'm not so sure? Warrior-priest are still an iconic duo (the problem is I don't feel confident enough to tank anymore, even 5mans), but I hear good things about paladins (we're Alliance) and to a lesser extent, mages? I'm stuck on which Horde alt too though I've narrowed it down to probably shaman or rogue I guess.
---
It's all pretty confusing! I'd love some fresh insights if possible, compelling cases for X class or whatever.
---
TL;DR mostly-melee, sometimes healer, weirdly-interested-in-hunters(?) player doesn't know which Alliance class they want to play with their priest friend. Maybe warlock? Maybe not?? Thanks for reading.
---
World firsts were 15 years ago, classic is just sloppy seconds. There’s been guides and strats for all of the content for over a decade and people smashing through it on private servers. Anybody competing for “first” at this point is mentally deficient.
---
To be fair, Classic also has dynamic respawn, just at a slower rate. I doubt we'll se sub 3D played times, but Mage will without a doubt be first.
---
Depends on PvE vs PVP.
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!! DRAMA MUTCH?
---
...Go jump off a cliff.
---
That seems like it could work. Many players want rare pets I guess. So basically you would just sell the chicken feed in booty bay? I guess it's dependent on horde players knowing that the chicken feed will get you a chicken pet. Seems a bit obscure but maybe it's more common knowledge than I think.
---
Pallys are great healers, but they are pretty bad at most other things. Protection is pretty good in five mans 
---
Ret is... well I forget what ret is for..... just can't seem to think of a darn thing 
---
Ret lol
---
*Few
---
But your corpse was now at Darkshore, right?
---
Probably two gathering professions in the first few weeks/months will grant you some nice profits. Especially at the high end materials.
---
A lot of people will pick up two gathering professions until they are level 40 to pay for their mount. And a lot will drop the second for a crafting one. Making low level materials not worth it. But the higher ones will become more in demand when endgame nears and a lot of people are leveling a crafting profession.
---
Later on, in a later phase you can make the switch as well to a professions you know is a shortage of and use that to your advantage.
---
Sure, but you're still trying to fill a job that just isn't there in the first place.
---
Dark edge of insanity
---
I'm in the beta, my experience is that levelling in dungeons is quite viable, esp. Gnomer and SM.
---
Note that is by feeling only, I didn't take any numbers.
---
I feel like farming mats for consumables is like a player generated quest with the reward being either gold or the consumable. It’s a great way to immerse yourself in the world
---
Haha, that sounds fun. I'll def consider it if I end up rolling lock.
---
So do you respec at 40?
---
Didn’t they have to tone it down because it was literally mathematically impossible or am I thinking of a different raid?
---
Cop btw, cop btw.
---
You decided against marriage?
---
You broke up with someone and said “I’m not marrying you?”
---
Or you said “no marriage, ever.” Which probably was never an option for someone who swore off marriage, plans to move to Amsterdam, and plays wow anyway.
---
I second this, but it is a bit more complicated: you can only track one ressource at a time, so while farming you would need to switch between both.
---
To be faair
---
no.  
---
op specifically asked for bis in pvp AND pve
---
not pvp OR pve.
---
In Vanilla, pally was the only class I could regularly solo an elite. They did take forever to kill stuff though.
---
I dont get how people survive with just one monitor. Need two, prefer 3
---
Farmed mobs in winterspring because I loved that zone. Bought green skel warhorse just before the patch adding new colors. Then farmed EPL and bought the purple one. Yes I was dumb.
---
Got it for my alt rogue too, farming mobs.
---
Didn't come with mine
---
Yeah you need to make a macro
---
Well it’s not a huge money maker but it will get the occasional hit.
---
The biggest problem with wow tokens is that it is a pay 2 win system. You might argue that people can buy gold anyway, but its much bigger scale now and easier. 
---
Another wierd effect is that you can transfer gold from retail to classic, which links the two economies in a unpredictable way that will influence the classic evonomy.
---
Vurtune is mediocre compared to private server heroes tbh.
---
Mage lvling wont NEARLY be as efficient on classic as they are on private servers.
---
Oh dear, someone didn't attend physics class.
---
https://youtu.be/vQ66Z5d7Gc8
---
Yeah. I completely did forget those.
---
Honestly, it grinds my gears a bit when people talk about vanilla as this hugely difficult and whatever thing. It's not. Rotations are really mostly one to two buttons. Some situational awareness required. I don't mind that much though.
---
It was WotLK where for me rotations and everything got really interesting. TBC was IIRC still very simple in that regard. Can't say anything about the later expansions, but at least up to WotLK the game got increasingly more difficult in terms of mechanics and skill required (for the most part).
---
What that has to do with wlocks and shadowbolt.. I dunno. I just needed to rant.
---
A lot of people complain about the story, and it sure has its problems, but i'm too big of a lore nerd to stop following it. There's always a metric ton of details most people don't notice that you'd only notice if you know everything
---
You print this map ? Or bought somewhere (map)?
---
Definitely wasnt mage, world first on krnos2 was a druid
---
I’m so casual these days that I pretty much don’t play until they implement the catch up mechanics. I feel like it’s a waste of time to try and grind beforehand knowing that there’s a 100% chance that grind will be bypassed in the next patch. I’ll just run a m+ or two, grab some vanity shit or xmogs and log
---
Great to see someone with dungeon experience from beta. Any chance you see dungeon grinding as being a reasonable xp/h in classic all the way from 20-60? The comp would probably be my friends as warr, mage and lock. The 5th would have to be pugged.
---
Play whatever class fantasy you want, stop worrying about min max, 90% of you arent hardcore anyway.
---
That's because of the insane mob respawn rates, which is ESPECIALLY high during the first days of a server's release.
---
I remember not being able to enter caves because mobs would quickly respawn behind me as I tried to progress through.
---
Not everyone pvp... some folks respec for pop
---
Post the screenshots OP, we want to see them :)
---
Do you honestly think he was asking for everyone in this thread to address both topics?
---
Generally a thread asking for opinions on several topics is asking the general consensus on the topic. That means even stupid people like me are allowed to respond in an either/or, or in general.
---
Quit acting like an idiot.
---
I remember it becoming a thing in either wrath or cata
---
You mean meme spec lol
---
Personally, my money is on druid
---
of course that's in the list, not 10 hours thou .. ;)
---
Ff12 is technically a prequel timeline wise.
---
Female night elf hunter with rhok'delar🤘
---
Hold on lemme call by buddy Ion
---
Yeah sounds like it's worth testing. Going to give it a go a month in or so when people have some money.
---
5-6 months
---
I’m still trying to figure it out.
---
Bro the most elitist group by far are the pserver players.
---
What?
---
Exactly i remember solo/ duoing it to get the mount and all the fun stuff at 70 because he was a level 60.
---
I played from launch up to midway thru wotlk and I gotta say some of my fondest memories was when it launched,  minus the servers being down.  But when the starter zones are populated it's like nothing else the game ever offers.  It's just so much fun doing starter quests and seeing people everywhere.  That only lasts for about a week or 2 thou then the traffic thins out as people spread around the world.  So enjoy it when it happens.  Even thou I was a horde main back in the day and gonna play horde again.  My first character was a nightelf and not many things could compare to the starter area and darkshore filled to the brim of nightelfs all questin about.
---
More like never lol
---
They tried invading thunder bluff!? Now it’s personal.
---
I don't get it
---
Nice!
---
Nothing that alex guy says should be taken seriously. He knows nothing about wow.
---
They are
---
okay, this is the problem  
---
you don't understand AND and OR statements.  
---
an AND statement is when two variables have to be both true.   
---
an OR statement is when one of the variables have to be true but not the other.   
---
in op's question, he's asking for best in slot combination for race and class for pve AND pvp, not pve OR pvp. 
---
quit acting like an idiot you say, but you're quite literally showing that you don't understand 5th grade math and statistics nomenclature and that you're incapable of applying it in a fucking simple real world context
---
Chinaman maybe?
---
I’m same as you and it’s pretty amazing how your instincts kick in at an older age and you’re able to control the situation more.
---
I was extremely excited about playing the stress test with a buddy and one of the kiddos ended up getting sick. I maybe got to level 4 and had to log off to take care of her for the rest of the 2 days the stress test was out. I surprisingly didn’t mind it at all. Like others have said, Classic doesn’t require you to be on every day. You can skip a couple days and just pick up where you were when you left.
---
This makes no sense though. Why would beta activity dropping off snowball into harming classic wow? New people can’t come into beta. People can’t raid or do any endgame content on beta. On classic none of that is true, people will be joining all the time. Totally different situation.
---
Yeah, everyone knows the prism acts like a capacitor for Seal of Command.  When it pops, it will shoot ahead of the other rays.
---
quefrio, you better put every damn point into frost with that god tier name
---
We asked for 1.12,we're getting 1.12.#nochanges
---
You’ll feel obliged to your guildmates instead, especially  as an officer or GM.
---
Those players have been playing Vanilla WoW and studying it for years now. These type of players will be in the top 1% of the player base of Classic WoW. To them everyone does suck at the game.
---
It's true that there is a lot of legends from vanilla, and it's of course a game where your skill progresses, but I remember more younger people were playing back in the day, and WoW was the first MMO that that played (maybe even game). Anyways. 
---
I can agree that it's sort of a meme.
---
I would argue that tryharding for a win in random pugs is kinda pointless ? If you are that desperate for a win get a premade no ? I personally joing random pugs simply to just let lose , have some fun and do whatever I wanne do. For everything else (especially tryharding for a win) I have my premade setup.
---
Losing aggro on a single mob to a mage in a 5-10 man dungeon doesn't even matter at all. At worst you or your party will control the mob with a stun / root / slow, or just have the aggro puller kite it. Paladins are AoE tanks, you really shouldn't worry about occasionally losing aggro on single mobs.
---
he's going to call his buddy Ion and ask him if they're going to up the beta lvl cap
---
Is that supposed to be a lot? 
---
If it was like 4K or more sure but 2K is pretty normal for a good gaming PC
---
Horde for 15 years, looking forward to making a might elf :)
---
Messed up xp rates, insane spawn times at server launch, no one recognizes that as a record lol
---
Why run away from targets when you can make them run away from you.  In vanilla you can also DoT them without immediately breaking fear
---
To add after watching it: He seems to like the idea, but doesn't agree that it's faster than single questing. 
---
He says he wants to test it out, so people on the beta: contact him and try it out ;)
---
Quantum level BS for the win....
---
i cant wait for it to be mobile or even on ps4 and xbox, this is 2019 the technology is here already.
---
In vanilla I played a NE druid. For classic i’m rolling an undead priest! I’m looking forward to the class quest of getting the epic staff!
---
Considering the source I'd say no. Whatever opinion that douche bag has always make sure you have the opposite one and you'll turn out a decent human being.
---
My girlfriend at the time wanted to marry and have kids, I turned her down then she moved out.
---
But yes I've stated numerous times before and during our relationship that I'm not looking to settle down in my 20s.
---
When I watched a similar video, this big thing for me was that it confirmed to me why I should play the classes I want to play.
---
He is making an absurd comment about calling the developer to ask, because that is the only way a person could answer the question you've asked.
---
The fact that Shamans didn’t show up in your post is telling... alliance scum.
---
the only rare pet I want is the hyacinth macaw. But I won't get obsessed with it this time around, hopefully.
---
Isn’t it CT_UnitFrames?
---
Hunter bugs will disagree :(
---
Boomkins and ret palas, the true meme specs
---
Thank you :) If you're into numbers go team up with the other guy in this post and at least then you're two people :) Kargoz was interested in trying it as well, so if he plays with people who isn't streamers you should have a group soon :D
---
Anyways, hope you're enjoying your beta access! Can't wait to join for the 48h it opens in July.
---
You forgetting about the hidden beauty that layering provides to blizzard. A layered server can be merged but it could also be split up into multiple servers if demand requires it. I for one wouldn’t be surprised if blizzard only provides a dozen or two servers on launch day.
---
Oh, I see, I had no clue who Ion was.  I'm one of those people that havn't played since wotlk but am coming back for classic so I don't follow much at all let alone know a devs name lol.

A light Magenta, the class colour for Paladins isn't on the colour spectrum. It's invented in the brain of those who see both red and blue light. Ret Paladins are a subtle nod towards it in that while the brain of players see paladins as a damage dealing hybrid support class, they in fact may as well not exist.
---
You can’t charge more than a gold per feed.
---
You’re not going to enten a raid as a protection paladin. Leveling is your own choice though.
---
you're embarrassingly unintelligent

No I actually know what I am talking about. I don't need to prove what I am saying. People will judge the content on it's own merit.

The only option is holy paladin.

Good choice. I mained rogue back in the day.

Now I'm going full support as druid, but still got to twink rogue.

I love the class.

Most common way to start a new character is to have skinning+herb or mining. I wonder though how much money you really earn from skinning? I'm planing to roll a warlock. Since the mount is free at 40 I'm not sure if skinning is worth it. Plan to drop skinning for engineering when I have been 60 for a bit. How much gold would I really miss out on? If it's like 100 gold or something it's not really a big deal. herb+mining is great but as a warlock only having 3 bags I could see it becoming impossible with the bag space. Especially since starting out on a fresh server you do't have access to big bags for quite a while.
---
They are already testing 40+ content on the alpha server and they have been for a long time, maybe they dont want to show off too much content before the release
---
I’m still torn between paladin and druid please halp
---
Wait, are you telling me I shouldn't be using my windows 98 and AOL dial up connection? This is BLASPHEMY!
---
Technically, it's arbitrage.
---
you can play wow classic on a potatoe. capitalism
---
Nope. There are two rolls when you attack a mob with a spell. The first is the chance to hit roll. This is based only on your level, your target's level, and your hit gear. The second roll is the resist roll. The result of the resist roll can be 100% resist, 75% resist, 50% resist, 25% resist, or 0% resist. This is based on the target's effective resist level (which includes your spell penetration).
---
The part that tricks players is that if they get a miss or a 100% resist, both cases used to show a "resist" pop-up on the target and resist was the text used in the combat log. I forget when they finally changed the combat log to show "miss" and "resist" as different results, but I'm guessing it was after 1.12. But those 100% resists could not be overcome by spell hit because they were on a second roll.
---
In other words: %hit gear had no effect on %resisted damage, which was the question being asked. Interesting that so many people in this sub are still so ignorant of spell mechanics that everyone knew about 14 years ago that they downvoted my obviously correct comment.
---
best of luck with your life

And Kris Holm is a better unicyclists than me, but I can still unicycle just fine. Better than most people I know actually.

I started my run last night, picked it up in the sale. Supposedly it's a 250 hour campaign. I'm ready.

City of Heroes Homecoming!
---
You like Wooden sticks with  ribbon wrapped pinapples on top?
---
Like others said, very strong healers. Very capable dungeon tank. Ret is fun in leveling dungeons. Ret w/ engineering can also be fun in pvp.
---
I really liked this explanation in a thread about how hard BWL is going to be:
---
&gt; “...it's funny when people keep saying that you can join a casual guild that will bring players with unviable specs. Yes, you technically can, and you might even get carried through most/all of MC and Onyxia. But once you get stuck on a boss like Vael for a few weeks the "try-hard" clique of the guild will start pointing out the DPS below the tanks. Which inevitably leads to losing those tryhards or to losing those players with unviable specs (either respecing or not inviting them). Casual guilds will already have a harder time clearing content, why would they purposely make it even harder by bringing dead weight specs.”
---
That's your response? Run out of bullshit to prop your pathetic narrative? Why don't you continue this charade?
---
If I am indeed the complete moron as you claim you should be chomping at the bit to make me look stupid.

Sell sell sell or have friends craft you stuff from the raw mats and sell sell sell that stuff.
---
This is such such an utter bs no offense. The best dudus in the priv server communities reached "meh" dps by going extra MILES for the spec. If you find urself in top 10 as feral dps either ur guild suck with too many troll specs or the ppl suck whom you play with
---
Can never be to careful when it comes to spoilers, for all we know there could be a dragon ruling Stormwind.
---
imagine if it wasn't a bug but an actually secret way to do something or get somewhere?  Now I know it probably isn't but that would be quite interesting.  I remember back in the day on sega genesis there was an x-men game where the only way to beat a certain boss fight (Mojo) you had to actually hit the reset button on the console LOL
---
Hunters and warlocks?
---
Dwarf priests will get their cock sucked by any guild anytime
---
It's Dire Maul East, you two man farm a few specific bosses with a tank and a healer (or two dps after gearing up). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVUKcRqesto

No issue here. I raided on a p-server for 6 months, to test alliance and we did Boss explanation every single Mc run.

There are tons of older players who remember nothing and newbs. You are fine.

Create a button on your actionbar that shows how many Soul shards you have.

Use a Healthstone, or create one if you hold a modifier key.

Cast Fear with a priority order:

If WoW was a religion, ion is basically the god

that woulda been sick if it was actually implemented and it wasn't like an instanced tram but it actually went the length of how far it was and you took like a 10 minute underwater high speed tram ride that had amazing scenery
---
buddy you don't understand 4th and 5th grade grammatical and mathematical conjunctions.
---
I don't have to say fuck all to make you look stupid
---
I should have said “early vanilla”. In early Vanilla pets did not have a lasting taunt. You could get maybe two shots/casts off before the elite was off your pet and on you. So, no. This was obviously changed later in Vanilla
---
don't limit yourself to NE for that. Hunters just Feign Death, sort the kids out then continue on.
---
What about Omar?
---
Its a simple script
---
Nice meme.
---
I am going to play druid and whoever tells me that there are better healers, wont get a reju from me!
---
Please enlighten me on the wonders of your 4th, and 5th grade educational wonders.
---
You didn't answer the actual question: which is that no, spell hit gear and talents have zero effect on spell partial resists (including a 100% resist due to spell resist stats).
---
See: https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Spell_hit&amp;oldid=1646292#Effect_of_resistance
---
Im not sure tbh. Any downtime when you need a 5th is gonna reduce your xp/h greatly. But you do have the benefit of summoning and mage water. So you can all stay in the dungeon untill bags are full or essential spells are learnable. And you can hs and summon one by one. And the warlock can cast summon on himself, hs and then accept his own summon and get back that way. (I did this. Im a warlock on the beta).
---
Id say deadmines is not that great XP but stockades is really fast and decent XP. When you get to 30 SM is amazing XP. Cant speak for content after lvl 40 though.
---
So in total id say yeah. Its a reasonable way to level as a group.

Most of good guns are BoE, bows are just more common and better

Darkwood is a great little gem of a game that not many people know about, but it is classic survival horror (with no jump scares!)
---
So in UBRS there is a dagger that is a broken bottle that is dropped by the barmen.... I'm gonna grind that guy till it damn well drops. 
---
I killed him excess of ten times in vanilla before BC came out and never got it. 
---
It's not the best dagger, but I want a broken bottle as a weapon lol.
---
Another redditor and I thought of how cool it would be to have the verdent reach narrow down to a cliff-like canyon with a dark souls-esque feel to it. Basically like a good 1000 feet of this canyon you have to run along the sides of the walls in between feralas and un'goro. If you fall off you fall into the valley with a bunch of elites. It's highly motivated to not fall into the pit unless you at least have a 5 man group. Anyways we thought this would have been a cool super dangerous jungle canyon idea that connects the two zones
---
At some point you will be pulling \~100 mobs during scourge invasions and even in range one frost nova may not be enough due to resists and that will force you to reset the pull or die. Same with ZG farming.
---
You can play anything. But to minimize disappointment, you always need realistical expectations.
---
You can run 5 man dungeons no problem. 
---
Beyond that, it's up to you as a player. We can't guarantee a raid spot for you.
---
&gt; show off too much content before the release
---
Haha careful not to spoil 15 years old game
---
Morrowind. Especially with having to read quest text to know where to go.
---
:D thanks mate!
---
Brimstone staff
---
Beta, maybe, but he quit like 2-3 months into cata
---
Some are just more awesome than others.
---
Everyone rolling Need on BoE items of worth seems like the way to go because there's no avenue for exploitation.
---
That said, I wouldn't object to Blizzard introducing a Need-and-Equip option for people who actually wish to Equip &lt;insert item that can be sold for a fortune on the AH&gt;. Obviously Need-and-Equip would &gt; Need.
---
do you know if blizz consider it legal?  i quite liked the effect
---
Thanks for your input. I'll pitch it to my other friends :)
---
As long as Falstad Wildhammer is there' he's cool with it.
---
Some of those dots arent instant in classic.
---
Friends?
---
Cool just throw me a source in that and I'll toss you an upvote
---
Druid is kinda the king of WSG, that's amazing at *something* in my book
---
Grand Reapers Claymore looks like an unrealistic Anime weapon. At least stuff like the Whirlwind Axe look awesome and also realistically able to be used in battle.
---
The fact we can't trust pugs is the cancer within WoW. 
---
During Vanilla and early BC I never experienced it and beloved need if needed and greed otherwise.

It's sad that people will ninja for gold. It's bad behaviour and their mummies should be giving them a spanking.

Get hype!

Any recommendations for race for a priest? I’m thinking alliance but open to horde. After reading some guides I think the hyper utility shadow weaving priest seems cool to me since they bring a lot of utility, but I worry it will be really hard to level? Is it bad for a first time classic player? I could just play it safe and go with a more buffing priest, skipping shadow entirely
---
/console cameradistancemaxfactor 5
---
It's a command built into their interface, so there's no reason it should be considered dodgy.
---
What is the better race on horde to play as lock? UD or orc?
---
This has literally been me, tryin to decide between priest or warlock. I used to main mage so I want to try something different.
---
Warlock + Skinning, and Mining
---
Same goes with gold making, drastic difference in differences. You're either S tier hunter or mage capable of making even 150g+/hr, with the last half at tier C making 50g/hr and the other half with zero capability of farming and stuck with outdoor herb/mining making 20g/hr
---
thanks, is it true that hunter has huge problems with pet on classic?
---
maybe check Kingdom Come: Deliverence
---
Stop, Activision is flooding illegal migrants into blizzard and introducing a pay to win features, but don't worry your boy tony abbot with a 22 will stop them from entering blizzards HQ
---
Will I get into raids playing warrior dps
---
As long as you level with a wand spec, you have one of the easiest leveling experiences in vanilla. Later on you can spec holy, disc or shadow weaving hybrid and you'll be set for all content
---
For me "how to pick a class"-stuff just reinforced my desicion to play Warrior
---
Salt and sanctuary is excellent
---
I am an atloholic.
---
Legion ruined it for me - once I realised I had an unlimited grind - and an unlimited power gain - i just gave up.
---
I’m not going to get an artifice level up again.
---
Yeah I don't link vieos either
---
Yeah. Imagine accidentally falling off in burning steppes or something at level 10 XD

I've been wanting to go back and try master mode
---
Careful, they might spoil nax for us in the beta.

I wanted to play grim dawn but isn't it single player?

Warrior mage or hunter...maybe a pally. Or lock.

Fucks.

dots can be talented to be instant - and if you down rank you can get some near instant cast dots.

Google translate please.

Yeah no joke. My PC runs wow at 3440×1440p ultra wide maxed with 270 frames per second. It's a big jump from what I was playing with back in the day Haha.
---
I had that with the Nightmare Blade from Taerar on my rogue. They looked damn good together.
---
Depending on who you ask, he's the devil lol
---
what does that even mean kobe bryant
---
It’s dependant on recipe drops. Enchanting is a huge gold skink but when you get Crusader and others you can charge for the enchanting and make a killing, same goes with Alchemy. That’s end game obviously the money makers have been posted in here before whilst levelling but those two professions are the ones that will continue to make gold through the phases. Tailoring and Leather working can make gold from BIS sets but the monopoly on devilsaur will effect you if you can’t get into a mafia and tailoring even though the bloodline set is bis for some until Naxx eventually the over saturation from other tailors and less need for the items will slowly bring the profit margins down. All gathering professions will net good gold but are also farmed by the majority of the population so fighting for nodes/herbs/good skins isn’t very profitable.
---
There are some exceptions though I believe. For example, the race specific abilities for priests are taught only by your own race, but there are breadcrumb quests offered by trainers of other races.
---
*Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?*
---
He's not a bug checker, he's a fact checker
---
You’ll do very well at leveling and low level dungeons if you specifically spec to tank.
---
However, you will still struggle those 2v1 situations - and it’d be a slower fight than dps would do.
---
Everything is too obvious and pandering. 
---
Diablo 4 begins development after immortal controversy and is a FPSlooter? Give me a break
---
If you use immolate as affliction you are doing it wrong. And imp corruption is mandatory (at least 3 points).
---
imo  the early TBC and Wotlk dailies were not as bad as people always make them sound like. If anything they gave non dps specs an alternative option that's missing in classic
---
Yes I've just said that. Bite me. It's coming from a hunter player who never cared much about them for the purpose of gold farming.
---
In TBC they were what? 10 repeatable things to do every day to get x amount of gold... instead of doing other repeatable things to farm X gold with. Who gives a flip about that. Even when they raised the limit to 15 it was merely a part of the expanded faction daily options.
---
When blizz removed the limit on them and down the road transformed them into world quests they turned them into this frustrating chore retail has to deal with these days. It wasn't about 'I pick the y quests because I want to get Z. From that point on it was: I've to do everything at once and burn myself out on doing the same 50+ boring quests every day.
---
I log on so that I can do what I want, not grind out my rep (wq meter) so that I can unlock some allied race to repeat the process.
---
Why do *so* many people want to play Ret when it's awful.
---
Fyi warriors are tanks..
---
In fact a lot of watriors eventually fury tank dual wield because upping dps is the only way to keep up with high geared dps threat.
---
They're far from useless. They're the best single target healers in the game, provide great buffs to the group, and can solo damn near anything if you don't mind a "war of attrition" style of gameplay where you just put a seal on yourself and autoattack with procs. You will be able to heal any 5 man dungeon in the game + UBRS with any spec as long as you get the appropriate healing gear. If you luck out and make the right friends you can even dps / spot heal in dungeons as ret.  Whoever told you they're worthless is a drooling moron.
---
Norwegia lol
---
You think? I've started making noises when I sit down and pissing 4 times in the night
---
This is a well known strat.
---
Few opportunistic rogues will fall for it.
---
Well, lot's of people here were complaining they wouldn't get a "classic summer" so I guess people do want to "waste" their time playing
---
Same for me. Just made every class on a private classic server and I like and hate stuff about each class.  So far I seem to really be clicking with warrior. I’ve been hamstring kiting which is like a 30% damage reduction buff and really enjoying the play style.
---
This is the kind of thing this sub needs way more of. Enough a out layering and streamers and classic plus shit.
---
Dire maul. Deadmines abbreviation is vc for van Cleef.
---
Dire Maul
---
Irrelevant. Not talking about class specs. And dwarf is u questionably the best in your stupid example anyway so as well as being a moron, you failed.
---
Depends on who you ask lol
---
So you can respec anytime? (I assume with gold?) So during levelling I can basically do anything I want to try things out and respec later?
---
Or you just learn where the spawns are in the zone. Do enough farming and the tracker becomes fairly unnecessary.
---
Eh, you have an interrupt. That’s enough utility for a high damage mdps.
---
Isn't a feral Druid achieved a world DPS record on Ragnaros with the power shifting spec?
---
Certainly, but people should be aware of what is expected of them (or their build) when it comes to endgame.
---
Druid is your answer:)
---
oh please We were not the only guild selling the damn bear for weeks. The ZA speed run had absolutely no challenge to it when you walked in there with proper raid gear to crush everything in your path.
---
I started at the end of Wrath as well. I made a mage and hunter and I remember when Cata dropped and suddenly my hunter didn't have to hold onto her ammo and I didn't have to work on my relationship with my pet. It killed my want to play hunter since it didn't matter anymore what pet I got to fight beside. I quit during Cata and came back in Legion and more focused on RP and painfully get my toons through the levels so I could tell stories with my friends.
---
During the last stress test I got in, made a Hunter and rapid-fire leveled to level 11 with in a day and when the server was taken down I keep finding myself scrolling over to the Classic launch button and clicking it. I liked how hard it was, I missed it. My progress actually felt really important not 'ugh 40 more levels to go'. So in August when the servers launch I'm going to press the log in button and enjoy a new adventure and actually take my time leveling up my professions and enjoying the original game to it's fullest.
---
Of all the zones, verdant breach is the one that defo needs a redo
---
I was actually thinking something similar to those ideas, but with a hot springs region in the east, and maybe a high road to top of the gorge to, with some pteradon riding trolls up there too
---
Floridaman
---
Get ripped before classic so wife can stare at abs instead of being concerned about the amount of time being consumed playing
---
Just to add all professions make money just some are better than others most of them make enough to have a stable gold income but the true money makers the ones that make you so rich you can do what ever you want require more than the standard 300/300
---
I remmeber watching the Zazz shadow priest pvp video and he had a "NOT IN RANGE" / "IN RANGE" in the middle of his screen... Looked for it for ages but could never find it. It was almost like a weakaura before they were a thing
---
Unrelated comment is unrelated?
---
&gt; I think your fps dropped when taking screenshots but I might misremember.
---
It absolutely did and for quite a long time too.
---
Spinal reaper is good for warriors, but BRE is definitely better. However, both Spinal Reaper and BRE are rare drops from rag. You have a 5% chance of it dropping at all - some guilds never see it drop ever. You could go with the mentality "take what you can get" or hold out in hopes of the rare drop.
---
Tons of warriors get Zin'Rokh. It's a 20 man raid and the weapon is great in PVP. All classes that can use it can benefit from the attack power and stamina it offers.
---
They need to invite more people to keep them full and up the level cap. Go up to 50-55, open up AV. More people need to experience the close to end game meta.
---
I’m rolling priest. YouTube can’t stop me from healing my tank. Watch me.
---
Also don’t tell anybody about your class plans on r/classicwow. They will find some good reasons why you should not play it :P
---
That's very depressing, but if it makes you feel better I have similar stories. 😭🤣
---
Which begs the question, do many 19 years old die of expected heart failure?
---
The "t" is obviously silent
---
Skinning is approx 30% gold increase from beasts. I got this from frostadamus. It adds up 30-40 and makes good coin also 50-60 with all the beasts you’ll kill in WPL EPL ungoro Felwood and winterspring.
---
I totally agree with you dude.  
---
Disagreeing with what someone says purely because of who they are is 100% the most logical and sane thing to do.
---
Let's totally ignore the fact that the bugs in game currently let an organized group of people (think devilsaur mafia)  to form a complete monopoly over the server's economy,  from devilsaur to rich thorium &amp; black lotus.
---
and let's ignore it just because this one person that pointed it out, i don't personally like!!!   
---
Because we all know in the end that it will benefit me, the completely unrelated and unaffiliated player in the long run.
---
right?
---
right??  right??????
---
oh wait.............................
---
oh wi
---
So what part of "Class/Race combos" are you having a problem with?
---
This is gonna end up the same way as osrs I feel. Which would be amazing, also opens up the possibility of "vanilla expansions" in which the core gameplay is kept the same but we could explore new content at 60. Maybe more raids as dungeons to do with the old god's, etc.
---
I'm OK with shards too. Use the macro to keep your bag full forever and you're set (as long as you remember to cast Drain Soul regularly, which I have no problem with).
---
Now go get the Mage in the safe
---
Rogue is 4, hunter is 5. Ret/feral are near 7 boomkin duder. Don't be crazy.
---
This is just all of the hurricane trailers clipped together with random wow music played over it. The actual hurricane trailers are way more hype.
---
*slap the debuff on whoever you can,  all the time, because rank 1 of the debuff (which is 20% healing reduction at every rank) only costs 35 mana and lasts two minutes.
---
Totally illegal, you’ll go to prison for it.
---
I played a Gnome Rogue back in 06-07, and absolutely loved it.
---
I'm planning to still roll Alliance this time, but wanting to be a caster of some sort. Likely Mage or Warlock.
---
I feel Mages will be the most popular, and I'm leaning towards Warlocks as mostly I'll be playing alone and will be time poor.
---
Would love some insights!
---
Mining #1
---
Why?
---
Not only you can make weapons and armor, bit engineering.
---
u wot?
---
Focus on your exam. Classic isn't out for 2 whole months.
---
False.
---
It's mage&gt;warrior&gt;rogue&gt;warlock&gt;hunter=druid &gt;&gt;&gt; anything.
---
I got my warrior to 60 just fine only ever hamstring kiting at best a few times per day, on a hard mob or when things got hairy. Tirus isn’t wrong that spirit gear or scrolls will top you off just fine so idk why he’s getting shit on.
---
Might be the record between cats but certainly not between all classes. I think you refer the elysium rag kill where a warlock pulled  1400 dps with exploiting and got banned.
---
Power shifting is a must for pulling your own weight and not to top dps charts
---
I love watching T&amp;E’s cinematic analysis videos. Taliesin is crazy observant and watches them several times over, and picks up on the tiniest details that provide so much more to the story.
---
No took my exams during BC and Wrath lol 
---
But I understand the feeling, be glad the game is not out lol
---
Also what university goes so late? Most get out in early to mid May
---
During the last stress test I took my Dward hunter to Teldrassil at level 5. When I got to level 10 there were no class quests available, not even in Darnassus. Had to go back to IF.
---
well I think that the best choice of that shiny new BoP epic upgrade that just dropped for you is to be vendored for 2g.  since you should just vendor it anyway, we should all Need it because we all need gold
---
Plus you don't even need to think about that until 60 when you can respec if you feel the need.
---
Hello miss information
---
No bro. Deadmines was DM long before Dire Maul was a thing. The proper Dire Maul abbreviations are DME, DMW and DMN. Since you need to be bit more specific which one of the 3 instances you refer to anyway
---
Ö
---
I'm really conflicted between a Dwarf priest (because i love dwarves and have never mained preist) or Nelf Druid (because i love druids as a class, but I'm not really into nelfs)
---
I played at launch and it was called VC
---
Hter we go again
---
All good.  Welcome back!
---
And don’t take too much time overthinking it or you’ll end up with brain damage
---
It's completely built in, you should be pretty safe to do so.
---
If you’re thinking of chinaman, that’s different because it was used in derogatory fashion, and it’s different from Chineseman which isn’t a term people use. Frenchman Englishman etc as well as Dutchman are all pretty standard.
---
Bad hunters in that case. Should do more then druid if they are not huntards
---
One of my worst experiences in wow was getting a legendary from a daily quest on my demon Hunter.
---
I've played since vanilla and I've respected people who played their ass off getting different mounts than their original race, farmed hard for setpieces, purples that were hard to come by and the most prestigious achievement is having a legendary. 
---
I DONT DESERVE SHIT I AM NOTHING BUT A PAWN IN THIS HUGE VAST WORLD, NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IM AN IMPORTANT PIECE IN ALL THIS??
---
we ARE NOTHING but adventurers and I don't deserve SHIT UNTIL I WORK FOR IT WITH A TEAM OF PEOPLE FOR A GREATER CAUSE.
---
Can't wait to just stand in awe for accomplishments people have dedicated themselves to do when classic arrives
---
They're only tanky in one spec which sacrifices a ton of damage ability. Non SL locks are basically softer than mages and priests.
---
It's the other way around. Holy resistance never existed but it did on some private servers.
---
Not at launch, definitely not.
---
EU subjects are not Citizens.   
---
They do not elect the EU council.     
---
They are not armed.    
---
Their natural rights are not recognized. 
---
You are subject to the rule of the EU council and cannot defend yourself or your land.
---
It's been a long time since I was in AQ40 but for our guild it went something like one mage, rogues, then locks, then the other mages, then hunters. Occasionally one warrior might surpass some hunters.  
---
Are people speaking from vanilla experience or private servers? Personal experience or are these following from the best guilds around during vanilla?
---
Tbh, if the servers are east coast, we should expect about 80-100ms, which is completely playable.
---
There are EU people in the beta and they seem to be playing just fine.
---
Never heard that in vanilla
---
I'm kind of tired of seeing this post.
---
Vanilla is not some extremely hard core real gamers only sort of thing. When I played vanilla for the first time I was only like 10 years old and I figured it out.
---
Just play the game, it's great.
---
Here we go
---
While my point was made to say that I don't like how progression just resets so often. 
---
I also relate to you. 
---
My dad has always played WoW. But he never really cared about grouping up other than doing dungeons in LFG. 
---
He never raided even once and he has played A LOT of WoW.
---
The later expansions had a lot of content for him, especially the management of his garrison etc.
---
If you ask me, for people like him, they should make a questline every patch.
---
Similar to the Warlock green fire quest in MoP. I did that and it felt amazing. It was difficult, but only doable Solo.
---
I personally only really raided with a guild in karazan and gruul's, but for the rest of the entire game I only did PUGS
---
So raiding wasn't a big deal for me either. But the game is centered around it, and it is arguably the strongest point in WoW.
---
I’m in Germany i guess it’s different to your country. Got all my exams within the next 2 weeks :(
---
I tested on pserver, so ymmv on classic. The level one class quest is only available in your starting zone, but you can pick up the next ones in any zone. 
---
Test 1: quested dwarf rogue to kharanos (including first rogue quest), went to teldrassil, was able to pick up lvl10 quest
---
Test 2: went straight to teldrassil with gnome rogue. No level 1 class quest was available
---
If you take 5 mages and 5 warriors equally skilled and geared.
---
Ok 1 mage will be 1st dps, but if you get to the damage done overall by the 5 classes, i am pretty sure the 5 warriors are 30% ahead.
---
That sucks
---
If you have a group, it is viable to do a mix. If you are solo, it is better to quest and do each of them once by finding a group.
---
I wouldn't say 8 agi is negligible. It stays all the way to 60.
---
There’s no way. Everybody called it DM because most people wouldn’t even get to van cleef to call it VC in the first place
---
In TBC the WL is in his prime and as complicated as u make it. 
---
The fire built is absolute garbage and creates nothing but aggro, the easiest built to play is 0/21/40 spamming SBs and sacrificing the Succ.
---
The most fun I ever had in the game though in playing Affliction (41/3/17 or 41/0/20) due to your versatility. If you manage with the help of the right addons to keep your dots rolling on the targets you’ll always top Meters especially when the tanks ain’t at the peak of their game. The dmg to threat ratio is superior to other specs and with improved life drain you’ll survive any raiddmg with ease.  Tapping your fully buffed up and void shifted Imp for mana every minute is another great perk that relieves healers since there’s no need to lifetap.
---
TBC is the expansion of shadowdmg.
---
Good call! I used that method with priest but believe I ran out of mana before I could kill an elite.

---
Took my GCSEs at the time WoD came out, I was sufficiently dissuaded from playing wow to focus on my exams.
---
"It's OK that you levelled to 60 and the spec you like doesn't work because you can respec resto!"
---
Yeah, friends were a thing in vanilla...will be again in classic.  Lol
---
Wow, you’re right! I made one more ghost run before actually rezzing back in Coldridge Valley, took the boat to Darkshore, ran out into the water, rezzed at my fatigued corpse then swam back to the dock. Mission accomplished.
---
yeah never ever heard it called VC on vanilla, tho i did play horde, so DM wasnt that relevant
---
WoW! I look forward to these.. friends
---
Wish I was in my early 20. I’d just take a semester off tbh. I barely enjoy life as much as I should/could so it wouldn’t hurt. 
---
Too bad I’m almost 27 so no time to fuck around.
---
There is no doubt what dungeon you are running if someone asks for a VC group. There could be confusion however if someone asks for a DM group. It's time to evolve. VC is deadmines
---
Even ran it on Linux with wine and it ran smoothly, mac shouldn't be a problem
---
Fair enough on both points. I guess for my view, I would rather have one less point in furor and to take that point into auto root and one less point in improved rejuvenation (which while an ok talent is actually not as good as it makes itself out to be) for feral charge. The thing about autoroot is that even at only  35% chance, it is guaranteed to go off quickly in most instances given how many small auto attacks occur in wow.
---
Yeah, I'm 20 now, working full time and studying, wish I had more time to play tbh, hopefully next year I will be just studying so I can grind it out.
---
I was in mainly 2 guilds in vanilla.
---
1 had a friendly guild leader that let people use whatever spec they wanted (like ret paladins) kinda as long as the raid had enough of each role. It was nice people but was struggling and wiping in MC while my other guild, at the same week, was progressing on Nefarian in BWL.
---
I expect most guilds to be like that, if you are allowed to use "bad" specs in raid, then guild won't do well (not just because the specs but also because the people there likely won't be very try hard). If it isn't allowed then the guild will do much better.
---
Everyone needs to take a page from this guy and invest in a standing desk. The manual crank (SKARSTA) ones from IKEA are fairly cheap. Better for your health and actually even easier to concentrate for long periods of time imo.
---
Full time + studying. Fuck bro. 
---
Which country you live in?
---
More interested in the UI
---
The casuals who couldn't clear VC weren't even at level to do VC when we were calling it VC
---
Remember that a lot of data comes from private servers which have been proven to be off, just play the class you like
---
I'm in the UK.
---
Whilst I do have hardcore aspirations there is a long time of just MC, I'll somewhat hurry, but I'll be playing paladin was I won't lose sleep after missing week 1 or 2 MC reset.
---
Probably the best WoW YouTube folks
---
You're right, it doesn't. Did i imply it does? What's your point exactly?
---
There’s a blue post by blizzard clarifying that it was called DM at launch just go check it out
---
My usual method is to think for myself and pick a class based on how badass I think it is.
---
Also, *stop doing research.* Be patient. Let the game come to to you. Enjoy it.
---
1 monitor, vomit
---
I’m really torn between Druid and Shaman and my mind changes between those two every day
---
Wow, that’s an admirable collection! Wish I had kept my copies back in the days..:)
---
Not the preferred nomenclature, dude.
---
In that case people will disagree with you and if go through with it that you will be blacklisted.
---
In the end it all comes down to what other people find acceptable behaviour and where I draw the line is much more reasonable then what you just said. 
---
No to mention that you are just wrong that the best option is to vendor it for 2g.
---
Yeah they do, it's also accessible for casuals, it is ridiculous to assume otherwise. The elitists will have you believe that there is no point playing unless you are putting in 40+ hours a week in vanilla. I played on a private server for about 6 hours this week and am still enjoying it as much as I want to
---
That one barrens quest where you need to collect Strider beaks near the river. It takes God damn forever. Makes you humble. Makes you realise the grind could be way worse.
---
I started vanilla the first week of release and didn't quit wow until mists of pandaria.
---
Months ago I jumped back on private servers to see if I liked vanilla still. I played as a paladin, it was a class I had never played before and I also had never tried the alliance faction. 
---
I felt pretty nooby honestly regarding class mechanics and city layouts. I mean I kinda knew storm wind and iron forge but the night elf zone was a brand new maze to me. There were still dungeons that I had only run maybe 3 times in vanilla. Black fathom depths for example, I couldnt remember where to go or what the bosses were. No problem my group led the way and helped everyone was nice.
---
Anyway what I'm trying to say is even some veterans will be new to some aspects of the game. And even though people get lost or dont know every detail the classic wow community is friendly and will almost always help.
---
You'll do fine. I bet you'll have tons of fun.
---
Armor resist and other values are waaaaaaaaay off. You have no point. Enhancement shaman might as well be top DPS (hehe).
---
All I know is I’m not playing melee :)
---
No.  This time I mean.  For realsies.
---
Yeah i wish i knew if aoe grinding was going to be possible at launch or not because of layering. 
---
In general wetland gnolls at level 22 isn’t really more efficient than single mob/questing in most cases. It’s good practice though, and teaches you how to avoid taking a beating, and wasting mana.
---
The point is that min maxing is not a replacement for being good.  Anyone can look up this info and it doesnt translate to gameplay.
---
* and not near other mobs 
---
Ahaha
---
Good for Fury prot
---
It is a decent list. But I think it's flawed, because mages depend more on Ignite than warriors on Deep Wounds. 
---
Further, that repack server is rumored to have overtuned armor values.
---
I do think it's still warrior&gt;rogue~=mage&gt;warlock.
---
But would be nice if you provide your test data!
---
Only a scrub would spend 2k. Did i say 2k enough. do you guys think im cool yet? 2k? 2! K!
---
Even on nerfed private servers lashers are better gold/h if you have herbalism. We do not really know how lasher farming will work on classic though. It will for sure be different than how it is on Chinadale as that server don’t even have the pods. It will most likely be closer to how the twinstar one works (that means it will be in some ways easier than chinadale, but also harder in some ways as you need far less mana on chinadale to do the farm as a priest).
---
then you did no wand enough.
---
Also You would never look for diremaul. You would look for easy, west etc. so DME or DMW.
---
Indeed! My gnome will be killed many times by undead rogues 😭😭
---
You can seek out the respective trainer and start a different chain. For horde as example it is much easier as warlock to do the orc quest for a succubus as the UD quest asks you to travel to the wetlands with lvl 20. 
---
Man those arathi raptors came out of the walls I tell you
---
Paladins are the light combined.
---
Congrats! Having a 4 year old and a 10 month old i can say that this will take a lot of your time.. but you can probably squeeze in an hour or two in the morning or night depending on when (if) they sleep :) But enjoy the little one, they don't stay little very long and it goes by in the blink of an eye.
---
No bro, people were calling it VC before Dire Maul was a thing.
---
 https://web.archive.org/web/20050518092536/http://www.thottbot.com:80/?i=5664
---
Because they want to play a paladin and are smart enough to realize ret allows them to heal 5 mans and solo level without a respec.Oh, and so,e people think it’s fun. Which is the point?
---
Teebus Blazing Longsword is the best looking item and it's not even close.
---
You just trying to be mean or? 
---
I guess I don't see what you're trying to do
---
Plagueheart checking in
---
Forever until the last server shuts down.
---
No. Now go to another subreddit
---
Yea I never felt obligated to fulfill the 38th spot in my guild's raid team every night /s
---
Troll elsewhere please
---
Sorry but holy pal are really strong in pretty much all raid content
---
Yeah I know some people's fun come from as min maxing.  The point of the post is that some people's fun is killed trying to min max.  How are we thinking about this mindset?  This is how I'm thinking of it.  Dont bother and pick the gnome warrior for pvp if that's how you're thinking of it.
---
Shame whatever store felt the need for big ass stickers
---
Kinda useless uh?
---
I would agree.  In general I think you are better off as a Paladin.
---
Kinda reminds me of that hidden room with the initials WKM carved into the stone, wonder if they're related to this.
---
Here's a link for reference (here.)[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/WKM]
---
Rogue is a great utility in group pvp. Lockdown their whole team
---
Nope
---
Then you can increase the price of your flowers. It still amazes me that people do not know how basic economy works. 
---
The main effect of inflation is that repaircost/respecc cost/ mounts etc becomes cheaper.
---
But that's not how you spell Dark Age of Insanity.  
---
THE FUCKING WEAPON IS LOOKING AT YOU WHILE IT EATS YOU.
---
naaaah, while i could agree on top 4 being the ones you said, have you ever seen a ret paladin with right consumes+oil+chilli? feral abuse of pummler is also insane which is why i rank those 2 actually above hunters
---
You seem to not understand the word scrub.  A "scrub," by definition is:
---
a) a guy that wont get no love from me
---
b) hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride, trying to holler at me
---
c) thinking they're good at the game because they youtubed "bish racialz 4 warriar"
---
Get educated before you spew generalities in public.
---
Why is there not one mention of koiter in the big blizzard artbook? It's got warcraft, diablo, starcraft
---
nah, there's 3 other people in the group who would rather have a chance at 2g for themselves than you get an upgrade
---
we all needed so it's not ninja
---
Stormstrike shamans were insane mage killers in pvp, cant raid though, no threat management... I was ressed 4 times on trash for over aggroing .... my repair bill was insane.... funny as balls though!!
---
He asks for race to be specified. You said 'priest' (lol). And dwarf is the best priest anyway. Dumb fucking cunt.
---
&gt;It would suck to be peer pressured into not just a class but a spec within one too just to have a higher chance to participate.
---
It sucks just as much to peer pressure other people into carrying you simply because you choose a spec that simply isn't designed for raiding.
---
By all means, play whatever you like, but when it comes to raiding, don't expect other people to cater to you.
---
It's called Alt Tab
---
So this is how far the rabbit hole goes? I remember now.
---
My group calls them screachers, they're the kids that used to plague the halo 3 and mw lobbies (known as squeakers) but now they've evolved into this edgy teenager that literally screaches into their mic and shouts obscenities because they think its cool/funny.
---
Since it seems to be missing

post naxx content = TBC

Ret is bottom. Hunters and ferals are *now where near* rogues lol.

https://invidio.us/watch?v=ypfZaTxwXQw&amp;t=2m
---
yes way
---
why are you this way?
---
well it's just like that = ignite yes ? &gt; warrior . Ignite no? &lt; warrior
---
armor values aswell as other procc buff bugs are the reason why stacked paladins will perform this high with oil+chilli etc. the list is ofc for the case that everyone has 100% the right stuff no matter the cost. ofc some classes will have higher gold costs.
---
26 is the new 18
---
He advocates duo leveling because he believes its the best method to speed level (he has said this many times in videos and streams) but hes yet to post a speed leveling DUO time that's even close to whats been recorded so far, in fact his times have been 3-5 hours slower in the 1-20's and since people are doing 1-20 in 7\~ hours, 3+ hour different is huge. Probably not a good person to ask regarding speed leveling/dungeon grinding.
---
I forgot private servers with unofficial mechanics are more accurate than actual official mechanics.
---
good luck with that
---
Bow before your priest overlords!
---
I was gonna run a priest. I heard it was difficult but rewarding at end game being a key healer
---
Your art is so friggin cool :) cant wait to see the priest one
---
It's still a hobby, my wife can sit on the couch watching god knows what for 12 hours a day, I should be able to do the same.
---
&gt;MMOs are just not the spotlight genre anymore. 
---
I understand I could be wrong, and many will certainly disagree, but in my opinion MMOs aren't in the spotlight anymore because WoW got bad. With the popular version coming back, I believe they will contend with battle royales an and such
---
Come on, you can't actually think that. That's not the point at all. Of course the knowledge of the game has advanced on private servers over the last 15 years, regardless of the mechanics weren't completely accurate. We'll see Mages absolutely dominate leveling speed in Classic.
---
Can this dumb ass meme did and not be brought here
---
Wot u mean its time to evolve???
---
#nochanges
---
2 good expansions and the beginning of the end
---
nvm if you don't know shit.
---
&gt;Every few months you get a "free" DLC! (Major patch) All while you are paying the same amount.
---
It's worth noting that this only happens because the model for expansions has shifted. 
---
I would rather expansions be complete when I purchase them then having a shitty dlc model.
---
Respawn rates doesn't favor mages in starting zones. Mages don't have their AOE spells then. The experience you had was only really true for the first 5-10 levels, which doesn't really matter.
---
Of course Classic spawns will be slower, but that's the difference between 2d 17h and 3d 10h, not 2d to 5d.
---
The stealth pro-ret paladin post.
---
I did but not on my priest you stupid fuck
---
I don't remember that at all. Do you have patch notes for reference?
---
Gnome mage and lock is the obvious big one. Definitely the best pve and pvp.
---
I mean, people still did that when we were playing Halo 3/MW. Teenagers have always been like that. They just didn't always lap up terrible game design because they're addicted to those dopamine hits when gold shinies show up on screen.
---
It was a joke fucking idiot.
---
Better than in 2 months lol that would be brutal.
---
The Blue warrior PvP set on an orc. My goal for classic.
---
Ever heard of a starter pack? This was a joke you dork.
---
But druids can tank plenty of raid bosses, including a lot in naxx, and are even better than warriors in the abomination wing.
---
https://www.wowace.com/projects/avr
---
In dungeons you will normally not use shield on the tank, especially if it is a pug. But there are times where it is good:
---
- oh shit tank is about to die
---
- tank has been mortal striked (don’t use it if you do not have to, but in this situation it becomes you most mana efficient heal by far)
---
-pre pull shield. This should only be used if the group know what to do. The point of pre shielding is that it is basically a mana free and aggro free heal. It is mostly used in raids where the tank is pulling and mob/boss is hard hitting or the tank needs to get aggro on a lot of mobs. Any other type of healing can potentially cause a wipe if tank does not do any damage to the boss or get decent aggro on all the adds (example the imps in molten core).
---
Good at AB as well
---
The PvP is so good though. The jumping puzzles and dungeons have always been great. I just didnt like that most cosmetics were obtained by $$
---
Maybe in a week or two when the streamers start leaving BFA again. Increasing the cap now would take a lot of twitch exposure away from 8.2.
---
holy shit big time genius right here fellas
---
You're bragging flagrantly. Most ppl find it rude. You're not subtle
---
Its also f2p once you buy the game. A cheap beer until you can get back on the henny
---
Lol salt
---
Thanks for the additional replies. Everything is crystal clear then. Gnome warlock in Elwynn it is.
---
Ret pally fifth seems pretty far off.  And I played with one very good ret. pally who just pwn3d BGs all the time who knew how to play very well.
---
It might be a dick move, but that's what literally everyone did. Your guild was one of the very, very few. Need before greed wasn't a thing when it came to BoEs, especially expensive BoEs. It was a very rare case where people would do that and make you equip it before leaving.
---
You literally posted this comment twice in this thread.
---
Reserve that thought! One of the other best things then is that you actually look forward to continueing your work after your break!
---
its not about spoiling its about not killing the hype by letting thousands of ppl watch all the content through streams
---
Bragging about what? I've never even mentioned myself, why the hostility
---
And those people have a right to not give a fuck about what you think.
---
Haha yeah possibly
---
Love that the colors fit, nice touch
---
Will give it a try!
---
You're actually so fucking retarded I almost lost faith in the community I'm about to play with. If you think a plate wearer who can kite and gets a free huge crit after the enemy dodges is harder to play than a leather wearer who has to face tank or a paladin who cant cast one spell without going oom you're a fucking sub human.
---
If you play an orc lock and go to undead zone it's fine. it depends on your race / class
---
&gt; If they were to introduce daily boosts like the rested bonus that is non binding, that would be great.
---
Now that's a good idea. The old pvp system is a testament on how bad this kind of a 'grind it how much you want' system is. Because if you can grind nonstop until you get it there will be people who will risk their health doing so and Blizzard shouldn't encourage people to do so.
---
Dark Age of camelot or dark ages?
---
I agree with what you're saying.
---
I'm talking about the first few weeks of a server launch. No fresh 60s are spending tons of gold on a BoE when they're focusing on their epic mount/profs.
---
So if it's an upgrade for someone at that point they get priority vs someone who's just going to have it sit in their bank for a few weeks before it even has a chance to sell on the AH.
---
The ONLY time I'm talking about doing this is during that fresh launch experience where prices haven't settled yet and everyone's still in quest greens/blues.
---
Fishing.
---
My bad thought u were op
---
So? Don't you work too?
---
Cool thanks for the input!
---
This was meant as a joke, you fucking dork. I did this in 10 minutes in mspaint. You sound like a whiny bitch yourself.
---
&gt; I'll keep that in mind! Coming from healing, I will probably stay far behind and sap extra mobs on pull.
---
Just fyi - you can only sap OOC mobs. And if you don't have improved sap (which you should have, because the cookie cutter combat spec is boring af and hemo spec is only about 10% less damage while levelling but infinitely more survivability which reduces downtime) you will most likely die :D
---
Don't like those monitors. They're literally overkill.
---
I don't like how games look on a stretched monitor like that.
---
My 32" LED TV works fine for my desk or my 50" Plasma if I'm planning on gaming on the couch.
---
&gt;low droprate items in dungeon/raid are ignored (legendaries, ironfoe, ...)
---
from the guy's main post.  This is not a bis this is a reasonable bis list.
---
I’ve posted my tag line elsewhere too. Glad to see it’s getting noticed.
---
The class trainers should still offer the quests....at least I know the warrior trainer will off the level 10 warrior quest to you no matter what zone you're in, but they make you go back to take the specific test that you would take for your race.
---
So if you're UD and ran to Durotar you'd have to go back to undercity and brill for your level 10 quest.
---
Nice that looks pretty fluid
---
Female Night Elf Rogue is the only answer.   Until the Blood Elves come out.
---
It will, however the upper eschlons of fps are more geared towards FPS and faster paced games, in order to not skip frames
---
They’re all awesome, but Priest is more awesome than the others. DoTs, HoTs, and smashin thots. Priestgang, scrubs.
---
Warrior, Druid or Hunter. I will decide on Launch day because wracking my brain with it now is driving me crazy.
---
There's only a very small amount of 2H that a hunter would want that Wars and Pallys also want.
---
Even then, if someone's only raiding to get a weapon for PvP then they have just as much priority than said hunter.
---
No point playing over 60hz unless you prefer it.
---
Dragon Age Origins
---
Eviscerate scales with AP.
---
Im not sure I understand....
---
you have a great PC but only get 15-20 FPS something is fishy here
---
You pay for it by sacrificing a bag slot lol.
---
Vanilla Vet / short term private server player here. 
---
Believe me. You can play whatever you want, except probably Moonkin Druid and protection paladin, those two are objectively just shitty. 
---
The rest is FINE. you WILL find a more casual guild that will Raid, and take you as a Feral Druid. The raid might take 30 minutes or so longer, since the constellation is not min/maxed, but that’s about it. 
---
Just know that specific classes just exceed you in their native role. But even then, I remember I was utterly shitty geared in Vanilla on my Paladin (which was retribution - another “shitty” build”) but I still punched out good blows in PvP &amp; wasn’t pushed around. Because I actually invested time &amp; studies my spec in depth and outsmarted them. 
---
That’s the beauty of vanilla. You really have the ability to out smart your opponent. The same applies to PvE content aswell. Not so much, but still. 
---
Don’t bow into the believe that you have to min max your character if you don’t have to. Wow classic might be the last MMO of its kind where skill actually matters because the devs didn’t flatten out the whole game by ‘balancing’ everything to a point where it just feels like you’re playing a mobile game.
---
Any gain is not significant enough.
---
Awesome. Great work mate
---
I don't know what you thought a higher refresh rate was going to do for you but it's only to show more images per second. I personally love 144hz
---
and pepper!
---
Dear Shamans and Paladins, Youre breathtaking!
---
As a hunter I would kite any and every elite I wanted to kill.
---
People trying to be speed runner levels of effecient when they are still losing people to void zones and blizzards in naxx always makes me LOL. Same as idiots trying to run before they can walk and "effeciently" clear content that's not 100% on farm, usually resulting in a spectacular face plant of some kind.
---
Is Classic going to be exactly like Vanilla or will any of the QoL changes be there?
---
Thinking about Hunter/Warlock but having a whole back taken up for Soulshards/Ammo is a bit of a turn-off.
---
I think he meant that he used to play at that framrate but now he has a better pc.
---
I dont doubt that they have a good chance to be first, the first level 70 on retail back in the day was a mage, but I'm just saying that comparing private servers to retail for any sense of justification is logically and mechanically flawed as an argument.
---
Hi just saying that comparing private servers to retail for any sense of justification is logically and mechanically flawed as an argument., I'm dad.
---
Especially if you level with the affliction talent for extra regen if they die to a Drain Soul tick.

The map was on Reddit a while ago, not sure where from but:  [https://external-preview.redd.it/IHfNOoU\_88He4wxajBsSYdu2dTE41Ei9I25oKIMLk1A.jpg?s=1b8e1a91af5de38c5a46de11aaf1165e9a6cc575](https://external-preview.redd.it/IHfNOoU_88He4wxajBsSYdu2dTE41Ei9I25oKIMLk1A.jpg?s=1b8e1a91af5de38c5a46de11aaf1165e9a6cc575)
---
Typical people are going to take 350+ hours to hit 60. At 3 hours a day, thats about 4 months to level alone.
---
the difference between 60 fps and 120 fps is massive
---
actually ret does not appear because sane people dont raid as ret lol
---
Thanks for contributing nothing to the conversation
---
thats what im thinking
---
That's literally the definition of denying them the upgrade lol

If they are fresh 60 with green/blue quest items and it's an obvious upgrade then the class that can use it gets priority.
---
Most people won't even have enough money to buy it off the winner at that point yet.
---
I agree with what you're saying once the server has established itself a bit more, then sure. BoEs are just free gold on the AH.
---
But at that point in the server the AH hasn't even settled yet so what happens is that item sits in someone's bank for weeks until players can afford to buy it after they've got their mounts and proffesions worked out.
---
Neretzek, The Blood Drinker is bae. That ugly ass pizza cutter trash drop is more beautiful on the inside than any boss loot could ever hope to be.
---
Lol that's not what I said at all
---
Look thru the blue post.. they announced it after that big uproar about loot trading
---
I am impressed but the parent comment is so downvoted nobody will see this
---
I did but not on my priest, nice try though you don't sound like a gatekeeping virgin btw. You really don't.

This just proves how Blizzard are so anti-druid. If I as a Night elf druid try to go and get my class quest from a Tauren they just attack me!!! ^/s
---
oh
---
im guessing English is not is native language the whole post feels hard to understand
---
Not the point I'm making, the point I'm making is that there is not really a gameplay advantage for using anything higher than 60hz on a game like classic wow. It is not an fps where every frame matters.
---
in a game as slow as WoW
---
I reckon its barely noticeable if noticeable at all lol
---
&gt;I've tried asking Kargoz on his youtube videos and stream, but he always seem to ignore the question
---
Probably because he streams to YouTube and twitch simultaneously and never bothers to look at both of the chats.
---
I made the same mistake and then I reread it, it is not the best constructed post. But it is what it is.
---
Which horde race would get Darnassus?
---
A good IPS monitor is better for WoW than a TN panel.
---
I have a 240hz TN and my PC can easily push high FPS in WoW but the colours are really shit compared to an IPS.
---
Planning on doing the same, was a gnome rogue back in ‘05 and have been playing an orc warlock on a pserver but think I’m going to roll a gnome lock for classic. Love the gnome aesthetics, except I hate the mechanostrider mount. Luckily don’t have to worry about that with the lock.
---
no u
---
at any rate there is no real reason to go over 60 for an MMO
---
Like....everyone goes Fury for raiding... There's only like 1 arms Warrior in a raid, if that.
---
gotcha
---
Originally all dungeon gear was supposed to be tradeable for 2 hours, after a lot of backlash it was changed to raid only because it is really easy to have your friends roll on a item you need for you in dungeons
---
You don't think ignoring 15 years of knowledge of classic because it came from private servers is *logically flawed*? A good handful of the private servers were closer to vanilla than Classic currently is, so don't dismiss them too fast. It doesn't have to be 100% correct to apply.
---
N1 :D
---
It wouldn't be so bad if they stacked to 20
---
&gt; would be nice if you provide your test data!
---
it's very noticeable but there aren't any real gameplay advantages
---
That's dark
---
Very rarely young people die of heart failure/diseases. Your maximum heart beats rate decrease as you age and also the possibilities of getting heart disease increase as you age.
---
The Deeprun Tram is also interesting because the tram actually moves. Compared to Grimrail Depot where the train is static the whole time and only the background moves.
---
These videos are interesting.  How do you go about testing these?
---
I am surprised OEB isn't part of this conversation.
---
I must just be too old then lol
---
I hope not!
---
That's the ConsolePort Dev, he also has a video of him getting The Proven Healer achieve with a controller.
---
Don’t forget fishing! Very easy to make gold with «passively» while leveling: just fish any node you pass by!
---
Well depends on the game. If it had proper resolution handling it won't look stretched. You just see more on the sides.
---
I got two 32" curved monitors thst become like one ultra wide and it is amazing. It makes, in my opinion, for a lot more immersion in a game, since it quite literally surrounds almost all of my field of view.
---
Yeah have fun respeccing multiple times a week for 50g each. Classic is all about PvP, Raids are so easy that you can do them with everyone in PvP Speccs.
---
must be it 
---
my eyes can tell the difference between frame rates of above 60 or so
---
so long as its consistent, I can detect frame rate drops and in super fast shooters i can sometimes notice but in a game like wow I see no difference between my monitors
---
Pretty sure 4 was the max.
---
Priest fear has cd though. Warlocks doesnt.
---
But they do not! I'm going to go hit things with rage instead. You don't run out of rage and it doesn't take bag space.
---
Exactly like vanilla.
---
&gt;Also a lot of people would be pissed off if like in OP's situation the other guy needed and you risk (rightfully) being called out as a ninja in /world if you follow their advice. (i'm not saying one system is better/worse, just the way i believe most people do it based on my experience)
---
As long as you're clear upfront about the situation then there are no issues.  Most pugs will be running all need on boes but the group leader should always say so at the start of each run.
---
Undead
---
Played a Paladin and Shaman during retail vanilla. Not trying to harsh your vibes, but you will not have a great time being a prot pally. They have no taunt and are not viable tanks. Amazing healers and ret is fun if you have good gear because your so damn hard to kill. Only ever specced into prot for Reckoning. OFC do what you want and what you find fun, but just dont want you to be disappointed once you hit 60.
---
well yeah but everyone gets fishing you dont have to pick it as one of your two
---
Serious guilds that don't care about PvP aspirations of some of their raiders aren't that serious.
---
Especially with the way phases are being rolled out. The guy below me layed it out perfectly why you'd want to get some R13/14s in your raiding party.
---
BFA (downvote) Vs classic (upvote) would be far better imo.
---
No, it's definitely something else. CT doesn't have the info to the right or below the unit frame boxed in like this.
---
The difference between 60hz and 144hz are massive. Even in a game like WoW.
---
Using your 60hz over your 240hz monitor just wouldn't make any sense.
---
Yes sorry I'm not a great English speaker
---
and Thunder Bluff for alliance? Gnomes?
---
Yep
---
Of course, but alot of people tend to overlook it. You can make tons of gold already in the 10 - 20 zones from Oily Blackmouths.
---
Should never go to a Hunter over a Warrior.
---
Hunter only uses 50% of the weapons potential (the stats).
---
Warriors use the weapon damage and the stats.
---
Warriors get Priority.
---
You can always kick them out  ;)
---
The 60-120 jump is pretty high and noticeable, even in a slower game like WoW, but I personally choose to stay at a stable 60 simply because it means my GPU isn't working harder and heating up my office.
---
DM clearly stands for Dun Morogh so when someone says DM they mean Gnomeregan
---
We used to have our guild hang out at this spot all the time. I remember using the mass summon to get everyone there after doing it!
---
The main streamers have already said they will be hiding the server for as long as they can..
---
Soda has gone much further and said he will most likely not even stream for months to avoid the spergs..
---
They will want them at 60, they won't want them leveling, specially since they are all playing slower leveling classes so STV would be hell, moreso.
---
Yeah you should always clear the area before ☝️
---
I dont see Scatman from the Serenity Now funeral raid
---
Tanking raids doesn't suck as a Prot Pally because you don't enter raids as a Prot Pally. They can't raid tank unless your entire guild supports you and gimps themselves in doing so.
---
Same thing goes for Ret. Unless you have a super friendly guild that is ok with you holding them back just so you can play Ret or Prot then you will be healing in raids as a Paladin.
---
a good point, had a friend back in the day that used to say he caught his mount as he basically fished for all his gold lol
---
I liked the 2H Hammer better, especially on a Dwarf.
---
Everything
---
Higher frames is better in just about every game - even something like Hearthstone. Smoother is always better.
---
It doesn't have to provide a gameplay advantage, but smoothing everything out just looks so nice.
---
I have a 144hz and 60hz 2nd monitor. Moving nothing more than a window between the two is a staggering difference. I never noticed it before until I got a high refresh monitor but it's instantly apparent just moving something across the screen.
---
Also, why would a higher refresh strain your eyes? Does real life strain your eyes? That's more of a brightness/color calibration issue than framerate. Too bright and leans towards blue if you have strain or turn off whatever bullshit "dynamic this" or "anti-x technology" your monitor is using. That's usually a huge culprit. Download a good ICC profile for your monitor and apply it in Windows or Mac.
---
https://i.giphy.com/media/aH65G8gIjIbPG/giphy.webp
---
Absolutely. I was in a semi-hardcore guild and we raided 4x4 hours a week, less on farm. You basically have to plan your life around the raiding times and so does your friends and family have to understand that.
---
If you told me only 1 piece of loot then i qould leave after i got mine yeah
---
This was like one of the very first news related to classic XD
---
Ya that's why progression guilds take time clearing raids..... They are easy in comparison to now but they still required a certain level of specing to progress in.
---
People in PvP spec raiding happened later in Vanilla once most people had gear from the raids above MC and Ony or had BWL/AQ on farm.
---
Especially at the start of a server where everyone's in greens/blues.
---
Dunno why I would respect multiple times a week. I'd get geared and master my engineering then respec PvP and focus on that. One respec..... Not even 50g.
---
I like this answer the best
---
No point playing over 30hz unless you prefer it.
---
Well, I'll be making my 8th Hunter.
---
Hey, to each their own, I've seen setups like that, seen one with an ultrawide in the middle and two curved on each side for 3 total.
---
It just seems like overkill for me. I don't even like having that much viewing on the sides. I do some photography in my work and I'm hardwired to avoid dead space in photos, playing wow on a big stretch like that just makes me think of a photo with a lot of dead space lol
---
I'm weird though.
---
Why don't you actually just check the log site with actual logs instead of just posting anecdotal shit?
---
A man of culture I see, only 1 monitor
---
Yeah, just going in this time around people know how much these BoEs will be worth in the future. The in game population completely sucks compared to in Vanilla imo, so I don't really know what to expect.
---
&gt; STVietnam, the main reason to play on a PvE server.
---
STVietnam, the main reason to play on a PvP server.
---
I haven’t been watching as many streams but the issue with Paladin DPS is that there’s no real sets for it and other classes scale better. 
---
It might look good now, but it falls off.
---
I'm allways wondering how 120fps make the difference.
---
Do you all have reaction times below the 17 millisecond range, or how does it benefit you?
---
He's right though. That's the only solution for endgame druid and if you don't like healing, you're out of luck.
---
Aren't balance druids really good in bfa? I saw some new raid content and top 3 were all balance.
---
Turns into a lightsaber with enchants, too!
---
Both are good. Orc has the edge in PvP for the stun resist but WOTF is still amazing, especially if you hate losing mirror match ups as much as I do.
---
In PvE, wotf helps in some boss fights and the shadow res racial makes UD bis for tanking twin emps in AQ
---
Was happy to see one of these without an alliance banner, then I finally noticed the monitor... That aside, looks awesome!
---
Nah, don't be sorry. Not worth it, you still put forward your point :)
---
Yep. Albeit golds harder to come by so you're talking respecing when you get total points avail to get a big skill in diff tree. So like every 5-10 levels would be considered often. 
---
The main thing that makes it hard is classes with varying stats that are weighed not as even throughout. For priest your spirit intel will work all 3. But for a enh/ele shaman id have to keep extra spirit gear if i ever wanna go resto
---
Any weapon from BWL looks better.
---
The only reason they didn’t is because they’re Alliance only. It’s why both classes end up being healers in raids as well.
---
And many clearly don't exercise that right
---
What yiu mentioned a definitely sounds like overkill to me too. But just two monitors, or one ultra wide is almost perfect.
---
You're not weird at all, just different. 👍
---
Found the UD rogue
---
My main in vanilla was a holy priest and i leveled him by healing dungeons. I remember this was horribly inefficient, but can't remember if it was better to a) level shadow and switch or b) quest/grind mobs as holy. Anyone remember?
---
Have you ever seen a good hunter tho? Can easily beat locks and definetely ret palas with full consums, good pet micro and melee weaving with wf
---
Generally orc is considered better because of the stun resist and the pet damage boost.  
---
Play what you want though!
---
God damn you must be a blast at parties.
---
I played gnome Lock from the beta to tbc. Now I'm wondering if I should switch to mage. Mages will be an overpopulated class, but probably since everyone is saying that locks will be the least played class (and you will find a slot for sure) everyone will play them! What do you think? Can you help me to decide? Thanks!
---
"Closer to vanilla" as far as they can guess from watching old videos.. All of the formulas were guessed. Mobs have different armor values, different resistances, completely lacked a ton of abilities. There are SO many back end features that had to be haphazardly reverse engineered with absolutely no control to compare against.
---
Leatrix Plus.
---
What does this have to do with warlocks?
---
If you lead then in a circle with cone of cold later on you can get them stacked up really tight, problem is when one or two resist the nova.
---
Warcraft: Let's Go Sylvanas and Anduin
---
Good attempt
---
It is!
---
Yeah its still trash
---
I like the Kingsfall dagger too ngl
---
and shamans? i will play my ele shaman
---
Nah, night elf druid.  Obviously if you don't like PvP you don't like it, sometimes it's fun to take a break from leveling to get into a brawl.  I did that recently in a private server, friend and I went to Shimmering Flats and got into massive brawls with horde.  Looking forward to doing that in STV too.
---
If your only experience of STV is you getting ganked while trying to quest, well then you didn't respond to the PVP.  Gotta band together and fight back for it to be fun.
---
Played as a priest to rank 12 PvP wise and cleared most of naxx. It’s purely situational, there are going to be fights where you absolutely need a shield, the prebubble thing is just not true. In many cases, sure, if it’s a mob of 3 non elites it’s going to leave your warrior rage starved and a hot is just going to pull all the mobs to you. 
---
Against bosses? Big pulls? Etc. throw a shield and hot and sit down and drink and as soon as aggrod fade. Any decent warrior should have the shield knocked off and sunders going out like crazy, and you are at full mana, he’s at close to full health and way ahead in rage.
---
In PvP same goes, a room turtling a flag in wsg? He’s absolutely getting a shield and a hot. It’s his job to take the burst yours to bust up the pile with a physic scream. 
---
Pallys are fantastic in PvP, but be prepared to just sit permanently sheeped and feared, especially if you aren’t playing with a gold priest.
---
Most humans cannot react that fast no, but the motion of the game can look smoother, especially in a fast pace game, personally I can't tell the difference at all in a game like wow (I honestly don't think most people can but many claim to)
---
My 27 year old best friend did.  We thought the same.  The walls on his ticker were to thin.  Nobody knew.  He went to bed thinking he had a cold. :/
---
Life is precious.
---
Yep, people would always cry about "$15 per month", but really, compared to most other forms of entertainment, $15/mo is pretty cheap.

Hi, /u/justsomespecial

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6zqkt/what_class_you_definitely_wont_roll/). 
---
Just have him or you run to the Zepplin outside of UC/ outside right of Orgrimmer entrance and just one of you go start at the other zone. It takes maybe 30min max and wont matter which race you choose.
---
You need to clean more than once every 15 years
---
This.
---
I soloed quite a lot elites with my hunter back in classic, even some 60 dungeons are partly doable with t2
---
If you're not DS/Ruin then you're doing something terribly wrong
---
Mines priest or mage because I mained warlock. What you leaning towards?
---
Why do the mods let this repost every 2 days?
---
You don't need fast reaction times, it's about your eyes getting the new visual information sooner. If the new frame appears 8ms sooner then you can react 8ms sooner regardless of how long it takes you to react. But the more tangible benefit is smoother motion, which is definitely noticeable.
---
Yeah but there’s a difference of feigning in combat and feigning on the side of the road. I’d bet it’s much more likely someone runs passed a corpse they come up on rather when they are in combat.
---
More likely not guaranteed.
---
This guy games. For me it’s 100% worth it just for the fluidity. Even if you’re just running around, everything looks and feels smoother and 60 FPS no longer feels like I’m getting the full experience of any game. It’s not needed for WoW but it’s nice to have.
---
Everyone thinks so, he's just too delusional to see it himself and his paranoia leads him to believe that it's some major conspiracy from Blizzard or the retail players.
---
He's irrelevant and toxic and the sooner he moves on from WoW the better.
---
Please explain to me how I am supposed to "respond" to people 7+ levels higher than me attacking me while I'm fighting mobs
---
No, I don't want to fuck around "banding together" and "fighting back" against random other people, who are then going to target me in return and interrupt my questing even more. If I wanted to PvP I'd join a battleground.
---
Bombay
---
You not blocking me also makes no sense. All you have to do is report this comment for anything and it will give you the option to block me :)
---
Bullshit. In my Guild all Warriors were 31/20 including myself, we never had any Fury-Warriors. 
---
I would never gimp myself for PvP. I did the same thing with my Rogue and obviously did not went full Combat and I think no other Rogue did that. 
---
Fact is: Only retards would go Combat or Fury on a PvP-Server.
---
&gt;I found a post by a guy named   
---
&gt;u/Carpaintergeril  
---
&gt; that I shared here but it got some hate calling me a lazy poster  
---
&gt;Thanks for the post man.  I'm not sure why people suck like this.  They called you lazy for sharing information?  So stupid
---
If your warriors werent in the #2 slot they were just bad
---
Orc. I know I'll get downvoted for this but undead is the worst race in the game. It has the smallest amount of benefit and most of the other racials are much better.
---
Hunters do melee in pvp. Not intentionally ofc, but they are forced to. 
---
Besides: warriors use 1hs for pve, so they dont even use the 50% of the weapons potential (the stats)
---
Hunters 50% usage &gt; warriors 0% usage. 
---
Hunters get priority.
---
Appreciate it
---
Yes, I'm sure that emulated data and mechanics are far closer to original than the company that actually has the data. 
---
How many things has blizzard come out and said "you thought it worked this way but it didn't"?
---
Come on, think logically about what you're trying to argue.
---
I believe its ShestakUI.
---
Just to clarify here: you think a 7 second kill is relevant to anything at all?
---
That’s like looking at HFC numbers a year after progress was over and thinking you could’ve killed every boss with 18 mages when it was current.
---
This. No race changes in vanilla. Play what you enjoy looking at. People really glossing over how long it will take the average person to reach competitive max level, I'd more worry about hating the look of my tauren feet and stuff 150hrs in than if im at a slight disadvantage in hypothetical even combat
---
Feral is great for quests, dungeons, soloing, farming.
---
In vanilla we never raided with one though, didn’t bring as much dps
---
Neither will help a raid, no priority needed. Whoever gets it, gets it.
---
Priority only counts for raid-usable gear. Ironically, the only class that will actually use it in a raid is Hunter. Sooo...
---
Again, you're not refuting my point. Your only argument is that dishonest players ruin the fairness. Well yeah. Dishonest players suck.
---
There are two ways to handle a dishonest player.
---
One: blacklist them and make it hard for them to group in the future.
---
Two: Join them and roll need as well.
---
My point is that pservers allowed personal greed to make everyone go with option 2, to the point where it became the self-proclaimed norm. You basically just created an artificial rule to make yourself feel better about needing on an item you're going to sell. The desire for gold is literally the definition of greed.
---
I remember getting ganked by a Shaman in Darkshire wearing this full set when I was leveling my first character in vanilla, shit was so bad ass.
---
I’m not going to deny myself what my heart of hearts wants.
---
I want to be a rogue, like I was in vanilla, and I want to gank horde
---
Yeah. I haven't tried tried to get in touch with him, just on YouTube. So I guess he mainly streams on twitch :)
---
Hi not going to deny myself what my heart of hearts wants.
---
i want to be a rogue, like i was in vanilla, and i want to gank horde, I'm dad.
---
You're not going to have Arms Warriors in your raid.
---
warriors are fury in pve,though. So a 2h is for pvp (offspec) just like it would be for the paladin.
---
I linked whatever it opened on for you to check, on mobile so I didn't change any settings.
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
Nope, everyone has that, but everyone can’t access it. You answers your own question in the last first words of your post.
---
Tested with prot warrior. No builds are saved atm and for the BiS list it shows me 2h weapons. When i switch to 1h, it gives me the worst weapons for tps and defense.
---
Didn't test for other classes/spec, but so far it is a 0/10 from my side.
---
It makes no difference to your performance, it just feels nice.
---
PVE servers are fine for you then.  If you're being ganked by high levels of the opposite faction, there are probably high levels of your faction who'd like to fight them.  Just call on them.  Just saying there are always ways to respond to these things.
---
From the sound of it though you don't really like any PVP which isn't lateral.  That's fine.  A PVE server is perfect for you.  World PVP is lots of fun for me though and I'll take a few inconvenient deaths in STV over the world being boring and unfun at 60.
---
A solid 6.5/10
---
Unfortunately yes they are.
---
I recall them being really good in some patches in legion too.
---
Druids should not be high DPS, it makes 0 sense. They are tree hugging hippies.
---
cringe thread
---
I feel like people like you really underestimate the value of friendship, my dude.  We aren't all aiming to clear and farm content as fast as possible.  Many of us just want to goof around in discord with our friends for 2 to 6 hours each week, and raiding provides a nice backdrop for that.
---
&gt;whines like a bitch
---
Also
---
&gt;complains that the community is toxic
---
It's a solo farming / pvp spec for paladin. It makes perfect sense for paladin to not be a PvE dps class.
---
Im the same type of player. For me ive decided to go shaman. All 3 playstyles are distinctive enough i feel itll help be able to refresh if i get burnt out being in melee range so long getting kited- just swap ele and pew pew big chain lightning crits. Till i get a 2h that makes me wanna play windfury lotto again. Then bored and resto for my boys to chill. Tons of utility and solo capable of world stuff. 
---
Priest is my 2nd. Both have good class fantasy but shaman totems are just dope having 20 or so to just be able to use in niche situations. 
---
Retail i main frost dk/ mm hunter so i just love fishing for those big numbers. Chain light crit and windury procs seem most in line
---
It depends on what aspect of the game you're focusing on. In raids the pet damage doesn't help you because locks are either running DS/Ruin and saccing their succubus, or SM/Ruin and keeping the imp on passive for blood pact buff - usually in the tank group
---
I think the Classic Team is trustworthy. I agree that the WoW dev team has done a lot to harbor mistrust, but the Classic Team seems on the up and up. I have faith this will turn out well.
---
I know I didn’t understand it either I’m just trying to help my fellow WoW lovers out a little but oh well this post seems to be well received! Thanks for the comment :)
---
Still remember some guys nicknames because of guild loot drama that happened in this game like 12 years ago.
---
Shadow Weaving only becomes worth it when you have at least 5 Warlocks. In such an extreme min/max scenario, that is unlikely.
---
These are the only expansions I need to play again, after mop the game is over for me
---
I think a week-long level 20 "stress test" is more likely.
---
What’s a phone?
---
uh US is in the same boat 21 full time server and 15 credits
---
don’t you dare
---
WPVP was way way way WAY WAY WAY more than """""just a few""""" deaths. Every single contested zone was a 24/7 battleground and every single enemy player would gank you on sight.
---
Sorry, I don't like being stressed and anxiety-ridden because an enemy could smack me dead at any minute. I play games to relax and have fun, not to be on-edge at all times. I just want to collect my 10 bear asses in peace.
---
Because they're sooooo amazing in PvP. I hear they're the most popular spec.
---
I guess the last 6 expansions have been wrong about them all along.
---
I recall people using the glowing brightwood staff and headmaster's charge, just because they were purple. So I would say yeah people were kind of stupid. Sure by AQ and Naxx people learned a bit, but you can look at old videos of the very top guilds and say, what the fuck were they thinking.
---
Daaaaaw 😘
---
Against some classes, yes, against others, no.
---
Want to be top3 dps in raids but mainly aiming for #1 What class would suit me the best? Im new to wow so i dont know much about the game. Generally said i get veery bored if there is no competitive aspect of the game. That said i like to participate ono nline tournaments as well as offline lans in many games. 
---
So classicwow is not this kind of game yet i would like to play a class thats highly competitive in PVE raiding guild and server wise.
---
Nice! Thanks for the extra info I’ll look into it all when I get a chance :)
---
Should abortion be illegal?
---
Yeah, I played Vanilla as well, and good luck if you think people are going to be that bad this time around. Nearly everyone was a clicker, barely had macros, back pedaled, etc. Now, it's the opposite. Very few don't know their class, back pedal, click. 
---
The impurities of classes are going to show much more because the average player is *muuuuuch* better than in Vanilla.
---
Lmaoooo
---
Loot Trading is in Classic raids buddy. They added it to prevent the need to ever contact a GM.
---
Wasn't dealing any damage anyway. Good time to take a few screenshots
---
Thank-you so much!
---
Or just, you know, dispel.
---
To clarify, I wasn’t even aware of the his perk. I was surprised to receive it, seemingly out of no where. I just have my sub setup to auto-renew every 6 months because it is the cheapest per month cost available.  
---
I do agree that rewards in game are more exciting  /enjoyable / appreciated when you have to work for them. For example, grinding angler’s rep to get the Water Strider at Nat’s took me close to a month, and now everyone just gets an item in the mail that lets all their mounts walk on water. Or grinding archeology for the Spirit of Eche’ro Mount.  So, I’m really looking forward to Classic.

I was playing 8.2 last night, I tried to talk to people while questing, doing lfr, pvp and in the city. No one would respond. The content itself was cool but it didn't feel like an mmo, it felt like a singleplayer rpg which isn't terrible but wont keep me subbed for long (will be only for classic really)
---
Soulshard farming,... Yuck!
---
So IMO this "take your time" thing has become a bit of a circlejerk here, so let me express my more moderate view.
---
I am planning out my leveling route.  Not because I'm trying to "race" to 60, but because it's easy to make lots of mistakes when leveling that cost time.
---
For instance, the quest "Dry Times".  You have to go to Duskwood, Stormwind, Goldshire, and complete the Hops turn in.  If you don't plan for this quest, completing it can take tons of running and flight paths and you'll waste 20 minutes just getting the stuff to complete the quest.
---
If you do it right, though, you end up in Redridge pretty early on to do some quests, and you pick it up.  Then you grab the alcohol as you do other turn-ins in all of the same locations, which there are a few in each spot you have to go to.  By making a few notes on this I can save myself time and headache later.
---
Does it make leveling faster?  Yeah, of course.  I've leveled a test character a few times on private and my 1-20 went from about 24 hours to 17 hours by optimizing the route a bit.  But that wasn't because I just want to race to endgame, it's because I don't want to waste time doing a bunch of unnecessary running.
---
I think people underestimate just how much time is wasted on travel and running when doing unoptimized leveling.  Making some notes to remind yourself of important things to do is not a bad idea.
---
I highly doubt that the majority of people did click on their abilities almost 1 year into the game and long lvl 60. Cmon lol. What an ignorant sight on things. 
---
Also the Potential future Ret Paladin is better aswell. We’re all generally better at MMOs now.
---
There’s no need for a PUG blacklist in Classic.
---
In an MMO you would get little no no gameplay advantage, especially when most things have quite long casttimes etc. where it doesn't matter if you can react 6ms faster. 
---
Competitive shooters on the other hand are almost unplayable at 60fps as you are at an extreme disadvantage.
---
OP's username checks out.
---
yes. its unreal to play at60hz game looks like trash
---
Which is why you don’t give out any loot until the entire raid is over.
---
&gt; Useless once someone hits max herbalism
---
They are actually still useful, black lotus requires 300 skill and will actually fail quite often at that level. With these you get a much better chance of picking them up. You wouldn't want one to get stolen from under your now.
---
That makes no sense. If a Warrior can use it and get high rank in PvP then they will have gear that helps them raid better and other drops can go to other players in the raid. It's Win/Win.
---
Also, if a Warrior gets. 2h from a raid in the first few weeks of launch, they will be using that 2h while raiding until they get better weapons for Fury, which could be a while. You're still helping your raid progress more so by giving it to a Warrior vs Hunter.
---
Also some people only raid to get equipment for PvP.
---
You’re very welcome :D
---
It is not the reaction, it is the crisp animations and movement, especially when you turn.
---
The amount of people that ask this question is staggering.
---
If it is successful, then they won't need to monitize it. The more the subscribers dropped from retail, the more they had to monitize it.
---
Until you see the same hunter dead on the side of the road near popular quest hubs for 3 days straight.
---
In a fresh 60 environment if a Warrior gets a 2h he's going to be using it in raid for a while until he gets two 1hs that do more than said 2H.
---
Also if you're progressing as a guild with a bunch of fresh 60s I'd rather the 2h go to a Warrior who can increase his DPS much more than a Hunters DPS would be increased by it.
---
It makes a difference but not a big one in a game like Classic. Most of the action is pretty slow, so the increased refresh rate won't really be noticeable. 
---
That being said, things like Flight paths and Ragnaros emerging out of the Lava will look smoother. 
---
As far as eye strain, not sure it makes a difference.
---
First class I played in 2004 was Pally, this time it's going to be a Shaman and the decision is final...until I actually get to the character creation screen
---
Lol paladins at number 5 and cites tipsout as a source. I'm gonna go ahead and say you're mentally challenged.
---
My fear is that some retail players will try leveling, run out of quests in Westfall and struggle, then post complaints that leveling in classic is "broken".
---
Some people have this idea that leveling should be a set of quest markers you run to and complete without any thought to what's going on around you, and any mild inconvenience means the game is obviously "BAD DESIGN".
---
So yeah, I agree with you.  I'd like to see true fresh blood in WoW classic.  And hopefully players who whine about difficulty can be quarantined to a forum where they can yell into an abyss for hours where we can't hear them.
---
Don’t act like those two are the same things.
---
I eat poop.
---
This!
---
Ret paladin with consumes+oil+chilli will still be half of the DPS of any other class. Lmfao
---
Feral is way ahead than boomkin and ret
---
A hardcore raider isn't getting Rank 14.
---
Found the British dude who probably eats pills for breakfast.
---
In BGs when they didn't see you coming maybe. If you're a mage, and you actually let an Enhancement shaman touch you (and you see him coming), then you're extremely bad at the game
---
They aren't the best in PvP, but much better than PvE dps for sure.
---
The original idea for paladin PvE dps was, is that they have their seals and then use auto-attacks and have their globals free so they can use them to throw buffs, heals and be a mix of damage and support. If you don't believe me you can listen to Kevin Jordan talking about why paladins didn't get an attacking ability.
---
Obviously this failed as an idea for raiding since it's more optimal to be specialized for a role, but I'd rather have paladin DPS being useless than paladins doing as much or more damage than a class that was designed to do damage like a mage or rogue.
---
Pure damage classes not being top DPS makes absolutely no sense. The dps specs of healer classes should be for solo and PvP, never pure PvE dps, maybe PvE dps and support like shadow priest, but nothing more.
---
Level 10 quest might be locked to region. As a Dwarf Paladin, I could not do the Elwynn Forest Level 12 class quest, I had to go to IF.
---
[BUT, last stress test, I ran a gnome to Northshire, you can do the L2 imp quest.](https://clips.twitch.tv/CoweringSparklySandwichRuleFive)
---
No idea if you can do Blueberry quest in Elwynn tho.
---
If you factor in gold sinks, like npc material cost, I'd say you're on point.
---
"In my guild" 
---
Cool story bro. I'm many more guilds than yours they do things differently, and yes on PvP servers.
---
Plenty of people min/max spec for PvE to get established for PvP then respec.
---
Or they just aren't poor and don't mind respecing once or twice a week.
---
What is wrong with you
---
Oh wow, I remember doing this too.
---
Ah realistically chances are he dont live past ,72. Mid life crisis is just when you find out your probably never gunna be able to do some things again if your life so you get your fill while you still have time.
---
Right now only the stats for a single piece of gear are considered, so a two hander has a higher value than just a one hander. I can see where this gives weird results for a general prot warrior search.
---
For 1h what weapons would you expect to see?
---
In classic pretty much the biggest limit to dps in raids is NOT how much damage you're actually capable of during, but rather how much damage you can do before you get aggro. In later expansions it's pretty much a total non-issue in comparison - yes you may pull aggro if you suck or your tank sucks in later expansions, but it was nothing like the constant balance of threat vs damage in classic.
---
Tanking is more difficult in classic because you have less tools at your disposal and generating threat is more difficult. That's why you'd even have some tanks specced as fury or arms because the extra threat was way more important than additional mitigation. This is why it was pretty much top priority to gear your main tank before everyone else - if you geared everyone at equal rates your raid would be more likely to wipe because it would require better play on the part of everyone else to not rip aggro, they'd have to hold back. Delete those damage Meter mods if you're playing horde as a dps and install a threat meter mod instead, because focusing too much on your dps as horde gets you killed.
---
With that in mind, paladins gave alliance a huge advantage in raids. They have a blessing that lowers threat generation by 30%, which is simply massive. Thats 30% more damage your raid can do before pulling aggro. This made most fights much, much easier. Your tanks would take that buff off while the rest of the raid kept it on, so you had a lot more leeway when it came to dps. 
---
Paladins are pretty much the reason alliance was better than horde in group content, and made raid makeups and viable specs very different between the two factions. Because of paladins, alliance had better buffs (other than windfury) and could last much longer in fights on AVERAGE than horde. Obviously there were always outliers.
---
 Horde was typically better in disorganized content because of the better racials. Horde also had the option of letting warriors use 2 handed weapons in raids because of windfury, while alliance didn't really have that option - dual wielding is strictly better for warriors when raiding except when you had very bad 1 handed weapons and a good 2 hander. 
---
That threat ceiling is a big reason why bliz realized they had to bring paladins to the horde in TBC, because it was getting harder and harder to balance raids when one faction was flat out better than the other. They gave shamans a totem to sort of balance it out in classic but it wasn't enough. Even though shaman had aoe heals and paladins didn't, it still was a big advantage to the alliance because paladins could keep healing after every healer in the raid went OOM, and could heal all the melee in the raid via a seal. Horde raids simply didn't have the staying power that alliance raids had because of paladins. 
---
I hope this was helpful!
---
I used to run that one too, you'd pick up BoE epics for 1 copper.
---
Don't worry he will be on different layer each day
---
It can be good if you have lots of heals and are good reclicking the flag after vanish. 
---
In general it’ll be better against casuals than against premade
---
Thanks for all responses
---
Didn't notice I said 14. I said high rank. 
---
Many hardcore raiders are also high ranked in PvP for certain pieces of gear. Some of them manage to get R13/14 at least once for the gear as well.
---
I remember a lot of Warlords in the Horde Progression guilds on Black Dragonflight
---
&gt; WPVP was way way way WAY WAY WAY more than """""just a few""""" deaths. Every single contested zone was a 24/7 battleground and every single enemy player would gank you on sight. STV was 10 times worse because people were actively seeking out PvP there and you had level 40+ people going to the northern part of the zone specifically to gank the low 30s, level 60s camping nesingwary, roaming gank groups everywhere, etc. etc.
---
Yah you're exaggerating to all hell.  Also remember in classic there won't be 60s ganking unless you take uber long to get there.
---
&gt;Sorry, I don't like being stressed and anxiety-ridden because an enemy player could smack me dead at any minute. I play games to relax and have fun, not to be on-edge at all times. I just want to collect my 10 bear asses in peace.
---
Yah, go roll on a PVE server.  You don't need to reregister your complaints, you can't handle ganking, I get it.  You'll throw your keyboard or whatever.
---
&gt;World PvP is nice in concept, but in execution, it's just ganking.
---
If you think this, it means you've honestly never experienced world pvp.  Just straight up.  In my experience the point of ganking is to invoke retaliation, not just to kill random people.
---
Go play on a PVE server, you don't need to justify yourself and the words will be wasted here.
---
Not very good? They are probably the only spec that *can't* raid, period. No taunt. Can't tank.
---
Is that table sturdy enough? I want to pick up one that is similar but idk about those legs.
---
I guess it remains to be seen whether my info is correct. It might just be an overlooked detail among PS.
---
Vanilla isn't necessarily about optimal.  You want a little bit of everything because just about every spec brings something different to the table - usually some sort of aura buff, which is cool!
---
LUL
---
This is the value of a lengthy leveling process. You get plenty of time to get better with your character. Try to do each dungeon once or twice to get those experiences and to find people to play with.
---
You need 3% spell hit in PvP.
---
Refer to the chart above. A player of the same level as the target will miss 4% of the time with 1% hard coded spell miss. Meaning the effective PvP hit cap is 3%.
---
After watching hamster wheel farm all the mats he needed for consumables for naxx40. I cringed. 
---
Also melderon's video about world buffs, made me realize for normal raiding their not worth the effort.
---
i, too kept my copies. except for MoP because i didn't play.
---
The FOV fix is already in classic. You won't need to change anything
---
It amazes me that people think they understand economics, because supply and demand.
---
atiesh IS sick, with the animations and stuff. Absolutely a beauty.
---
but only on a druid.
---
All players will be called noobs at one point or another. 
---
Even in vanilla there were older, better informed, experienced MMO veterans playing the game. Some of these would call people out for making mistakes but usually it's some douche on a power trip.
---
My recommendation is always ask questions, always listen to feedback, and determine if the advice given is worth following. 
---
There are enough people playing the game just looking to have fun that you shouldn't feel pressured to study or treat the game as a second job. Be social in the game and you'll find your clique.
---
Im going mage because i want to blizzard farm.
---
The true answer is always in the comments
---
Lol this dude really thinks he's gonna tank on a pally. They don't even have taunt man.
---
&gt; Yah you're exaggerating to all hell
---
So the 4 years I spent playing on pvp private servers was just a hallucination I guess.
---
&gt;You don't need to reregister your complaints
---
And you don't need to keep replying if my opinions offend you to the point of insulting me over and over like this.
---
&gt;If you think this, it means you've honestly never experienced world pvp. Just straight up.
---
See:

For the Horde!  :)

Great bot
---
If you move your camera you can definitely see and feel a difference between 120fps+hz vs 60fps+hz. But that's pretty much it, it's mostly the camera movement. Worth it for me tho I usually cap wow at 90 or 100 fps so my gpu and cpu are almost completely silent.
---
You need to take all warriors and mages DPS and average them out, because all of the mages contribute to keeping up ignite forever, but it only counts for the damage of 1 mage. So yes 1 mage will be the #1 always that doesn't mean mage is the overall best DPS.
---
i've always bad a softspot for plain weapons, Darkstone Claymore comes to mind, BRE has a special place in my heart aswel as Stoneslayer from Uldaman.
---
Yeah, if Blizz gave out more beta keys and the servers weren't dead.
---
&gt; you guys all have phones right?
---
I would 100% play WoW on my Nintendo Switch if that option was available.
---
I agree it's when you turn the camera rapidly that it becomes noticeable
---
Great response
---
No. Actual vanilla player here. We called it VC since day one. Stop spreading lies
---
Feral off tank is viable in some scenarios and honestly I don't believe in gatekeeping so anyone can play whatever they like. Sure if might limit their guild and raid opportunities but that's up to them to deal with. Some people don't ever raid.
---
Pro tip, if Beta shows up in the “In Development” section delete it. It will then disappear from your launcher if you don’t have access.  
---
As has been reported hundreds of times and confirmed by Blizzard: Everyone who has the Beta client installed from the first stress test has this in their launcher now so that they can delete it.
---
Because your experience 100% contradicts mine.  Of course I'm going to say there was something off with your experience, when getting in large open world battles was pretty common in my experience.
---
Hey, just a little comments because I cannot reply to you all guys:    
---
this post is a meme...    
---
this post was NOT aimed against priests, they are awesome and I think I may roll shadow for PVP...     
---
I wanted to troll you and put DK in the red but decided not to. imo warriors are really strong and I think I'll actually roll warrior because I can tank and dps and pew pew in BG premades (I want to go rank14)...     
---
paladins and shamans are missing because ~~I'm lazy~~ this is original picture and I didn't want to ~~use photoshop~~ change it, I have nothing against them (I still play my ret which I started in vanilla)...     
---
I think I may actually roll rogue, because that way I can go rank 14 AND be solo ganked when people quit and leave me in the Azeroth alone (I'm looking at you, Dave, Mr. family guy who is so fcking mature now...)    
---
props to the dude who figure out this is from "Pink Floyd" album     
---
Cannot wait for the release... #wearegoinghome
---
If you play it that seriously then you will figure it out. Not everyone is racing to 60. Some of the most memorable moments come from leveling.
---
Those logs are filled with outliers, and world buff exploits.
---
Day one vanilla player here. We called it VC since day one
---
For new players, for sure they should enjoy the adventure to 60.  Having to run all over the world is part of it.  
---
If you want to optimize your questing, go for it.  If you just want to jump into the game and see where it takes you, go for it.  If you want to grind mobs to 60, knock yourself out.
---
Everyone will be playing different.  The circle jerk you are against is targeted at new players that didn't experience WoW the first time around.
---
Pets were always problematic. People often refused to instance with hunters in vanilla with one of the reasons being pet pulling extra packs by stupid pathing/ai
---
60hz = choppy with movement
---
120hz = smooth as butter
---
I promise you, mages will still shit all over you as a gnome warrior.
---
What's different in 1.12 about it?
---
It's a few percent lower than swords, but the trade off is that you can pvp/pve as combat daggers and not feel completely gimped as you are with swords. Also on fights like vael you will be number 1 by a LOOOONG shot
---
My concern right now is less about the money and more about the time. Spending a shit ton on a car is one thing, but the car doesn't by necessity consume a lot of time. But paying $15 a month, well, I want to get my money's worth...
---
8.2 content is pretty much done after 1 day, now it's just dailies. I heavily doubt most big streamers stay at retail for 2 more weeks.
---
I've leveled priest in private servers two times. Once disc/holy (with spirit tap) until 44 and then respec to shadow and first time as shadow all the time. I found disc route better for early leveling with questing and grinding mobs and I always level mostly at dungeons as healer lvl 30-44 and do few quests here and there. It's fast and fun leveling and you get well geared for rest of your journey as shadow.
---
Disc/holy tree made dungeon healing so easy. Starting from 44 you become invincible with new shadow spell ranks and your solo grinding/questing is best way to level.
---
I saw an video of Kevin Jordan saying the reason they didn't is because they couldn't get righteous defense to work correctly on pre bc code.
---
Fffffffffffffffffffffffffffrick
---
Arrow users are mostly Hunters.
---
Amen.
---
Don’t do herb mining, do skinning mining or skinng herb instrad, it messes with the tracking don’t listen to that guy above.
---
Oh man thank you that’d be swell. 
---
Probably Druid, I’m a utility/flex/support player in general so i found it pretty fun to lvl before.
---
Really appreciate it!
---
The person I was arguing with did, yeah.
---
Priest with mind control can effectively solo two elites by making them kill each other.
---
Ret is honestly way the fuck off... and you need to take dorf vs. human into account when gearing BIS for them as well. Agility is great for ret up to a certain point (judgement crit cap). Int is also important if you want to keep consecration going as best you can. Ret could also take advantage of Seal twisting even in classic with vengeance procs and switching to crusader instead of casino, so +SP isn't even that bad, especially when you consider the marginal increase to consecration damage with the 33% multiplier. 
---
You effectively just built out ret paladin "BIS" as an arms warrior, which isn't accurate given the complete nuance to trying to play a ret paladin. I mean, it isn't "terrible", but it really isn't taking advantage of a lot of what ret could do. They weren't the best at anything, but your list really doesn't exploit a lot of what was possible either.
---
I found that if I move through a zone to quicky that I may be a level lower than I wanted to be for the next zone. Mixing in a dungeon was a good way to get some filler xp.
---
Once you go 144hz, you will never ever want to go back to 60hz. It's night and day.
---
It really is true
---
I'd be lying if I said I didn't do this.
---
I am completely new to WoW and will be picking up Classic as soon as it launches. Going to play with 3 friends, 2 vets (Druid &amp; Hunter). Not sure how much we will play together so I am not trying to base my classchoice on that.
---
I can not decide between Warlock, Rogue and  Paladin. I can only play about 15h a week so I prefer not to reroll. Maybe some could help me out with some advice :)
---
I like active playstyles, pressing a lot of buttons, being proactive and reactive to what is happening. I play a lot of action and fighting games. Played 1 month Retail and liked Mage but hated elemental and ench shaman.
---
Rogue fits my description. Stealth combo dps sounds like a lot of fun but Warlocks intrigue me so much. How do Warlock compare to my playstyle? I know that they are beginner friendly and easier to level so that is a plus but I hate standing still and always repeating the same actions. Mages moved around and always had stuff to react to. Is Warlock just letting your pet tank and spam DoTs?
---
Same goes for Paladin. I think they are cool and a hybrid class might be good so I can play different roles but does a Ret and Prot pally suit my playstyle? I know they use a lot of auto-attacks.
---
My experience from private servers is the same. It's too few quests to go from 1 to 60, and I'm sure classic is the same.
---
I have a 144hz monitor and i've noticed at around 100hz is when I stop noticing fluid motion improvements. So I do a similar thing to you and cap my FPS at 100hz so my computer stops acting like a space heater.
---
It’s stuff like this that made the game so good, not this BUY THIS BOAT MOUNT shit.
---
Grats you found 3 shitty expansions
---
That's fair, but I don't think there are *that many* new players reading the subreddit.  It just seems to get posted more than I think is necessary.
---
I haven't played since Cataclysm ended (I started at the beginning of Wrath) and I have never given rogues a real shot before, but since vanilla hunters have to use mana instead of focus and worry about ammo and dead zones, I think the sneaky bursty rogue is going to be more up my alley. 
---
What are some things I should watch out for / worry about with rogues, and how do they compare to most other classes in terms of their ability to make money?
---
There are seriously Streamers who play BFA? That is riduculous!
---
Huh, i'll be honest, I don't watch em. Maybe i'll give them a look, most WoW YouTubers have been really meh lately
---
 
---
My biggest money makers in Classic were mining and herbalism. There are guides for how to level blacksmithing, engineering, and alchemy to max and lists of the supplies needed to complete the guide. I would gather a complete list for the blacksmith guide and offer it all for sale at once. I gathered herbs at the same time, so at the end I’d go finish that list and offer a alchemy leveling list. 
---
Specify the guide you got the list from in your forum post or trade chat post. Someone who wants to become a blacksmith without spending time gathering buys the set.
---
Took the words right out my mouth
---
I keep watching these and I'm still on priest because I know that no matter what I pick, I will have a great time and make many new friends
---
Absolutely, paladin is ok for a casual player. People are really only referring to progression raiding for retadins being a terrible pick. 
---
You'll feel pressure to be holy for casual raiding, but you should be able to find a guild that is happy to have a warm body following mechanics.
---
i mean it brings more utility but i would never bring a cat to raids. I would bring a bear.
---
Haha amazing! Thank you for testing it out for a non-beta pleb :D As useless as this is, since running on foot would be faster, and most hard to reach areas have no shores, this is still awesome info :D
---
I almost threw up in my mouth and slapped my grandma when I saw that list.
---
So have i, and im still 39... mybe is something wrong with my life style...? 
---
Who cares.
---
But I can’t decide what everyone else is running. If everybody in general stops doing AQ20 because there’s a new 20 man that drops better loot, I can’t still “just do aq20” to have fun. You need consistent raid teams that do that. If there was LFR involved you’d be right, but what raids the community deems worthy is not under my control. 
---
Kind of like how I always tried to make Ulduar runs in Wrath, especially during the ICC phase. Nobody wanted to do it because it didn’t drop upgrades. But I still wanted to “have fun” doing Ulduar, but I can’t make other people want to play that way.
---
The game is really simple, what truly sets great players apart is mostly knowledge. 
---
So I think you'll be fine as long as you inform yourself on stuff you are uncertain about with a quick google :P
---
Most raidleaders will explain fights before the pull, but in general you should probably look up tactics beforehand.
---
Even good players get called a noob if they mess up, it's just a word, don't worry about it and associate with nice people.
---
I only found when friends were patched out in 3.3:
---
"Cross-Realm Dungeon Finder
---
The Dungeon Finder is now available, providing players with quick and easy access to five-player parties. This feature connects all realms within a battlegroup using an advanced matchmaking system, making it easier for players of all levels to find a dungeon group."
---
Checked his post history and he’s asking for items in game that have slow/root effects. He has limited knowledge and is spreading misinformation with clear motivates of trying to promote ret being a viable dps. I don’t even get mad because it’ll be him who hits levels 60 and try’s to raid as ret only to be disheartened and likely quit.
---
He (you?) said "Life is precious" I was just curious whether he actually meant "Some life is precious, usually determined by proximity to me."
---
Its the main reason I went destruction while leveling in Vanilla. Shadowburn is an easy way to steal those dirty Alliance souls!
---
You think you do, but you don't. 
---
And the judge will tell you the same.
---
Do yourself a favor and watch the originals, not this abomination.

36 aint mid life crisis, i bang plenty of closet bi dudes at that age who don't want their wives to know about it. What.
---
Warlock is as busy as you want it to be. You can have your pet tank one mob at a time and dps it down.  You can have your pet tank one mob and fear the other, letting your dots tick.  3 mobs or elites? As long as they can be feared, no problem.  EbEarly on not so much, but later on your pet will run into mana issues keeping aggro off of you, so you need to micro manage their auto taunt feature for mana preservation purposes.  You are also constantly managing your health and mana pools.  Lifetap, drain life, healthstones etc... In raids you just spam shadowbolt after putting up your designated curse.  You still manage your health and mana pools though and that does require some finesse to optimize your dps.  For example you want to try to lifetap when you have to move to a boss mechanic anyway.  You want to end the fight completely OOM or you lifetapped too much and lost dps.
---
If you like a lot of different buttons and abilities then I don't think leveling a Paladin is for you.  I believe they are very straightforward and use minimal buttons, but someone else can correct me if I am wrong.  I will let someone more knowledgeable tell you about rogues.
---
I want to believe this is true so badly.
---
and entire weeks too ...
---
Would love this put in perspective. How much dps is mage at the same stages?
---
Beautifully done sir.
---
They are more silly and fun than super serious
---
Holy reach is just a, "That's kind of convenient I guess," talent. In PvE, Holy Nova isn't really used in a raiding environment, but it has some uses for solo farming. In PvP, rank one Holy Nova is very effective for taking approaching Rogues out of stealth.
---
You seem like a really bad team player tbh :P I would probably have kicked you as well
---
That's the real punishment right there. Levelling ret and thinking you're not gonna be bottom of the charts. It's funny because ret lvling is pretty good, so it'll get his hopes up. But as soon as he raids or even does UBRS he's gonna start crying inside.
---
Can 100% recommend icewind dale games. That god dam frozen forest puzzle.
---
hahahahaha! True Story.
---
People are still doing that in WoW pservers. It's scary how many people just never grew up and are repeating the same edgelord racist shit from when they were 14 :/
---
This is where somebody typically mentions r/technicallycorrect I think.
---
Priests are a lot of fun to heal with in dungeons. So many tools to choose from.
---
I bought a bunch of blizzard stock because I think classic wow will revitalize blizzard
---
Yes yes... of course...
---
Im getting late.. emmm...
---
Cya!
---
I can actually do that tbh. Maybe its cause Coke is 300+ a gram in Australia and finishing an 8-ball is expensive.
---
they were really stingy with back-sheathing one handers. i never got that or spiteblade :(
---
Skinning will supplement many of the leveling farming spots and is generally just good. You don't even need to AH the leathers you farm, you can sell most of them right to the vendor.
---
alright wise guy
---
My white damage will fuck you up until I bubble hearth away. 
---
I miss vanilla ret.
---
I considered to start play after they remove it... totally forgot that classic is developed by different team. Now when you told it... I probably start as soon as unofficial language realms will be choosed (EU player here). I dont want to end on some realm where I will understand noone.
---
It does.  Listen to the recent podcast on Countdown to Classic and they explain it all 👌
---
When leveling or doing dungeons, you can play whatever you want. But it’s different with raids. If you want to play a hybrid DPS you have to go above and beyond to make the cut. But since Classic WoW is an MMORPG, emphasis on RPG, if you play the jack of all trades class, it makes sense that people want the masters of dps rather than the masters of none to be dps. 
---
Most of the time, classes that can heal are most appreciated as heals in raids. They’re sought after, they’re *needed*. So a lot of the time it’s hard to justify a handful of specs (but not all) when they would be helping the team out much more as a healer. 
---
So don’t be peer pressured unless you’re trying to do the highest of the highest content. But if you do plan on doing aq40/Naxx, you’ll have an easier time either being heals, or any other dps class if you want to dps.
---
It has multiplayer, but it's not like D2 with servers hosted on battle.net. In Grim Dawn player host server and there can be upto 4 players on the server.
---
I have most fun with build meta and often check /r/Grimdawn for cool ideas. I will be checking PoE after I'm done with Grim Dawn.
---
Does anyone really farm all the mats? I just farmed a bunch of the easiest GPH materials, sold it all and exchanged it for what I needed. 
---
If you can make 100g an hour watching Netflix - theres no need to farm obscure herbs.
---
You sir are a true leader. The lighthouse of your boys. They can be happy! hahahaha.
---
i sort  by new and check the sub regularly, its like 5 a day
---
I could’ve sworn you could rez at a different spirit healer at one point.
---
When you spend 2k on 2004 game Kappa..
---
Bags are awesome. I would often offer to make people bags in the leveling zones if they brought me mats+2 like 8 linen cloth. I would get the skill up and a little extra cloth.
---
That won't work in Classic
---

---
Is the best you get.
---
You might not like it, but I don't see how this addon breaks any of the game's rules...  
---
People have been asking for a streamer free server and this might be the community solution. They even took the criticism on punishing players who don't use the addon and decided to offer incentives instead.  
---
As with all community efforts though, this strategy relies on players trusting a certain group with a lot of power, and from experience in old mmos private servers (Star Wars Galaxies, FFXI, Everquest etc) this always leads to abuse.  
---
Let' see...
---
There are some advantages to an alliance warlock.  Blessing of Salvation (30% threat reduction buff) from Paladins is a god send.  I was always threat capped as a Horde Warlock.  Shamans get Tranquility totem (20% threat reduction totem which only affect the group), but as a warlock I never got a shaman in my group.  All the shamans went to melee groups for Windfury and there were never any left over for the casters.  Mages get talents that reduce their threat, but warlocks are screwed.  Early shadowbolt crits can easily EASILY pull aggro off your tank and wipe your raid. 
---
Secondly there will be fewer alliance warlocks in general.  Because so many Horde go Undead for PVP purposes, Alliance warlocks are less common because so many opponents can break their fear with a racial.
---
As far as leveling up and playing along, mages are warlocks are both solid choices.  You can fend off pvp attacks quite well as both and they are both efficient levelers.  Warlocks can kill some stupidly hard elites if they can be feared, mages can AoE level and have great CC.
---
What a beautiful visual representation of decline. A+
---
&gt; it's the same thing you did to the other guy for their upgrade
---
False
---
&gt; we all needed so it's not ninja
---
Sure if you everyone agrees with you then you won't suffer any consequences, good luck in your adventures.
---
&gt; Any recommendations for race for a priest? 
---
For Alliance, Dwarf is the consensus. Strong racials and Fear Ward which no other race has.
---
For Horde it is actually an interesting choice. Troll and Undead are both very much viable choices in both PvE and PvP.
---
&gt; After reading some guides I think the hyper utility shadow weaving priest seems cool to me since they bring a lot of utility,
---
Sadly, as a raid spec shadow is a broken spec. There's no reason to take a full shadow priest to a raid as opposed to a gimped holy priest who takes the shadow tree just far enough to get Shadow Weaving and spams Rank 1 Shadow Word: Pain when they aren't healing. If you did take a full shadow priest to a raid they would be last in line for gear upgrades because their coefficients suck and they go out of mana quickly so an upgrade does them little good.
---
I loved my TBC raiding shadow priest but sadly it's not a viable thing in 1.12. I say save it for Classic TBC if we ever get it.
---
&gt; but I worry it will be really hard to level?
---
There's no point levelling as anything other than full shadow with wand spec in my humble opinion, at least until the mid-fifties. You can heal every instance comfortably and you do more damage which means you level faster. *Maybe* respec into some kind of hybrid disc/holy thing around 56 or so if healing instances is what you want to do.
---
&gt; Is it bad for a first time classic player?
---
Controversial opinion: priest is 100% the best Horde class for a first time player who wants to be good at the game. The best way to learn what works and what doesn't in 5-toon play is to be the one up the back seeing what everyone else does, and trying to save it all from disaster when the other four screw up.
---
Playing the healer made me a far better tank and DPS.
---
&gt; I could just play it safe and go with a more buffing priest, skipping shadow entirely
---
Bad idea. You will spend 90% or more of your time soloing, and gimping your ability to solo so you can be marginally more effective healing in group content is a very bad trade-off. The improved buffs you get make very, very little real difference.
---
The release of Demon's Souls caused me to unfriend everyone irl. Same for dark souls and bloodborne. It's my kinda game fosho
---
As far as that room goes, how does WKM = Michel Koiter?
---
If anyone has anything to add. Leave it in the comments! Tought this would be welcome
---
This is correct. You need multiple accounts.
---
You just have to keep them on defensive and send them in manually in dungeons.  You have to be more careful with them, but a good hunter won't have any problems.
---
Leveling up hunter pets are beasts.  They do all the work while you sit back eating bon-bons.
---
I meant to watch
---
Youre laughably wrong but fuck that guy regardless
---
Your setup is DYING for a second monitor if you ask me. Even if it's a simple basic &lt;$100 screen. I held off for quite a while (for one reason or another) but I took the plunge and could never go back.
---
Thanks, I'll take a look when I have time. I'd assume if spells get extra range, then the min range of intercept should be bigger as well than it was in Vanilla, so it's possible to do the kiting, just staying a bit further away.
---
There it is!
---
All classes are viable but pretty much any class that can heal will usually be expected to heal at end-game since their other specs aren't as good.  I know people are going to say "you are an elitist, you can MT as a paladin endgame!", it's good to make sure people have a realistic expectation so they don't level to 60 wanting to tank then realizing nobody will take them along.
---
Theres nothing bis on the auctipn house if youre raiding...
---
&gt; world buff *exploits*
---
LOL
---
What class should i play? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Same, i hate how ppl always come in and just goes "why daggers? swords are best" 
---
Yea but what if you just like playing with daggers..
---
SF daggers might require a high crit chance to really shine but they work, same as Combat dagger specs and bonus is you dont have to roll against other sword users for drops.
---
No, it does not effect minimum ranges.
---
Some people really make me question if they played in "casual" raiding guilds in Vanilla.
---
*The hardest thing about being in a casual raiding guild? *Getting people to show up to raids.* I'll take a meme spec over a missing raid spot any day of the week.
---
&gt;I called it this, that means everyone called it this
---
Great work! You should add Lezonta is experienced shadow priest player
---
Ret more than holy, but I recall I was reckoning spec for a good long while. 
---
I always thought base defense was useless except in certain situations where you're supporting the carrier. We're much better at flag carrier support and at returning flags than carrying them, but you don't need prot to run flags. Retribution's repentance will be more useful than anything deeper in prot, and then get a decent tanking resistance gear set to swap to when running. Going a few points into prot for the +hit and blessing of freedom buffs is good too.
---
lol, i was 38 when i first logged into wow in 04...played my 1st poot game in 85 on commodore 64..ahh the memories
---
Dutch? -man endings are rarely used in these days.
---
Fresh raid environment? BWL will be out after molten core and ony, and ZG if I'm not mistaken, thus ashkandi is better for hunters. Your logic is flawed.
---
you clearly have no idea how flat damage works. Flat damage is scaled with all of your attacks first of all. Second of all its not just +50 its more like +300 per target when you crit. Also, if you send your pet into a group of players in premades its dead in 5 seconds. 90% of the time you keep your pat passive next to you and just utilize the howl. Don't respond to me anymore, you are clearly clueless
---
LOL. MULTIPLE ET SSW VERDUN
---
Sorry papa
---
Actually understand the text of the quest and hit 60 instead of accomplishing quests and not understanding what I did as a 12 year old.
---
I could see that.
---
I am always a forsaken warlock because it just looks cool, but lately I've been coming around to orc warlocks.  The orc stun resists (25%) is a big deal in PvP.  In Vanilla the pvp trinkets are class specific and do not break all CC.  The warlock pvp trinket breaks fear, charm and sleep, but NOT stun.  I recently did an undead warlock on a pserver and realized I had 2 fear breaks (WotF and pvp trinket) but nothing to help with stun.  Rogue stun lock was problematic.
---
I love taurens for warstomp.  Warstomp warstomp warstomp.  Plus I just like Taurens.
---
That TO bio, LUL
---
Level 40 mount is actually a spell though?
---
That's really sad. I'm not even planning on leveling a rogue, but losing a high skill mechanic in the game like rogues kiting warriors sounds aweful. Especially since it's confirmed worked in Vanilla.
---
Yeah he's in there! 1 spot away from the bottum. Did not know in what order to put them in. So it's abit random
---
Literally everyone called in vc on my server. I learned it as vc from others on day 2 or 3 when I made it to westfall as my dwarf
---
Realistically if you raid witha guild in either version you'll find yourself spending more time daily to play the game.
---
If you dont raid with a guild, you dont really need to do anything on retail. Since catchup mechanics keep everyone relevant to a certain degree.
---
What do you mean? You can still kite warriors.
---
If it makes you feel good then I guess you made the right choice mentioning it I guess.. Doesnt make that much sense in this scenario tho
---
He corrected someone who said it didn’t exist, with saying it did. Which isn’t ”technically” but ”factually” true
---
Maybe when they first started. Now they feel like the shill-iest of the shills.
---
T actually put out a video defending azerite traits, pre-change even, at the height of the unpopularity. 100% lost any interest in their channel after that and refuse to watch any videos since.
---
I can still remember my Winterspring Thorium route. It's 12 years later but I ran that route multiple times a day for years
---
So you went out of your way to bring politics into a story about a guy's friend passing away, just to contort it into a strawman for your position? Get off your high horse dude. Fucking insufferable.
---
I really wanna play a priest. Healing has always been my go to in retail and holy priest I excell at. But people keep telling me "don't play priest, its so boring, you literally have to only press one heal and then wait for mana to recharge, you're gonna regret it". Mage I think would be cool, but idk what to do.
---
I hope so
---
Hey there - I was a day 1 Vanilla WoW Druid who played 5k hours in vanilla and into BC. 
---
What's your playstyle? How do you want to play? 
---
I plan on leveling feral to 60 (Going 31 into feral and then more into resto) and then swapping to my Resto build (8/11/32) at 55. You can heal all the early dungeons fine as feral while leveling, and will also be able to tank/dps as needed. 
---
Are you planning to roll Resto at endgame - in which case, I recommend a 24/0/27 for raid efficiency or (my favorite) 8/11/32. Threat reduction isn't really necessary in end-game raids.
---
I only have classic, TBC and Wrath. After that i started buying them digitally so no boxes.
---
"That spell power is good for arcane shot!"
---
GM polearm? Huhuran's stinger?
---
What does it feel like to be that stupid?
---
Meh, I disagree. Pretty low effort and the dude didn't even started his sentence with "hi I'm".
---
You'd be better off doing this with an addon that watches the combat log.
---
Start here: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22119-TradeChannelCleaner.html
---
I mean that currently if both the rogue and warrior are moving the melee range of the warrior is bigger than the minimum range of intercept, if there is no deadzone, you can't stay in the deadzone.
---
Its true that warlocks scale much better with later gear levels, but you do just fine and in PVP you are not about DPS anyway.  You are about support and CC.  Sure you are going to help kill stuff, but your fears, curse of tongues, felhunter/succubus are what make your class great at PVP. 
---
A soul link specc'd warlock is ridiculously hard to kill and generally considered king of the pvp dueling class/spec combos.
---
Yep. Also at low levels if you run an alt to lvl 5 you can learn LW (and tailoring) and make 2-3 times the vendor price for your low level skins/linen just be crafting basic stuff.
---
&gt;False
---
well thinking about it yeah, i guess so, what you did was way worse because i only took an item worth 2g while you took an item worth hundreds/thousands xDd
---
I’ll admit itemization was much more interesting when it was hit % and no reforging. When it had survivability and tps to consider. When healers really did go oom. For dps real decisions are made regarding managing your negative stat (hit) and that’s so much more interesting than looking exclusively at ilvl and if the green stats are your two preferred. 
---
For me, gear has been a means to an end since BC, it was only ever in classic that I saw purps and decided I would do what it takes to get them (hello that’s how I ended up playing 30+ hours a week for 10 years). I only care about gear so much as it allows my raid to kill bigger and meaner bosses.
---
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING
---
You backpedal so it doesn't add range, same with hunters.
---
Linus tech tips recently did a video on monitor hz differences in gaming, watch it.
---
Apart from the word condescending, I haven't insulted you. You've thrown around way more insults, and I felt calling you condescending was more than merited. Have I even insulted you apart from that? Would you like me to directly quote all the time you've thrown non-substantive insults for no reason? (Since you're bad with rhetorical questions the answer to the first one should mention this comment, and the answer to the second is no)
---
I'm very unsure of my whole point that loot etiquette is subjective and you should talk to your group about it instead of just assuming you're right is "not substantive."
---
Hehe, noice :)
---
I am considering rolling on an EU sever since my play times will generally be during the day during regular NA east coast business hours. Not many raids going at 10am
---
Works on private servers so yeah?
---
Yeah I had just started college and somehow convinced my parents that I *needed* a $2500 Dell XPS whatever whatever. It crushed games in 2004.
---
You joke....but Hunter's could do meme-tastic damage with Arcane shot using AQ40 cloth gear. My guild stalled on Twin Emps for a while and I started spending DKP on cloth gear for luls.
---
Made BGs fun as hell, and pissed off a ton of clothies in Ironforge.
---
Summer semester has been a breeze this far.
---
I’m worried about fall semester, which starts the same day as classic release.
---
I also have a 9-5 job 40/hrs a week and a gf.
---
I’ll see you boys at 60 summer 2020
---
Ah, that's smart.
---
36 is midlife if you're planning to live to 72
---
DAOC. ❤️
---
Warriors are so good in Vanilla.  Go warrior.
---
Priests had a talent rework in 1.10. I don't know if these talents have been present before, but I feel they're new:
---
* Holy Fire is now baseline, no longer a talent; decent opener/DPM if you let the DoT tick
---
* Searing Light adds 10% damage to Smite and Holy Fire for a 2 point investment
---
* Spiritual Guidance adds 25% of your spirit to spellpower, which adds up rather nicely
---
Between the reworked Holy talents and a 13 point investment into Disc for Wand Spec, Improved PW:S and Meditation I feel that it's a lot better than it used to be, albeit not nearly as good as Shadow.
---
No it hasn't.
---
There is a deadzone without backpeddling while moving against non tauren warriors.
---
And it should be bigger backpeddling should not increase the range of a deadzone- movement should not increase attack range and there is a reason blizzard hasn't corrected us with their reference client.
---
Thanks for at least trying to explain it more. Either way the main game is not in a good spot compared to even 2010
---
That a result of the client change?
---
Too bad they aren't giving us the best version of RP servers. 
---
Unfortunately taking away the PvP tag takes away a lot more from the gameplay experience than RP tag adds.
---
Please give us RP-PvP!
---
That wasn't the point at all. If you want me explain it again I can.
---
My point was that if even for the player for whom the item was an upgrade it was better to sell it, then anyone can need. It is obviously not better for someone to vendor a BOP upgrade for 2g, so you are just going a useless tangent that has nothing to do with the conversation.
---
I meant it's important info for someone who's looking for streamers playing specific class/spec and being good at that.
---
1.5 good expansions.  Wrath never really delivered.
---
Why would he start it with that? It clashes with the joke.
---
Thanks for the worthless addition. It has already been clarified.
---
Technically, battlegroups did not exist at the beginning of vanilla. Then they did exist during the latter half.
---
Ah oke hahahah. added! thanks
---
and my point is who are you to decide if it's better for someone else to sell their upgrade
---
it's obviously better for me to vendor a BOP for 2g than to give it to you and get nothing out of it
---
On that note does any else get put off that the only advertising they are doing for Classic is really getting Streamers in? I’m not on the streamer hate train I think they are good for exposure. But they would go old school . Old commercial reboots Tv spots get the word out. 14 million were playing back then no one I talk to who played even knows it’s coming back except one guy in my office who saw my background was Alliance. 
---
Get the word out Blizz less than 60 days !
---
Wow OMG really, if the inkeep is a lady??? that's really homophobic of you boys have poopers too yknow
---
Priest. The one and only master race. Warlocks and hunters have terrible AI tank meanwhile we have a full party.
---
If you want some solo action then you can make an alt. I'm thinking hunter, rogue or druid as alt. All of them are incredibly fun to play alone but priest is bis for social content.
---
just be what you are most comfortable with that is all I can say. Focus too much on others around you and you can lose your way. This can be associated to real life as well. \~ This is why I never post on reddit.
---
I haven't played Hunter since actual Vanilla, but I didn't have as easy of a time VSing them than I thought. Most of the time I'd win, but it'd be hard. 
---
If they got the jump on me (BGs), and crippled me, I'd feint and trap them. I'd walk soooo slow trying to get some distance, and I really could only concussion and then multishot, and then they'd be right on me again. I'd scatter as soon as they got to me and get some more distance, but sometimes they'd get a blind off or something and they'd get me.
---
What am I doing wrong? I've watched videos and honestly it seems like most rogues they fight don't even use poisons correctly. If I wasn't slowed, it'd be easy. Trap, get distance, aimed shot and kite. The slow completely screws me, and when they get right on top of me with evasion, it's basically gg
---
It was in vanilla and is in classic. Not as we know it on private servers (that it proccs every time), but you can abuse spell batching to make it work.
---

*Warcraft - Koiter, Michel*
---
Like I said, it’s just speculation, but people have combed through the credits and there’s no WKM.
---
I’m an American living in EU, and while I do have friends come launch for easier raids etc, I still plan on playing on US servers. Literally 80% of the content can be pugged and that’s worst case scenario if you can’t find a guild with a semi decent raid time for you. I was on the fence, esp with the leeway and stuff but I’m rolling NA, it really shouldn’t be an issue.
---
&gt; have a range issue
---
you connect the devices with the power of the internet, why would it have range issues
---
He went out of his way to bring his dead friend to my joke, clearly strangers on the internet mean more to you than to me.
---
Correct. A lot of CVARS were removed in WoD/Legion.
---
I did not know about the trinkets being class specific. That’s something to seriously consider. 
---
One vote for Tauren!
---
Money cheap but sure as hell not time cheap.
---
This is simply wrong. Not only is bear tank perfectly viable through nearly every raid boss of vanilla, they are optimal over warriors in a few places. They are far easier to gear up and less dependent on gear overall. They put out far far more TPS than a warrior, especially in phase 1 content. All of the arguments that are made against bears can be levied against warriors just as easily at that stage of the game, except that bears have more inherent health, armor, and TPS. They serve best as off-tanks, but beartank is not a memespec at all.
---
Better computers and internet too. No more lag from shitty internet and bad specs. Lots of people couldn't do more than 10 fps in raids.
---
I'm trying to figure out what country... best I can do is "somewhere in scandanavia".
---
Pitchfork from farmer’s in hillsbrad that only horde could farm
---
Watch out for? Not alot. They have some extra expenses with poison and reagents to cast blind and vanish. I cant think of anything else
---
Other than that they are amazing. Good in pve and pvp. They can farm money by pick pocketing elites which makes for and uniqe and lucrative business.
---
If you wanna play rogue, go for it!
---
C'thun. I don't think naxx was adjusted during vanilla.
---
I have always played an undead for my warlock, but have recently been considering orc.  The Orc 25% stun resist is the only help you get with stuns.  PvP trinkets in Vanilla did NOT cover every type of CC.  Warlock PvP trinket was fear, charm and sleep breaks.  So as an undead you have 2 fear breaks (WotF and your pvp trinket) but no help against stuns. 
---
Also, warlock have bigger threat issues on the Horde side.  An alliance warlock will always have blessing of salvation (30% threat reduction), but as a horde warlock I NEVER got a shaman in my group for tranquility totem (20% threat reduction).  All the shamans went to melee groups first for Windfury and we never had enough for the casters.  That is multiple guilds on multiple pservers.
---
Anyway, just take that with a grain of salt.  I reflexively choose undead warlock for the look, but there are other options that could make sense.
---
I dont know why Paladin players dont like holy. Holy is amazing! You feel like a God of life and death! In pve or pvp, holy paladins CHOOSE who gets to live!
---
Grounding totem, earth shock, stormstrike triple wind fury proc, dance on the corpse. 
---
Every .... single..... time.
---
Your best bet is to just duo lvl and starting from mara and onwards (49+) just weave in dungeons with all the quests. You might take an extra 10 hours to ding 60, but you guys will be in a lot of pre bis, so it’ll be worth.
---
I know you hate melee leeway, but it's not going anywhere.
---
It’s definitely a bug but just for the record I also have the Stress Test client installed and I never had that option so maybe I’m just lucky.
---
Fra Fona endda...
---
Lol you get a triple windfury proc every time? Sounds like you're watching too many unbreakable videos
---
No. You are correct. People take skinning to ensure mount money. Mount at 40 ensures faster leveling and income by getting to 60 faster.
---
&gt;who are you to decide if it's better for someone else to sell their upgrade
---
You and me just like everyone else is their own personal agent so I make that judgement using my own knowledge and experience.
---
&gt;it's obviously better for me to vendor a BOP for 2g than to give it to you and get nothing out of it
---
You seem to keep missing my point and being very egotistical. It's not about what is better for YOU personally, but about what would be better for the would be receiver of the upgrade.
---
We all know that classic leveling is punishing, deadly and unfair.... as a rogue you can help people experience this authenticity better. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Wait there is no rp pvp?
---
Edgemaster handguard is his for DPS warriors till AQ I believe, might be bwl
---
Exactly, which makes correcting someone on either wron, when both are true
---
i remember farming tanking gear but i dont think i tanked any. Besides vael ofcourse :). Is there spesific gear/build for that, like 3x t2.5 for example?
---
&gt; What level should i pick it up?
---
60.
---
Lol? People were still clicking in TBC, as well as everything else I listed. Ignorant sight, hah. The only ignorance here is you if you think the average player isn't MUCH better now.
---

I played feral in vanilla, did up to aq40.
---
Their damage isn't  bad, but starts l falling behind a little once you start raiding to about mid-pack.
---
HOWEVER, in vanilla both cat and bear specs were combined so you could kill elites and survive things other classes couldn't.
---
Including switching to bear when the tank died and saving a wipe.
---
I mean you are obviously being pedantic just for the sake of arguing, but you'd have to be braindead to not know the difference between selling a blue for hundreds of gold and vendoring a bop for 5g
---
I want to play the Gilmour one
---
r/technicallycorrect
---
Prepare to be frost shocked!
---
Cool, the bot can fuck off from this sub tho tbqhfam.
---
You're not gonna have bag space for mining+skinning, just fyi.
---
Just going to vendor everything at first.
---
Thats great man! I would love to put it in there. Thanks allot. Gonna do it in abit
---
Maybe I'm weird, but I would think the person you would most want to hit (and parry) would be the tank who keeps the DPS from getting aggro and getting splatted.
---
Is the consensus it's a dps weapon?  Who decided that?
---
Do daily quests even exist in Classic?
---
And greens that roll high plus shadow or frost DMG, or +healing are bis as well
---
Do your research before you tell people they are wrong
---
and your judgment is that it's okay to ninja as long as what you're ninjaing is expensive?
---
&gt; It's not about what is better for YOU personally
---
except that's exactly what you're doing.  it's better for you, personally, because you have a 20% chance to sell it for yourself instead by rolling Need.
---
I'd give the tank an upgrade before throwing it to a dps to use as an offhand.
---
Son?
---
You aren't going to have enough bag space for vendoring. You're going to be deleting items left and right while you're out questing. No one has room for 2 gathering profs, so just be prepared for that.
---
You'll be missing out on making Rods for everyone leveling enchanting \^\^
---
What beta? It's totally dead..
---
Sometimes it was only a single crit!! I Was geared for crit, and using TuF from AV. 
---
Was on a an active pvp server, was experienced in pvp before i took up raiding mainly AV but did a lot of WSG too. Our server was heavily alliance so we has to get good at world pvp or never get anything done 😊
---
I did like the unbreakable video 🤣😊 
---
Main was a warlock, my shammy was pure pvp hilarity.
---
Nightmare Blade doesnt sheathe on the back tho... atleast not anymore. When i got it before the dragons were removed from the game it wasnt sheathing on the back.  
---
It does look cooler than maladath, if you are going for a darker look.
---
30 minutes a day will get you $1/hour in value. That's pretty damn cheap as far as entertainment goes.
---
I believe this is the reason why they launch as few servers as possible so they have room for TBC and Wrath servers. They can´t possibly do another force migration.
---
Cataclysm wasn’t instanced. And every expansion after that was a new continent and we always had instanced continents.
---
Dwarf priest /thread
---
what? are you sure you've activated 120/144/240 hertz on your monitor? playing below 100 hz for me, even in wow, the cursor feels sluggish and the gameplay is very unsmooth.
---
Paladins probably aren't what you're looking for. While leveling and as PvE healers, they have some of the lowest button use / highest "spam" use in the game. But in PvP, they're much more dynamic and have some amazing proactive &amp; reactive utility.
---
You mentioned enjoying Mages. Mages are among the classes with the most options during leveling and PvP. And while most their PvE playstyle at 60 is incredibly spammy, they have great options for every scenario in every other aspect of the game.
---
warlocks are pretty versatile. The ability to go between casting spells while your pet tanks, running around throwing up DoTs, and utilizing fear to handle multiple mobs sounds like it might be the just the right amount of proactive / reactive playstyle you're looking for.
---
Rogues and Hunters both have pretty active playstyles with some mobility. If stealth and moving around are your thing, Rogue's probably solid for you. Hunters are very easy to play but have a very high skill cap. They only regularly use a couple active abilities, but the skill comes from timing right (kind of like animation cancels) and getting positional advantage through kiting. The combination just makes them feel very satisfying to play.

---
True, there are so many small changes that people don't seem to realize. And a lot of those changes are things that help mages level faster while not really helping other classes that much. Take NPC scripting. Most pservers have some really dumb mob AI. Most caster mobs that I have encountered either don't even use their mana or cast 1 spell before running in for melee. That's obviously something that helps mages. Locking down melee with nova to AOE. You couldn't do that if the 5 caster mobs were all still casting at you. At the very least its more damage taken and more more downtime needed. Doesn't really help hunters or locks very much tho
---
5 a day that you see. I'd imagine even more.
---
Some guilds will bring one shadow priest for the shadow weaving buff.  They can do decent dps if they keep their mana up.  You will need tons of Major Mana Potions, Dark/Demonic Runes, MP5 potions and food, etc...  If they can keep their mana up they are worth it to bring for dps and shadow weaving.  They shouldn't be topping the charts, but they won't be the weak link either.
---
Hey there! I'm Tips Out, and I defrauded California governments of hundreds of thousands of dollars! When we tried for another big payday, the county banned us from trying again, so I called them racists and threatened to sue them personally, because that had worked for us in the past! But this time, a judge ordered me to shut the fuck up and so our company tanked, putting me $25 million in debt. Now I run advertisements in the middle of dueling tournaments to try and stay afloat.
---
It will not be exactly like Vanilla, they are not using the old Vanilla code. Basically, its the retail version of the game they essentially gutted and made into vanilla. There already are a few changes: macros use the LUA and are simpler and easier (you can use showtooltip with the question mark icon), you can trade items up to 2 hours with people in the same instance, sharding and layering, mail system, no auto crit when sitting down so no /sit macros for Pally / Warrior builds. All that said, when you log on and start playing, its going to be pretty much vanilla how you remember it.
---
Oh man FFXI. 
---
For all the people who never played it, if you think classic wow gives you a sense of accomplishment for something, ffxi is tenfold that.  75 cap ffxi made you work, but it was so fun at the same time.
---
Any smart enchanter is going to forget about it until 60 and take skinning for mount money.
---
The highest people might take it is 70 for the Greater Magic Wand's to sell on release.
---
Running on foot can be faster depending on the location. die, rez 10 feet later, die, rez 10 feet later, die, rez 10 feet later, die, rez 10 feet later, die, rez 10 feet later, die, rez 10 feet later, die, rez 10 feet later, die, rez 10 feet later, die, rez 10 feet later, can take a while.
---
Yeah I'm sure lol I have one 60 and one 144 and I only notice a difference if I swing the camera super fast
---
I just slide it down, so ` through 5 instead of 1 through 6.
---
Thought it was some type of air play but I wouldn’t leave my computer on at home to stream something to my phone what’s the point when I can just play on this? With nice comfortable buttons and a full keyboard not on the screen
---
Arbitrage trading between faction AH's
---
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  
---
yay
---
Is there anything comprable to this on BS I could be selling early like Keys or weapons?
---
Oh shit I guess i thought since druid couldnt neither could rogue, but druid also has to be shapeshited which means he cant drink anyway.
---
Yeah, we've been asking for it, there is even a petition but apparently blizzard won't give us one at the start or even ever.
---
it's like your eyes stopped working halfway through my message
---
Maybe allow 1 free transfer per account so if for some reason your server becomes low in pop or just to imbalanced they should allow you to make a ticket to justify 1 free transfer
---
Its literally a fact, theres no technicality here
---
Hm. Could you ghost run from Azshara along the coast E of Winterspring, fatigue die, then drown with a new corpse location, and spirit rez in Everlook?
---
That'd save a LOT of time getting a level 1 character to Everlook.
---
I still get chills when I listen to the soundtrack. That game was so punishing and so immersive. Still prefer classic wow but ffxi had some magic to it for sure.
---
Frost shock and wind fury is very scary. God bless evasion.
---
🌶🌶🌶
---
That's a good one
---
Sandoria bagpipes.... oh man
---
Do you think that means it is not worth it?
---
technically (adv): according to the facts or exact meaning of something; strictly
---
You're just arguing for the sake of argument at this point.
---
No, if you fuck up in the community you deal with the consequences.
---
Yay. Should be able to move. Is totally worth the cost
---
Except Brez and innervate, which can save a raid from wiping.  Also there are a couple raid bosses where a druid tank is slightly preferable to a warrior.  Not many at all, but a couple.
---
This is me. I’m tryyying to be proactive this time around with my keybinds and macros, but we’ll see how in-depth I actually get.
---
Most raid bosses in Classic are immune to taunt - that's not what's holding back Paladins. It's the consumables. Mana sucks for a tank. You can do a passable job if you farm consumables like it's your full-time job, or you can let Warriors and Druids do it while you heal.
---
I played a Druid on a private server where I tanked and healed. The prep work involved for healing is just so much easier. And Druid tanks don't even need that many consumables compared to Warriors and Paladins. 99% of people are going to choose the path of least resistance and heal. But if you really want to make it work as a Paladin tank, I'm sure you can as long as you accept your limitations and actually do the extra work.
---
This is cool, I might do some more shading where the head meets the shoulder so it pops a lil more but other then that sick doodle
---
Everyone on my server called it DM, does that shatter your world view?
---
That’s really up to you, it’s just a hassle you’ll have to deal with.
---
&gt; Mara and ZF are way slower though
---
I would think ZF would be INSANE. Not full clears, but 12 minutes along the left route to Gahz pool, then back out to reset. Could be a great quick route.
---
I do run a specific spec, about midway down subtlety and combat, the biggest problem is getting stunned as it completely ruins your mitigation. Other than that it’s mostly problems with aoe, a lot of which could be solved with a thunderfury.
---
&gt; Pirated realm shitters
---
It will still be worth. My plan is to have multiple bank alts to just mail stuff when ever I see a mail box.
---
And the login music oh boy
---
To increase the odds of strangers recognizing your jokes you could try making them funny
---
Warrior class color isn't red.
---
I can heal as ret or basically any spec.
---
All praise be to Omar, death to the non-believers
---
It's not about worth it or not. Imagine someone ninja looting and then transfering instead of not being able to get a group ever again.
---
Just once I got a roommate to play with me. We spawned a Stuka with him on the tailgun and for like 45 minutes he was bored out of his mind. Then a Hurricane found us and I could hear him squealing in his room while the tailgun went takatakataka. 
---
He never logged on again but he still tells that story. I can't remember if he got the Hurricane. I was a pisspoor pilot so we likely wound up on the deck.
---
Cooldown addons can *easily* compensate. This has the benefit of an uncluttered set of spell bars.
---
I recommend picking a role before picking a class. Like do you like melee, ranged, dps, tanking? Are you going to pvp? Do you like control vs raw damage? Do you want to fill multiple roles? Are you a solo player?
---
If you're indecisive like me just play a shaman or druid and do it all.
---
I do know one is more gold than the other.
---
The question then becomes why does it being more gold allow you to take it from someone who needs it. Since if the gold is an excuse, that applies just as much at 1g as it does at 1000.
---
They are all awesome, but they are all awesome at different things, which is why class guides actually are useful. There is definitely an overabundance of these guides, but having too many is not really a problem in this case.
---
Cheap pala/shaman gear might pop up
---
PvE to PvP should never be allowed, but what they could do is offer free transfer to low pop servers from high pop, or even make it faction specific to even out imbalance (this obviosuly only applies to PvP, PvE server imbalance is completely irrelevant). 
---
Also if they finally add RP-PvP it would be nice not having to starting over because they didn't give it to us from the start.
---
Or download flux, to reduce the blue color that can strain your eyes
---
I think you do, but only if you play it right.
---
You only need 5 skill points per level, and all the money in skinning comes from higher levels. Skinning level 10 mobs for ruined leather scraps which vendor for 70c a stack is not worth the bag space, as you note.
---
So.... don't do that. Just get your 5 skill points a level, and only skin when you are not at all pressured on bag space. And then at level 20+, when you start getting full sets of 8 and 10 slot bags, you can start skinning for real, on level 20+ mobs. 
---
Medium leather is 20 silver a stack, and though I have no idea what bags will be worth at launch, given that bags and money will both be in short supply...but given that the vendor price of the items used to make them is about ~24 silver, I have trouble imagining they will be much more than 60 silver each. So if you just take ONE extra fast trip to town, you are probably bringing enough extra money home from skinning to upgrade a 6 slot bag to a 10 slot, and once you have 56 inventory slots.... you can afford to devote inventory space to skinning mobs.
---
Introspection is in order because what people do on pixels doesn’t make me angry. I’ll be sure to bring that up right away at therapy and have it promptly discarded.
---
Not even collectors, casual
---
Sure, why the fuck not
---
Mages have a similar amount of awesome stuff though. I think they basically took all cool wizard stuff (which there is a lot of) and split it into two classes. And both classes still have more cool stuff individually than maybe any other class.
---
I played horde where it was pretty rarely run, so I don't have a horse in this race.

&gt;This was my very first Rare drop which ***I got from VC Instance***; I loved it so and was hard to part with it.
---
Ruins of Dire Maul [launched on 2005-03-07](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0), so that comment predates the release of dire maul.
---
Absolutely not.  
---
The whole thing about classic was the fact that the community was great.  
---
The community was great because it took most ppl 10-15 days to reach 60, then about the same ammount of time to get a neat set of gear to raid high end game content.
---
Once you've spent 20-30 days played time creating your character you really care about your reputation in the limited player pool that you play on the same sevrer as.  
---
If you ninja loot or play like a fucking moron you'll be recognized as such and it will have long lasting consequences for you.  
---
Beeing able to pay a small sum (compared to the time investment) to erease your reputation and give your character a clean sheet is very VERY bad feature in an otherwise great game.
---
This makes a lot of sense. Especially wrath. Dungeon finder and the aoe dungeons completely ruined the dungeon community (or at least for me).
---
People are telling you priest is boring and you want to switch to mage?!
---
Mage in Pve is literally 1 button. After aq it’s 2 buttons.
---
They are both dynamic in pvp, so no worries there.
---
I was a feral druid up to aq40 (which is as far as we got before tbc was released). People talk so much shit...
---
The average player was fucking terrible back then. As raid leader in TBC I had people cry when I banned anyone doing under 300 dps from gruul, which any scrub who had completed a kara run should have been doing in their sleep.
---
Obviously content is easier if you min max, but it is not even close to being necessary. Everything before tier 2.5 can be done with 25 decent players. You get to take 40.
---
Not sure I want witch hunts in my videogame... I *get* it, I *know*, simply don't be a jackass, but... it's a game.
---
To answer directly, you’ll have to manage soulshards and ammo.  Macros help, but the inventory slots being taken up are still there.
---
Yes.
---
I was ret/holy and found this to be an effective mix for PvP.

[Paid Character Transfer will be in Classic WoW](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo). 
---
No announcement if it will have the original 6 month cooldown, the previous 1 month cooldown, or be like Retail with no cooldown at all.
---
No announcement if it will allow PVE realms to transfer to PVP realms.
---
Ok cool! Thanks!
---
This drives me nuts when micro transactions are justified. Charge me 30..even 55 a month for an amazing mmorpg without skinner box treadmill bullshit.
---
Obviously the difference is bop vs boe.
---
No changes boy
---
It seems that you are confused in your definitions here. In this thread we are discussing our rationales as to why we roll in certain ways on some items, so it is by definition not a ninja since we are advocating as to what should be or what we would like to be the standard behavior in groups.
---
&gt; except that's exactly what you're doing. it's better for you, personally, because you have a 20% chance to sell it for yourself instead by rolling Need.
---
I think you need to reread my post (and my previous ones) as they will clarify what I did not type out in a full paragraph there. That line pertains to as I judge how to roll based on what is better for the would receiver if the upgrade as opposed to what you suggested which is to look at everything from only your own perspective.
---
In fact what you are saying is that if I do not pass on every item in a dungeon/group then I am only looking at it from my own perspective since they would benefit me? That is just a ludicrous suggestion.
---
Seriously. It ruins the fun and makes it a job.
---
oh damn, thanks!
---
Hahah for real? never knew. Well he is still a content creator.. Lots of ppl watch his content. I'm not a judge
---
A lvl 5 enchanter alt is a better compliment to a lw, with that being the main's profession.
---
Why should server type transfers never be allowed?
---
It’s the only point of this post
---
Streamers are an easy and cheap method of advertisement. I’d anticipate that they’ll launch a a web campaign pumping adds out once we’re a month away.
---
As much as I’d love to see some TV commercials, I don’t know a single person in my WoW group that still watches TV.  Then again, it would be awesome to see a “What’s your game” add pop up in YouTube or Hulu.

---
I am in the same boat.
---
I played vanilla and TBC hardcore from ages 12-16. Like 8 - 10 hours a day hardcore. Luckily, I was in middle school at the time so the impact on my grades didn’t really affect my life. However, I always look back thinking about if I was able to channel that time spent on WoW into my academics or into sports, where would I be?
---
Fast forward to today and I am in school full-time pursuing a business degree, working full-time as an analyst for a mid-size company, and I am in a dedicated long-term relationship.
---
As Classic approaches and I get more and more enthralled with nostalgia and playing a game that was pivotal in my upbringing, I am starting to feel the same way about letting myself go into a hardcore mode that will undoubtedly cause other aspects of my life to falter.
---
However, I think that the key to not letting the addiction set in is by realizing that there is no rush, no ultimatum. You can play this game and be responsible in your personal life. Granted this philosophy will definitely mean that you will not be able to get full naxx gear or rank 14, but it does mean that you can enjoy the game at your own pace, get to 60 eventually, and experience most of what the game has to offer.
---
Personally, I have a priority hierarchy that I have established so I can play WoW and still maintain and develop my life. These priorities make it so that I make sure that I keep my real life in order, then if that is done, I can play WoW.
---
Priority by order:
---
1. School/Work/Relationship
---
2. Working out
---
3. Wow
---
As long as I satisfy  1 and 2, then I can play. In all likelihood, this means I’ll be able to play maybe 2 hours a day. Potentially 4 on the weekends. I also might have to sacrifice some sleep, but it’s worth it to me. 
---
Time management is key!
---
TLDR: 
---
Don’t think you can’t enjoy most of  the game at a casual pace. Prioritize your real life in relation to  WoW. Time Management is your best friend.
---

Don't know if I'm referring to you or me, though.
---
Not enough rage
---
&gt; Do you all have reaction times below the 17 millisecond range
---
It shows you the stuff you need to react to earlier (on average).
---
Because you could take the easy safespace carebare rotue to 60 on a PvE server, get some gear then transfer to a PvP server and enjoy the benefits, without having to take the real men's way to 60.
---
Mining skinning is an option, as one guy pointed out save all mats to get bs to 300 during 1-60. But this will require several dedicated bank alts.
---
Borderline AoE grinders too, multi-dot mobs and VW Taunt - use health funnel to keep him topped up and throw in a drain life to keep yours up. Life Tap keeps your health going and you pretty much infinitely grind without drinking.
---
with a big cooldown so if you fuck it up again you're stuck for awhile
---
No... Every random group you are in will have someone needing. It's not about honesty or dishonesty, it's about different perceptions of rules. You never go wrong with need, worst case you win it and can give it to the guy that can equip it. Everybody wins.
---
Fuck! Whats a direct mage counter? Warlock?
---
&gt; My plan is to have multiple bank alts to just mail stuff when ever I see a mail box.
---
Why multiple?
---
Could https://barrens.chat get a mention?
---
are you me?
---
It's not a witchhunt, if someone ninja loots, should have to face the consequences. Same applies to being an asshole in general. You are free to do whatever you want but there have to be consequences for it.
---
I was thinking of doing exactly that......
---
Ain't nobody got time to get ganked and camped by some tiny dick rager
---
If thats the case then its the most retarded thing ever. You mean we had acronyms for all the dungeons, not a single one was after a boss, deadmines had an onvious acronym that wasnt taken yet but people decided to use a boss acronym for a single dungeon out of all dungeons?
---
Paladins are great for casual playing, you must be ready to take on the roll of support&amp;healing at 60 though. Ret and prot at 60 are not really viable if you want to push through content with a guild
---
Wouldn't know, because I've never had it happen.
---
If you don't level on a PvP server, you don't deserve to be 60 on a PvP server. This restriction applied back in Vanilla when they introduced transfers so I don't see why it shouldn't now.
---
That's what I was wondering about the eye strain comment in the OP. Everything I've read says that higher framerate is fine for your eyes. I personally have been struggling with eye strain from the ASUS PG279Q I got a few months ago; it looks beautiful, but it tires my eyes out quickly. I've tried messing with brightness, contast, and color schemes, and I can't figure it out. I definitely have the higher framerate enabled though, and it's great. Not too important in a game pike WoW, but nice to have.
---
Oh heavens no! What will I do now? My world view is shattered by Clipeus-Virtutis
---
I'd be happy with BC honestly. Karazhan was the peak of raiding for me. Probably my favorite dungeon in the game.
---
I didn't hate WotLK that much, but that's where I felt the game started to decline. All 5 man dungeons just turned into faceroll AoE tanking. At least heroics in BC were somewhat difficult.
---
At least 32 buttons can me mapped with consoleport. I don’t think OP was taking about raiding but playing casually on the couch.

600 DPS single target in full BiS is abysmal though
---
I really want to play enhancement shaman but I've seen no one endorse it. So I pretty much have to settle with elemental if I want to play shaman. Which I'll probably be forced to heal on
---
It probably will be mid life for many of us with healthcare being entirely out of reach in the US.
---
Will be a whole new world......of Warcraft!
---
FYI all thottbot web archives from 2004 show people calling in VC and not DM. On launch, it was VC. Let me guess you played EU? Which came way after NA launch numb nuts
---
You didn't take fire resist pots to prevent preventable damage...
---
This guy needed more healing the whole fight, a healer would notice this guy losing more health and would be keeping a closer eye on it, more than likely contributing to the raid wipe.
---
Also, it's a very selfish mentality.... especially if you're trying to do progression raiding.
---
I'm sure that's what plenty of people said about Joseph Goebbels.
---
I need more rage
---
sharpening stones are well worth it, but I don't know if the market will exist for them. It's pretty tough to extrapolate from private servers: A lot of leveling consumables are not worth the time of competent players to make on mature servers, and of course, you need to be somewhat competent to be listing sharpening stones on the auction house on a regular basis.
---
There also SHOULD be a market for the copper dagger (vastly superior to vendor weapons, can be made for probably less than 2 silver in mats, and every rogue in the game SHOULD spend everything they have when leaving the starting area on a dagger of some description, and there probably wouldn't be enough green dagger drops to go around. 
---
will there be a market for that dagger? I honestly doubt it.
---
WoW! :)

added this one as an argument that WoW Classic will run on very low-powered devices, thanks for that:

Do you mind expanding on this? I've heard they aren't great because you often find yourself in 2v1 situations, which *apparently* Druids aren't good at. Looking to be Druid and I have fond memories of AB in my younger years.
---
Good summary, now I kinda want to play warlock and dot everything, that was not the plan...
---
Then again, I really want to play everything xD
---
Ofc good mention. Its ment to be a good oversight, so everybody can find a home in the Classic Community
---
exactly. you just have classic + keep adding on with TBC design philosophy for classes and raids
---
Patch 3.3 came about not long after Ion came on board. Coincidence?
---
I hope they add those servers soon. I don't understand why they haven't just added language servers in the first place.
---
Is it likely crafting materials are going to be worth much in the first month given everyone seems to be taking at least one with the aim of putting it all up on the auction house?
---
I actually think Ashkandi is inferior to most 1h weapon combinations available to hunters by that point, maybe it's just after ZG. Usually they also just want it for PvP because of the outrageous amount of pure stats, mainly stamina, at least afaik.
---
Afaik they are in the game from the launch.
---
Thanks for sharing!  Great advice to. I have been thinking along similar lines... The only way I will be able to enjoy classic guilt-free will be sitting down for a 2-4 hour session only after knowing that I've done all the other essential stuff first.  Work and other responsibilities done? Check. Plans made to spend time (ideally outdoors) with gf on the weekend? Check. Place is clean? Check. Got some exercise? Check.  Alright, lets see if I can get to stv today...
---
You really hung in there for those last two!
---
And what about shams?
---
Same except I just stopped buying them after wrath, best way to go!
---
They're relevant to Phase 1 content, I wouldn't see why they wouldn't be there.
---
You'll be fine.
---
The real proper termonoligy for Dire Maul is 'Tribute Run'
---
Because with the values of bop upgrade vs vendor gold the bop upgrade is definitely more valuable.
---
But the value of a boe upgrade vs AH gold the AH gold is way more valuable.
---
My issue with hakurai's video is the lack of research presented. The entire video is based off one screenshot from a supposed xp/hour number from questing solo 18-25 vs dungeon farming 18-25. I want him to gather more data and explain how he tested in detail. We don't have enough information based off that one screenshot to be able to prove anything. I'm not saying he's wrong, just that he hasn't provided enough information (yet) to prove that dungeon farming is actually as efficient as he claims.
---
You own the later versions of wow I think we can all agree who's the pleb lel.
---
If that wasn't the case it would be a complete mess, people speedleveling on a PvE realm and transfering to PvP realms, obviously it's not just that they don't deserve to be there, they would also make it really hard for real players to level because of their unfair advantage, going out and ganking people that are below them without actually working for that privilage.
---
I avoid Asus and Acer monitors at all costs, almost strictly using Dell. There's just so many complaints about those two companies and their displays, including what you're describing. Yeah, they're cheaper, but you get what you pay for.
---
Do you have motion blur reduction turned on? I hear that can be awful on those monitors.
---
That’s actually a good idea. 
---
Any recommendations on a good instant private server?
---
orc is better than undead for any class especially PvP
---
Don't forget to rebind capslock.
---
I quit shortly after ulduar from burnout and it's funny cause I legit think that was the last raid release before the game really started to lose itself, lfg and all that shite started getting added shortly after
---
I wrote a 300+ arguments discussion about this, trying to gather all the pros and cons, unfortunately some Retail fanboys voted on it, I would appreciate if you countered those votes a bit:
---

---
There has no news besides regular PvE and PvP servers.
---
I agree, 
---
They can Facebook blast, target browser ad, Reddit advertise although I wouldn’t see it on my Apollo app many would.
---
Some kinda Viral campaign could be cool. Like MR T or someone riding a Bengal Tiger through the Mountains. 
---
My point is they are attacking the media side of this without any fury or fire.
---
“Mr T and Azeroth are calling, we need reinforcements, it’s your game” see you there August 27th !
---
I was going to make some sarcastic and snarky remark about this, but it gets posted so often I'm too tired to come up with something.
---
Maybe using the search feature you can find the answers you seek.
---
So the armor you can make for yourself leveling is not that good?
---
like...why?
---
That makes no sense, no other dungeon is named after the boss.
---
The first half of wotlk was absolutely amazing, they really fucked it up towards the end and it was the turning point for the game but the overall expansion itself wasn't shit.
---
TLDR go resto
---
Some us did! If nowadays was 15 years ago I guess. Fuck. :(
---
In my eyes it was the catalyst that created what we have today in Modern WoW. You are right though the first half was amazing.
---
I agree totally. And if I had beta access I would do my best to test it myself. Sadly I dont, so I'm reaching out to those who do :) I'm surprised there's not more people trying this out as it's a social way to play together with your friends :)
---
I'm testing on a free shard and running every class I'm interested in to level 20 to get a sense of what they are about and then picking. Bonus side effect is I'm learning my 1-20 leveling route really well and should be able to do it all by memory upon release.
---
It can be, but it's prohibitively expensive to level Blacksmithing that way and whatever gear you do make yourself while leveling quickly gets replaced. It's just not worth it.
---
you seemed to have a problem with the group ninjaing your BOP, but that should be standard behavior in groups to Need everything because it only has value to you as gold anyway, and everybody Needs gold.
---
Yeah, you're judging that it's better for them to sell the item, therefore because they should sell it it's okay for you to ninja because you also want to sell it.  Except it's up to them if they want to sell it or to equip it, and if they want to equip it that makes you a ninja.
---
I'm saying that you should Greed like you would any other item that you want to sell, and let people who want to equip the item Need.  Then it's up to people who can make use of the item as an upgrade to instead decide for themselves that it would be better as gold rather than an upgrade, in which case they would also Greed

I feel like every other year is a new midlife crisis at this point. At 30 it was moving across the country to start a new job and buying that watch I had wanted for some time. 
---
At 33 it's going to be reliving classic WoW.. and another new job. Might get a dog too. Can't wait to see what 36 holds.
---
Alphabetical is the easiest way to avoid discrimination

But where is the arcanite reaper

Oh I make that alt too :)

https://sixtyupgrades.com
---
Website for creating builds at any level. Finds gear for you based on stat weights. Allows custom stat weights and has pre-defined stat weights.
---
Definitely Yay if there won't be official non english servers in EU. 
---
Idk about anyone else but if I end up on the inofficial czech server 6 months in and can't transfer that would be the end of my classic career I think
---
What one that thinks rest is the best shammy spec yeah I'm pretty sure that's the general consensus.
---
I'll PM you, im not allowed to say here
---
If you want to be an asshole, your guild will fail. If you don't want to be an asshole, your guild will fail.
---
Know when to be hard and when to be soft, and fix problems while they are still small before they take deep roots.
---
Exactly. 
---
I think you can turn the addictive tendencies of WoW into a powerful motivator to sustain / improve other aspects of your life.
---
For me as a fail-safe, I know my girlfriend will call my ass out in an instant if I start slipping into hardcore mode.  So I definitely know I won’t ever get to that state. So maybe use your gf as an accountability buddy? 
---
Also,  I think the addictiveness of WoW is a quality that happens when someone doesn’t have a lot going on in their RL. I mean I understand why age 12-16 me was addicted; WoW was a world where I had responsibility and the ability to explore. As a 12 year old, you’re pretty limited in what you can do IRL.  So it makes sense why I was so I was enthralled. 
---
Fast forward, I can’t in good conscious see my current self, which has a lot of meaningful developments happening, sacrificing those for a video game.
---
However, I would be damned to say that I am not excited for this game. It’s going to be a fun ride!
---
It's because a BoE translates directly to gold. In this case if it's worth 45g the item should be viewed as whatever the item is OR 45g. 
---
Gold in vanilla is important for obvious reasons.
---
Gold directly translates to BoEs that you may need for you build. So in a sense, everyone needs the BoE because everyone needs gold for their own BoEs. So it's either all need or all greed.
---
If I see a BoE and I see anyone roll need on it I roll need to. I need the gold just as much as you need the item.
---
Doubtful, I know it's a fully explored 15 year old game but this is a business at the end of the day. They don't want to risk "burn out" for any of their potential new customers. 30-40 is kind of that natural midpoint to max level and its only a steeper climb from 40 and up. This combined with such a small amount of players doing the grind makes for negative press. As each level cap had occurred, the population has lost momentum (as it should) the closer we get to classic.
---
When you get your epic mount, gold has no value, you want to respect 100 times a month, you can do it.
---
Here's the compelling argument. 
---
The system you use should be in accordance with the goal. Every player I know, enters the dungeon to get better gear. I've never come across someone that says "I'm just here to ensure no one ninjas loot."
---
The best system for ensuring you get better gear is to "need on shit you need and greed on the rest."
---
The best system for ensuring no one ninjas gear is to "roll need on anything BoE."
---
Check if Pheenix's "Warding" is still up. It's what I used to play years ago. Or else check on the r/wowservers for one at the pinned messages.
---
Unless mind control breaks early which it almost always does.
---
Dude, you just convinced me to roll a warlock in Classic. Any race recommendations for Horde?
---
No idea. Maybe because it was compiled by Nick Carpenter who was never one of the members of Sons of the Storm.
---
Priest + another person, literally any class it doesnt matter = the most fun way to level, arguably the most fun experience of the game.
---
Priest world pvp: mind control people into lava, off of cliffs in thousand needles.
---
Priest endgame: people begging you to join their raid. 2nd most desired class in a group.
---
Healing: fun.
---
It's a great class and anyone thinking of leveling one should.
---
Flame shock*
---
Yeah, don’t do your research and after weeks of leveling discover that your class is useless and you will never get a group.
---
Yeah, but you have to no-life it in between server restarts to kill mobs.
---
Real players? - lol
---
Ya I did that... I went from priest to warlock to Rogue to Druid to warrior to shaman to hunter to now back to priest or maybe warrior
---
Didn't you really die if you feigned for too long?
---
I have a customer who wants to go to it yuyyyr it u uurrryfd yp atthe airport in your t
---
Mage is the best hands down.  Save time traveling with portals to every major city.
---
People paying YOU to get a portal!  Make your own food/water!  This isn't retail so a mage can use ALL THREE types of spells from arcane to fire and frost!
---
Rogue second... stealth harass the hell out of people mmkay?
---
Are paladins blessing bots and occasional off healers in raids?
---
&gt; there is no monetary gain
---
This is just wrong though. If you are leveling up, a BoE especially if it's a good one will make you level up quicker. Quicker leveling means you make gold quicker. 
---
If you are going to argue that the amount of speed that you get from a random BoE while leveling is negligable then really nobody should equip it if it doesn't matter. It should be sold for the much more important gold.
---
If we are talking about end game BoEs then obviously there is a clear monetary gain to rolling on a BoE even if you don't sell it. It's just another item you didn't have to farm for and the farming time is useful to literally everyone.
---
If there is a Paladin or Shaman in the raid with a 2H it is nightfall.
---
ESO, Skyrim, Oblivion, and all the dark souls games
---
I’m trying to find easy to follow (with pictures for babies) guides to show my guildies to help them with their classes. Shjt like this is basically what I need. Thanks! Got any more? :P
---
Windfury Weapon and Windfury Totem are not on a PPM system in Vanilla and are not on a PPM system on the Beta.
---
Back to the drawing board for you.
---
A screenshot would be a good idea.
---
2H Fury is aa good as DW on Horde side due to extra benefit from Windfury.
---
Ohh! This is a purrfect idea!
---
Abuse the system, tauren hitbox is crazy which helps both in PvP and in pve. Roll a warrior.
---
Is that based on vanilla experience or data?
---
If Chuck Norris can wow, you can too..
---
I can't pick between orc and undead for my rogue for the sake of me. I've played both and when I play one I miss the other. I'll probably coinflip it or just go for that female UD backflips and level a second rogue later on.
---
Don't forget death coil, infernal, doom guard!
---
Class quests that are available to everyone of that class  should be available from any class trainer.
---
Can't wait join anti streamer guild, and kill them none stop.
---
Private server is the only way to get data on how the classes behave in a pre1.12 enviroment, so yes while they may be flawed, they are the most accurate thing we have.
---
If I were rolling Druid I probably would go w this for sure! Looks good
---
Experience, videos and of course p servers later on. I played fury back in vanilla and did very well
---
I have re-linked the shot, it was not included the first time for some reason.
---
+1 for using MATLAB!
---
The mages all contribute to one ignite that only one mage gets, but collectively they do less damage than the warriors.
---
25$ for a ninja loot is a pretty big price to pay. Also let's so many others who are on crap servers get on a good one to enjoy the game.
---
Yeah, I still keep buying them even though I stopped playing during Cataclysm :p
---
Ah yes, the designated jacking-off enthusiast class.
---
If you want to support and have fun though, roll a shaman.
---
Honestly Ulduar was great but the raid tier that launched with Wrath was a complete joke. I remember doing a PUG when I was a kid with a fresh dinged 80 in blues and we did a fair few bosses in Naxx, only 2-3 weeks after launch.
---
Wrath was great as an experience but the game definitely was too easy on launch. They picked it up with Ulduar.
---
Nope, since everyone needs the gold and no BoE is worth equipping, it's everyone need.
---
Orcs are ugly, abd undead is the best choice. BiS dance, BiS laugh, and WotF is a nice CD to have. I know people say the orc stun resist is OP, but its a dice roll, while WotF is 100% on use.
---
Wasting a debuff slot for stormstrike :/
---
Yeah, my guild beat it, but once WotLK beta started and people posted starting area greens that were better than my gear, I stopped raiding. 
---
That was really my whole thing that got me disliking expansions and wanting a classic server where I could min/max a character in an era and not have to worry about some expansion coming and wiping out all my progress.
---
Druids are hard to find anything to do at 60 since they are bad at everything
---
Really depends, if you are multiple offender or ninja something really valuable it could be worth it. It might be a combination of many things that make the server hate you. Although since a limited transfer was available in Vanilla it can be up for discussion.
---
Server transfer was implemented in vanilla. #nochange
---
All credit goes to TKing. It still looks good after all these years.
---
r/gamersriseup
---
RIP
---
i thought resto was decent
---
I'm in the exact same mindset as you. The only thing I worry about is the dungeon potential. I hear it will be hard to find groups as a sole Hunter 😥
---
Imagine you play on a PvP server, you fight your way through STV and other highly contested zones, get to 50, then some clown who easy-moded his way to 60 on a carebare server ganks you because he was allowed to transfer.
---
Does it not look like a popsicle ?
---
The god of Retail maybe.
---
He was a white collar attorney until WotLK released.
---
Resto DPS is garbage bruh
---
I pvp a lot on a Paladin and most want to say you’re super wrong about this. If you’re wearing cloth in PvP you’re going to get swallowed alive so quickly. You need a lot of + stam plate gear and while healing is important, it’s still less important than plate / stam. 
---
Only naxx geared rogues are going to bother me in plate but if I’m wearing cloth then any rogue can do big damage to me and force me to use my cooldowns at bad times. I really have no idea where you’re getting your info from but paladins are tanks in PvP and should gear with that in mind.
---
thats a joke right...
---
Came here to say this!
---
It's a lot down to 1.12 having all class revamps in talent trees, itemization had a pass as well, earlier dungeons had needs and balance patches, people already know ideal strats, all the minimum gear required can be prefarmed for the most part too.
---
There's going to be some things private servers got wrong (9% boss parry pserver vs 15% live as an example) that will mix up some stuff, but overall player power level at naxx is going to be the true test since the patch matches the content.
---
Lol I’m so confused. Did his account get hacked?
---
Will be saving all my mats till the AH economy picks up to maximize profits. So I'll be filling up alot of space I reckon.
---
BRE was a weapon that looks unassuming, but you ran if you saw it
---
Apparently they are expecting it to be too much of a niche and think there won't be enough players to sustain even 1 RP-PvP realm, despite the fact that RP-PvP is superior to regular RP (which there will be I think 1 or 2 in each zone).
---
wasting a raid slot on enhance lol
---
Orcs have stun resistance, dunno if you're playing pvp or not
---
Oh for sure, a lot of vanilla boss mechanics are dealt with simply by out dpsing the boss so you don't see it. I was watching a private server first MC clear and they did so much damage to rag, he never submerged. Easiest way to deal with shadow flames is to never have them spawn haha.
---
Orc is great for stun resist and extra pet damage. Also, for me personally, I love the male orc casting animations.
---
Undead has cannibalize and will of the forsaken to get out of sleep, charms and fears.
---
Here I was almost to make the same comment after studying the image. If you're willing to go Matlab... Yeah, be enhancement in my raid.
---
SO I CAN EAT MY ENEMIES TOO?!
---
Well its mainly because if people roll greed someone will definitely need it to ninja it. Its why you never risk it.  Ill admit its not the best mechanic to have boe items like that.  What if they didnt sell it but gave it to their guild alchemist for crafting? Thats pretty likely too and not as painful maybe.
---
i'll allow it.
---
I agree but tracking helps if you have a brain dead day :-)
---
Not trying to be rude but this makes it pretty clear you haven’t raided a ton. Warriors all want one handers and there are much easier weapons that your warriors will have. PvP weapons should be more up in the air for raiding guilds but if your guild does run a premade or something I can see people asking to let the warrior get the first one.
---
Everybody is a day one vanilla player here it seems 🙃
---
I’ve been playing a ret pally in classic to see why so many people hate. It’s just as good as anything else people just don’t know how to play.
---
I believe they will be. That corehound belt is gonna make me some money.
---
Looks like they're trying to get by with as few servers as possible.
---
Reasoning likely simple cash, and avoiding dead servers down the line.
---
You can just keep stuff in the mailbox, and return the mail whenever your main needs it. No need to actually use the bank unless you're buying stuff on the AH or whatever.
---
yeah like pvp'ing
---
Yeah, but the "we sucked" sentiment relates to the new meta that has been created by exactly that type of players.
---
Didn't that that was a healers role lol
---
But it is. I've seen soda and StormX on about it and they're both druid mains
---
So retarded
---
If you have a friend who wants to play priest or warrior, I would highly recommend playing warrior or priest, respectively. My brother and I are doing that and it's been a lot of fun.
---
I seem to remember PvP armor worked as a stop gap. But since it had resilience as part of the stat budget, it was never as good as equal tier PvE items. Weapons on the other hand were pretty good. I ended up using PvP weapons and never picked up P E weapons to save myself on DKP spending.
---
I made a bit more conscious spending efforts in TBC vs vanilla. In vanilla I was so far in the hole trying out daggers, swords. Actually got maladath over all sword rogues passed on it since nobody knew how strong +swords was. Then when I started out damaging them we started figuring out what +weapon skill did. Granted, we had no human sword rogues in the guild, at the time, so we never saw the advantage earlier
---
Wow... i don't why you come to Classic if you "don't have time" to take part of the game features and just trying to act like a "boss" without doing PvP ??
---
More valuable how? Gold is gold.
---
probably fovfix addon(or w/e it is called)
---
That depends.. not many people are going to have a lot of gold in the first month... I don’t suspect the market will level off till month 2-3. It depends on your server though. It also depends if you deem it worth taking the ah cut and waiting for it to sell when you can just vendor it. A lot of people are going gathering to start this time.
---
This is the saddest thing I've read on this sub, and that's saying something.
---
No man that's just wrong. everyone uses one enha shaman both for weapon totems and nightfall. You might be stuck with auto-attacking for 3-5 mins without being able to do anything other than totem sift and use mana pots but you will be useful and while outside the raid you will be able to farm and do PvP with your main spec. Elemental is just a way to go oom fast, not have fun and pretty much get accepted on a casual guild with meme specs and a weird environment where everyone hates each other for not pulling their own weight.
---
Be strong, be useful, be enha, have fun one shotting people in PvP. Don't forget. Believe in yourself. Not in you who believes in me. Not in me who believes in you. Believe in yourself!
---
When classic WoW was first announced, I knew I was gonna rush 60 and be top tier Raider PvPer. Then I realized that I have a life now and there is no way I could stay a head of the curve. The world of Azeroth is beautiful, and if I want to spend 6 hours fishing like I did when I was 12 playin vanilla, then by god you bet your ass imma do that. The raids will always be there, but the memories you make along the way will be up to you.
---
Private server info so, well you know. (I played human warlock on live during vanilla, so obviously it sent me to SW)
---
At level 10 I was sent to SW regardless to get my voidwalker, and looking at the quest location and stuff, I would say both races will have the same quest in SW.
---
I wouldn't want Classic any other way, but I don't mind the time gated one. Those tend to respect my time more. Gives me a reason to log on after I'm done levelling and initial gearing.
---
Yea I was reading a bit about it on wowhead. So instead of earning points and spending them on what peice Id like next, theres a set schedule of when you get a certain slots item. Then the specific stat bonuses on that item are generated randomly when you get it. I think they said you maybe get a choice of two or three options? Changing the items bonuses can be done through some PvE grind? Is that all basically right? 
---
I was also reading a bit about the adjustments they make to gear... Seems like a whole strange new world.
---
But that's.. why they are there. It's to ensure shit isn't camped all the time.
---
You only do it when it's clear they're spam clicking bid, obviously. 
---
And if they aren't spam bidding, you can always bid it up to the normal price of the item and they will still probably bid and you still make a profit. The risk isn't any higher than if you made the price normal and nobody bid in the first place.
---
same. i loved BC and WotLK. i even loved playing during cata. would love to be back at a time where that was current.
---
And then you look at someone who knows that their doing:   
---
[https://youtu.be/ZRyD2LfBZPQ?t=58](https://youtu.be/ZRyD2LfBZPQ?t=58)
---
Enhance shamans aren't even good at applying the nightfall debuff
---
If you aren't healing your drinking. Speed runs only bb
---
I don't think they're mutually exclusive. Egg timers can be fun because they give you nice short-term goals to pursue that shakes up the formula. Otherwise I might become a raid logger outside of doing bgs.
---
If'm done with levelling and gearing from dungeons, I might not have a reason to go out into the world.
---
Stop encouraging them. Non healing shamans in PvE is fucking trash.
---
I feel like once you go over 60 fps and get used to it you almost get a headache looking at that low of a frame rate again. The difference is astonishing but 100%worth it!
---
I mean that's nice and all. But I'd rather play something I don't want and actually get invited to stuff.

Howl does not scale at all with anything on pservers but it may be different on classic. No need for that hostility.
---
No. 90% of you aren't. It's easy to tell who was and wasn't there. The private server crowd is easy to spot.
---
Have you seen female orcs in leather? They are sexy with good posture, dance, animations, good DPS cd, meme PvP racial and all.
---
Specially in PvP there are cases where I'd take orc over UD and the other way around way too many times.
---
I'm afraid that with all those guys who wanna prove their dads that "retri/prot Pala is useful, look at me! No hands!!1!" Orc is gonna get more value. Let alone every other stun in-game, also do many people are pumped to play priests, blackout is a bitch, a way to beat RNG is with more RNG.
---
Dunno man.
---
You. Can skip anything, your not locked out from buying skills or leveling, it's just going to be harder without imp.
---
Certain bosses required it though like 4 horsemen, so even if you pumped your mitigation up it didn't matter. There are also bosses that require you flip aggro between multiple tanks

Might be worth putting this on there - https://vanillafriends.com/

Agreed. The particle effects, the simple but distinct carving... it’s incredibly simple and yet iconic. Personally I’m not a fan of the cartoonishly huge weapons in Warcraft and warhammer, so weapons like Atiesh really stand out to me. Not to mention it gives Druid more individual benefit than any of the other versions.

great way to kill servers and guilds
---
It may be because dailies are what led me to notice my addiction.
---
My guild use ret's as a hybrid support but more active melee combatant or providing off heals etc.
---
Thank Fuck.
---
Saddly yes QQ
---
By the way, if you’ve never used this kind of UI art. Unzip it and put the folders into the Interface folder with the Addons folder, not in the Addons folder itself.
---
Elemental in dungeons are fine. None of the fights last long enough for you to go oom.
---
What patch changed WF to PPM?
---
Why are they not great tanks in endgame?
---
I did not think of this. Good call I like it. Thanks :)
---
Just mail mats to a bank alt.
---
2v1 situations?  Oh, OK I'm gonna go now - cat form sprint or travel run away flipping the bird, get out of combat and stealth. GG
---
Just farm and sell mats?
---
But you will get invited more as enha over ele. Ele is literally garbage. Enha at least has a use on every kind of guild you might be looking for.  Someone has to stuck that nightfall debuff and totems are great to boost your fury/rogues. Everyone will admire you for being useful and you will enjoy yourself.
---
On the other hand you're gonna struggle, with sifting totems and casting downranked lightning bolts, you will not have fun with your spec and you will not join a serious guild (if that's your goal).

Ret is a lot of fun. I'd be happy to be the only one. More of a pvp spec in classic though.
---
This is just trash, every class is wrong
---
They were always pretty good about balancing servers. Cant be too sure if it was in classic or TBC, but I seem to even remember free transfers from some of the most populated servers to specific lower pop ones to try and boost up the player base.
---
Happy cake day Gaskal!
---
Your numbers are estimates based on your old memories from 14 years ago. One person. One server. 14 year old memories. That's extremely unreliable data. Anyone with less of an ego would admit that.

Have a 1h and shield, sell dungeon runs, farm elementals, professions
---
Farm mobs.
---
This doesnt look like the respec menu
---
Get a healbot friend and just be their super kill guy, bing bang boom, epic mount.
---
How's an RP server different? I've never played on one. Do you have to be careful to stay in character? Is barrens chat still full of trolls? Does it just mean less minmaxing?
---
I love your comment thank you stranger
---
They are very strong single target healers but if you mean can they dps or tank? Dps not really but some group MIGHT bring you but dont expect to be good. Tank? No
---
Acquire epic women
---
Why? Can you explain the math behind this and why other classes are better for it? Not being snarky, I'm genuinely curious.
---
Amen brother. That and they jump on the hate train like sheep.
---
With the cost of foods and repairs I don't think that's very lucrative or fast
---
You underestimate the BiS BM of Cannibalize
---
Take skinning until 60 and then switch to eng BS, use an alt for farming mats.
---
But with melee leeway is it comparable?
---
You go into The Badlands and you kill Greater Earth Elementals until you have 1000g worth of Elemental Earth to sell.
---
My first character ever was a Tauren warrior at 13 years old back in 05.. I played vanilla-Cata and never healed so I’m torn between Druid and shaman

More squeekers play Alliance. Most Alliance Ive noticed are very judgemental. All alliance racials are situational. All Alliance seem to forget every buff they have in pvp can be purged. In classic shamans rule in every way of killing you. So much so we even hate them because there is no beating a good one with any class in duels. The advantages of Paladins is the mana for casters, threat reduction, and heals for days. You cant compare Blessing of might with Strength of earth combined with Windfury. Alliance bias people that take up for that argument is living in a dream world. Yes it is true they tested new WoW content with alliance raids back in vanilla. Thats why they got so mad on fights like Razorgore when Horde had it easy cause of totems. I dont know the current WoW population per faction now but I assume it still is like 4-1 or 3-1 favor in Alliance. We always called you guys Zerglings. But being real watching Alliance races walk and function you guys should open your eyes. Ive never seen a human person walk with his butt so tightly positioned, I mean whats the deal they look like a white dude trying to dance but arent aware they have no flow. Dwarves remind you of Danny Divito in Taxi and the short dude that has a hole in the lady's room wall. Nightelves well you see they dance like Michael Jackson so would you go spend the night at their house. I cant say much about gnomes they are little people after all, but from what I've seen most Alliance hate them worst than Horde. Not to mention everyone wants to punt them. Needless to say Horde do have there hiccups. Most orcs go out of there way to kill any critter on the map and have some awfully manly women. Tauren when they run or rush look like there some panicing cow in a stampede. All undead can be classified as either goth, emo, vamp, or I dont give a shit. Makes you wonder what the hell the problem is. Dont have too much to say about Trolls except everyone says the racial they have are bomb for pve but you only will ever see one as a hunter or shaman on most occasions. I love how Alliance say Horde shits in the street. Well I've been to Stormwind and Ironforge and havent seen one bathroom explain? You wanta say your buildings and cities are more advanced so it means you are more civilized. Well go look at the Mongolian moving tent towns that the Mongols had back when they conquered 2/3 of the known world. And yes your european castles existed during the same time. I would roll Alliance but all the fairytale,lotr, we are going to kill the monster crap annoys me. Besides Paladins give off a no sex having, keeper of the light, closet molester vibe. I have a hard time beleiving anyones 40 year old virgin pure. And have you seen the Scarlet Crusade. Can anyone say cultists.
---
They’re pretty amazing in WSG. With 2 sprints and 2 vanish every 10 mins that’s a really difficult cap to prevent.
---
They already said there won't be transfers at the beggining and no PvE to PvP even in the future, so nothing to be worried about.
---
So if somebody hacked your bank account, and the next time you checked your balance online the pixels on the screen read "$0", you wouldn't be angry because it's just pixels?
---
Some streamers are gonna do a brd run in the next few days, if they can get to the grim guzzler it’ll be known
---
Server transfers are okay because as far as I'm aware they were possible at the time. That alone should be justification enough. 
---
Blizzard won't merge servers either. They implemented the layering system to avoid exactly that because merging servers is never good PR for an MMO if it is logical and justified. What we think of the layering system is irrelevant in this case, it's there to allow Blizzard to launch Classic with a smaller number of server than what would be needed if they didn't have layering.
---
This brings me to my next point. Despite those countermeasures against dying servers it might still end up happening that a server has an extremely low population at some point down the line. Do you just want to force all those people to reroll somewhere else? Obviously Blizzard could just offer free server transfers to those people if that becomes necessary. I would be fine with that too.
---
Personally, I don't want to have to change servers in Classic. I did it a lot when I still played retail and looking back it was never a good decision so I hope the won't give me any reasons to consider switching servers in Classic either. Still, I think server transfers as a character service are fine. I'm aware of the downsides like a ninja transferring to another server to get a blank slate but those are negligible. I honestly can't think of a reason why it's a bad idea to offer server transfers to players when I can think of a number of reasons for why it would be a bad idea to offer other character services like race changes.
---
Yeah i know, i really like the nelf female bow animation though so im happy Rolling a nelf :)
---
The two best classes for applying nightfall are warriors and hunters.  This is because they both have a cheap, spammable attack that can proc it (hamstring, wing clip).  Hunters are the best, but being a nightfall hunter is super boring and nobody wants to do it, so usually nightfall will be on a warrior offtank

If you wanna heal, as in "I'm useful and I actually heal instead of being here for a CR, a buff and my innervate" go shaman for sure. They are great for premade bgs, great for any kind of pve activity and you at least got an offspec that's rare to come by and it might come in handy for PvP since you will be a tauren, which is enha.
---
If you wanna support your raid and FC in wsgs, go druid.

You are awesome, dude.

I'd still like to see shaman tier 2 !

Casting a lightning bolt between attacks resets your swing timer, as is the case with any non-instant spell.

I'm to used to IPS monitors to make the switch lol. Plus I'm poor and building and maintaining a rig that can run 60hz is just so much cheaper to budget for.
---
That said, OP already has a great PC and already owns a 240hz monitor. Why he'd build a machine that can operate any modern game at refresh rate and choose not to use it as his daily monitor baffles me.
---
From experience I can tell you that the atmosphere does change pretty quickly when you're wiping on easy MC bosses and people start looking at the DPS meters to point the finger. Getting 40 people together isn't easy, getting 40 friendly chill people together, who also aren't so good they end up in better guilds anyway, that is likely going to be pretty rare.
---
Yeah those seem useful haha. I think that fear one is gonna come in handy.

This was the first set I ever got on my shaman :D
---
Well, no one said you have to play it.

It is. Food/repair cost is negligable to getting 5g a pop for each Elemental Earth or w/e you are farming.
---
Thats so inefficient and you cant even watch series, movies etc at the same time.
---
Not reading the guide fully and expecting things :/

He has a talentbuild without SS that states "If you can't use SS because you're raiding, use this build". You can still use Earth Shock and Lightning bolt between AAs and Totem twists if you have the mana for it.

58 days of shitposting remains.
---
This comment swayed me heavily towards shaman, thanks man
---
I dont mention my work every post. "Lool at me im a so and so". Ok buddy, relax.
---
Or some PVP Arms warrior who comes along for some gear in your raids, that also works very well.
---
It's not that only certain specs can raid, it's more accurate to say there are certain specs who "can't raid".  Classes like Priest/Shaman can easily dps in offspec gear without respeccing. 
---
If this game doesn't interest you then don't play!
---
The progression mounts are hands down the best looking in the game.
---
Yeah maybe, but in classic you build yourself a reputation. Ill be working hard on getting recognized on my server. It also helps starting your own groups :)
---
I really like this idea, how much more would you charge over the auction price given it's basically a service, not just the mats?
---
What the fuck were they thinking when they came up with pandas?
---
No pandas.
---
Good enough for me.
---
I fired up the beta and just made a bunch of characters: Warrior level 6, mage level 12, Druid level 13, hunter level 8.

I’m more excited to play classic than ever. I think you got burned out mate.

---
Once takes a gold, I think the second goes up to five, and it keeps going up every time you do it.
---
It’ll drain your funds pretty quickly, and in classic gold is really important while leveling (food, water, training, and especially your mount at 40 all add up to a lot of gold if you’re not being thrifty). So usually, you should try to keep it to once or twice, Max.
---
But that being said, if you aren’t sure what you like, I think it is best to keep switching it up until you find something fun. No reason not to level in the way that you get the most out of, personally.
---
Stormstrike's cooldown is 20 seconds, so you only get 3 extra swings per minute that can proc Nightfall. Windfury doesn't count in your favor because anybody on horde side gets Windfury.
---
You give Nightfall to the offtanks because they can spam Whirlwind which bypasses the swing timer.
---
You thought you did but you didn't.
---
Chinese market.
---
Back in the day I spec into mining and sell ore and ingots all day.
---
Seems like you just don’t enjoy the game, not sure what the beta has to do with it.
---
Cater to China.
---
classic isnt for everyone
---
Panda rogue is the most ridiculous and awesome class/race combo possible!
---
I thought nightfall offtanks spam hamstring, just like hunters do with wing clip.
---
Look outside of instances? You do know you can farm and make a decent amount of gold outside of farming instances, right?
---
Farm basilisks in stv.
---
Farm tiny crimson whelplings.
---
That's really pretty. I kinda dislike minimalist stuff and love RPG-style UIs so this is pretty neat.
---
If there is something Warrior themed like this, do tell!
---
Actually impressive that this would be the most stupid post of the day but you’ve got a shot.
---
Early on you usually mine since you need arcane crystals for all your sick warrior stuff, sell the rest to engineer levelers.
---
Warriors have to do massive amounts of dungeons to get fully prebis on both dps and tank gear, and with some of the hardest prebis items like Dal'rends, truestrike, HoJ etc. you have to do A LOT of runs.
---
In the meanwhile while waiting for groups(won't be long though because you should be tanking most of the dungeons), you can farm various spots. One favorite is EPL bats, they drop massive amounts of greys and with prebis it's aboout 40-45gold per hour. But yeah it's just filler stuff to do while waiting for a bit. That and dungeoning IS the mount for you right there.
---
Later with DME coming out and you need a constant supply of very expensive raid consumes, there is DME 2man farm. This is amazing with a strong healer if you have the right professions(mining+enchanting and optionally herbalism), and especially if you get a pala/shaman which boosts your dps and therefore cleartime by a lot. This is one of the best gold making tactics out there, and it's fun, you can chill with a buddy on discord, and you actually do what you love the most, doing massive dps(with tanking the boss giving you rage and enrage procs it's rly fun). 
---
And then of course there's all the world farming spots that people don't hightlight that much because A) they are inconsistent and B) they are usually very hard to do on pservers due to pop. These will be great farming methods on classic, examples of this: Badlands rock elementals(don't do before AQ), any fire elemental spawn(do preferably around BWL launch), silithus worms(after AQ) for wormmeat(BIS warr food), do professions like mining, rly good gold near naxx with arcane crystals suddenly being rly expensive as you need a fuckton in naxx, farm juju's in winterspring.
---
It's the fucking beta dude, calm down.
---
Stoneform can drop a blind in PVP (and is pretty solid as a debuff wipe without spending the GCDs on cleanse).
---
Participate in the point of MMO's.
---
Meet people.
---
I'll be healing for days. Yes there are ways I could go and do something myself, but its alot easier/more fun with someone else.
---
Make a friend and split the loot.
---
&gt;i-its just the beta, papa blizz will fix everything, i p-promise!
---
pathetic
---
Only took a month.
---
Well I would actually argue the opposite, once the game comes out. 
---
Now? I go out to eat or do things all the time outside of work. But when I have the option to just cook a pizza and stay home to play classic again, I know which one I'm likely to choose. My bank account will definitely be going up after release...
---
oh yea? prove me wrong then
---
They are certainly not all awesome! Everyone needs to play the only good 5 classes or you're going to have a bad time. /s
---
No idea, it wasn't a documented change. The only PPM mechanics in Vanilla were the permanent weapon enchants (Crusader, Lifestealing, Fiery, etc) and Seal of Command.
---
But important to note: Instant attacks were separate from the PPM system for enchants and haste effects did not change PPM either.
---
Yes it's easy to do and apparently there are whole guilds which are UK based on American servers, or American guilds with EU-timezone raid teams. A lot better then dealing with random languages
---
Hah, it just got reported. I didn't even check the date. Just leaving a note as stuff gets removed, needn't worry about bans/warnings etc.
---
Learn the AH...in vanilla I was the last person joining my small established guild of friends..I was loaned 5g by a friend when I started, paid him back in a week, had 100g the next week, and never looked back. I was the first in my guild to get an epic mount as well...learn the auction house and love it.
---
Are they fixed
---
Ah. Thanks!
---
I wish i had medals to give you one, my dude.
---
Yeah you dont sound bias at all dude.
---
How was your gear on the beta? If you were grinding out some gear at 30, your clear speed should be considerably faster than it will be for new toons in greens with a few whites and blues sprinkled in.

---
Every class has a spot in a raid. NOT every spec of every class can get a spot.. those are very different ideas. 
---
It seems like you burnt yourself out with information analysis paralysis. Just take a few weeks off and when you come back play what you feel is most fun, not what some min / maxer says you need to play.
---
That's not how it works. The onus is on the poster to prove themselves right. You've supplied here say evidence regarding a beta experience.
---
Obvious troll is obvious.
---
No probs, wish you the best of luck.
---
Hardiness is the best racial in vanilla and you didn't even mention it lol, so go Orc.
---
Specially if you are going enhance you'll basically use all your racials sans command.
---
I was in a guild that cleared Naxx and we didn't have any fury warriors. They were all 2h specs. I think some tried fury late ,like Naxx late, but for the majority of the time they were 2h. Just kept rogues and warriors not fighting over the same weapons.
---
Trolls just dont try like they used to
---
Night Elf Rogue I guess
---
Paladincraft 3 features that song.
---
You obviously didn't try googling "how to farm gold in classic" before posting this. I'd start with that. There are thousands and thousands of posts on this subject matter

There's casual, social and in general: Guilds of *all* types. There's a guild for everyone.

I've seen plenty of examples, I need an explanation.
---
&gt;its just the announcement dont worry they will fix it
---
&gt;its just the alpha dont worry they will fix it
---
&gt;its just the beta dont worry they will fix it
---
&gt;the game just launched calm down they'll fix it
---
&gt;its phase 1 give them some more time they'll fix it
---
&gt;tbc just launched they'll fix it now for sure the bugs they have on bfa
---
You sure have a lot to day for not knowing what to say. 
---
It's the first time I've been able to afford a really good PC so I got a much better setup than what you listed.
---
You sound mad.
---
sounds like the game was never for you in the first place...
---
whats the beta got to do with it
---
At my worst, I had a raid-ready hunter(SV), mage(arcane), DK(blood), and priest(disc) in legion and was clearing M+10 on all of them most weeks.
---
You farm Thorium veins in the Burning Steppes 10 hours a day. It is really easy to do if you are in the first group of people to hit 60.
---
Ummm warrior will be the top played class.... rogues second, mages 3rd. Stoneform lets you have a second opener against warriors and dwarves shit on every other rogue race. Mages will indeed be tough but improved sprint already removes nova.

No it doesn't. This was introduced waaaaaay later in expansions (WoD I guess?)
---
If you're a N.E.E.T.
---
They do.  Also wf totem buff gives 1 extra swing, but shaman wf gives two.  Furthermore, Idk anyone that is absolutely sure that wf cannot apply the rebuff.  It's assumed that it cannot.
---
Priests have one of the easiest leveling experiences and they are fun all around. It's a solid choice, keep it up man.
---
Played since EU 2004 beta, We have always called it DM, and we called Diremaul, Diremaul, or DM:E, DM:N, DM:W for wings.

It has always been the case on most of the EU servers, VC is a NA thing.
---
Thats kinda funny coming from the guy who literally joined in for the sole purpose of arguing and passively insulting with a r/ link
---
Are you saying its not a fact, but rather a technicality that Battlegroups did and didnt exist in vanilla? I truly dont see what you’re arguing about, because you’re arguing.. Acting like I’m the one/only one arguing is just false
---
boomkin can actually be really fun in BGs if you find a hidden spot where you can sit and cast, like in AV standing on a ledge overlooking a big scrum or whatever. you will still go oom but its a BG so whatever, and you can innervate yourself. boomkins have massive crits when geared are cant be deleted by rogues like the clothies because of armor bonus/escapability
---
Shift-click and check level, easy.
---
Lol, I remember doing that a lot! My internet is so poor that I can't play on a full server.
---
I'd rather have play against the other classes than to shore up my weaknesses as a player against whatever % of the player base is going to actually make it to 60 with rogue and warrior.
---
I agree completely. You’ll lose some karma but at least you’re spreading the truth.
---
Calling EU player numb nuts, good job.
---
NA Trash.
---
Hunters were awesome in rated 2v2. Specially with a Resto Druid or a Disc Priest. Lots of mana drainage and good CC
---
They actually haven’t said either of those things.
---
Herb +mining is fine but perhaps not for everyone. I had it on a character back in TBC. Used a macro that toggled between them, that kind of macro works in classic as well. Put the macro on an easy to reach side-button on my mouse. You get used to press it every now and then when you are traveling around. I didn't find it that annoying but some other guy perhaps would.
---
r/creepyasterisks
---
there you go, buddy
---
Well stoneform helps against hunter poison too along with being able to remove devouring plague from undead priests.
---
in tbc 2.1? 2.2? they merged mh/oh wf into one internal cooldown of 3,5? sec so we wouldnt blow up everything instantly. It was not on a PPM in tbc and wotlk, after that no idea.
---
Man that brings back memories and you are right about this. I haven't played retail in years but I still take pride in the fact that I have that Warbear mount. Granted, that pride is not really warranted because I wasn't part of a top raiding guild who managed to finally clear it within the timer. I was one of the people who farmed my ass off to get the gold to pay the top guild on the server to get me in their raid and get the mount. I'll never forget it. I remember seeing that mount and really wanting it but realizing I'd never get it because I wasn't in a good enough guild to get it. Plus even if we did get good enough for it, there were 9 other people to contend over it. So I resigned hope of ever getting it. But then I heard the top guild on my server was selling it by way of summoning you in for the last fight after they did the speed run. I promptly started farming my ass off to get the gold to pay for it. And then after quite a bit of farming I finally had enough for it. I paid them the gold. Waited for them to get me in for the fight and then got my mount that I never thought i'd get. It was an amazing experience for me as someone who wasn't in a top guild. As weird as it is to say that I just farmed for in game gold to pay another guild to run me through a fight for a mount, its one of my fondest memories in gaming. It felt good having something that was fairly exclusive and was hard to achieve even if I knew that I didn't truly earn it.

Anyways, all of that to say I really loved what they did with Zul Aman and wish they did more like it. Though I also agree with the other guy as well. I liked how BiS came from many sources. So I think you are right in that BC had some good philosophy in the co-op area but it would have been nice for them to spread out BiS a little more. It wasn't terrible by any means but it started down a path. Though there were many things that started down a path that ultimately lead to where retail is now.
---
Laughs in protection paladin.
---
Why is this not up voted more? LMAO
---
There will be more room in classic. Pservers have cleared every raid a thousand times over so speedrunning is all that is left. You need certain specs to speedrun raids
---
If it weren't for na you wouldn't have wow, the internet, or 90% of the things your nerdy ass uses on a daily basis. Stay 3rd world EU
---
I've been shitting pancakes ever since.
---
Only use for a ret pally is a reck bomb. Then after that they're a punching bag
---
Because rp-pvp servers are always dead realms
---
On Pservers most tryhard warriors actually level an alt Mage to farm DME with. Phase 1 will be pretty dead anyway so it’s a perfect time to get your alt leveling done.
---
DME jump runs, Herb/rich thorium(for arcane crystals) farm are the most common ones. You can also farm dungeons and vendor shit. 
---
Anything really.
---
We let a prot pala tank (on a p server) once. One frostbolt from me and I had aggro.
---
That's because pink doesn't appear in a prism.
---
We were in the third round of those free transfers, but by then we’d had a good look at what it did to the previous groups, listened to the horror stories, and said “fuck no”.
---
I’d rather have Layering turned back on or just have cross-realm play than ever accept a balancing transfer.
---
Ok buddy, keep your tinfoil hat on.
---
I have been working on a 1-60 alliance leveling guide for the last 9 months. It's for every class but I main a mage. [Check it out](https://sage-guide.netlify.com).
---
I was so pissed when they said Pandas would be a race. So freakin lame
---
Plus, Tirisfall Glades have some amazing quest lines.
---
Pandaren have been in warcraft before WoW even existed
---
Get two gathering professions, mail all vendor items to an alt. Sell those items on ur alt then send back the money to your main.
---
In a raid you don't use as or shocks.  You twist totems.  Of you cannot maintain twisting totems, then you don't belong in the raid.  This likely means sacrificing personal dps for gear with intellect, mp5, and even spirit.
---
Depends if you have one or multiple tanks with nightfall. Hamstring spam is really only necessary if only one person has it.
---
Great stuff man! Some things needs to be fixed though, like how Druid healers Chest BiS is truefaith vestiments. and leggings of [Leggings of Transcendence](https://www.classicwowbuilds.com/bis#) is on the list to. Also missing all "of healing" greens as well. Gonna look into it tomorrow and report what i can find to be incorrect. This site will be more important then you think :)
---
You get downvoted since you are wrong. The few people that got burned out by simply watching wouldnt get past lvl 10 anyway.
---
Blood and thunder, friend.
---
Well, some classes /specs are optimal, but I like to think that in every raid there are few spots for offspecs. Maybe not in top raiding guilds aiming for naxx, but in those others not so hc. And consumables aren't so important until aq40.
---
Thanks. These redditors can downvote me all they want I don't care about karma lol.
---
What even is this analogy? Those pixels indicate real money I earned doing real work that gets used for a roof over my head, food, and water. You wanna know what gold is? Say it with me: Fake money! Can I pay my bills with it? No. Does the grocery store accept it when I’m hungry? No. I don’t know how currency needs to be explained to a grown human being but there you go.

Guide to mage: Press 1 for frostbolt
---
Pretty much.  Just like vanilla.
---
While true, I can't think of many high level places that have access to the coast. Feralas I suppose, Tanaris, Swamp of Sorrows if you consider that "high level". That being said, i'm sure some of the higher zones probably have spots you can drown in that spawns you inside the zone, considering Dun Morogh has a spot like that. Supposedly Winterspring has one, but I tried VERY hard to find it two stress tests ago, and ended up going all the way to Darkshore.
---
They seem better, yes. Ive not played much beta this week. So have not tested enough to say anything definitive.
---
Thanks for helping.

Unfortunately its not the video i am looking for.

It's ok he could taunt it ba--- oh wait.
---
Tbh having 1 hitcapped enh with both NF and Imp WF totem is pretty nice to have. It takes some serious effort to gear up, get invited and contribute so you gotta respect the hustle when you find a decent player doing it.
---
Can't have too many shamans anyway in my experience. Tremors, wipe recovery, resistance totems etc etc.
---
Also they barely get any loot whatsoever, which certainly doesn't hurt!

Probably part of the whole "the human eye can't see more than 30 fps" conspiracy. I used to not get it til I got a 144 monitor a few years back and I was like :O lol

Except your country is considered to be less superior in many accounts, so many infact that I dont want to spend the time listing them to you.
---
Go educated yourself, your country is considered to be a 3rd world country if you didn't know this, EU countries are wealthier and are considered more high tect and 1st world countries.
---
Your schools education system is worse.
---
Your medical System is worse.
---
You run the country on capitalism.
---
People without money or homes are treated like dirt.
---
People are unemployed.

You have the highest rate in the world for gun related "accidents"
---
You have one of the highest rates of polution and natural disasters.
---
You dont have free dental unless your company gives you. (In EU you get this until the age of 25)
---
I can sit here all day and let you know how your country stinks and how uneducated and brainwashed you are by your own countrymen.
---
I'm not replying to this again.
---
In casual guilds everyone can raid hell back in the day we did MC with ten-15 afk or DC we need to stop pushing these elitest ideas that only apply to the top 5% lol. Play what you want pvp raid casually have fun.
---
Anarchy Online represent!
---
You're right, it does suck to be pigeon holed into healing as a hybrid if you don't like healing. Outside of raids their diverse skill set really shines through, and their other builds are far more viable, but in raids there is far less freedom.
---
Additionally many of the less optimal builds are definitely viable. Private servers have a far more hard core crowd than the general populace of classic will be, so playing on a private server gives you a terrible sample bias for how you expect people to behave. Classic should definitely be less min/max crazy.
---
Don't let the inability to farm dissuade you from playing a healer (unless you just don't like healers). DME lasher farming for priests is amazing. They are one of the best farmers in the game if you have herbalism (but obviously nowhere near as good as mages or hunters). Paladins can farm stockades, SM cath, DME lashers, and several other places. Druids can do princess runs in mara, a few stealth runs (i think in lbrs and brd), and have several other good ways of farming. I'm pretty sure they can do DM trib runs, but I could be wrong. Shamans can... I haven't actually played shaman and can't think of anything of the top of my head. 
---
Classic isn't for everyone though. I read a thread about BC classic servers being planned. Hopefully that goes through and you'll be able to play a game you truly enjoy!
---
I’m between shaman and priest :(
---
what how
---
Absolute crap. I didnt gear at lvl 30 at all. I was wearing deadmines blues and some greens i got from questing and random drops.
---
My problem with pvp servers is I plan to play a healer and I'm sure as hell not going to spend the gold it takes to switch back and forth between specs. So to have fun on a pvp server I pretty much need a farming alt of a class that's actually good for pvp. My friends also convinced me to go alliance and there's no fucking way I'd play priest/lock on a pvp server against wotf. Yes I know in group pvp alliance is actually better but that doesn't make me feel better when im getting ganked out in the open world. 
---
So fast forward to where im basically a raid logger on my healer but I do almost everything else on my hunter, mage, or rogue. Is the healer even my main anymore? I'd feel as if I have no attachment to the character I play in raids, which to me should be my "main" character. Overall I just don't see myself having fun on a pvp server unless I was planning to main a class/spec that's highly viable in 1v1 pvp.
---
Got one for warlocks?
---
I read this in the Russian accent from the Starcraft Battlecruiser :)
---
Go play those then. I don't think anyone wants the toxic private server community infesting Classic anyway.
---
So you can grasp the fact that pixels can represent things of meaning, but you can't understand that people find meaning in their hobbies, and that people generally don't like it when other people cheat in a way that impacts their hobby?
---
You should be able to see the difference by simply moving your mouse in circles on your desktop.
---
I'm not listed in the content creators? Is it cause my sub count is too low? I get just as many views as some of the other content creators you've mentioned and my streams get 300+ views.
---
I like the elemental burst damage, I like enhancements mad wind fury crits and I like resto chain heal and mana stream totem.. shaman looks really appealing to me
---
You can't use Stormstrike in raids.
---
Well the T6/T7 shaman sets in WotLK haha
---
That doesn’t solve the problem of filling up your bags every time you go out to quest.
---
Well shoot, now it does. Nom nom
---
The thing is, in blizzards betas/alphas they have a public testing build of the game, and their internal testing build. The internal one is much ahead including loads of features and bug fixes which aren't immediately patched to the public version. This has been their way of handling testing since wotlk or so. 
---
Doesn't mean all the bugs are getting fixed, but can say for sure that the game will be in a lot more stable state when released. So no need to worry about what u see or hear in the beta
---
I don't play World of Warcraft, but I've had problems with other companies and their PVP systems in the past, so I will help you make it to 1500+.
---
Private servers have stated they have entire game mechanics not working properly. 
---
Game mechanics not correct &gt; some Bugs.
---
amen. 
---
He's great for setting up raids, but he's way too much of a numbers guy. That being said its not like anything that is really his fault. Most of the problems I personally have with modern retail wow came from the lead devs before him.
---
Duck the PIRATED servers.
---
I am pretty much thinks ng the same thing unfortunately. Part of me doesn't want to believe it though. That kind of action would fuck this up so hard, do for the life of classic they have to maintain it how it was!
---
This doesn't answer the question. You explained why warriors and hunters are good, but you failed to explain why shamans are *bad*. If you don't want to substantiate your claims, don't post.
---
This was the case early in vanilla, but they patched it out.  You could kill a mob, hold the points, run to your next target, then SnD with the points from the last mob, switch to new target.
---
"being able to maintain hz" has nothing to do with the game or what you are looking at. You will always have 240 Hz refresh rate on your display. Don't conflate FPS and Hz.
---
They have never stated that. Stop spreading lies. Private server mob pathing is infinitely better than beta mob pathing.
---
&gt; Private servers have stated they have entire game mechanics not working properly
---
no they havent, you have never played private servers
---
No, but many people have serious heart defects and do not know it until...BAM!
---
19, out for a jog, no clue your heart has an issue, and suddenly you're on the ground with lights out. It happens so very rarely, but it does happen.
---
I'm wondering how many Nightfall wielding raid members you need to have before the damage increase from the debuff is outweighed by having that many players using Nightfall.
---
Except on the servers where it was VC before Diremaul even came out.
---
There is no pink photon. The colour pink you see is a combination of every colour in the rainbow minus green. Trivia.
---
Yeah I am saying it all the time. They gonna fuck classic the same way as they fucked retail. Current state is boring and unplayable. And they want money for it. Not just once but monthly. Loool wake up blizz.
---
what if.. now hear me out alright   
---
what if this fucking shit has been posted already a thousand times
---
hmm
---
From what it used to be? Yes, it's gotten way better, but there definetly are still bots. It's a constant battle, of the bot creators to make new, undetected ones for a while and by Blizz to fight those.
---
The game will never be 100% bot free.
---
Beta was bad cuz muh hype died down. Never mind the thousands of bugs that have been found and fixed.
---
Warlocks are super tanky with good gear and SM/Ruin since their healing in classic is not reduced by Mortal Strike, that was added in TBC patch since SL/SL was literally unkillable
---
shadowpanther.net, not .com
---
what if this has been posted already
---
I thought it was hilarious when they announced it as an april fools joke.  Less so when they released it a few years later as a real joke.
---
It goes back to the WC3 beta forums. One day Chris Metzen was dumping concept art in a thread, one of which was of a Pandaren that Samwise Didier had drawn. There was also an easter egg of a panda's face on the Demon Hunter's warglaive. People asked about it, and Samwise said something like it was just a character of his own that he liked to draw. People liked it enough they added the Brewmaster in TFT as a neutral hero.
---
I mean, I don't know how or why they decided to make them as big as they are now, but that's where it started.
---
They aren't the best tanks. (Obviously) But they can tank 5 man content okay.
---
Oh I'm totally going to. I couldn't care less what you think about it.
---
I quit in the first few weeks of Cataclysm. There were too many small changes that I didn't like; mostly a lot of the new class/race combinations. I felt kind of bad quitting a game I had played for 5ish years at that point.
---
Then when I saw the next expansion had Pandas as a playable race I realized I got out at the right time.
---
It's because it was a lot people's first dungeon and they found out about from a quest called Kill Van Cleef or something. They looked for groups for the quest by saying "lfg van cleef", and then people started shortening it. The name stuck on many servers.
---
I didn’t say “maintain 240 hz”
---
Get your head out of your ass.
---
**Then your answer is priest.** We dedicated shammys are unwavered by the temptations of the lesser classes.
---
^^srsly ^^tho, ^^me ^^too. ^^shadow ^^priest ^^ftw!
---
Druids are near impossible to catch so if you’re outnumbered you just run away and can prevent caps from a distance.
---
Info like that won't be hidden for long. They're going to want their names, if anything.
---
bruh this was month ago, a little slow on that remove
---
I think this time around will be about the same. Solo players and pvp whores usually went horde due to thier better passives for pvp.
---
Gold has no meaning or value. Somebody having 1000 more fake money than you impacts you in exactly 0 ways. It just pisses you off because you either don’t have disposable income yourself or you just don’t want other people having nice things that you don’t. Either way you would benefit from learning to separate reality from fiction.
---
I feel like this is more like an irrational fear. Of course I'm sure some people might do this, but realistically, how many? How many people are going to drop an extra €25 or whatever it is just to not get ganked while levelling?
---
We also don't know when they will open up server transfers. It may not be until phase 2 or later that you're allowed to transfer, by which point, the bulk of players will have already levelled anyway.
---
I do ultimately agree though, this restriction was in place when we could first do transfers, and ought to be in classic too. The only thing I would say though is if server populations would benefit from consolidation with a free transfer window, even if that would mean allowing PvE-&gt;PvP transfers, then I would like to see it be an option if it would be better for the population.
---
I'd rather have people to play with than worry about how someone levelled to 60.
---
Dont you have to be aware of healing threat pulling aggro onto you? Or is that negliagable if VW has enough threat?
---
Verdant Breach and Veiled Strand have been two of my favorites alongside this one! I love the idea of filling out the coastal zones and making the continents actually feel completely travelable (seriously, why didn't they do this in BfA with the nautical theme?! It's even called *Battle for Azeroth* ugh facepalm...)
---
I hope Blizzard sincerely looks into doing something like this with a potential Classic+ in 2-4 years down the road.
---
Are you sure? I've heard ppl say 5% is the cap
---
What if Blizzard just shuts down Classic after 2 years?
---
And it sucks not caring to much about end game raiding and getting peer pressured into playing a spec you don't like, and getting shit on when asking if you can play your main spec off and on. Being a shadow priest in original wow was not fun when it came to raiding, specially in a big guild where they would specifically change the rules to make sure you could never get the gear you wanted.
---
Simply invite ppl who dont touch retail
---
Let’s also make it so your character gets tired and needs to sleep
---
Also all the content is solved. So if your raid is failing at something it’s easy to find out why. 
---
No more “maybe we just need more dps” or whatever was happening.
---
DM clearly stands for Dungeon Master so when someone says DM they mean Roleplaying
---
Oh you sweet summer child. Get to end game and in a decent raiding guild and you'll see this whole not feeling obligated thing fade away faster than your hairline in your 50's.
---
No playable Goblins is a bit of a bummer, though.
---
Dude they’ve fixed bigger issues in days. Relax. Hunters will be fine.
---
Thanks for the new and interesting ideas. This has really opened my mind to new and interesting possibilities.
---
Maybe some tie-ins to the WCIII TFT campaign where Tyrande and Maiev assist Kael's caravan
---
Who hurt you?1
---
The beta is already tons better. You dont know what you are talking about
---
I sort by new cause I’m not an NPC.  So instead of saying dumb shit unrelated - focus on this post. If I knew that I wouldn’t have posted but clearly I don’t. Contribute or leave
---
I can if I do it really fast
---
Not to mention, a prot pally just can't generate as much threat as a warrior or druid. So depending on your raid comp, it's a no go from the start.
---
Will this work with prot warrior?  Also, is it worth doing without someone with enchanting?
---
Oh shit duh.  T7 that was!

This comment gives me irrational rage and fear.

nice

If you want to play melee dps u should just go warr or rogue
---
I think he knows this. He's just trying to be funny. I chuckled at least.
---
You played yourself. Gg.
---
Not like youd get to 60 if getting to 30 burned you out.
---
DPS dont get invited solely so they can top the charts. Every raid will need at least 2 good hunters.
---
r/classicwowplus
---
thank you! ill be referring this to QA should be an easy fix
---
Pally gang day 1-1,000,000,000
---
No taunt, not as much threat as a warrior, takes more damage than a warr. Warriors are the only viable endgame tank.
---
We should probably get a few more tags for the builds going.
---
"Meta" would be nice; using some mechanic or build which employs unusual mechanics (like the Spelladin).
---
I'd say "Solo" "Group" "5-man" "Raid" and "RP" would be a good start as well, since people will be looking for those. "Leveling" should stay, since you can then see if a build is a "Solo" + "leveling" or "Group" + "Leveling" build.
---
This is a very good response. I think dps warriors can also pair up with priests and do righteous orb runs, but I could be wrong.
---
I'm considering doing a tanking service in addition to herb/alch
---
We're really going for the low-hanging fruit here with 9gag posts huh
---
And I think T6 was the same aesthetics but was blue?
---
There were server transfers in Vanilla (with long cooldowns), and there should be server transfers in Classic.  There are a plethora of reasons to transfer servers. Get off your high horse.
---
I thought the tomb of sargeras is on the lost isles according to wc3 tft ?
---
No?
---
no its not, they fixed 2 bugs out of 50+ in almost 2 months of beta, thats bad
---
Yeah, you die after you lose the 6 minute buff. no durability loss cos suicide (my other vanilla char was a lock so killing yourself for durability save was always fun).

Is Deep wounds optimal use of debuff slots? And what about rupture? Looks like rogues were using that when the raid was split
---

---
There are tons of things that dont work right on pservers.
---
Frontstabbing, mobs fear pathing is predictable instead of random, feral damage being too high, mob damage being too high, being feared off a moving boat can send you into a high speed no man's land and trap your character. If you mind control someone off a ledge they can get stuck in midair, blink animation is wrong, etc.
---
Blizzard at least has the resources to correct these problems.
---
I'm 100% going to play a shaman...
---
Except that all my friends and family play Alliance like weaklings, so I'm now undecided
---
The community is worse for having you in it.
---
Issue with them in 2s is that nos of the bracket was druid warriors and druid warlocks. And hunters had no idea chance against either.
---
How much did judgment of the light heal for in t2+gear?
---
What are some of the easier classes in pvp?
---
Yes. Join us! 
---
We are happy to have you on the US servers. Ping shouldn't be too big of an issue either. You just need to find a guild with the right raid times for you
---
Go play on pservers then mmkay?
---
Yes from the beta...doing farm runs was quite common to get 40 . 
---
Im not sure any other instance beats out cath just because in cath there are so many mobs so tightly packed together.
---
ZF is spread out and has those damn blood drinkers for example which seems it'd slow things down
---
...his answer was located within his non-answer, if you just looked for it. He stated that warriors and hunters have instant attacks with no cooldown. Generally you wont be using stormstrike in a raid. So all you can do is auto. That's bad.
---
How is that even relevant? I literally just told you: "Just because I never did something does not mean I don't know anything about it."
---
Look at this site or realmpop

The only remotely played rp pvp server is Emerald Dream and thats because its not really an rp server its just another pvp realm

Glad you know and are picking race for an awesome reason like that. You can also jump up from fd into shadowmeld and stuff so there's plenty of fun to be had.
---
My first toon was tauren hunter...I think its a bad combo for pve and pvp though beefy cow and stomps were some great fun.

It just got reported today and i didn't check the dates. It's just a removal message to explain, not a warning or ban or owt

Goblin starting zone and Azshara was fun as heck. I lost my shit during the [Dozercism quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctd2AVhjshg).

I think Goblins would have made a good neutral race.
---
It's the most important item in the game for paladins
---
And Thrall doesn’t look like a lil bitch
---
It's not like the requirements are high at all for a game in 2019 though.
---
nah
---
Hate to break it to you but... That's every generation of kids. There all annoying  adhd squirrel chasing window lickers. Thats what kids do.
---
Excellent explanation. Brief but detailed enough to get the point across.
---
i gotcha, can't believe people are salty enough about em to report someone for talking about it
---
BC was shit. If they released BC tomorrow instead of back then you'd think it was just more modern wow trash.
---
Looks like someone had the same thing in Teldrassil too though, so I'm not so sure that's why. Good point though
---
Not sure what any of this has to do with the beta.

Canada is the worst. No one has healthcare. Their public education system is way worse than America. The people are rude there too! Canada's one saving grace is how well their roads are maintained. Not a pothole anywhere in the whole country.
---
(This is probably way funnier in my head)
---
Holy shit you're a complete moron.
---
Oh my god this made my day. Thanks for being stupid so we don't have to.
---
Lol you think they prioritize pushing that out to the beta. Even with the bugs it would still be better than private servers. But you go to private servers then. Ill play classic and have a way better experience
---
There's definitely some negatives that come with it but for me a huge benefit is that if I find myself on a server whose population is beginning to dwindle and goes from High to medium population, I can just jump ship at a small cost and move to whatever realm has the largest and most active playerbase.
---
who needs ret when holy is so good
---
Bosses aren't how you get fast XP though they don't give much more. You get fast xp from killing a shitton of trash really fast.i'm not sure though as I've only done ZF at the 40 cap
---
Is there a thread or post for pre-planned guilds?
---
I’m an OG wow player, raided at end game in Vanilla, currently Mythic raiding (but like so many people just isn’t the ticket).
---
I just want a guild to level with and raid, not start the game with nobody to play with (my current guildies never played classic, so don’t plan to pick it up more then just a “oh so that’s what it was like, eh.”
---
Plus half the fun of Vanilla is gonna be the experience and I want people to enjoy it with who actually miss it!
---
Can we just get a sticky in this sub?
---
"If you can't log into the Classic game, THEN YOU DON'T HAVE BETA."

Seems pretty damn self-explanatory.

Except when your 60% mount can't keep up with the 100% mounts (obtained through cheating) when trying to gather herbs/ore, or trying to escape a ganker. MMOs are not single player games where every player's experience is an isolated bubble unaffected by the actions of others. They are social games where respect is earned through putting in the time. Would you expect to get respect from a gym full of lifelong athletes if you showed up with no training and a bag full of roids and HGH and started to out-perform them?
---
&gt; It just pisses you off because you either don’t have disposable income yourself or you just don’t want other people having nice things that you don’t.
---
It pisses people off when people use wealth to cheat systems. Look at the public reaction to the university admissions scandal in the US involving hundreds of celebrities and wealthy families. I don't care if a rich person owns a fancy yacht that I will never get to own. I do care if a rich person parks that yacht illegally on a public beach area so that every non-rich person's swimming experience is ruined. Communities have rules, and MMOs are communities.
---
&gt; Either way you would benefit from learning to separate reality from fiction.
---
We all play the game in reality. Fiction is the lore in the game; us playing it is real. We have real social experiences with each other when we group up. We feel real emotions when we win or fail. Experiencing and enjoying any kind of hobby is a very human thing to do.
---
Go to the classic warlock discord, there is a crazy amount of info there.
---
I would roll an alliance character then. I'm looking forward to revisiting those zones again.
---
&gt;How is that even relevant
---
Tips is a retard and is just assuming things he doesnt know about private servers. And even worst, you are using him to prove your argument.
---
Guild wars 2 basegame is free. Worth a try.
---
I love the writing in those.  Can we get one of these for all classes??
---
The agreement my guild always makes with the inevitable enhance shaman is blacksmithing. The shaman can be a useless raid member but he has to farm thorium rep. Nightfall is better off on an offtank spamming hamstring.
---
It was my favorite pet of all time, and then one day I randomly looted it in vanilla.  Still my favorite pet of all time even after all these expansions.
---
They were similar, and blue, but [different](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/news/10898-shaman-tier-20-armor-models.png)
---
Based on all the responses I guess a lot of people don't know this but all 240 hz and most 144 hz monitors are tn panels which are way harsher on your eyes than ips panels. So that's why
---
You'd be surprised as a lvl 4 how often you're going to die vs lvl 5-6 mobs.
---
You auto and totem twist, which contributes DPS to your melee group.
---
Definitely take skinning till at least 40, but I'd actually recommend keeping it till your early 50s. Leveling up blacksmithing is very expensive, and vendoring all that leather will help. Plus you don't need to go out of your way to collect the leather.
---
However you might want to reconsider blacksmithing if you don't really enjoy crafting professions. In general, almost every thing you could want from blacksmithing is boe, so it's better to just have mining and know a blacksmith (your guild usually has one). This doesn't work for everyone though.
---
Only if they are greedy. That's why the second option is greed.
---
Which has absolutely nothing to do with what we're talking about? What?
---
Yeah gonna add it, thanks!
---
Nice blog post.
---
Thanks, going to add it!
---
I feel they make up for it slightly with windfury procs increasing night fall procs but it doesn't quite makeup the difference
---
Cool. Good to know.
---
Blood Elves should have remained High Elves and been a part of the Alliance instead blue squid people.
---
Then the Horde would have had Goblins.
---
No sorry was not on purpose, I would like to add anyone who creates content to the list. I knew I was going to miss people. So if you leave a link here I can add you to the list
---
Mods. Please.
---
They're great offtanks, with content - appropriate gear, and feral tanks make good use of a few items that are pretty garbage for warriors
---
Are you a medical doctor able to make a retardation diagnosis? If you watch the video he states in the first couple of minuted that he spoke to someone who managed a Private server. 
---
So your argument may be that he is a lair or is relying on someone who is a liar.
---
I know, they just need to keep the 6 months or so cooldown on them then it's fine, and no PvE to PvP of course.
---
Pandaren we’re creep mobs before TFT.
---
And then they added the debuff limit.
---
There are plenty of 144hz IPS panels
---
Almost never run more than 2.
---
&gt;  ...mob damage being too high 
---
 That one I actually like with private servers, that mobs do more damage. Watched a video the other day where it was claimed that mobs in dungeons on the beta "hit almost half as hard" as on private servers.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u48WF9uIpZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u48WF9uIpZo)  ( roughly 8 minutes in)
---
 Personally I wouldn't mind if mobs were made even more difficult than on private servers. I played retail classic back in the day but I'm not stuck to having classic be an exact replica. Today players are better and we know more about the game, a harder game I would just consider a plus.
---
Mine was feb 2011 probably when I finished my professor title
---
Absolutely, but we should only really count one extra attack in that case, since all your melees with have windfury, but the shaman ability for themselves does give one extra attack. Still pretty bad though.
---
I hope they nerf them hard to fuck with the mages. Though I feel bad for the priests who are also affected.
---
Not while leveling you can’t! That’s where you’ll savor the souls the most.
---
I'll take pandas over emo demon hunters.
---
It's not a waste to run 1.  It's generally preferred.
---
Cool man! Would you mind if I use your list to add more creators to mine?
---
How to Play enh shammy: Don't.
---
Well it's a BoE so if you have a lot of gold you can get one.  
---
I think I may want one on my Holy pally for some encounters, may work with a build that gets holy shock, seal of command and pursuit of justice.
---
Like as a switch in PVP from a shield and SP mace so I can attack better in certain situations.
---
Server transfers kill server community. There needs to be the old cooldown to prevent this.
---
Crafting materials will probably (HUGE assumption) be worth next to nothing in the first few weeks. People want gold fast while leveling, especially if they're rushing to 60. This means many put the price lower than everyone else, and this keeps the prices down.
---
You'll most likely end up better off just vendoring your materials until like level 40 or a couple weeks in. This actually adds up to a decent amount and is more than worth it.
---
Whoops, fixed!
---
Either way, people that level on a PvE server don't deserve the benefits of playing on a PvP server, no matter how you look at it.
---
Mob damage is also low for some mobs. Not every mob in the game is dealing more damage on private servers.
---
Undead has the better spellcasting animation imo.
---
Seems like you graduated from themeparks and are ready to play a real MMORPG. Congrats.
---
That's a good way of viewing it. It's okay when progress raiding because you really want to kill that boss. But when it's on farm and your raid leader forces you to pop expensive consumables it's not so fun. Speedruns are a good motivator too. Spending a week farming all sorts of weird and wonderful shit to do an MC in under 20 minutes is pretty fun.
---
The blizzbots will downvote you for this one
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
That would have missed the whole point of Blood Elves which was to give the Horde a pretty race (supposedly to balance out the numbers between both factions).
---
Cool man! Did not know there was already a list like this. Would be cool if we could maybe merge the list. I really like the lay-out of yours. I would prefer to keep the small introductions, so it would be a little like an old phone book.
---
Now do that to all classes!!
---
Lol are you okay?
---
That’s a shame MoP had a lot of great things about it, including one of the best leveling and questing experiences in any WoW expansion to-date.
---
Ok didn't know that. Sounds good in my book. Hopefully it evens out then.
---
&gt;first couple of minuted that he spoke to someone who managed a Private server
---
ok im done with you, go watch tips
---
Goblins are at the level of Pandas, not visually but certainly thematically. Shit like rocket boots is straight from Wily E Coyote.
---
I did not know that! I just thought they were considered uglier. My eyeball-hurting new monitor is IPS, though
---
I really enjoyed this
---
It sucks.
---
I hope someone makes a Classic video with that coming home sing skyler grey sings
---
You coming back? Just thought it was funny that mine turned out to be exactly one year prior to classic's release. I'll basically be clean for a year when classic launches.
---
You do understand every popular private server has more bugs than the beta has right?
---
That's melee hit, not spell hit.
---
Stop running into mobs
---
17-17-17 tri spec!
---
Meh, Blizzard never confirmed this and there wasn’t really a huge faction imbalance at the time. If anything it was just a way to explain Paladin and Shaman crossover, albeit not very well.
---
Roll a warrior Hordeside, then pretend you're a paladin all the way up to 60.
---
Only autoattack, stock up on buff scrolls, keep oils and sharpening stones on you and say they're seals, etc.
---
Just want to say i love you : )
---
Which is exactly what I said. It can be meh with occasional good fights provided you apply insane amounts of out of raid effort. If you wanna top dps with no where near the effort, as melee, go rogue or war.
---
The dwarf NPC (Rousch) in Hillsbrad Foothills overlooking the sea has a similar story, not as well known but touching nevertheless.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/In_Loving_Memory
---
You can. By 1.12 there was a debuff priority system in place which meant that so called 'trash' debuffs like deep wounds wouldn't push off important debuffs like curse of elements or shadows.
---
I’m gonna main holy pally, will do gold runs with warriors
---
Essentially you burnt yourself out getting a few classes to level 30 on a private server which in essence means you would have stood very little chance on the 60 grind in classic.
---
Tier .5 doesn’t come in til phase4 or 5 I believe. R10 will be in phase 2.
---
Two nightfall axes is generally considered enough to accomplish the job.
---
finding bugs takes a large amount of people and testing. once bugs have been reported you fix and verify the fix in internal builds.
---
a beta is not publicly updated for every god damn bug to satisfy some nolife crybaby.
---
once they fixed enough and deam it necessary to get a new beta build going for more testing they will update it, or they won't bother updating again and just release the fixed and verified version.
---
i swear to god you morons need to read a software quality assurance guideline once in your life so we can stop having those stupid posts
---
Really?  I got a free invite back to mop for 7 days and the leveling was so boring and pigeon holed.  It was like goblin leveling. You had to do x,y,z or live on the island forever.  That shit kills open world imo.  It's not open if quests pigeon hole your progress out of a zone.
---
Nerd.  
---
I really don’t care what you pserver nerds think and I am going to own you all in PvP.
---
What a brave comment.
---
yes i too looked at the picture
---
Are you sure that's the set? I recall it looking differently but that could be because it was a decade ago
---
Of course you are ..... you are only capable of throwing insults, but as soon as a sound argument arises you run away.
---
yes and yes, vendoring blue boos is decent money. its slower as a prot though :)
---
I’ve never had an issue while leveling multiple locks as Affliction. Your VW has multiple taunts by lvl 30ish and the individual mobs die too fast for heavy aggro. Just make sure you use the AoE taught on multiple mobs and let the VW build threat on 2 while you dot up 1, then send it to 3 while you dot up 2 etc

Without a doubt! Console games have left a sour taste in my mouth after anthem and chaosebane. Diablo 3 is feeling pretty stale. I understand most arpg players consume content way too fast and I’m looking forward to a slower game and I really miss raiding. 
---
Was planning to build a new gaming pc for halo anyway but there isn’t much news about that on the horizon
---
Why would you pick up Blacksmithing early on? It makes no sense to waste time on Crafting-Professions before 60.
---
Pick Skinning and Mining for leveling.
---
Missing the best expansion WoD
---
I dual boxed before and I plan on doing it again. I would skip many collection quests, but alt tab worked really well. I spent most time running an afliction lock with a pally as a pocket healer on follow. So I would run around dotting everything and life tapping to keep going.
---
no they dont
---
I love you too robit
---
I feel that having PCT is overall worse for the long term health of the game than not having it. 
---
So far I've seen 3 decent reasons for having them, moving away from dead realms, constant griefing/stalking, and playing with friends.
---
Dead realms - I think that moving away from dead realms is something Blizzard can actually attempt to regulate by offering free realm transfers like they did back in the day or perhaps merging low pop into a medium pop realm. On the other hand, there's no quicker way of making a medium pop realm into a dead one than with PCT being available. Which is exactly what happened to retail server before they started connecting them.
---
Griefing - From my experience this doesn't really happen that often and usually doesn't last that long and is ultimately something that GMs might be able to help with in severe cases. Of course it will be different for streamers but they know what they're signing up for.
---
Friends - People have had 2 years to organize with friends to play on the same realm. Should the needs of the few have an impact on the entire game? Makes me sound a bit like an asshole when I say it like that, but I really don't think this is a sufficiently good enough reason to introduce the service all things considered.
---
Let's go over some negatives then.
---
Population balance - If a realm with a balanced population has a handful of really good horde guilds, and only one good alliance guild, with PCT you will see the the H:A ratio shift dramatically midway through Classic. Same goes for realms having celebrities, or just great reputation in general. People will move there in huge numbers. This is something that didn't happen in Vanilla because PCT was only introduced near the very end and it wasn't as used as it was in TBC where some realms saw huge chunks of their population disappear.
---
Guild deaths - This is speaking from personal experience. It only takes a handful of core members to decide to transfer to a different realm for whatever reason for the entire guild to collapse. This can happen often enough to seriously jeopardize the entire faction on a server. I've seen it happen.
---
Personal reputation - One's standing in the community is greatly diminished in value if people can act in the most anti-social manner possible (within limits of getting banned) and then simply move to another realm and continue like normal. There are ultimately no repercussions for one's actions.
---
The general vibe of the community certainly felt different before and after PCT was introduced. At least from my experience.
---
Economic stability - Being on a low pop realm effectively means less competition for resources, and having huge stockpiles of mats/consumables being transferred on lower level characters can seriously impact the economy of a targeted realm. Don't underestimate people that are prepared to do this. It will happen.
---
Streamer transfers - I don't even need to explain how bad this one is, do I?
---
Apart from the cash it brings, ultimately I don't see why Blizzard has to immediately introduce this service to Classic. Can't we just wait and see how populations and communities form and progress before we introduce a service that has such a high influence on how the game is played?
---
Nah people allowing this trash is making it worse.
---
Hopefully we will be enough sane people to keep these trolls out of our groups.
---
&gt;I am going to own you all in PvP
---
you'll most likely get crushed by private server veterans tbh
---
I think knowledge of and willingness to farm consumables is another big factor.  The amount of consumables you bring to Naxx raids on pservers is insane.  I wasn't even a tank, good lord I pity them.
---
This is a good answer!
---
I'm still a small fry but I figured I've got high view count compared to other small channels that rivals some of the lads you've posted.
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxa1v9wVMmjYUhUfQOJxbzw/videos
---
Been a tad inactive but that's just cause I've been working on some major, autismal projects.
---
Private servers dont have the soul that blizzard has. AI is retarded
---
And you haven't played the beta. If the game sucks at launch then you dont have to play. Where do you get this sense of entitlement?
---
Such a bitter wanker.
---
As a priest, I strongly support this
---
call the mods to protec you, its leddit after all, right?
---
Also, like the guide says,
---
"Fuck hunters."
---
Im the opposite! Minimal UI, nothing unneccessary. Bags + Micro Menu - Bottom Right, Minimap - Top Left, 5 Bars stacked up in the middle and chat on the left.
---
I try to play with no DPS Meters and occasionally use threat bars when needed
---
You’d prefer a quest hub with 20 quests you don’t read and can do in any order, giving the story no sense of weight or thematics?
---
No thanks.
---
I understand your position clearly now I believe, but we just fundamentally disagree on what is more important. We have laid out our arguments and I do not think that there is more to discuss. I hope you find groups that suit your style as well as I do mine.
---
Still, if anything it would have created that massive imbalance, seeing as Blood Elves are, along with Humans, by far the most popular race. Goblins have Gnome-like popularity, except they don't give you the urge to step on them.
---
everything u need is within

More stale wojak edits.
---
Like all RP-PvP servers though they had the disadvantage of starting later than RP servers and thus having a weaker pool of growth.
---
Classic RP-PvP servers have a far better chance than the late original ones, also retention rate is more important than flat numbers.
---
Try using some basic deductive reasoning. The only instant attack enhance has is stormstrike which has a huge mana cost and a cooldown. Enhance shamans are terrible at applying nightfall
---
Looking at this reminded me why I never want to play a vanilla shaman again.
---
Holy shit I thought i was hyped before but now I am full erect. I can’t believe I’ve never seen these
---
no if hes just trying to stir things up hes a troll lol
---
Even if you were to use stormstrike it has a cooldown and huge mana cost
---
No other comment in this thread is attempting to teach you to not be  a helpless moron.
---
Fury 2H is a thing. More so in the early game when 1H are scarce.
---
Meh every class is valued given the unique buffs and cc they bring to the table. Just don't play balance druid. Everyone agrees that spec sucks.
---
The fuck do you know man?  I’ve been a rank 1 gladiator in arenas,  and a Global Elite in CSGO, and I regularly win games of fortnite so I’d worry if I were you.
---
/s lol
---
yeah for improved windfurry
---
He's not talking about the Pandaren leveling, he's talking about Pandaria (the 85-90 zone).
---
If you’re wondering why this is downvoted, the streamers are telling people the cap won’t be raised, without naming their source.
---
Doing the lords work. Thrall bless.
---
He thinks you're talking about the Pandaren starting zone.
---
This guide could have been condensed into one 1 word. "DONT"
---
I fail to see what this has to to do with the beta?
---
See you in-game Aug 27th when your choice won’t be playing a temporary character on a shitty emulator.
---
They're also prohibitively expensive. Starts around $450. 
---
I don't agree that TN panels are worse for your eyes though.
---
The point is I love AV and I will be there as soon as it's possible.
---
It's not necessarily "suboptimal". I'm advocating for CHOICE. Why do you get to choose **for someone else** what is *optimal*?
---
I'm telling you what is commonplace. And I happen to agree with it as well. That people can roll need on something that is an upgrade. That's literally what the need option/roll is there for. You're trying to neutralize the need option and make all rolls greed rolls, because you apparently have decided that no one actually deserves upgrades and that boes should always go to the AH... 
---
Rolling need on upgrades, regardless of bop, boe *is the norm*. So you're the one that needs to state the abnormal policy of rolling need(actual greed roll) on everything. Call them GREED runs or something.
---
I'm definitely not talking about rolling need for alts. That would be a ninja loot. *Need* should only be selected if you can and will, use it right then and there.
---
8 shamans = totems in every group
---
9-16 shamans = windury + tranq totem to every group
---
Def cant have too many shamans
---
Please no one new to classic vanilla fall for this. You will not get a raidspot with this spec, unless the raidleader is an idiot or it's two years into the game and they are speedrunning old raids for fun. Even then you won't get it on merit. There will be PLENTY of resto shamans that in every possible situation provide more benefit simply dropping WF. No one takes an actual bis melee gear enhance shaman to raids, let alone this abomination that provides the same buffs but with less dps.
---
Improved weapons totems is not a legitimate raid dps boost. In fact the entire totem twisting thing is of very situational benefit. On the vast majority of fights the shaman will be better off preserving  mana for heals.
---
You'll have to farm ridiculous int / mp5 gear you can't use for actual enhance play, and that will not even be in the game for a long time after launch
---
you will be bored out of your mind as hinted by the "2 totems &amp;  autoattack" being the entire rotation
---
I would say OP is wrong but I can't even do that since this is like the 10th repost of this shit
---
Fishing in AV isn’t *that* bad...
---
thats funny, seems i read a DPS asks how to farm gold.
---
he cant be for real, in a game where you DPS down a mob to loot it and get items/gold.
---
a DPS is strugling to make money, guys come together and donate some money.
---
i always knew a tank or heal can farm so mich better. i mean, if a mob hits you often enough maybe he gives you his gold...
---
dude what the fuck, kill shit and loot it
---
hands down, this has to be the most retarded argument against mop
---
They were a bit more than stopgap tbh. Having an extra epic piece a weeks was gnarly
---
I can make all my gold in the first month and pretty much buy raid consumes forever though
---
At first, I was like "why would I ever use this over the classicdb talent calculator?". Then I realized I'm an idiot and need to read better.
---
This looks like it has a lot of potential. Keep up the good work!
---
Without improved sprint, makes you want to roll gnome for escape artist
---
This shit is like when McDonalds had the balls to start saying "Welcome back" instead of "Hello".
---
I literally quit the game over pandas, my last day was the day before Pandaria launched. Granted all of my friends had quit by then and I was getting tired of the game, but pandas were the last straw.
---
Just thinking about all of the panda furries I'd have to endure while playing on a RP server (Moon Guard) was too much.
---
It's actually like 99.9% of the player base
---
I agree rocket boots are goofy, but classic is full of goofy stuff like that already. I mean whats goofier than a mechanical chicken mount?
---
Thats not what we are talking about here. Since there would be no 2h fury warriors in the raid it would then be classified as pvp need. in which case pal/sham or warrior would have equal prio.
---
And how do they pay for all that? Oh yeah, they rely on the USA for national defense.
---
I love that half of this subreddit thinks they're going to "push for world firsts"
---
Lol blizzard and soul in the same sentence
---
A dps warrior will have no problem whatsoever with farming. If you had said prot warrior it would be another thing. Basically making gold at 60 comes down to the more you learn about the game the richer you will become. Obvious of course but just saying it since there are so many ways to make gold. If you haven't played on private servers( classic was so long ago so hard to remember) it will be a learning experience for how to make gold. It's not apparent. Stuff like already mentioned farming elemental earth/fire etc.
---
It's because the entire quest led up to killing Van Cleef. Think about it. If it's your first time playing, you're not thinking "I need a group to run deadmines", you're thinking "I need a group to kill this Van Cleef guy".
---
You'll do fine in dungeons even at 60, Id go so far to say that tanking as a prot paladin in DUNGEONS is much more fun than druid/warr - but take it from someone that ran a prot paladin vanilla through cata; you'll better get your own guild(or be highly ranked in one) or have a large circle of friends or else you'll have a hard time raiding. I mostly ran as an OT and that wen't fine but if you want to do some serious tanking, look towards some other class.
---
Obviously chosen because of the 8.2 raid.
---
What do you think a beta is got besides bug fixing, especially in a game that's already been fucking released before hahaha
---
It doesn’t even out. And it will be more apparent when we get into raiding and people realize how overtuned raid bosses were on private servers.
---
Join a progression guild. You'll be free to bid on 2Hers after the hunters hav3 their pick. Even on PvP servers, progression guilds will be made to progress, not get everybody their wish list.
---
If you just join a raid guild on a PvP server that raids one day a week to get gear for well...PvPing, you'll probably have to roll against 15 people for the same 2Her  and won't be taken on raids if you don't waste PvP weapon dkp on getting some vear so they'll take you to heal over 10 other paladins willing to spec and gear holy.
---
OP had nothing to do with this, this thing's been around for at least a year
---
Hahahahahaha... I think all private servers combined have less bugs than Classic beta.
---
I came here to point this out! MATLAB IS LIFE.
---
I disagree because as a horde the same happens with arugal. I kept reading his name in quests, i knew his name and that i was going to kill him but no one ever called the instance his name. Sure i knew his name better than the dungeon name but the quests still says where you need to go so thats what i looked for.
---
Other way around. Private servers do it for the love and passion. Blizzard does it for the money and money.
---
And you realize that its not very much effort to fix bugs you've already fixed before and the fact they do it so slowly is an obvious issue. I always enjoy watching blizztards argue with blizz haters.
---
Link please? :D
---
jugdement of light doesn't scale, other then from set bonuses.  
---
Base it is 50% chance proc to heal for 61.  
---
With 3 piece T1 it is 60% chance to heal for 61.
---
With 2 piece T3 it is 50% chance to heal for 81.
---
With both combined 60% chance for 81.  I think it is likely worth it on any aoe fight to have a designated paladin wear T1 for the set bonus.  
---
In a 5man the healing is noticable but not crazy and only rarely worth judging.  Baron rivendare is probably best case example of it being good in 5mans.  Rend in UBRS is really good because it is such a long fight and you will have more then 5 people.  The more people hitting the target the better so in a raid it is a lot of healing on the order of several hundred heal per second if the raid is taking aoe damage, when healers maxx out in naxx gear in the 600hps range.  
---
Tier 1
---
good idea, just added this
---
Even the things they "get right" people have no clue if their formula is right or if they just settled at the right answer. Like if blizzard used (18 / 9) + 2 = 4 the pservers just see the end result in an old 2006 YouTube clip, the 4, and they very likely used a different route to get there. 2 + 2 is not the same even though they both end up at the same destination
---
Tipsout is a legit retard though. I thought everyone knew that at this point.
---
Yep, need more people there
---
Classic will never be better than private servers.
---
Would it be a good idea to play a mage/hunter for the sole purpose of farming gold and have your alt be the class you actually want to play?
---
no
---
1. Wait until the mage has pulled a mob or is eating/drinking.
---
2. Kill mage
---
From the fact they are charging money to play a game they already have made before and yet still can't fix the bugs properly.  
---
Its not entitlement to expect a functioning product when you are paying for it.
---
Its also hilarious how you guys think they are going to magically unleash some secret internal build with a bunch of features and fixes in a month lolz
---
Nail on the head. 
---
You're almost definitely not doing any raids as prot, but depending on how casual you are that doesn't matter. Prot is also really fun to aoe farm as. Nothing like going to SM Cath with a damage on being struck / when you block set and mowing down everything in one go.
---
not everyone has it or there wouldn't be people posting about it......
---
I recognized it right away, awesome job!
---
A cheesy opener doesn't really make that much difference, but of course it can help. Yes a rogue can win.  
---
It will come down to exact spec, racials, nades, reflectors, resists, poison procs, crits etc... It is mage favoured but a rogue can definitely win if they play well.
---
In vanilla it started that way because blessing only lasted 5min, you spent a considerable amount of time just rebuffing, but launching with 1.12 build you have greater blessings so you will spend about as much time and far less buffing as a priest or druid has to.  Far less globals on blessing then a shaman has to on totem, and practically never needing to buff doing raid fights.  
---
So they are 100% main healers in raids, and should numerically be competitive with priests early on, and as you get more and more +healing you should surpass priests because of the insane efficiency of flash of light.  Priests are forced to downrank slower heal/gheal and flash of light typically and annoyingly undercuts priests heals other then in very high damage situations.
---
Wasnt totem twisting not a thing in vanilla, but only became viable in TBC?
---
How many Chinese players at the the time of release?
---
Do you remember the Chinese gold farmers from back in the day?
---
Wow was extremely popular with Chinese gamers.
---
Not seeing it .... unless you have one of those "internal radars" where you can identify anyone who belongs to your group of people?
---
Is there a blacksmith equivalent to the Bloodvine set. Bloodvine was a cloth set that was actually BiS for mage / lock through BWL, however you needed a 300 tailoring to wear it. Just curious if there were plate pieces you needed 300 blacksmithing to wear, and if so were they ever BiS?
---
yes
---
nah wasn't wondering.  Almost forgot about the thread until I saw a notification on my phone for a reply lol.  That seems like a weird reasoning thou, I just figured it's reddit, some threads are hit or miss.  I've seen really good post never get the light of day then I've seen really stupid ones get a crazy amount of upvotes.  I don't let it bother me if I don't get upvotes thou.  Can't let small things like this bother ya IMO
---
I think it’s this. I used it in BC but haven’t played in 8 years
---
It will not.  You have tons of utility.  You can kite, freeze, de-enrage.  If you're an engineer, you can feign death and use your jumper cables to potentially save time on wipes.  Your pet can briefly tank if the tank goes down.
---
Hunters are not worthless at all.
---
As a swede, that's all I got as well.
---
why 0/14 ?  I think 14/0/37  (or a variant, maybe 9/5/37)  would be better
---
Just play resto or go to retail
---
For many, its the rpg class fantasy aspect. It's sort of a trope in fantasy to have the heavily armored paladin wielding a large weapon and smiting evildoers, and some find it fun to play that character in the game.
---
You do realise they have their internal test team and an alpha right? Those the ones that get the continuous fixes and test that out until it works. The beta is not prioritised for that at all. Get real
---
Awesome work! Can’t wait to give it a try.
---
Where can I get this for other classes? This is AMAZING work
---
I am 100% going NE warrior so I can meld then the kids needs tending
---
Esfand raided with my guild which was top 4-5 on alliance Hight's Lope. He always beat the tanks, but not the hunters (who were below everyone else)- even in Naxx.
---
DPS warriors have trouble farming? Since when?
---
The Boomer knocking on the window with vanilla in the hands made my day.
---
It looks to me like he had a stroke.
---
Polls show otherwise, interest in a pure rp server is less than rp-pvp.  All the WoW RPers I know have either no interest, or only plan to peek at Classic to remind themselves why they don't want to play.
---
Lol ok buddy
---
So your saying that private server vets are going to be playing classic wow? Is that why your here? Cause you don’t want classic wow but everyone else is moving to it?
---
Rank up for PvP gear. Spell damage gear is reserved for mages and warlocks.
---
Depends if you are dedicated or not. I raided in the Original as a Horde Orc huntard at 60. I chose engineering and used to farm everlook where the demons are for thorium to make bullets every 2 days and repairbots. Had a Alt to make my Potions. Cooked stacks of buff food. And farmed many other reagents to stack buffs every raid. But as far as damage I had no problems at all putting up numbers similar to mages and locks every week. We took 5 of each class in every raid we did and by the end of WoW classic my guild had 3 wings in Naxx cleared, AQ 40, BWL,Ony and MC. I had a few Alliance reroll and join our guild and couldn't understand how we got the damage compared to Alliance. I have a hard time believing that faction would play a huge role like that. I don't understand where most people are getting there Numbers. Private servers I suppose. Cause if any of you had half a brain youd understand most of the streamers and people blabbing how they raided 15 years ago were squeekers. And Ive noticed a few things in every stream they make thats full of shit. I dont believe lies I beleive numbers. Like the ones I crunched for over 2 years on a weekly basis respecing continuously to squeeze every bit of every ounce of damage on a week in and out basis. I raided 3-4 40 mans during the week from 6pm to 11or12 pm sometimes longer. I did 20 mans on saturdays. Im not blind or have a mental condition I know what a level 60 hunter is capable of. I still have the stats for my hunter with full tier 2 pushing ZG enchants and agility on gloves,boots,cloak, stats on chest, sandreaver barb with greater agility, Ashjre'thul crossbow 2% hit scope, cloak of shrouded mists, drakefang talisman,Band of Accuria, Signant of bronze dragonflight, prestors talisman neck, and badge of swarmguard. With totem, not enhanced totem, hunters mark, not imp hunters mark, my two set bonuses, mongoose pot, motw, winter squid, and scorpoc powder I could buff to 2478 RAP 30% crit not counting base crit before gear, and 14% hit, not counting base before gear. I spec lightning reflexes, scattershot build. For the 15% increased agility off my base. I had no problems hitting 3k aimed shots and 800-1200 autoshots without crits. 2k multies.And this is all with Mid raid gear and intro AQ. As long as you didn't break your rotation especially during long fights youd out damage alotta ranged classes. Big key factor your the only class that can dump agro every min.Threat is never an issue so balls to the wall. Another thing run dps meters that combine pet damage with yours. Your weakness is fights that involve alot of moving. Cant autoshot while moving and thats the bulk of your damage. I dont have a firm grasp on blessings but is it you cant have but one on you at a time. If thats the case screw salvation grab your Kings buff eventhough most guilds I hear dislike Ret-tards. Any fight that is threat sensitive or last for long periods of time or involves being at a long range to escape damage hunters are perfect for. I'll compare our damage like this. We are like two rogue builds for raiding dagger spec and sword spec. If the target is still the dagger rogue destroys the sword rogue. If it moves alot the sword rogue destroys the dagger rogue on damage. We are more like the dagger rogues its all about positioning and not moving a whole lot. I would advise using Jumper cables and Jumper cables XL they are both on seperate cooldowns. I cant tell you how many times Ive feined death equipped it, waited for cooldown again and feined death near a dead druid and used cables to res in combat and saved whole raids. So Im being honest with you about a game I started playing at 28 years old and loved dearly. Anyone and I mean anyone that tells you Ohh hunters arent any good late game never seen or never knew any good hunters or dare I say your guild and raid sucked ass. If you learn your class and know your strengths and limits after so many wipes and raids you will see. I could say dps warriors suck on Baron gheddon, shazzrah, Ragnaros, and firemaw. Does that mean we dont take but one maybe two? I can say multitude of things but the point is every encounter has winners and losers. And ever who makes up the shit on hunters are more than likely truth be told  either people that have no brains or warriors and rogues because of thier encounters with that one hunter that took something they werent clearly justified for in the warriors or rogues mindset. And hey Im not denying you werent shafted they are idiots in the world of retardcraft. I know its a pain but be sensible and explain that anything with strength or meelee wise is my priority if not leave. CYA. Another reason is they hate having to roll with 2 different classes much less 3. Exclude one physical damage class that shares crit necks rings and trinkets warriors get to roll on a dps set quicker for there after tanking the raids activity. Ive played  with tons of good warriors and rogues and beleive me if I wasnt doing my job and throwing up numbers on a weekly basis there is no way theyd agree to let me roll for a Drakefang talisman or a quickstrike ring. My Two Cents.

Majority of the player-base will look at fishing as boring/tedious so they rather buy whatever they want from the AH, that's why fishing is a viable way to make gold.  Not to mention that all classes need food buffs and consumables are in constant demand. For example Squid for agility, Stone-scale Eels for tanking. You'll be able to level your cooking easily too.

Commenting to save this, thanks

Updates:
---
- Fixed bug where class specific items were displayed for all classes in BiS search.
---
- Added new labels per /u/Lanessar
---
This is perfection.
---
Maybe you're too retarded to see it? idk.
---
Decent? Not really. Best out of his 3 specs? Definitely. Most of the naxx guilds bring a single dudu cuz they have no use. Early raids they are a bit better but their scaling is also shit  so later parts they are literally walking innervates.
---
Mainly for improved succubus, was on the fence if it was worth sacrificing instant corruption casts though
---
why would you publish every fix on a obsolete software when the next planed update/release is already planed (beta update or release whatever they decide)
---
i am no blizzfanboy, i just happen to work in software quality and release management for a big hard/software company and cant take the bullshit people spread around here anymore.
---
you got daily/weekly iterations for internal testing and only release something to the public if you reach some milestones or push out a hotfix if shit hits the fan
---
can someone please type out that big chunk of text so I can make a copypasta out of it
---
“If you can chill it, I can kill it” - faxmonkey

pirated servers brought you wow classic, dipshit
---
Ench shaman has mana to twist windfury and tranq totem by himself for 4 fury warriors. If threat limits the dps, he is bringing more dps than adding 5th warrior to that group.
---
amazing
---
Is this possible while raiding once a week?
---
Thanks for the response
---
Oh also real noob question, is there a place where I can view BiS pvp? I only see raiding lists
---
How would you rate salt and sanctuary?
---
Off the top of my head: SM/ruin warlock (corruption giving instant shadowbolt), 30/21/0 rogue (due to crit combo generators give an extra point), feral druid (same as above rogue in cat form), and any clear casting fishing (although probably the most boring proc imo)
---
They have a better chance maybe. RP-PVP fails to do either well and it pushes players out more than it draws them in. Reddit isn’t a reliable sample for the general playerbase
---
Its almost as if different people like different things, astonishing! ^/^s
---
However, they bring a lot on the side of applying it. Melee hunters and hamstring spammer warriors don't do much else, while shaman can combine it with totem twisting.
---
I see you're thinking of going warlock. They don't have hit so most of the time you resist, and if you hit and crit you get threat and die. If you hit and don't crit u just do less dmg than mage anyways and d buff slots will be filled with deep wounds from our 14 fury warrior so don't even play warlock at all.
---
Private servers are very bugged as well, just harder to tell because you get accustomed to something so fast.
---
While I agree that hunters are in a sad state atm I can't look away from the fact the pservers are far from perfect. Especially dungeon-events are the worst on pservers, they are scripted horribly. I'm mostly looking forward to play the dungeons the way they were originally designed.
---
&gt; Why do you get to choose for someone else what is optimal?
---
Everyone does this. When a hunter takes a melee weapon over a warrior for whom it is bigger upgrade then you will also have people speaking up.
---
I don't agree that what you say is the norm, but we can only see how it will manifest. I will be an advocate for my style.
---
&gt; That's literally what the need option/roll is there for.
---
This is only your opinions not a fact. It is no more valid than if I would say that my system is implicitly right.
---
&gt; because you apparently have decided that no one actually deserves upgrades and that boes should always go to the AH...
---
I never said this.
---
As long as the people playing on mobile get marked so I can avoid grouping with the
---
You help people to the grave now! =D
---
No server fails to do anything well its down to the community on it. If you community is gimped from the start then its gonna be gimped.
---
I however, constantly hear good things about emerald dream.
---
No, I am not retarded.
---
well you could join a guild whos main goal is PvP
---
they may be more inclined to give you ele gear
---
There seems to be a 3-tag limit, not sure if you want to increase that or not. 
---
Also, some formatting on the "description" field might be nice. Right now, I can't do paragraphs, etc.
---
I'm trying to point out some of the interesting meta via spell and talent fields on the build I uploaded, but I cannot arrange the order easily (which is a little important for continuity).
---
Pandaren roleplayers aren’t all that common, from what I’ve observed. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of roleplayers prefer humans or elves. The few Pandaren roleplayers I have seen on Retail have either stick to the wise monk shtick or gone for some sort of triad-esque criminal.
---
I was a really good mage, and a good enough priest. Priests (healers) are IMHO the hands down funest class for someone that enjoys having to think on their feet.
---
Most dps classes end up with having a best rotation of spells/abilities with the most complicated parts being juggling a few cooldowns and not hopping on untill the warrior has enough sunders down. Most fights are lock on and burn it down.
---
Being a healer means not only managing your own resources, but 4 other people's as well. Can I keep the rogue up, who body pulled an add, without getting threat? Is the rogues vanish on CD? Will the warrior pull the add before the rogue goes down? Is the warriors warstomp off CD or did he just use it in the last aoe pack? If the rogue drops, will we have the dps to take down the boss? Is the hunter that I'm 3/4s through with a greater heal going to FD and give me agro? 
---
For a mage: frost bolt, frost bolt, fireblast, frost bolt, frost nova, cone of cold, turn and blink, fireblast, frost bolt... Repeat till oom then evoke, potion, or drink. That's 90%+ of fights, solo, raid, or in an instance. You may get lucky enough to have to sheep something from time to time, or frost kite a mob back and forth with another frost mage.
---
As a priest, any time I was actually needed to heal, shit got real in a huge hurry.
---
Even during late wotlk I had a lot of groups use greed normally and only need when it was an upgrade. Some people even passed entirely on items so it definitely depended on server etiquette.

As if that's necessary for "survival".  This guy is clearly working with a budget. Give him a break. A second monitor is an expensive convenience, not a necessity. There's nothing "efficient" about it. You play the game on one screen.

Do you want to play a game where 80% of player pool is same class? Might as well kick all rogues from the groups too since they lose to warriors in dps.
---
*Sensible chuckle*
---
Fastest route to get to the actual bank, but you still need to run to XR and fly to Org for the AH. Also fast to get to a mailbox quick, but you can as well go to Razor Hill for that.
---
Ah.  I did a bit of that but quit because they had finally removed the talent system and felt like there weren't specs anymore to me.
---
\&gt;  Whenever I hear about the raiding scene it feels like there is no room if you don't play few specific classes/specs.   
---
I'll address this because it seems people want to be naive about it. I first started  wow when i was 13.  I was max level by 14 and trying to push end-game ranks with friends. It was hard to get in a group often, as you will hear echo'd in this sub. Though, a lot of people will ignore the only conclusion is that people are stingy statwhores- but neglect that the majority demographic was teenagers and i was basically in middle school- so yeah maybe i understand why people don't like little kids on the mic.   
---
Additionally,  WoW vanilla wasn't a casual gamer game. It was for sweats before that was even a term-dedication. These aren't the people who just fuck around in WoW for twitch viewers. So the environment was often competitive, which comes with industry standards. To that- this go round will not be that same atmosphere. You're reaching a far far greater casual playerbase- streamers-content creators that will not give a shit about if you're the best shaman on your server or the 5th best or the 30th best.  Are you geared enough to not make us wipe? Let's go. There will still be Realms that have the main comp Guilds, but i would strongly believe there will be far older demographic.   
---
I know i as a 25M, with twenty or so other 20M-30M will be pushing pvp ranks and raid. We-as a lot of people are- in it for the nostalgia. As long as we can do it and you can be on a mic-it's chill, like c'mon man its WoW Classic. Feel free to dm if wanna join
---
Tell that to my new Monitor, sound setup and new desk i built for my PC just because i wanted to be prepared for classic wow.
---
MoP was a flawed gem though, suffered from the mistakes of WotLK and Cata, even though it had such beautiful lore, world, aesthethics, and the raids were challenging. I still do not agree with pandas being able to pick both factions though.
---
Find a guild that raids but also forms premades
---
Playing this game the last 5-6 years can’t get enough. Every class and spec is viable somehow, you just have to different efforts for everything.
---
They are flag defense. They can moonfire and kite, and entangle melee.
---
Let’s not forget Crendor and his quality WoW Classic non-content.
---
SFK is not the first dungeon Horde encounter. They will typically encounter RFC and WC first.
---
Depends on how much time you spend raiding I guess. I'm not aware of any BiS PvP lists but since you don't have different pieces to choose from it's kinda irrelevant.
---
Get all the pvp gear you can and fill in the blanks with dungeon gear and/or crafted pieces.
---
Ah - I see. I misunderstood, IF is super convenient for that. I just always go for human for the 1st bank alt since it's so close.
---
Its not a bug, at all. Blizzard decided that anyone with the first stress test installed would see the beta so they can easily remove it from their computer. There is no bug about it.
---
I think it's a good call, especially for when dire maul comes out. My plan is to duo a priest with my friends warrior and level a hunter for gold making when he's not online.
---
Yes but you want improved windfury and now your warriors can do more dmg or threat for offtank by using a real weapon so enh frees that warrior up.
---
But i don't know if its enough nightfall uptime.
---
Subjective. I though the leveling experience was worse than anything that came before it.
---
hit 60
---
wait for tbc
---
This is really cool. Is there going to be a related addon where I can upload my custom route?
---
Just kill them when they are half your level like most rogues.
---
Those boots of the five thunders holy fuck, they're perfect. Would strength help an enhance sham?
---
I'm so excited for Hunter, I tolerated the change from Mana to focus, and the removal of eyes of the beast, I tolerated them dumbing down pets and removing happiness and the ability for pets to run away if you neglected them, I was okay with not having a quiver, but once legion hit the class didn't even feel like a hunter class anymore.
---
For solo, I prefer mages. They have 95% of the soloability of hunters, comparable cc, but are overall much faster and cheaper. Mages get free food and water, don't buy arrows or bullets, don't have pets to feed, can evoke, which skips every 2-3 eat/drink sessions, and can teleport to all major cities.
---
Yes, it's common for guild members to be able to pick up offspec items, just not until every class that uses it for their main PVE spec has them.
---
Are you sure?
---
It's a shame people scribbled all over it
---
Are you outa your mind. All you will be is a huge distraction. You cant kill anyone and they cant kill you easily. From my experience most people in Battlegrounds will just run away from you cause you arent worth pecking all day to kill you. You can be a huge pain in the ass especially if your maintank raid geared.
---
“Man this huntard sucks balls lolz I see his corpse everywhere”
---
Goblins are money allied.
---
If nobody needs it as a class specific item then off-specs can use their dkp / get selected by the loot council.
---
Yeah the tags are limited for formatting it on the home page cards. I might raise this in the future.

I'll add paragraph support to the description now.
---
&gt; I'm trying to point out some of the interesting meta via spell and talent fields on the build I uploaded, but I cannot arrange the order easily (which is a little important for continuity).
---
Are you wanting to reorder the explanations at the bottom of a talent/item build (if so, I can add that)? 
---
Can you give examples of incorrect itemization, I'd like to fix that.

Dude, no breaks. Sorry. Its an absolute necessity and if you dont have it why even bother having a PC?

The starter shirt for female troll shaman. It's called Primitive Mantle and it gives you arm tattoos. Since we'll all be poor at launch, I plan to offer up a portrait or chibi doodle of their character in the time it takes them to roll the toon and get to Booty Bay.

Well mop was a good expansion, so that sucks for you I guess

That's not why. Mine is a TN panel and looks amazing. Not as good as an IPS but close after calibration. I'm 96 on color accuracy so an extra 2 or 3 percent from an IPS isn't worth the cost for me.
---
Most folks don't properly calibrate their TN panels and try to over compensate with high contrast ratios, up the saturation to make colors pop, up the brightness to make brights brighter, etc. This is where a proper calibration and OS level ICC profile come in handy. Look them up for your monitor and apply them.
---
A HUGE help for your eyes is also a backlight. Generally I use a neutral color RGB strip behind the desk and turn off my overheads and turn on a nice warm RGB for the room. Backlights help not only add more noise to the room so your eyes aren't being hit so hard from the monitor, but they also help darken the darks on your screen - not magic. Look at an all black image on your screen, it should look like charcoal and not black. Now add a white grid to the image and the black gets blacker - this is your eyes closing the Iris to let LESS light in thanks to the bright white which makes the black look darker.
---
There's more to getting a good image from your monitor that is easy on the eyes than just monitor settings - when you calibrate, be sure to calibrate in the light you will be using in the room the most. If you like the room dim - always use the computer like that and calibrate it like that. This is easier said than done unless you have a dedicated computer room or game room.
---
Hope this all helps.
---
yes which is a community problem - this issue i've found with a chunk of my fellow roleplayers is generally they give up at some-point but thats more because there isn't support and thats all down to the server community.
---
RP-PvP brings roleplay in conjunction to the world effects of a PvP server.
---
It's ok, classic is not for everyone. If leveling to "30s" wants you to roll an alt... that doesn't sound too good for your Classic leveling future.
---
on same skill level and same consumables no

Ret paladin pulling more dps than a hunter? I know hunters fall off hard but they can still do more than a ret paladin
---
Yes I am sure. [Reading Comprehension Problems: Signs of a Disability](https://www.verywellfamily.com/learning-disability-in-reading-comprehension-2162449) Consider it.
---
I do prefer not being the epic hero of the world in forced down your throat story that's linear.  I mean we're both in the classic subreddit no?
---
But i did think you meant  the starting zone included.  I didn't enjoy talent change, pandas existing, nor the monk class so I didn't resub nor play to 90.  I prob got to 87.
---
This is what I recall as well. But it seems even NA is not on the same page there.
---
That is also a option but it's mostly something that tanks with reflector shield do from my experience. Warriors can join too and do amazing cleave dps too though. 2 warriors 1 rogue 1 shaman and whatever last is crazy cast clears.
---
Just play Tauren Warrior like the rest of us.

You can change camera distance, fov and even raise the "camera port" higher above your character. It's all done through script commands or addons.

The actual main series doesn't get nearly as much love as HoMM and it's a crying shame, they were among the best western RPGs of their time.

So because you don't like classic raiding somehow the extended beta was a bad idea? Can you elaborate on that a bit.
---
If you care about spelling mistakes, don't buy it. It has TONS of them and [I've kind of made my own version](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwlity/someone_posted_this_map_here_a_while_ago_and_ive/epye2d8/) of the map which doesn't include any if you're interested.
---
I'm not saying kill gahz. Clearing through the pool area would be the most mobs on 12 min. Then reset.
---
Can break roots/slows 4 times, trinket poly, gap close 4 times, not to mention bombs, nets, rocket helm or boots and free action potions.  I'm sure the "possibility" is there.
---
This literally happened in Vanilla all the time, what are you talking about? Back then it was done through support tickets and entire guilds were transferred and it was free. This time they have tech to do it automatically so they won't be doing it for free because they wouldn't have the staff to implement that.
---
Enhancement is a blast to play, and they're fun to have in groups too. Nobody gives a shit what you think is 'best.'

Don't just play at launch and join at phase 2, problem solved.
---
The single greatest thing about MoP was that it forced all the whiny manchildren that didn't want "HURR DURR KUNG FU PANDA AMIRITE" to leave the game.
---
Well that, and the art, raids, and class design were all fucking mint.  And the story was good enough that Blizzard shamelessly ripped itself off to tell it again.
---
Keep in mind that there are different phases once a new raid is introduced. For fresh raids, your guild will most likely not offer you much in the way of offspec gear. When people begin to gear up you may get lucky with a few items that have been obtained by those in need, and near the end of progression for a raid when the majority of members have been geared out you will get all the offspec gear your heart desires. 
---
Sidenote, you will do just fine using your healing gear in PvP. Not optimal obviously but the additional spirit will give you a bit more longevity
---
Yup. Brewmaster was one of my favorite heroes to play in WC3, splitting in 3 was overpowered as hell.
---
Yeah its absolutely possible but itll be tough for everyone
---
But it doesn't make sense to "flag as needed" if you want a real and true RP realm where Horde and Alliance are in conflict.
---
And it doesn't make sense from a gameplay point of view if you want the threat of playing on PvP server.

But I understand you, and that's how we will play on RP if RP-PvP isn't released with the game.
---
Hit me up if a link gets posted, I’m at work and discord +many other sites are blocked so I can’t search it here.
---
This was on the beta. And our group didnt have good gear as we hadnt farmed "bis" at 30.
---
I'm speaking for raid content, yeah enhance is fun but it's a poor raiding spec
---
I have not gotten beta access so I can't start working on an addon. Using an addon like questie to show you specifically where an objective/quest is and tabbing out every now and then to check where you should be going next works quite well since you have quick access to databases and can plan things out in advance with the browsing feature.
---
Hey man. In the big community Discords are plenty of guilds already looking for players. One is calles "Classic WoW" with a Ragnaros icon.
---
so what about classic is going to fix the role-play community issues? if a pvp guild decides they want to stop any and all RP they see, why would role-players want to go there and have their events ruined?
---
I raided with three trolls and a tauren. I was the orc hunter. I never seen much differences in raid dps nothing that  set us apart you could notice. But in pvp Id obliterate any other race of hunter. Id always frost trap wingclip, bloodfury, and beatem down. After a hunter scatter traps thats it. Most time just trinket trap and get on em. They cant get away enough with imp wingclip and frost trap down. And beleive me an Orc hunters meelee stands out above the rest because of racial. After all the warriors got the big twohanders in a raid my guild would let us havem for half the dkp just like rogues and warriors for ranged weapons. I had a big Drake Talon cleaver I used on only hunters. Had it enchanted with crusader as well.
---
Is there one of these for prot warrs?
---
I remember reading an interview where they said warlock was their "signature" class and it was between warlock and I want to say death knight (or maybe demon hunter?) And they went with warlock and thats why it got so many unique things because all of the other classes were sort of standard DND fantasy tropes whereas Warlock was the "world of warcraft" class
---
Would be awesome if the names of players were writen on the shard.
---
your comment made my smile merci
---
Yeah, my argument still stands.
---
It’s funny the disparity between larger subs with more moderation and small ones. You can tell by how many low effort bots have access.
---
Private servers has its own problems, but nowhere as bad as these Hunter bugs.
---
Awesome, thanks for the help!
---
In terms of these 3 Rogue prob  fits best. Both  PvE and  PvP viable. Not too hard to level (but slow) and provide some utility
---
Improved sprint/vanish x2 each with preparation. Giant ambush crit to open. Slowing poison on both daggers. Improved kick ready to go. Can't mages blink out of a stun anyway? I'd definitely open with ambush over cheap shot and bring them to low HP.
---
Which is why they should never trust the Alliance.
---
You may have a lion on your sigil, but you guys don't pay your debts.
---
I think you underestimate the hate for that shit from true classic fans 
---
It would make more sense to convert classic players to retail with the upcoming level squish and game overhaul then to invite a mass exodus.
---
Piggybacking on this, would the same be viable for Eng, or is that more valuable along the way. I did Enchanting back in the day and I’m considering Eng this time around.
---
Would you prefer to form out and run away or bubble hearth when you lose a fight?
---
With a well sorted raid, you can get away with literally 20 pugs and it doesn't matter what class or spec they are. I mained enhancement 1-85 and I wouldn't even say I was 'good' at playing the class, but I could out dps a shit rogue or hunter any day, and never had trouble getting groups. There's room in this game and in raiding for all classes and specs. Even the 'bad' ones. I'd take a meme spec over resto you with a bad attitude and superiority complex any day.
---
The keys require BS skill to use so you won't be selling those.
---
*criesinspanish*
---
You can do anything that doesn't make it wise
---
I'm a balance druid and this was pretty funny. Upvoted haha
---
As a person planning on casually playing an orc warrior, my perfect group would be a rogue, a hunter, a mage and priest. Good cc, damage and not /that/ much competition over loot.
---
A computer made in the last decade.
---
Not , that’s not sarcasm. Someone tested it running on a core2duo at 30fps.
---
Not sure if I'm misinterpreting your tone as patronizing.
---
I say we'll see when Blizzard makes an announcement- so many people are up in arms shilling for what is a bug imo and defending it by saying Blizzard checked the reference client.
---
Just seems bizzare.
---
Errm, whatever floats your boat i guess.
---
I’m with you.  A bunch of nonlinear random quests being picked up at random locations is a lot more immersive as a “citizen” of the game world.
---
I’m not a hero, I just want to live in the world.  No need for a storyline imho.  (Not that having one is inherently bad, it’s just not what immerses me.)
---
ok, so I should only invest 2 points in Suppression then for the 4% resist chance?
---
What a lot of people that are coming back 15 years later are overlooking is that a lot of people are doing the same. Casual guilds of parents and folks who can’t prioritize play over pressing RL shit will exist.
---
I would not take a single crafting profession until 60.
---
Grinding. I always enjoyed it for some reason. If you want some fun play the AH. It‘s fun when you see how it works
---
its the same, leveling at 60 will be a much less painful experience
---
On my hunter I'll be doing the best dungeon solo available in the given phase, I'll also try to break into devilsaur but we'll see how it goes.
---
So even a refurb of some windows 10 computer will be fine?
---
Make a craigslist post and let someone mount me, ez epic mount
---
As a joke, but it became popular enough Blizz doubled down.
---
Troll male in robes.. So I'll /dance on a mailbox in Orgrimmar until people pay me to stop.
---
I think it's a pretty unpopular opinion around these parts, but I prefer to keep my endgame professions and level them as I level. It cuts down on bank space a lot, and a lot of the gear CAN be useful if you keep your BS skill up. The trouble is that many people outlevel their skill to the point where the gear will no longer be useful to them. But I like to take a break from the leveling grind every once in awhile and go hoover up a ton of ore nodes and then go back to town to learn more smithing stuff.  I think it's more satisfying that way. Another advantage is that when recipes drop in dungeons (even early dungeons. I like collecting them all) saying "I'm gonna need, I'm a BS" sounds much better than "Can I need? I plan on eventually being a BS".
---
Just my 2 silver on the subject.
---
Ah oke yeah. I never followed a route like this. But yours seems really fun. However i'm always worried that I out lvl the route and the quest becomes gray and I mess up the route.
---
I leveled a feral Druid on a private server. I had a blast, tanked a lot of end game instanced with a holy priest and FPS warrior. You’ll find your crew, whatever you play. 
---
Your discounting the fact that people want folks who are drama free and up to party, do content and have fun.
---
various pieces of tier2, the ZG set, and some other good things like the AQ20 weapon, the ragnaros shield are really good and super easy to get. You shouldnt have a problem to get good gear at all as a resto
---
Rofl
---
&gt;Imagine playing shaman in PvE raids as a non-healer
---
Why do you say that?
---
Your arguments were pretty decent in your previous posts but in this last one there are a couple adhominems and a strawmen.
---
The point of the other guy is that getting an item to sell it ultimately should be considered as greed and in a perfect world or one with sufficient etiquette you should all roll greed if you intend to sell (even if it is a personal upgrade).
---
You also presume everyone will act in the way you would and auction of the item. I for one often can't be bothered by it and if you need an item you can't or won't equip that I want to equip I'll consider you a ninja.
---
Dont pick herb / mining, go herb/skinning or skinning/mining
---
Great aggregate list, must've taken a lot of work. Mind adding me as well? I only have 250 subs, but my vids typically get around 1.5-2k views already.

Yeah.... every single Hakkar fight I would wait 10 seconds to engage. 
---
Every single fucking time it's a triple crit wf and I see my threat fly into the atmosphere and the boss 2 hits me....
---
This is the reason I never got an epic mount until tbc
---
The ending is accurate.
---
These guys don't realize that with a decent 2h, even if you don't crit.... 30% of their health just vanished
---
Yeah it was a very easy tier but it was the perfect storm for me. I was 15, bad at the game and had never raided before, I can still remember my first time in naxx and first time pugging OS . Atmosphere of those raids we're just epic to me at the time
---
I’ve been playing on some private servers and I will say the vanilla community is toxic as all hell and they don’t take kindly to unconventional specs.
---
Really hope it’s not the case when Classic comes out tho-a shit community can easily ruin a fun game.
---
Sure. Here are the use-cases I ran into:
---
* Choose any wand-using class which isn't mage, set the level to 40, search for ranged and use any spec. You get mage-only quest rewards recommended.
---
* Staff of the Blessed Seer is much higher than it is rated for Holy Priest (26). At +24 healing, it's one of the best +healing items and sits above several of the items above it. Many of the pre-Raid priests farmed it  during 1.10 to get started when they had bad luck with Strat drops.
---
This sort of brings up an interesting point, as Redemption is BIS:
---
&gt; Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort.
---
I'm not sure whether Redemption, which was added in 1.10 IIRC, will be part of that "loot revamp". I suspect it will.
---
But I digress.
---
* You might want to add a "pre-Raid BIS" option as well for filtering. 
---
* You might want to add a column for "Source" if you don't use pre-raid BIS filtering, that way we can see what is craftable, questable, or dungeon-able.
---
I realize that the spec I was gearing out was... really strange (+ spellpower, then +spirit), so I'm not knocking that aspect.
---
Zg after bwl.
---
You can certainly do what you want, but be prepared to be ACCURATELY called a ninja looter, rolling *need* on plate gear, as a clothie, for example. If you're fine with the consequences of being known as someone who does that, getting added to ignored and blacklisted, then sure...do your thing.
---
What is the need roll for then, if you don't use the greed option for things you want but can't use? That makes NO sense.
---
Yeah I totally agree with that one. Would kinda be like a pc player v xbox player in a fps game
---
If any person comes to attempt to ruin stuff then I've always found the best way is to weave them screwing around into RP commentary make them look like absolute moron's through character reactions etc.
---
The guys that show up to ruin things are just attention seekers and they want to cause you to be upset so when you act differently they have a nervous breakdown, it also helps when your really good at PvP but thats another sub factor. The biggest thing that riles them is you keeping on going either weaving them or ignoring them.
---
It's a different breed of roleplay that generally appears with RP-PvP or rather the ones that are more actively seen are that particular breed.
---
Its something me and the community I ran in Elite Dangerous did.
---
Yeah that's at like lvl 58, I'm talking about all of leveling.
---
And I wont be able to play at it before the 5th of september!!  Haaaaaaaaaaa
---
Crowded low level zones even with layering will sabotage the gold making via mining/herbalism, racing for nodes will be a chore, especially if you pick both, it will set back your leveling speed significantly. Not to mention that classes with movement speed abilities/buffs will have a significant advantage early on.
---
Pick Skinning from the primary professions and nothing else for the first few weeks. You'll grind beasts and you can vendor the skins so it'll easily contribute towards your mount. You'll use the extra time on grinding mobs and on your secondary professions.
---
Along with Skinning, focus on secondary professions. Fishing is amazing and compliments cooking, good gold maker, even in low level zones, since fish like Oily Blackmouth is highly sought after.
---
Once you have your level 40 mount, go back to low level zones and level your gathering profession up be it Herbalism or Mining.  
---
When you reach level 60, change your Skinning to Engineering unless you are assigned a profession by your Guild leader and you have priority over recipes / resources. Herbalism/Engineering or Mining/Engineering is a good combo at level 60. It can compliment some gold runs in Dungeons too.
---
At level 60 there are other more reliable money making methods in instanced areas for example, so you don't rely on professions that much.
---
I'm going Herbalism since I'll intend to raid a lot, supplying an alchemist can save you a noticeable amount of gold. Engineering the second one since I intend to PvP and there are scenarios where AoE damage from Engineering comes in handy in raids.
---
Pretty much this. Skinning &gt; Vendor, Fishing &gt; AH, get your mount and go back and level Mining/Herbalism up from 0.
---
Man, usually hate these meme videos, but all the ones with boomers in it are just gold. Love it!
---
The road to 60 is hard for a warrior, but you will be cherished when you get there.  Warrior is the only class in the game where all three specs are viable for raiding.  Furthermore, defense is not only viable it’s the ONLY raiding tanking spec that gives crush immunity, and thus it’s practically the only ranking spec for raids.
---
Warriors have the hardest road, but also have the greatest rewards at the end.
---
Playing the AH is always fun and makes me feel like a smart boy. But nothing beats fishing for me. Is it the fastest gold per hour? No. Is it the most engaging gold farming method? Hell no.
---
But there is something satisfying about looking at my bag full of expensive fish. I'm not sure what it is, but its super satisfying to me.
---
Yeah. I'm just focusing on the thing that seemed to make it literally not possible rather than practically not possible lol.
---
Oh God, I'm so sorry
---
They're not the same bugs, jfc. This is a port to the new client. New bugs to fix. Do you know how coding and software creation works at all? Fix one bug and you make ten more.
---
Fun fact in the barrens there is an item you can find, which starts a quest. The item is called “Chen’s Keg” and you turn it it in in ratchet to a brewmaster. This is a reference to Chen Stormstout who came to aid to Thrall and Baine and must have lost it on his way back to Pandaria. This all happened before vanilla.
---
Yeah for sure for sure.
---
I was thinking a resto with tranq and an enhancement twisting grace and WF.
---
I am all for that shaman love :)

First things first Arcanite rules the economy. Far as price its in the hands of the person who has the most up for auction. I knew a fellow who put himself through college selling gold. And he did it through Arcanite control. I never knew it til one day he kept trading me and putting 2000 gold in my trade and closing it before I could click. I was farming for my epic mount and he was teasing me. Talking about all his arcanite sells are gonna make him bank for the week. So I went to my bank and flooded the market with over a 1000 crystals and messed his buisiness up for the month. He didnt know I was a mad farmer and I didnt know he was doing what he did. I never sold all mine because I help 3-4 different people get sulfuras and thunderfury. Takes 100 crystals in total a peice. I used mine for favors. But do the math how much arcanite is in highend weapons and armor. Mooncloth just doesnt last for price after 8 months. If you go by how many needed to make stuff. Invest in Black Lotus, Dream foil,enchanting mats and arcane crystals thatll always sell and be the money makers.
---
oh right i forgot about how everyones getting fucked economically
---
Thanks man! Yeah wasn't to bad. I was in the mood for it. Fun channel, hope the list can give you some exposure!
---
In the beginning, I’m thinking of mostly fishing and cranking out fire protection pots.
---
You should add  https://www.warcrafttavern.com. They have a ton of guides.
---
The female panda model was probably blizzards greatest tragedy ever committed
---
Jeez man you don't have to go off on OP. At least in my experience when I see next level farming strats it's solo Mara runs or DME/DMT runs by hunters and mages.

Saying 'bruh' is basically a '/s'

Kevin Jordan confirmed this after he left lol. He said something like no one in Korea played Horde, so they added a 'beautific' race for them.
---
The Blood Elves going horde makes a bit of sense because of Garithos from WCIII though.
---
This is my exact plan.
---

---
Damn son. This is a pretty old one right? New site looks good
---
The other faction can't see your reactions and if they can understand you through some gaming the system you can be banned. If you can out pvp them that solves the issue, but you can't out-pvp numbers
---
If you want to do something that is fairly straight forward in generating money you could grind beasts, skin them, vender the skins.  It’s monotonous, but it works.  You just have to put in the time.
---
"dark" type of mage seems pretty standard to me
---
just want to say you are beautiful
---
I feel that
---
I alternate between watching class videos and refreshing new lol
---
That's very cute but this guide implies a serious player, who will farm hard to get gear hoping for a raid spot in what I assume is a somewhat serious guild. to autoattack and drop two totems. it helps to be aware that he will not get that spot and if he does, he will be continuously pissing off the majority of the other 39 players every time they wipe on progression.
---
Goblins were like this in WC II and III though, so it wasn't WoW that did that too them... also Goblin and Gnomish Engineering are both like this in classic.
---
with out sepcs I can say for sure
---
but probably 
---
its pretty easy to run
---
Thank you for your time! Very helpful response. I still hope that blizzard comes up with a solution for the layering issue. 
---
Maybe an account bound communication with mats information. So you can’t just switch layer to gather the same veins.
---
Until you obtain spell hit gear, yes.
---
I don't mind Pandas or any of the other races that came with expansions. Actually I think they added flavor. It was the changes in game systems that ruined WoW for me. (Flying Mounts, LFD, etc)
---
That's the only chest upgrade paladins have between pre-BiS and T3.  I would suck it up for 1 tier of content and wear the dress, but you might not even get it so sticking with red dragonscale breastplate until naxx isn't that weird.
---
Thank you very much
---
Forced timegating is never fun, but if the timegating is put behind something of player agency. Eg repeatable quest turnins etc, at least it feels like there is a level of control and never is anything lost by NOT participating.
---
"let the downvoting commence" only logical part of your whole post
---
I mean sure, the hitcap needed to be figured out. It was until late MC and early BWL that things were figured out. To everyone the 9% hitcap was known. However, the 6% hitcap for when you have +5 bows/guns not so much. Im still not sure if this is even true.
---
this is such a good photo. love it. i can almost feel it.
---
Yeah I took a look at his Channel. Now for a second time. I'm not sure as he makes allot of other content and I don't know if Classic is going to be like the main thing for his community.
---
NA isn’t a country lmao

WoW jokes like this make me laugh way harder than they should.
---
You do realise that I also talk in regards to your own faction.
---
Now if you can't protect your turf you shouldn't expect others to change their gameplay for you. If your in a PvP environment you need to expect fluid events or conflicts and the changing terrain/environment that comes with it.
---
As a roleplayer you need to accept being in a PvP environment brings other opportunities for fluidity that PvE doesn't it isn't for everyone however.
---
Are you getting paid to advertise that site? This is not the first time I've seen you post this.

I’m sure it’s possible but it’ll involve 10 hours of kiting
---
This. I can't believe how long wojak and pepe have lasted. Very disappointing to see the same jokes repeated over and over.
---
Warlocks were super fun and had a very strong class identity back then.
---
Mages excelled at all aspects of the game though.
---
I don't think you can go wrong with either.
---
Nah, it's just the only one most people remember from Vanilla days, so it became a meme.
---
There are probably much better places now.
---
if you want to raid anyway
---
Imp searing pain and destruction range talent are both quite important. I'd give the soul fire stun a miss, if you land a soulfire on someone you shouldn't lose regardless.
---
I don't see the point of imp succubus at all, I don't think the longer seduce even works on players, and the length is enough to get it done anyway.
---
Fel Dom without master summoner seems bad since you still won't have the .5s cast. Fel intellect doesn't seem great either.
---
I think you'd be much better served with NF/conflag.

You can already get GMs for same-faction RP griefers, thats not an issue. I'm just saying, not everyone will be able to hold their own turf and will eventually come down to do I like to RP more or do I like to PVP more and will leave to either a place they can RP better or a place they can PVP better
---
Raids only take boomkins and ele shamans with the occasional shadow priest.
---
Wait what is true about this and what is not? Honestly curious.
---
You're right. Out of all the new races, Dranei, Pandaren, Goblin, Worgen, Blood Elf, (am I missing one?)...if we are going to stay true to lore imo Goblins should be on Horde and Belf/Helf should be Alliance. 
---
.I feel the same about seeing Pandaren in WoW as if they were in LOTR tbh
---
Yes it's not necessary at all.
---
Not much. A service would be getting it ready when they order it. I did it when I felt like it and advertised when I had a full set for sale.
---
Starting day 1, moment of launch, i'll be running 9 level 1 alts from a second account to 9 rare recipe vendors.
---
Know that recipe that is 1G at the vendor, but sells for 20 on the AH, and you buy it, cause 'every goddamn time I go to the vendor, it's not there, so fuck it, 20G is fine"
---
I'll be buying one of those (on 9 toons) every hour for the first week of launch with no competition cause nobody's in Winterspring, etc yet.
---
Damn, those WoW 2 graphics are incredible.

Nah.

If they released low poly pandas to match the other models id be all over that shit.
---
Then you ask for help thats the point - people interact together.
---
RP-PvP isn't for everyone and not everywhere is your safe space. RP-PvP is about balancing controlled roleplay alongside fluid/reactive roleplay.
---
Not everyone can stand that or is able to do that but RP-PvP is also the best opportunity for players to dabble and try out RP. It's a mesh of both experienced and less experienced roleplayers that have to be more open to other interaction as they have pvp always open to them.
---
It's literally a quirk of the server type. The issue is people seem to forget this and then use the fact pvp is on the server as a way to target it. A server is down to the community on it end of.
---
I have predetermined leveling path set out with many many different areas set out to stop and farm mobs while also farming both of my gathering professions. Hope to make enough in the few weeks to purchase items I know will exponentially increase in value when the market stabilizes. Should have my mount shortly after hitting 60 :D
---
Hiding the mailbox with your Kodo until you’ve received 100g total. Repeat every couple hours.
---
It isn't necessarily about getting pre-raid bis by 60. It's more the fact that if you are gonna be running those dungeons for pre-bis anyway you might as well get experience for it as well.
---
good luck at high level with 30/40+ abilities
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
- fixed the mage items showing up for non-mage classes.
---
&gt; Staff of the Blessed Seer is much higher than it is rated for Holy Priest (26). At +24 healing, it's one of the best +healing items and sits above several of the items above it. Many of the pre-Raid priests farmed it during 1.10 to get started when they had bad luck with Strat drops.
---
- So you think the healing power is being undervalued for priests?
---
- I also noticed a bug where spell power was not counting as healing power. Fixing that now.
---
- Working to add a raid / pre-raid dropdown to the bis search.
---
- We only want to show the items at their 1.12 state to mirror how blizzard is implementing them in classic.

New phase? Stockpile the popular raid consume resources and wait for the phase to drop, then resell for \*00% profit margin.  Darkmoon Faire? Better keep track of the gray items and sell for huge profits when the Faire arrives.

---
Yes, you're not tanking 4 Horsemen as a Paladin. You have to accept your limitations. You put on your healing gear for that fight (remember I said you needed a spec that allows you to do both?).
---
My understanding of Paladins is that they're actually very good for threat swap fights with untauntable mobs, assuming they use spellpower and mana regen consumables. You could make that your niche as a Paladin tank. The thing is Druids are also very good for these fights and they don't need consumables. All it comes down to is this: are you going to put in the effort to actually do the job well enough that you're worth using instead of one of the many Warriors or Druids? For most people, the answer is no. It's much easier to just heal.

I took mine into MC on an alts raid night, laughed till my face hurt at the hilarity of wind fury crits and stormstrike crits, then do another corpse run as the trash giants justwtfpwnd you for being such an aggro generating fuck.
---
5 players all need livers from boars are grouped out. you are player #4 and all 5 of you each tagged 5 mobs. The mobs are 4 boars and a buzzard.
---
3 boars died first followed by the buzzard and lastly the last boar. the loot order progression is as follow.
---
Player 1,2,3 and 5 all were able to loot the liver, you got stuck with the buzzard loot.
---
Smart players takes adventage of this in dense area, intentionally pulling mobs outside of quest mob to speed things up for their turn to loot on the quest mob. Or look at it this way, some dumbass wanting XP by pulling other stuff is screwing you over since it keeps falling on your turn to loot and you're not getting those livers.
---
Good for you. It's better to be real with people then do something that will make you unhappy
---
You would make more gold vendoring your skins than selling them on the AH?
---
True, but that should never have happened in the first place. The playerbase got considerably worse on Horde side after that
---
I wonder if Chinese gold farmers will still be a big thing because their economy has grown like 10 times since the original WoW was released. Gold farming probably doesn't pay enough to interest most of them. I feel like we might see more from India or Bangladesh this time around.
---
Killing boars
---
I’m with you. But thats just why it isn’t popular. Theres not enough people who will put up with it. Classic is already starting with limited servers so I can see why they don’t want to take the risk with rp pvpers
---
Sure but for me it should be free for certain kinds of situation. Faction imbalance and such. If they put layering to adjust population, server transfer should be an option as well...
---
Looking at you Soda.
---
The undeath faction disagrees foulheartedly with this statement.
---
Why did Jaina become a white-haired Mary Kate &amp; Ashley impersonator?
---
Pretty classic
---
Skinning and Vendoring leathers early on. Fishing/Cooking and selling it on the AH instead of battling for the nodes in crowded zones. Instanced/dungeon runs for gold at level 60. Pretty much this.
---
Would be an easy way to get blacklisted from future PUG raids of it's the same guild running them. So if you really want to quit at the risk for that one item, sure, go ahead.
---
Kodo racing.
---
I understood that reference.
---
They were an Eastern Egg though...
---
I'd like to play a healing paladin, but for role play reasons I'm not happy wearing cloth. So here's the question: 
---
I understand +healing is an important attribute for healers in classic. I also see that there is big supply of +healing cloth items and a small supply of +healing plate items. And even if a plate part has +healing, it will usually be less than its cloth counterparts. I never see anyone talking about the damage reduction that plate brings. I imagine in PvE its not so important (because if you're healing you'll usually be hit by spells and not physical damage, I imagine). But in PvP that damage reduction must clearly be a big advantage?
---
With how powerful melee dps is with world buffs do you think nightfall will even be used anymore? And isn’t the uptime pretty crummy. 
---
Also why not put it on a hunter? Their dps sucks anyways at least they can spam their instant ability every global
---
Hijacking to ask what everyone thinks is the best spec for a min/max enhance/resto spec for improved weapon totems and healing? I think that’s what I’ll plan on doing because I think that provides the most raid utility
---
&gt; So you think the healing power is being undervalued for priests?
---
I'd have to say so. Pre-BIS for many priests starting raiding were Dreamweave, which is level ~40 crafted gear.
---
MP5 was an odd stat. You wanted it, but not over a certain amount (which was rabidly discussed and re-discussed over rounds of math on the EJ forums).
---
As I recall, the general goal was to get to ~400 +Healing, the rest to MP5/spirit. This is why you ended up with oddities like a level 22 staff being BIS for starting raids.

Damn, way to make me feel old.
---
I was 33 when WoW came out.
---
I also imply serious players, just a bit more serious than your random definition of what is casual/serious.
---
Its a nicher area of course - the issue is gimping the possibility of it at the start is not the best way to do the servers.
---
We all want Classic, we all want it within one of the four veins that existed up to 1.12. That is why for some of us RP-PvP is critical.
---
For some of us it allows us to pull in our friends that are RPers and are friends that are PvPers and Also PvEr's without it those people will be forced to go it alone on other servers rather than playing with their friends because they don't have that server option.
---
I've already seen it with good friends that have had to either say no to classic entirely or say the will be rolling flat RP. If we have to roll PvP ill do my roleplaying still and unlike most I don't give a flying fuck if some brat tries to ruin my entertainment.
---
The issue we have is that we don't have clarity - the last interview that had dev's that any of us are aware of said they were being considered for larger regions.
---
This puts a huge amount of stress on us in the upper parts of the community for RP-PvP. We have very few streamer/video creators and not really those of any serious note to push our point effectively so resort to using our weight from other community efforts we run.
---
lol count me in

About 15 years ago, I played Vanilla on a computer that was at least a decade old. Inside, a 256MB graphics card, 10GB hard drive, and single-core processor. Cleared 11/15 in naxx on that computer, all the while getting 10 frames per second on fights like Thaddius.   
---
If your PC can't run Classic, try looking in dumpsters for an upgrade.
---
I think you should include a treat meter in your videos, some classes like fire mage, warlock and fury can't do the maximum theorycal dps because they will be threat caped which helps low dps classes.
---
Also you can consider the crit aura adds nearly 100dps to the moonkin, if the other casters would be doing 800dps(which seems reasonable) with +3% crit they would be doing each +24dmg, x4 = +96dmg.(assuming 3% crit is 3% dmg, yeah i know it's not exactly that but let's keep it simple)
---
 !Remindme 65 days
---
As much as I like farming and grinding for three hours a day to get a few gold... I second your post.
---
Just cycle through rested XP lol
---
I mean it kinda makes sense to have a "pretty" option for horde players. I've convinced past GFs to give casual wow leveling a shot and both times they chose NE characters. If I was horde I think I would have had a harder time getting them to try the game out if they had to be a "monster"
---
pink isn't in the rainbow!
---
Pandaren were in the night elf campaign cinematics, undead campaign you find a Pandaren rest area. In frozen throne, theres a whole squad of pandaren during the alliance secret campaign
---
24 yr old teacher, such sex leg
---
Based on his other videos : 
---
fire mage : 843/965/1297 (heavily threat caped you can't do that in raids)
---
frost : 530/839/980
---
I hope you get an RP-PVP server, I don’t think you will. My best advice to you is do what the RP community did in FFXIV. Declare a server the RP-PVP server and shout it from the rooftops that this is where you gotta go if its what you’re looking for
---
TBC masterrace
---
you i love you
---
&gt; Badlands rock elementals(don't do before AQ)
---
why not before AQ?
---
If you wait for items to be available to offspec players, then there are some items you'll just never get.   
---
Because the items you want for your PVP set are PVE-BIS for mages/warlocks. Your raid will have \~15 of those classes, meanwhile, you'll probably be getting \~3 of these 'accessory' items per **year.**  
---
If you want great PVP gear, you cannot be willing to wait behind 15 people for items that drop 11% each week. That means a PVP-friendly loot council guild, or a PVP-friendly DKP guild.
---
Made my day, I love your comment thank you stranger
---
I don't see it that way personally, I'd rather aoe grind to 60 as a mage it feels (and is) much more efficient 
---
To each their own
---
My two best friends were both paladins.  I don’t think they had as much fun as I did as a mage.  One kept questioning if he should change classes.  Interestingly, they both stopped playing and I kept on going.  I always wondered if they had been a different class if they would have kept on playing.   We were also very casual players.
---
This is amazing
---
Good thing I've always played priest. I hope priests aren't over saturated at launch.
---
it's really fun, has a nice story and amazing areas to explore. Exploration is a big part of the game
---
This. Also, the older raids are still relevant and get run on a regular basis. So you'll eventually get a chance to get some gear there.
---
Who heals you if your wife doesn't play?    Must be a weird volunteer system of some sort ...
---
All the classes are useful. But man, if you want to never struggle to find a group for dungeons. Prot warrior or Holy Priest. Problem is leveling solo as either of those is pretty rough. So you will need to make some friends!
---
&gt;If you're a team player on top and willing to off tank, collect a heal set and decurse/toss some heals out on certain fights
---
So basically just know how to play your class.
---
Skinning and Fishing, good luck competing with nodes as a Priest in a crowded environment against Druids, Hunters, Shamans. Vendor the Skins from the beasts you grind, sell the fish or cooked meal on the AH. Get your 40 mount, get herbalism and go back and level it from 0 while you have a mount under your ass.
---
Holy fuck that is one disgusting female! Like woah! You actually look like a male Blood Elf crackhead, if crackhead were a class
---
the fact that private servers are absolutely infested with more severe issues sticks a wrench in this entire post.
---
 Sounds like they're having a midlifie crisis forreal though.
---
He's 22, cone isn't available yet
---
I've been playing on a private server for the first time, and I'm actually making money from tailoring. At first selling 6 slot bags on the AH made tones of money. Now that I'm in wool territory I just try to buy all the cheap wool I can to keep leveling. But I'm also buying like all the linen I can as well to make bags to vendor (making like 40c a bag if I can get my linen for 22c per). Maybe not the best money/time, but it's really easy. Also making some money from selling greens, but I have to do low volume or the market floods and most don't sell
---
copying from youtube:  The images were prepped individually in photoshop, and then animated in after effects
---
I added the level estimation so you can verify whether skipping something is going to cause issues in the future. Notoriously bad quests are tagged as such and instance/group content are generally a huge risk (timewise) so if you're ahead, skip them to even out the difference. Being ahead also gives you the option to group up with others and get quests done quicker with no penalty.
---
Outleveling content becomes quite difficult after level 30 which is reachable in a relatively short amount of time compared to 30-60.
---
You should be able run into the ocean and die of fatigue while a ghost and get put near the nearest spirit healer
---
It's going to be tough, you have to fight all those other classes wanted that +spell damage mail.
---
I ended up befriending Chinese gold farmers and bought wholesale from them. Basically offered them less than the AH listed price and they made more because they didn't get the AH cut removed from profits.
---
Or just some gold farming on retail.
---
You absolutely needed consumables for Naxx on private servers, granted that is not WoW classic but still.   It is not optional.  There is no way you can beat Loatheb without everyone in the guild having Greater Shadow Pots, Healthstones/Whipper Roots/Crystal Restores, and Bandages (I brought 40 of each for progression).  And you won't DPS him down fast enough without your normal DPS consumables.  
---
I have always contended that the hardest part about Vanilla/Classic raiding is the 40 man bit.  You think 40 can't be that much worse than 25, but I assure you it is.  In every guild i've been in there have always been a core of about 15-25 people that carried the rest.  There are some guilds that field 40 rock stars, but those are the minority and usually the top guilds on the server.
---
I recently upgraded to a 144 hz monitor with 1ms latency and I love it. Make sure you upgrade from HDMI to Display Port cables or else the HDMI won’t allow you to display the full 144 hz.  
---
As far as how much difference it makes, if you play at 1080p 60 hz and vertical sync disabled you will notice screen tearing when moving the camera. With 1080p 144hz I have seen literally no screen tearing. The motion is so smooth. It’s what I’ve been trying to achieve for years on 60 hz monitors but ultimately having to rely on vertical sync to even out the frame rates. But v-sync leads to input lag and that’s honestly worse than screen tearing. 
---
I should also mention that I upgraded my graphics card from a GeForce 750 to 1660 at the exact same time. So it might be a combination of both which gave me such a huge improvement.
---
thats kinda mean....

I remember doing a level 1 race from Dun Morogh to gadgetzan and I died of fatigue while a ghost near dust wallow and tanaris border and was sent to gadgetzan graveyard and spirit rezzed and won the race.
---
To be frank - though I admit it reluctantly ... Pandas weren't bad. Sure ... way outside the expected scope of WoW but still.  
---
I had quit at Cata in the Firelands patch when I received mails telling me all my precious keys and been converted into gold. It was the final offense in my eyes - I know it can look stupid to some.   
---
I returned during 5.3 after my cousin extensively pitched me I'd love MoP. Because sure I was 'The hell do I care about Pandas ?'. 'Trust me, you know me - I've never given you advice that turned out wrong (which is true actually), try it.'  
---
Tried it. Leveled a Panda Monk. The "Fantasy Chinese" setting didn't make me dream - but still I have to admit - I had a blast. Even with the grind. And Timeless Isle. Though I never took the time to complete the Pandaria Loremaster.   
---
I had rushed the Golden Lotus rep in the vale to finish it before 5.4 but otherwise I just quested enough to ding 90.   
---
So while I didn't like the setting ... that expac was actually pretty solid. PvE was very good. ToT. SoO. PvP was quite good as well (though I fucking hate that Deepwind Gorge BG). The max level storylines were good (loved the Divine Bell chain). The continent was awesome to explore ... there was the pre-WoD content draught but well ...   
---
Nah really, all things considered, even given how much I hated Cataclysm towards the end (though I loved the new zones and initial dungeon difficulty), the one xpac I'd chose to forget about would be Warlords. Had a lot of promise. Was botched horribly. I mean I have nothing against grinds, but I like to grind when it's useful. Here we were just grinding for days on end for nothing.
---
\*Snorting mana crystals\*
---
great guide.
---
Well, yeah?
---
Which means this time around, if you roll a shadow priest, don't EXPECT to get to raid with it. How hard is that to deal with, really?
---
AoE farming in EPL as a Prot Pally gonna be fun for you.
---
Wait that's a thing ?   
---
Shit. I have to make one now.

---
If not, yeah I'll try out nightfall/conflag
---
Ah okay there's probably some math we can do on this, but I have no idea how much XP those mobs give at a given level, or how many there are.
---
No, YOU'RE breathtaking!
---
Nightfall is best used on the offtanks to give them something to do when they aren't tanking. This is of course assuming you aren't at a point yet where all of your offtanks are tanking as dps specs. Giving one to a hunter is pants on head retarded. A warrior can do the same thing without chugging valuable mana pots.
---
People only think hunter's dps sucks because they are using meters of farm content they over gear and kill in 2 seconds. Or theoretical dps with BIS gear. That's not how things be. MC will be cleared by people in leveling greens. Hunters are reliable dps that are valued members of the raid. T1 the 3 ranged dps classes will be the most useful for progression. 
---
The real question is whether nightfall is worth the time it takes to farm it.
---
Am i crazy for wanting to roll elemental?
---
Buy gold from all the Chinese gold sellers who will make a fuckload of money thanks to layering
---
Why would you not want to pay Priest?  Let some other schlep be the tank.
---
Gonna dodge the bottleneck, won't even be behind.
---
You seem to be quite stuck up about your position. We will see how it develops and what becomes standard, but it useless to already start flaming now.
---
Also please reread my position. You are saying that greed option is useless, but as I described you would only need if the best option for any member would be to sell it for gold. You would greed in other cases and if the item is not an upgrade for anyone then it can be sold by anyone who rolled greed.
---
Report and block him like I did. Don’t give trash like this any attention.
---
This doomer stuff is just pathetic imo. Bunch of grown men addicted to gaming and drinking Monster? Jeez. Basically emo teens but for millenials. It's just beta as fuck.
---
Ohh thats one of the current plans at the moment - though It's caused divisiveness within the upper leadership. Many of us have links with either major wow websites etc.
---
I sit on the side of the post of just constantly contacting the dev's nicely and making noise but keeping it in a controlled and mature manner.
---
I will of course feel sad for those affected by us declaring a server rp-pvp if all of us end up rolling that way but if it comes to that It will have to happen and i'll promote rp to everyone, its just another way to let of steam.
---
No one should roleplay all the time while playing in the honest opinion and I don't think i've encountered someone that maintains 100% uptime unless for example they are specifically a rping streamer or within a specific niche group with specific characters.
---
It's high pressure much of the time but the random things that can unfold are sometimes so beautiful.
---
Put the two and two together... Private servers don't cost anything to play...
---
D:
---
Not to revive a dead thread or anything but is there a list of servers the streamers are going to be on so I know what servers to avoid?
---
Leveling as a healer is an exceptionally bad idea if you don't have a warrior partner lined up.
---
Well I’m a Paladin so...
---
I no I just don’t have one rn and was trying to get an idea of what’s the min I’d need
---
I’m fairly sure the thorium brother hood stuff was added in a later patch (1.7 from memory but I’d have to double check)

Aoe grinding mobs for materials and shit as a druid. Maybe stealth runs too. Professions.

Demon hunters were always real lore wise, pandas were an easter egg meme they decided to make an entire playable race + lore out of -.-

They use prisoners.

I'm glad physical copies of games are dying. Less clutter around the house.
---
Dailies in any game are annoying. I always feel you have this list of "do this... Then do what you want to do" with daily stuff.
---
Flipping AH mainly but in order to do so I have to build a bankroll. That's where farming DM comes in.
---
There is only one reason to do a server transfer; beeing to lazy to make a new character.
---
Why give people the option when they can relive the journey again. I thought that is what classic was all about.
---
Solo instance farming like Maraudon or DM North
---
Usually not worth it in terms of gold/hour compared to other options.
---
Yeah I can dig that too. Honestly never been very wowed by nightfall, it's just such a low chance to proc - especially considering a build that either loses or kills it's opponent pretty quickly.
---
Beg in the beginning, buy in the end.
---
Most of the good ele gear isn't gear for mage/warlocks anyway. Like you want vael shield, nef mace, magmadar shoulders etc. none of them are normal caster items.

Excuse me....its called a "Robe." Rofl

I've just finished the book 'Before the storm' and started 'beyond the dark portal' would you recommend reading this before anything else?
---
Hot out the gate I'm taking tailor and skinning, vendoring ruined, light and medium leather and selling bags made from tailoring.  Once I get in my 50s, I'll likely be farming elemental fires and snagging any devilsaurs I can get my hands on.  Post 60 I'll drop skinning for enchanting, burn off my post-epic mount funds into leveling that, then start farming twink gear and hope the market for that is as big as it was back in ye olde time (judging by the beta/twich response so far, I'm thinking it will be more lucrative).
---
You take Skinning and another gathering Prof to make gold as you grind to 60. 
---
Then switch when you get into endgame content
---
Btw what does bis mean
---

---
I really want them to remove the option for streamers, so they cant lvl on a pve server and then swap to a pvp server
---
So I don’t agree at all I personally love digital copies, but what you could do is stand around until midnight on August 26, maybe stand outside blizzard offices, and then go home and play
---
You don't need 300 tailoring to wear it.  You need 300 tailoring only to get the crit set effect, though in fairness that is what makes it BIS at that point in time.
---
So it's like shadow priest for warlocks, but with melee?
---
Sorry I was just asking
---
I think he was mostly talking about PVE, but even with PVP it is not the game that makes you log in, it is the other players.  Rank 14 is super easy if you are the only one ranking.  The nightmare comes when people try to out neck-beard each other and play for 18 hours a day.  Now the game design allows this to happen, but the daily grind is because another player is logging in every day, not that the game mechanic says you have to.  I mean, if you and one other guy are going for rank 14 and no one else is close, you could both take a day off.
---
But what changes with AQ release?
---
This is what happens when you play wow solely for mounts, pets, and all that cosmetic shit.
---
Women are notoriously terrible at just about everything. If there was an actual race specific to female players their racial would be Sandwich and their starting area would be the Kitchen. Females belong in Retail wow not classic. They can have that.
---
Isn't Falstad dead?
---
Sure, but you  will have over a year to farm for Nax. 
---
Plus, decent guilds can do split raids where PUGs pay them to get carried through MC and AQ. Thats how we used to fund consumables.
---
Depends how heavily you plan to burn through gold, I guess, and what you plan to 'actually play' and whether they can farm too.  Don't forget to consider the opportunity cost, you'll easy spend 10+ days /played just getting your farming character to max level, so you need to consider how well you can farm with your alt/main in that amount of time and see if the trade-off is worth it.
---
That goes out the window of course if you want to play multiple characters because you enjoy them.  But if your goal in doing this is solely to farm, I don't think it's totally worth it unless you have a pressing need to spend hundreds of gold quite often.
---
You must be a pro yelp review writer.
---
This time I know to quit before wrath
---
Good sentiment, but some classes do solo better than others in Vanilla. That will matter to new players.
---
I think DM farming is overvalued on this sub, reports from the beta have /camp not working the way it does on pservers.  Resetting DME seems like it'll be a lot more troublesome.
---
You’re posting this on Reddit and bashing Reddit.
---
Once all the mages and locks pass on it you can start rolling for it against the other shamans.
---
In what world is improved succy better than instant corruption in PVP?
---
1 important thing to remember.  Storm strike isnt used for raids, there are more important debuffs then stormstrike for that slot.
---
Yo Enhance Shaman is just one of the funnest classes hands down,  always gotta stay on your toes, some other classes just feel so auto-pilot.
---
I loved the Pandas. Sue me.
---
For sure, I plan on making a list of things my guild shouldn't vendor coming up here.  OMG you vendored a large venom sac???!?!? Don't you know that is for Elixirs of Poison Resistance for AQ and NAXX?!?!  Lol.
---
This is why I want blizz to release new content at lv 60 for after Naxx ala Old School Runescape
---
Nice, that was for epic flying in tbc tho. ;)
---
The sense of comradery will be missed but there's no denying the convenience of digital copies is vastly superior. You pre-load and install the game before it's even released and you're g2g.
---
As a shaman most of the mail gear pre nax is spell damage and healing not just healing. This makes getting good gear for pvp easier sins you will not fight anyone but other pvp orientated shamans. Neck and rings will be harder you might have to go whit dungeon loot until ZG but that won't be a problem.
---
It was an experience
---
Play 100+hrs to reach 60 only to get banned
---
if the tank is chain pulling then notice if you get aggro often if youre putting renew on him. If you do renew him then only do it early into a pull so that it fall offs in time before the next pull. Or if the packs are dying too fast for renew to fall off then only use a big heal when needed and abuse the mana regen mechanic when not casting for more than 5 seconds. If youre constantly renewing and casting shield youll oom yourself within a couple pulls everytime. Big heal casts are most efficient, at least for 5 mans. Raid healing you cast whatever really
---
DM will only be available from P2 and onwards and that will prob take a few months
---
Yes, I know very well what it is from. Doesn't mean I can't apply it to Classic to make some ez gold
---
Go Resto and roll on Off Spec items.  Im Enhance at heart but its just gonna be infinitely easier to heal some people and they toss it to you as a thanks, instead of trying to take top dps (probably wont) and winning the roll.
---
To be fair that would not run classic
---
This thing has never been laid lmao
---
That bug list is outdated, many are fixed. Feel free to keep playing on private servers with their "authentic" 3% parry, spell damage conversions on abilities that had none, corrupt GMs, and improper spawn rates.
---
When I was in 8th grade (2005) I had to do a book report. I chose to do it on  “Day of the Dragon” a wow book by Richard A. Knaak.  Long story short I got an A+ and my teacher commended me in my deep and critical thinking on the novel. First and last time Iv ever gone in such depth on a written assignments.
---
Honestly I’m hoping they continue classic into TBC and Wrath of the Lich King. That way I know it will get better. Everyone knows Classic is rough and unbalanced in terms of every spec becoming viable in a raid. But they all get tremendously better in later expansions.  Just stop before Cataclysm is all I ask.

Dumb question, but does anyone know when they send out invites? Is it monthly or not known?
---
What about Healing Focus? (-70% cast interruption chance). Are you better off with 2 points in that or renew?
---
I'm well aware. If the thread was titled *"How are you planning to make gold during phase 1?"* I would've provided a different answer.
---
I think the reasoning is worse than the actual pandas. They did it to appeal to China players.
---
Found the fedora tipper :p
---
By 1.12 there were 16 debuff slots and and a debuff priority system put in place by Blizzard to prevent good debuffs from getting pushed off by bad debuffs.
---
That means that for instance deep wounds won't push curse of elements off the boss. And also that stormstrike won't push off important debuffs.
---
You seem fun
---
Oh,
---
The rock elementals drop elemental earth, the primary material for Greater nature protection pots, https://classicdb.ch/?item=13458#created-by which is used for 3 different bosses in AQ usually by the entire raid, so safe to say many elemental earths are used doing AQ.
---
Pimping out some gnome chicks on the second floor in Lion's pride inn.
---
I guess I meant it sucks for everyone else lol
---
Advantage? Hardly
---
Is it more visually pleasing, of course.
---
Well done, well done.  The ending is a bit scarcely accurate.
---
&gt;Relaxed, sleep-inducing (seriously) commentary on World of Warcraft. Sincerely, Soupa
---
Still accurate.
---
Go ahead and stay on your quarantine servers if you want lol. Not everyone wants to play in racist cesspools with no moderation and high ping.
---
At 60 goto Brd killed the goblin in the bar and get best quiver in game before your Epic one from LockD quest. Only time I ever ran outa ammo. Let me see ,never. Made my own and it was always habit to fill quiver every end of day and half my last bag if I was raiding. Your dead zone is manipulated more by mages than any other class in pvp. Other than that in pve I never had a problem with it.
---
Ugh this person is so stereotypically annoying I can’t fathom what they’re like in real life. Nails. Chalkboard.
---
If you can't get people you'll be a zg/aq20 guild forever and your good players will go somewhere they can actually progress. So asses in chairs really is first prio.
---
Aaaaand the red eyes because of the question: "Will be there other language servers than english in EU?"
---
Nonetheless we will overtake one when there are only ze brit servers in EU.
---
I’ve been so discouraged about leveling a pally as my first, I think I’ll go with mage even those people say they’re boring in raids but they’re super fun everywhere else.
---
Was that really needed...
---
Ah I wasn't aware ele earth was used in those pots, makes sense now. Thanks buddy
---
Average mob level is ~44 Elite in ZF, so if you go in there at 40, they're worth 735 base. With group 1.4x then /5 split... each mob is worth 206xp.
---
Alex so nice he lets the lowbie gank him
---
What gear do you have? Decent to awful depends on gear just as much as spec
---
Mining and Herbs will be my main profs.
---
reeee thots refuse to give me the sex
---
Destruction is really good, and more importantly **fun**, for PVP. 
---
But I'd rather go [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IVZbxZxE0tMLtt](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IVZbxZxE0tMLtt) 
---
Improved Corruption is very useful since you won't be using COA for PVP, Searing Pain is your filler nuke, and your build has wasted talent points in Demonology: Succubus won't have mana problems in PVP, Improved Succubus is a waste of points because it's capped in PVP anyways, and Fel Domination isn't nearly as good without Master Summoner.
---
While NF/Conflag may look promising on paper, in reality nearly every point spent in Affliction is wasted when you're that deep in Destro. You'll never use Drain Life, which significantly reduces the value of Nightfall. And unlike Affliction, Destruction is a nuke spec, so at best you're looking at 4% proc rate on maybe 4-5 Corruption ticks. SM/Ruin is much better if you're looking to hybrid Affli/Destro.
---
I would research the various BIS item lists for elemental shamans.  You can see for yourself where those items come from.  A surprising number of good items come from quests/dungeons/crafting in Vanilla.  No main raider should need +spell damage leather and mail gear, so those are easy pick ups.  ZG and AQ20 runs are more lax about loot distribution usually, so those are a good place to pick up some items as well.
---
I would start with the BIS lists (just a google search) and go from there.
---
Indeed. Cultural appropriate feels dirty no matter the situation. It is forced so it feels out of place.
---
I don’t think it’s a good idea to be honest. If you think about the amount of time required to level an alt to 60 for the sole purpose of farming? How much money could you have made just if you has farmed herbs or something on your main in that time? Even if you have a substandard feeling toon, a week worth of farming would take a long time to recoup
---
Cool tyvm!
---
Best in Slot.
---
So for that class/spec it's the best item in the game.
---
Hell yeah
---
Just dont be an idiot like me and turn back on retail, I figured it would make the wait go by faster with the new patch. 1 hour later I turned it back off... the Muppet Baby Giblins made me cringe so hard I think I pulled something...
---
F A P pots
---
-1 for not using something other than MATLAB. fuck that proprietary shit.
---
Correct, the armor is no biggie in PVE.  There are some great +healing plate items, but they don't come until later patches.  You will probably be wearing a lot of cloth, but it if makes you feel any better the shaman and druid healers will too.  
---
Try to think of it on the bright side - you get your pick of cloth, leather, mail and plate +healing items, something no other healing class can say.
---
Only mobs who see the totem before you. Then they proceed to attack you.
---
Well you got me interested. Know of any videos showcasing their leveling capabilities? I’ve seen mages which are probably the top dawgs but for warlocks, they can’t avoid getting hit like mages can. How would they pull huge groups and dot all of them down without dying unless you’re talking about different methods?
---
That won't be an option for awhile.
---
Thinking of playing either mage or warrior in classic. Is frost mage the preferred leveling up spec?
---
Is it confirmed that windfury autos can actually proc chance on hit effects?
---
I agree, thanks for pointing this out. I will keep updating the page and cleaning it up the comming weeks untill the launch is close. Like the vids btw, keep up the good work!
---
Thankfully you get both in one with a quick gear switch
---
When servers are announced, this should help: https://www.avoidstreamers.com/
---
I'm currently debating between a shaman, priest, or warlock. I want to go for with something with either healing or utility, or both, and these three are the most appealing. I like the healing roles provided by priest and shaman, but I like the aesthetic of warlock. What can I expect from leveling and end game with these classes, such as professions, competition, and complexity?
---
"Stuck up"? What does that even mean?
---
You're not even making an argument.  I ask you a question,  like "what is the purpose of a greed roll, if you're rolling need on the things you can't even use?" and you ignore the question.
---
No I'm not saying the greed option is useless. I'm saying if you're need rolling on the things that you can't use, that you just want to sell, that makes the greed roll useless, because that's literally what it's for. 
---
The greed roll is very useful.
---
Again, you're claiming to know what is best for everyone, which is ridiculous. That's like me claiming to know where it's best to grind and 30, and forcing you to go there instead of some place you'd rather go. You're trying to force everyone to go along with what YOU think is best, which is just fucked up. And people will not be having it. 
---
I played Vanilla. I play private servers now. **Greed roll is for things that you can't use/equip now, that you just want to sell (or use on an alt)**.
---
But go ahead and roll need on things you can't use, isn't an upgrade, etc. And you will be kicked from groups and branded a ninja looter. Because *that's THE definition of a ninja looter*.
---
Oof, this was prime cringe material.
---
I can't stand people that do this faux stupidity schtick.
---
A big reason for me wanting an actual xfer service would be because of rare recipes I get with what profession I have and such. Try getting all the flask and gpp recipes all over again, ya no thanks
---
They very well might. Blizzard is in a fortunate position where they don't  have to release any new content for the two years or so of the game. 
---
Most likely, they are just waiting to see how popular Classic is and how the players are interacting with it before figuring out where to go next.
---
&lt;citation needed&gt;
---
Got emmmm!
---
I’ve been alliance all my life but I want to play a shaman so badly uuuuugggghhhhh
---
I had to stop watching after the quest accept fiasco.
---
What's your question?
---
My dream has always been to be a totem twisting enhance shaman so I can get sucked off by the melee dps between pulls. But I'm scared to because like half the comments in here are tryhards shitting on the totem twisting shaman.
---
It's still the hardest decision in my life and I'm still licking my wounds a bit to be honest.
---
I grew up lower class and my dad died when I was 20. That's when I became an adult from a college kid. I moved back home for more than a year stopping my studies in the capital city. After that my mother had enough saving for me to live off for 3 months in the capital city and I got a bit of a student loan too.
---
I started my studies again and looked for an internship. I ran out of money one week before my first pay arrived. I got a 5kg value bag of corn flakes with my last money and ate that for a week with some leftover people gave me in the dorms.
---
That's when we met. We were together for 4 years and my career started to progress a bit and I made more money than my parents' combined income was back in the day. I was still in debt and living month to month, but it was a comfortable life. I told her I want to be financially stable before kids, I want to have a place of my own, I don't want to have a family in a rented flat.
---
The sad thing is I probably would have married her if she decides to stay with me. But of course I didn't tell her this.
---
Now at 29 I'm a leading professional in the banking sector. I have more cash in the drawer than I made in the last 2 years combined and it's only June. I wonder if she has a kid already but I'm not on facebook and she left the country so I'll probably never hear from her again.
---
I think it's time I get a new girlfriend.
---
Anyway sorry for the wall of text and thanks for hearing me out.
---
And yet we don't call WC "Druids of the Fang" or DOTF. We call it WC, because it's a dungeon, the name of the dungeon is written all over the quest and even has its own subgroup in your quest log.
---
I think he asked if  he will get skinny while mining?
---
I'm just looking for feedback on this plan. Does it make sense?
---
Friends come and go. Paladin is forever.
---
Frost allows you to do crazy aoe which can make leveling very fast. Also with conjure water you should be pretty speedy and efficient. Add in teleport and blink, and you got a stew goin
---
Warrior without a healer friend is sloooooooow
---
Another thing is attunements. In TBC a guild couldn't carry you at all, as you needed to do a lot of attunments to even access the raids. To even get to heroic dungeons, you needed revered with the according faction, then you needed to do a bunch of dungeons to get the karazhan key (t4 raid) To get the serpentshrine cavern key (t5 key), you needed to complete karazhan and gruul's lair (t4 raids), to get the tempest keep key (the other t5 raid), oyu needed to do some very hard heroic 5 man challenges. And finally after completing  both t5 raids, you'd get access to mount hyjal, one of the t6 raids.
---
Attunements also were in vanilla, but not as linked as in TBC. In wrath they were completely dropped, wihch also eases the catchupo process.
---
This is the best marketing strategy I've ever seen. Good job!
---
Male my dude.
---
Look up holyfrog on youtbe
---
I never found the Pandas to be a problem, they have been non-existent in the story since MoP closed (and even in MoP it more about Orcs and Mogu rather than Pandas). And very few people play them as their character.
---
For me it's the Blood Elves and Paladins they bought with them. They are solely responsible for the Horde no longer feeling like the Horde. It's like 60% Blood Elves and 40% shared between the other 10 races of the Horde.
---
It is why I prefer Vanilla servers over TBC servers. TBC may have better mechanics, but the theme is garbanzo and the Horde no longer exists.
---
It was just exciting as a kid. I don’t really care about the physical copies on pc games, mostly just for console games. The excitement came from getting the okay from your parents to go out late, meet up with friends and wait in line, being unable to stand still from pure hype. Then just playing until the sun comes up, it was so fun lol. Never doing that shit again.
---
No cause im 11
---
Hes name will be Mitchel. Lol
---
Nice job having class colors synchronize up
---
&gt; Cataclysm was the first expansion where Blizzard actually put effort into dungeons and made them a challenge, gave the bosses actual tactics to follow or a competent team would wipe.
---
Are you kidding me? TBC heroics are absolutely great and more of a challenge than the cataclysm ones.
---
So the pvp guy has prio over the pve hunter? Gl with that
---
Horde data can't catch up, because most people aren't logging in anymore. All that missed characters from horde can maybe be collected when everybody logs in again, during a new duell tournament or something.
---
Solo or do you have partners?
---
Solo Frost is generally considered the best due to AoE kiting and farming large packs of mobs.
---
If you have a group your playing with or even a single partner it sorta depends what your partner will be playing but even then frost is usually the most viable.
---
Blizzard won’t change how world buffs stack lmao. Stop making shit up.
---
Me too. For prot warrior Night Elf looks best but their arms and fury stances are dumb. Humans have better arms and fury stances but dumb tank stance.
---
1 you would have no idea. 2 1 more death on your climb isn't going to affect your enjoyment of the game for the coming years.  I'm playing pvp, but this sub vastly over estimates the number of people that would roll on a different server and xfer over.
---
Your bags will be full 24/7, just FYI
---
Problem is, let's say for some reason Steam goes under. Goodbye to all your games?
---
oh, interesting, ty!
---
I hope a lot of people like this play on the opposite faction as me so PVP will be easy.
---
Quefrio BR?
---
The problem is that mobs on the way to it are on groups of 3 or 4, and the area isnt very good for kiting unlesd you plan to bring them all the way to arena and entrance. In my mind the biggest problem will be the respawn timer.
---
Question: is Nightfall available in phase 1? Thought I’ve heard something somewhere that it won’t be until later, kinda like Titanic Leggings
---
If you don’t have Nightfall, would it make sense to use a fast dagger/1-h to fish for crits, and then change to a slow 2h after for the flurry buff?
---
I’m not planning on being enhance, it was just a thought I had some time ago, and thought this was a decent time to ask it
---
When an April fools joke becomes cannon it really feels like they're jumping the shark lore-wise. Yet there was so many other races/story lines they could have developed... Too many people give them a pass on this IMO, hell some embrace and love it.
---
Lol. Ace Ventura style?
---
I really like Gnome Death Knight.
---
They have basically said they are happy with the amount of people playing the beta as of right now so to not expect any more beta waves to go out unless a major dropoff of people playing the beta were to happen.
---
it started as a joke and the war craft community liked it so they developed it during that game, they listened to the feedback
---
they existed before wow so I always thought it was weird the backlash they got
---
&gt; you're claiming to know what is best for everyone
---
I never did this.
---
&gt; You're trying to force everyone to go along with what YOU think is best
---
I'm not forcing anyone. I'm making an argument for a system, just like any other system people can accept it or reject it.
---
&gt; Greed roll is for things that you can't use/equip now, that you just want to sell (or use on an alt).
---
This is your opinion and that is fine, nothing wrong with that. Mine just differs.
---
&gt; I ask you a question, like "what is the purpose of a greed roll, if you're rolling need on the things you can't even use?" and you ignore the question.
---
I don't even understand this? Did you read my reply? I explained exactly when you would greed with my system.
---
I’ve been playing on a private classic server and trying out everything as it’s been ages since I’ve played last.  Warrior doesn’t seem as bad as people make it out as the hamstring kite seems good as a 30% damage reduction.  The character is only level 21 though so pulling multiple adds spells trouble. 
---
Still not sure what I want to play though.
---
Youll run out of bank space most likely if u do it while u level
---
Remember youll have to buy bank slots and large bags to have more bank room.
---
That all costs gold.
---
I say, go mining and skinning and sell all the mats until u get to 60 then
---
Farm all the mats you need (youll have plenty of gold to have a large bank) for engineering, drop skinning. Bam. Youre ready to go.
---
You just keep creating bank alts if you need more space
---
Imo drop skinning and try make some gold with engineering. Both ally and horde specifically can make really decent gold with engineering early game probably worth more than leveling skinning just to make a gold or two pre 40(skinning really doesn't take off before lvl 35+). 
---
For ally: Bronze tube is needed for beginning Look to the stars https://classicdb.ch/?quest=174 which is a questchain in duskwood. There are various vendors that sell these, but with everyone leveling there will still be plenty of a market. 
---
For horde: You need a Deadly blunderbuss https://classicdb.ch/?item=4369#created-by for the quest Warsong supplies https://classicdb.ch/?quest=6571 which gives some pretty damn amazing gear.
---
Both of these can be used to make a decent profit early on, and you get to level engineering and have some fun in the meantime.
---
but why take a screenshot of the figure window instead of saving the window in .png or .eps? :&lt;
---
Surprised, no
---
Disappointed, yes
---
Doesn't matter, if you want to play on a PvP server, level on a PvP server. I don't mind people transfering from PvP to PvP.
---
I mean yeah but the point is you can be a feral dps, just don't expect that to be the same experience as being a rogue
---
I imagine it would be something along the lines of "yeah, still trying to fix this hunter shit, folks."
---
Same, I think the colours are washed compared to an IPS.
---
Is this the Warcraft Chronicle volume 1?
---
A lot of the items you have there are not available until the later phases of the game. Just for peoples interest, in case they were planning as using that as a guide on release.
---
F
---
Should I try to find guild beforehand or just roll with it? I'm planning on spending 2 nights a week raiding and two days grinding.
---
idk what I just watched, but thanks
---
Translation:  When your totem from the last fight is still out but you've moved on and a patrol runs into it and then comes and murders you.
---
I appreciate the story. You need to be on the same page as your significant other. If you are not, then you start to resent the other person. 29 isnt too old to start a family. Hell, 35 isnt. You have the time. I wish you kuck.
---
These days, I don't think it would run Google Chrome or Firefox. :S
---
Chinese accounted for at least 3rd of playerbase before MoP, if not even more. Then again they didn't pay for subscription and instead for actual used ingametime and they counted "players" differently. Regardless there were a lot of Chinese players anyway.
---
!remindme 70 days
---
Perfect translation :D
---
Whatever. I would just say im sorry something came up and i gtg. Not right away to not be too suspicious. I would be fine with only one piece if it were distributed after the raid but if not, i have zero interest in going through a whole raid with pugs knowing that i cant get anything else, many people feel the same. I doubt this would ever work
---
so fake
---
Thank you for actually reading, it helps more than you think. All the best.
---
It makes little to no difference either way. You won't notice it at all, and there won't be this massive amount of pve levelers xfering. The restriction is nonsensical.
---
Oh man me too. When halo 2 came out I was at the local gaming store in St. Albert at midnight. We were already drinking to celebrate. There was a 12 year old there with his mom. I told the kid his mom was a total milf, he was not impressed. The good old days.
---
But just THINK of all the fun dear ol' DAD will have with his spawn!  I mean, if the 3 of you joined a guild...
---
Well there's that lol
---
I quit shortly thereafter.  When 3.2 was revealed to be *yet another* low effort filler raid.
---
wrong it stands for Dun Modr which is in the wetlands
---
&gt; 1 hour later I turned it back off
---
Been there. Honestly been thinking about leveling a class just for funsies but I feel like that might ruin it a little bit.
---
They love World of warcraft. They even built a warcraft amusement park
---
https://youtu.be/-LqJcdvZgL8
---
That’s just how a beta test goes. You’re online to serve them data they need. They are not online to serve your need for attention.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZtbbdhgZE0xzVRs
---
If you're just going PvE solely it's probably this. You could move points around in enhance if you wanted to take the weapon crit and flurry in place of the Dodge chance etc.
---
Resto has so many good talents in it that's it's hard to take them all. Ancestral Healing is good, but mainly beneficial on main tanks and on horde priests will cover them with the inspiration talent. 
---
Depending on where you are gear wise Tidal Mastery might also be worth more throughput than purification.
---
Healing Focus is also pretty important depending on what fights you're progressing. 
---
There's also people who would argue that most resto shamans don't need to take improved healing wave.
---
You could maybe get away with that once, but do it every raid and it becomes obvious.youd still get an "emergency" list as well if people we're sharing lists.
---
Doing MC shouldn't be that hard either way if they do good requirements for people to enter the raid in the first place.
---
A development blog would be nice, I suppose, but what is it that you are worried about? I mean, it's not like they are going to cancel it at this point. Or only making RP-PvE realms.
---
Go on any Vanilla realm, and you'll find Frost Mages just **love** to hang out outside Orgrimmar and duel, because the venue is completely open with no room to LOS, and they can Blink in any direction. Of course those sort of playfields are highly disadvantageous to classes like Rogues or Warriors. It's the same in WSG - picking a fight in mid as a melee class is asking for it, you're better off engaging in the tunnel, flag room or just about anywhere you can LOS.
---
In a tight environment, a Rogue is perfectly capable of killing a Frost Mage. A lot of it will boil down to who has which cooldowns, and whether you're lucky with Crippling procs seeing as there's no Shiv in Vanilla.
---
Easy guys we got an old timer in the thread. No cursing and talk slowly.
---
Warrior is what I'll be going, I've always wanted to play something none ranged (even though I've loved them). I like the idea of tanking and/or dual-wielding dps. 
---
Probably going with a pvp alt that is warlock as well.
---
Pretty much, but i'd rather them tank and have my 2nd tank rock their fury gear since we will be dw/fury specs.
---
FACK
---
I love the website! Not a whole lot of builds right now. Hopefully posting here will help with that. It's hard to find a good classic talent site for mobile but yours is really nice.
---
Every player is different t. Assuming they are both super pro and know the best of the best tricks then I don't think you'd see this happen. A rogue v mage duel is gonna be one of two things. A quick unload of attacks from one player winning it in a few moments of better placed attacks. Or it'll be the 2 picking at each other trying to conserve hp and still attack.
---
They don’t owe you anything, you are just a customer.
---
I’m sorry, you must be lost...Classic only ever went up to level 60.
---
Depends on whether or not there's a way to quickly get out of an instance once it's finished.
---
If they change it, maraudon.
---
If they don't, DM Tribute, since you can run out, and vendor in the instance.
---
IDK HOW MANY MORE MADSEASON VIDEOS I CAN WATCH BEFORE I GO CRAZY
---
Excellent, only $10 right now on steam. Can I go a magic build and be ok?
---
Join a DKP guild that adds no restrictions.
---
Those actually take a lot more time and group effort than you would think. I expect we will get something closer to launch to rebuild the hype and then we will get more posts from Blizzard so content creators can make videos about it further building said hype.
---
With retail people coming over, there will no doubt me far more dps shammies, dps pallies, bear &amp; feral druids, and shadow priests in PvE than there ever was back in Vanilla.
---
"There are lot of noobs" would fit too :D
---
Excellent work. Would love to see one on warlock
---
The big gripe with Warriors is usually the repair bill and being extremely gear dependent while leveling. 
---
Well that and if anything goes wrong in an instance it’s almost always blamed on the tank due to “bad pull bruh”. 
---
I play a healer though so I’m used to being blamed for wipes when they’re absolutely not my fault.
---
Children of my generation never ate tide pods for likes.
---
It’s not that I’m worried at all. I’m gonna play the game no matter the problems. I’m just interested in knowing which of their changes, like the layering, made an impact from their perspective during the Beta. I know we’ve seen multiple post with flaws here on the subreddit, but maybe they feel it’s working just fine, and have an explanation?
---
I had to really watch my threat with a paladin tank in 5 mans, far more so than warrior/druid.  Besides that they did alright.
---
I’m very much aware of that, thanks for the kind reminder!
---
As long as you don't hoard stuff, bagspace isn't THAT much of an issues...
---
Isn't accepting a quest Gaming Common Sense 101? I mean you can clearly see the "Accept" at the bottom where it's always located.... I guess she's too used to her auto accept addons maybe? Still not an excuse though.
---
Holy shit lol... I was born and raised in St. Albert (till about I was 15) when we moved to Vancouver. I'll tell you one thing, I sure as hell don't miss waiting outside when it's -30c out.
---
Can't say I agree, I'm not in beta but playing on servers or reading up on things just makes me long for the real game more. :)
---
But I plan to mostly be casual and I'm OK with not achieving certain things. I think that depends on your mindset.
---
Uh, easter egg? I guess Warcraft 3 isn't a real game then?
---
rocket boots are literally in vanilla tho
---
Its actually been the opposite for me. I've been thinking about every class except priest, and i think I've finally settled on a class, Priest. I just want to try healing.
---
That expansion was the most fun expansion I’ve played.
---
A lot of people will be playing classic for the first time. You will have lots of time to learn your class. If you want to dominate PvP I would suggest Mage, Rogue, Warrior, Warlock, they are all very strong in their own unique ways
---
But he's not talking about being competitive, he's talking about going about everyday business mining and herbing.
---
On Pservers he would go to crazy crazy lengths to do that much DPS.  He would pay Horde to somehow get him Thrall's World Buff in Orgrimma (mind control him for the buff maybe?).  On Beta I dunno.
---
I'm interested in this, as I was planning to skin my way to 60 as well. Why vendor them? Is the AH market simply not worth it or do they actually vendor for a lot?
---
Ffxi was the same way. People hate when something they think doesnt work, does work. I blame min maxing. Not every player has to min max.
---
Wait wait wait wait wait............. consumers are here to serve corporations?
---
Geez.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IVZbxhzZVx0tMxtt
---
is pretty fun imo
---
Micro play!
---
In this day of age, if you think that Hunter is really dead. You need some help.
---
For people with data caps, I feel bad that physical copies are going out of style. As someone who had restricted downloads until a certain time frame or when I straight up had to use a wifi hotspot with 5 gb a month? Digital only means I never got to play.  
---
Now? I don't miss awkwardly standing about in line with maybe one or two other women within the Gamestop, going home, installing, patching then having to wait 3 hours before actually being able to play. That shit sucked.
---
Join a pvp guild thats open to questions. Also, try to follow the best player in your class in terms of spec/builds. There are many pvp guides but imo, what changes a players play style immediately is making arena/focus target key binds. I would start with just focus macros, but if you really get serious, use arena macros. 
---
Also understanding diminishing returns for cc chains is big
---
The issue is not the lack of taunt, it is the lack of mana.  Once you run oom your ability to generate threat drops like a brick.  Even if you were able to taunt, a dps would just pull off you again a second later because you cannot sustain your threat without mana.
---
What are they gonna do? Tell us nothing has changed? They release patch notes when they fix stuff. There's nothing left to unveil.
---
If you want to pvp destruction, I would suggest going engineering, grenades will add to your survivability, and gear is pretty important. Soul link/nightfall or soul link shadowburn will be easier, it's ludicrous with a healer untill a fully geared warrior comes along.
---
Filthy knife ears, I would burn your UI in a magma poll if I had the chance!
---
Idk I'd love world of starcraft dude
---
Are the Warcraft books any good, I know they're old, but would y'all recommend it?
---
Couldn't I simply mail the mats to an alt and keep everything in the mailing system? No bank at all
---
If I use my mouse to turn my camera how can I click rend?

Right? Brewmaster was a panda way before WoW was a thing
---
I sympathize with the doomer, but I don't disagree with you either.
---
Ride the Tiger.
---
I know you're joking but it's just weird to read that. Blizzard is probably starting to believe it, considering they made people pay to beta test their 15 year old game. Any other industry practically showers their customers with adoration. Hahah no this one.
---
Quests are auto accepted from level 1 to 5 (I think?) on modern WoW.
---
I honestly have no idea why, its not even a QoL change since you just have to accept them the normal way whenever you leave the starter zone.
---
Great idea. I think I'll do that too with the other thousand people that think this is a good idea.
---
Why wait until 60 to get a mount?  Just go to purgation isle and farm the NPCs there until you have enough @40
---
For leveling 1-60? Yes, the game has virtually no gear nor are the elemental talents suited to leveling. There is a bear hybrid spec that works well, though. For raiding? Also yes as curse of the elements does not effect nature damage and raid bosses and mobs have substantial nature resist, so until you can get the AQ gear that lowers it you're in for a bad time and you're going to need to put in far more effort than any other classes to get consumables for your mana issues for subpar damage over most the game. For going 30/0/21 as arguably the best support BG spec? It's pretty rad.
---
I think goblins should have been their own faction imo. Having them pick a faction was lame af

i always let it out with an overwhelming sense of pride, even though I had to buy it in wotlk (for 2.5k gold i think). It has always been my favourite

Well they need to have existed at that point in time for it  to happen
---
Thanks for the reply, looks about like what I came up with with the exception of improved reincarnation in place of healing way. 
---
I usually choose a pve focused spec for progression nights and just respec for farming/pvp. It’s generally a net positive and makes up for the 50g hits

This is a good video (good skill for the time) https://youtu.be/VhCI3DDvGGU
---
I finally broke down and started leveling a priest in retail, just to do some of the old dungeons and zones.  A few hours in and im level 29, and havent even died yet :(
---
It's just a re release tho. Having a developer blog would be a bit much. There's only like 500-600 people on the beta right now. If they want to do something, they can send out more beta invites.
---
That's the route I'm taking. Skinning+Mining as warlock, mailing all mining mats to bank alts. Dropping skinning at 60 for engineering. When ZG is in the game, drop mining for tailoring so I can use bloodvine set with the 2% crit bonus. I guess if I ever get naxx gear I would drop tailoring at that point and replace it with something else.
---
A guide to raiding as enhancement shaman:  reroll warrior or rogue and actually get a melee dps spot!  You're welcome.
---
I'm not your guy fwen!
---
Don't worry. "WOW Classic" isn't going to play quite as differently from retail.
---
The players that say "pandaren aren't real, they're just a joke" have never read any bit of lore outside of WoW. 
---
They preach shit that they don't even know.
---
I’m a shaman and I could not beat this Warlock 3 levels below me in a duel. He kept sacrificing his VW, I got rekt when I tried to kill the VW first, and he would at times resist my intercept shocks on his fears. 
---
Warlock is a class you pick if you want to have control, just like the Mage. Demonology is nothing for me but I can see why people love it. It’s a great damn class.
---
im not your friend pal!
---
i said 1-30 didnt i? Maybe hard to read for u, since when does warrior wear plate pre40?
---
Huh, that's interesting. Thanks for the info. Seems like a strange feature to have for such a short period of game play.
---
Of course you're going to mail shit to an alt, that doesn't change anything. Your bags are gonna be full every time you go out to quest. Bags are full without gathering professions, but especially with 2 of them.
---
well cool for the forsaken, but the point was never disputable.
---
Depends on what you mean by more efficient. It's more efficient to get to 60, yes, but is it more efficient to get raid ready to start farming pre-raid bis in your 50's so you can already be on your way to being attuned and geared by the time you hit 60? Once you hit 60, you start farming pre-raid BiS anyway, so instead of farming gear while also gaining experience, you gain all the experience first and then get geared as two separate activities which one could argue could take more time overall.
---
Think of it this way, activity one takes 100 hours. Activity 2 takes 300 hours.
---
Would you rather do both separately and take 400 hours to do overall, or have the first activity take 150 hours, but being able to multitask both together, so you start your 300 hours at the beginning as well, taking only 300-350 hours to do both.
---
that was a rough estimation, ill just say i did way more corpseruns on warrior in the early levels then on rogue hence the slow weapon and the bad hit%
---
It’s not that it’s necessarily bad, it’s just not as good leveling as almost everyone else. It’s more intensive trading autos with hamstring which you can’t always do, you can’t really fight mobs higher level because your misses/parry are so much more important.
---
Warrior isn’t awful, it’s just that pretty much every other class in the game has a better time leveling.
---
is this murdoch murdoch? lol.
---
Didn't you just say it wasnt about the pre raid BiS in the previous comment lol

i hope you have a lovely day stranger

There are so many ways this is wrong it's insane. You do realise what they had to do to get 1.12.1 working on the new hardware, right?
---
Thanks! Send us a ModMail when you get your list fine-tuned a bit more and we can probably find a way to incorporate it into the r/classicwow Wiki, or on the Discord.
---
That's a battlestation? I don't see any poopsocks.
---
And even then...they should just go resto.  This has all been min maxed and theorycrafted to death, there is no point to wasting a dps slot on an enh shaman, nothing justifies it.  I mean people will do it, because who cares, but no guild or raid is ever going to specifically want it, something else is always better.
---
Dwarf priest bud
---
I'd genuinely rather have a warrior using nightfall with an enhancement just trying his hardest to do damage since the debuff uptime is much better.
---
Send COD paper wrapped junk to level 60's.
---
*twitches in shadow priest about nef mace*
---
Also, the nef mace, lokamir romanthis, actually is bis for resto shamans at that point.
---
So, you need 180 hold a day?  Good luck
---
I started playing in 06 so what's your point? It doesn't make anything I said any less relevant. Everything I said was in reference to, and holds true for vanilla. People will be playing Enhancement shaman, and you'll be raiding with them. Go ahead and complain about that to the raid leader and see which one of you gets kicked.
---
I am beyond stoked to play classic at 144hz. It's going to be beautiful and so smooth. There's no reason to play sub par setting if you have the option to play higher fps/Hz.
---
I don't think int improves +spell damage or +healing in Vanilla.  It does improve crit by a small amount though.
---
Pat Nagle, the low budget rip off Nat Pagle.
---
Doesn't mail auto delete after a while?
---
This is all wrong. The real way to play enhance is go into a bg and press stormstrike on an ally priest, if you get good flurry procs and they die you screenshot your big numbers, if they don’t die you ghost wolf away and try again in 20 seconds.
---
This is why as a naxx raider in pserved I had a frost resistant set. I did 0 damage but rogues can kill people naked so as long as I resist the slowes to reinniate a stunlock I win!
---
Best part of WoD was the cinematic. Downhill after that

undead is better by miles. life tap to full mana then cannibalize to full HP. also WOTF is actually OP as hell in PVP and noteworthy in PvE.

Its 1am and I should sleep. But Im rewatching superjail now, thanks to this

My gf of 7 years has her birthday 2 days after launch. I already told her we can celebrate it a few days early or a couple of weeks later... Wondering how much longer she'll stick around 🤪

RESTO SHAMAN OR HOLY PRIEST:
---
Please tell me everything you know about these classes.  I was leaning towards resto shaman since Ive never done that in Vanilla before.  But Priest is really really strong.
---
There are no "shit rogues and hunters" in what will be the best guilds.  Guess what else they won't have...enhancement shamans.
---
Well Robes of the Exalted from Baron Rivendare is better than Red Dragonscale Breastplate and T2 chest. Many paladins also go for Robe of Volatile Power because of the crit. Guardian Saint is really strong but you'll have to compete with priests and druids. 
---
Paladins and dps warriors really have a fashion crisis in vanilla. The fury set is completely random and a paladin with Guardian Saint and Don Rigoberto's looks like a cross-dresser with a hat.
---
Or the original client/server source code finally gets leaked onto the internet and the game is actually preserved instead of this pissant Legion client dog shit.
---
This. If the mage is good you will never get close to him after the first shot. He'll trinket&gt;blink&gt;Blizzard&gt;Fireblast&gt;Arcane missiles&gt;CoC&gt;frost nova&gt;blink&gt;Fireblast&gt;Blizzard.....well you get the point
---
A bad hunter is worthless, but a good hunter I’ll invite to anything. And most hunters are bad because it has the lowest skill floor and highest skill ceiling. A huge gap so putting hunters in one group isn’t accurate.

if you don't want to spend that much, you can also go on ikea and mix/match a tabletop with legs of your choice and can get a simple large space desk for around $50.

&gt; **Why I’m Hyped**   
---
&gt; Don’t even know why
---
Never write a book.
---
They didn't make anyone pay to beta test the game, they just only offer it to people with current wow subscriptions. Those are two very different things. I don't necessarily agree with it, but it isn't helping anyone to be misleading about it.
---
Weird, because giving their actual customers things like a chance at beta and stress test access seems like a bonus for their customers.
---
At the same time they also warned people not to subscribe for beta because they probably wouldn’t get in. I don’t think they made anyone pay, I think some people made poor decisions and paid against Blizzard’s advice and now are upset and can’t accept responsibility for their actions. But you know I guess however you want to phrase it is fine.
---
Don't do this. Wow classic will be there when you get back. Maintain that relationship bro.
---
Making pre-raid BiS blacksmithing gear.
---
Right, it's **suboptimal**. If you're trying to be a cutting edge guild there is no reason to bring an enhancement shaman. Everyone knows this.
---
You can still play it and get invited to raids if you can handle pissing against the wind all the time and still keep going for virtually zero reward. I tried it, went fine but obviously wasn't worth it in the end. 
---
Going to feel nice being a healer this time around as everyone and their daughter will want you.
---
If you like farming gnomer I guess?
---
I highly recommend taking it easy on hours played up until the first counciling session. The last thing you need is for your hobbie to become ammunition as to why things arent ideal.
---
Best of luck my friend.
---
That's why we keep the toxic chat to discord server chat
---
i see where your coming from but afaik the WoW specific warlock is pretty unique. of course you have the classic "dark mage" that dabbles in "dark locked away magic" but thats usually because its dangerous or uses something like blood or some other "banned" school by the rest of the general mage populace. 
---
then you have the typical "necromancer" type that summons undead stuff to fight for him while plaguing his enemies.
---
WoW warlock is pretty unique in that he summons demons instead of raising the dead, and he uses fire/actual shadow instead of like blood magic(yes i know lifetap) or other "banned" schools of magic. 
---
i kinda like how later on in WoW they made warlocks more felfire influenced (if they chose) or more focused on demon summoning or more of an affliction curse-disease monster. 
---
of course vanilla warlocks take a lot of classic tropes from other fantasy stuff in terms of a "dark caster" but off top i cant think of it coming close to 1 for 1 copying another universe or idea or anything
---
Ahh gotcha. I honestly completely forgot about the attunements in TBC other than SSC and TK. Raiding at the time meant the new ones were pretty much automatic but I can see how that would make catch up a bit more involved. I didn't know they dropped them entirely in Wrath. Thanks!
---
Never forget that not everyone raids the same time every week every time. There will be times when items drop and people don’t want to spend dkp or they already have the items.
---
It’s a time and exposure game. Raid early, raid often and you’ll get there. As a Druid, I know the pain you feel, but I made it, and if I can, so can you.
---
The amount of pushing for meme specs on this sub is concerning.  Everyone trying to justify boomkins and rets and enh or ele shamans etc etc for raids...just stop lol.  We have all the numbers, the game has been theorycrafted to death and perfected over 15 years.  There really is no excuse for walking into classic and trying to raid as these specs, we know what every class should raid as.  Please, just roll a class that does the role you want to play well and save us all the time of telling you "no".
---
Yeah, I was kind of half-joking 🤣 I'll look for an agreement that can work for both of us!
---
F u I like pandas
---
"Murder" is such a harsh interpretation. I like to think of it as a community response to irresponsible littering.
---
Oh no! The game company is communicating exactly as much as they have been for the past two years! Time to panic!
---
pffft mages are like the warlock little brother
---
city teleport? try my fucking SUMMON TO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BRO

oh you have a cool ice shield? LEMME SACRIFICE MY DEMON FOR A BETTER ONE

oh you can magically summon food and water? shame you dont have A STONE TO HEAL YOU AND A STONE TO FUCKING REVIVE YOU FREE WHEN YOU DIE

oh you have polymorph? shame that ANY DAMAGE BREAKS THAT SHIT OH YEAH FEAR OP BABY

sorry mages are cool but i'm passionate about how \*cool\* warlocks are if you couldn't tell.

Oh wow...that was amazing

BIG NEWS: Blizzard removes layering completely!

15s later on twitter by user "noblizzshard": "great! also: 1st!

17s later on twitter by user "donottrustivision": "ActiBlizzion tries to ruin the launch! They want classic to fail, to push retail!!!11"

20s later on twitter by user "blowmyblah": "This is clearly streamer influence. First beta only for streamers, now this. Whats next? Early access to streamers? Wait they already practising! #openbeta #notmystreamer"
---
I don't
---
But if every healing paladin in your raid was ret, every healing priest was shadow, every warlock was SL spec, every druid was boomkin....  At a certain point it adds up and you can't progress.  So the question is, do you want to be one of the people being carried or doing the carrying.
---
Gameplay and mechanically wise, MoP was the best xpac of all.
---
Guild List Updated
---
idk man. demon armor gives a dece amount of armor, warlocks having a bunch more stam naturally from base/gear/blood pact and afflic has a ton of self heal. i can see how mostly pure destro locks are pretty squish though.
---
I might try out SL in a later patch when I can get access to some really good gear, but probably not early on in classic since the damage will be too lack luster.
---
How is what he said wrong?  Why is this sub obsessed with pushing meme specs?  We literally know what every class and spec can do when it comes to raiding, it has all been theorycrafted and played out over 15 years.
---
Noice
---
After the ban I was expecting an ending similar to the Darkest Dungeon Intro! :D
---
I lost a 5 year relationship to WoW. Sorry if I came off strong.
---
eh in terms of shitty QOL stuff vanilla had, filling your bags with soul shards wasnt a big issue really unless you had to get like 30+ for a MC raid that night, and at that point you should have big enough bags/your other random shit in the bank that it wouldnt matter.
---
Sorry to hear dude. Hope it worked/works out ❤
---
i mained hunter in vanilla and never knew this lol
---
Except that isn't realistic for gearing purposes, or else yes, some guilds would do exactly that.  The line is drawn at the meme hybrid dps specs though, pointless to even waste gear on them.
---
that 5% pet damage is nothing, and for PvP the stun resist isnt dick compared to WOTF
---
UD all around better locks in vanilla
---
Psh if you are a good puller, it will be apparent to all.
---
Getting exalted won't happen till well after 60.
---
Life is great now.
---
U really need ur pets in pvp
---
To some European? We got countries over here you know 44 to be exact. Sounds fucking rasist and ignorant to me.
---
or imp if you wont be running void that much
---
i plan on mostly running imp unless i need to kill an elite or something but ill keep VW/imp skills maxed
---
&gt;My favorite thing to do was use Unending Breath in Southshore, swim out to the ocean, then just send waves of imps after people questing for Murlocs. That guy got me so many HKs!
---
oh my god thats great
---
Be quick about your business!
---
Yeah. Anyone bad at their class is a detriment.  That's  pretty well known.
---
It will be pretty simple man.  The serious guilds won't want you to play that, the casual guilds won't care, act accordingly and play with who you want to play with.
---
You will not go crazy, madseason has such a calming voice... Embrace Madseasones EMBRACE!
---
Agreed, they ended up being enjoyable NPCs in a great xpack with awesome zones, in a game with gnomes and cow people and whatever else I don't really think of them as more of a joke than usual.
---
No they don't.  And if that were the case isn't it better for the US to spend money on education and healthcare rather than the military?
---
i mean even if you pull off aggro its not like a warlock has any lack of tankiness/self healing to negate a few mob hits
---
Level in night elf zones, turn in cloth at 60, buy the mount.
---
Except for the part where the alliance were deceitful pricks to the blood elves and sylvanas sent actual aid when they needed it.
---
Decide on a specific customization ahead of time. When the servers open, remember the combinations (3 for skin color, 4 for face etc.) and then quickly pick your name. That'll save you the trouble.
---
just keep imp and VW up to date, ez pz. you dont need or want anything else while leveling (unless you're mr moneybags and plan to take time off to PvP then you might wanna pick up succ or felhunter and their books)
---
Take a look at any of the private server bug trackers if you truly believe this.
---
You're screwed dawg. Need that Goodwill cloth donations.
---
gottem gg ez no re get fukt nerd
---
That’s just the madholm syndrome talking.
---
Yes there is... I have found multiple pieces of shadow wrath/natures death and arcade death greens. I have multiple 40s on beta.
---
If you don't have excessive amounts of shamans, having ench shaman can be better than any other alternative. Yeah it might be better to replace them with resto shamans but that doesn't make them waste of slot.
---
Hit random a couple times and go with it.  Roll the dice baby!
---
Back in vanilla, I was a no lifer who didn't earn  enough irl to make buying gold worthwhile. But now, I've got a great career and an hour's worth of pay will get me a lot more gold than I could ever grind in that time.
---
Personal attacks because I didn't like mists of pandaria?
---
&gt; The point of the other guy is that getting an item to sell it ultimately should be considered as greed and in a perfect world or one with sufficient etiquette you should all roll greed if you intend to sell (even if it is a personal upgrade).
---
I do not see how this is in any way a more perfect world than everyone rolling Need. Everyone rolling one thing, or everyone rolling the other, has exactly the same outcome.
---
The only difference is that if the etiquette is to all roll Greed, a scumbag can wait until everyone else has rolled and roll Need. That is a downside.
---
&gt; You also presume everyone will act in the way you would and auction of the item.
---
I think all loot rules assume on some level people aren't behaving totally irrationally. It is very hard verging on impossible to make rules that get optimal outcomes with irrational agents.
---
&gt; I for one often can't be bothered by it and if you need an item you can't or won't equip that I want to equip I'll consider you a ninja.
---
The issue is not your unsupported opinion, it's whether your opinion can be justified.
---
&gt;Old man yells at memes
---
If you fd while fighting mobs they'll then target the pet which leads to dead pet &amp; a loss of pet happiness. If you don't need to jump up immediately (ie your toddler tried copying your wow classic wall jumping irl and is about to fall of the fridge) then you are able to despawn your bud.
---
I can't remember the exact sequence but its something like stay, attack, passive while you run away from it and when it despawns you fd.
---
Mob tricks will always be pretty much the same so pve realms no worries. PvP there will always be a risk; shadowmeld is the same. Don't get me wrong shadowmeld and fd have some great synergy.
---
You can break fd with shadowmeld to get up without mobs aggroing if you screwed up and fd'd in an area that wasn't safe (more dungeon tech but still). Elf stealth also breaks after 1 or 2 mins so that's another consideration.
---
Which book is this? Are you enjoying the series so far? Another member of this sub recommended them to me and shared the chronological order. Thinking of checking it out after I finish reading Jurassic Park
---
Take a look at any big private server bug tracker if you don't believe me and a majority of those reported bugs will never be fixed because they can only apply band aid fixes and don't have access to the engine. There's bugs that have been reported for months and will never be fixed. Go ahead and keep thinking private servers are bug free places.. You obviously haven't played on them.
---
Yeah I see nothing wrong with this. It's not for you, you got to try it and found out it was not going to be for you! That's all. I have been on p servers getting used to the quests and planning possible questing routes. Even after multiple runs 1-30 I still am beyond stoked for launch. Everyone's different though, go play a different game if you're not feeling wow!
---
If you are being corpse camped by a skull levelled player that means, that u are already too late to the party. Just disconnect for 10 minutes, make a coffee and read the news meanwhile.

Everyone has skinning and everyone is skinning in the beginning. AH price will be very close to vendor price.

scheeh, it seems you love'a'lot of comments, sir! ;

Farming, no matter how, always felt downright insulting ever since becoming an adult with an actual RL job. The idea of wasting X amount of hours to farm gold feels ridiculous - when you can just buy gold with real-life money for a much higher rate of gold/hour. But I guess that's a copout. 
---
I always enjoyed playing the AH though. It's an entire mini-game on its own, and just like in our real world economy it scales - the more you have, the more you'll make. I did this on several private realms, and back in retail too (except it required two accounts back then.) The AH is a literal gold mine when you know what to look for.
---
My goto strategy in Vanilla is buying and reselling items cross-faction. Items like Arcane Crystals, Righteous Orbs, Large Brilliant Shards, Pristine Black Diamonds, etc. are always in demand, and sell quickly. And since you can transfer items at no fee by selling for 1 copper to yourself at the neutral AH, the biggest challenge becomes balancing your purse between the two factions to ensure you have gold available when a bargain appears, and avoiding amassing gold on the "expensive" faction.
---
The idea is basically: plant one Horde char at neutral AH, one in capital - and one Alliance char at neutral AH, one in capital. Since mail is instant between characters on the same account, you're looking to buy items on one side, mail them to your neutral traders, transfer, and sell at a profit on the opposing faction. As long as you have some starting capital, this method can earn you several % per item, and doesn't require significant time investment, depending on your ambition. 
---
It takes some time to learn what commodities are good to work with. Generally, I'm looking for a few key factors: 1) liquidity - items need to sell fast and consistently, 2) volatility - items need to vary in price, ideally to the point where people aren't even sure what a reasonable price is, 3) accessibility - items should ideally be difficult to obtain, so you're not getting undercut all the time or competing with too many other sellers, and 4) value - making a few silver per item is great starting off, but eventually you're going to want to utilize the more expensive items.
---
ZG patch was an absolute goldmine: Souldarite, bat leather, Powerful Mojo, and especially Bloodvine, fits just about every criteria, and were highly sought-after thanks to being components of many good craftables for raiding (meaning there's a consistent flow of demand from newly dinged 60's). It also had Bijous. Some of the idols in the AQ patch were great too.
---
For the start of Classic though, these items won't exist and I'm looking forward to building a business model around whatever the "meta" is in this content patch. Arcane Crystals, Fiery and Lava Cores are alright, but before that I'm thinking certain recipes (Free Action comes to mind), Aquamarines, Small Radiant Shards, certain herbs and Truesilver could have potential. 
---
Generally this method has worked very well for me though. Exponential growth is just so much more rewarding than the linear growth you get from farming.
---
I only have Vanilla, TBC and Wrath in physical form. I did have Cataclysm in physical form but forgot it in England, when I moved back home :'( I started buying them digitally when Pandaria came out. - I was lucky enough that all of my copies had a plastic wrapper around them where those damned stickers were placed, no damage too the boxes :'D The stickers by the way are showing the danish currency DKK (danish kroner)  ;')
---
thats an end game goal
---
&gt;  if you don't agree you aren't up to date or watched too much Tipsout.
---
I'm well aware and I feel like it's the one thing that ruined it all. It wasnt a huge thing in vanilla, but towards the end of tbc it made a huge impact.
---
Soda is an entitled cuck, fuck him
---
Ok so what are the negatives?
---
Dumpy looking things.  They make me laugh.
---
I guessed I didn’t explain it correctly. 
---
So imagine you have a scale 1-100 and 1 is noob hunter that does EVERYTHINNG WRONG and 100 is pro hunter.
---
To be acceptable as a hunter I’d say you have to be 60 if this was a mage. I’d say acceptable would be a 20-30 it isn’t hard to fuck up frostbolt spamming.
---
Hunters have pets which have growl on auto. Most bad hunters leave this on and then get mad when tank can’t hold aggro. Also hunters can clip their auto shots which is like 50% of their dps. On top of kiting during raids/macros needed to be viable on other situations like in pvp.
---
Hunters just have more than can go wrong. And the class is attracting for beginners. To be a good hunter you have to go from like 10-20 where most bad hunters lie to a long pilgrimage on google to do research and apply it to reach 60
---
why are you refreshing windfury at 9 seconds in
---
Why would anybody play an enhance sham in classic? LOL/.
---
Can confirm, i just finished reading it the other day.
---
Or, friend another enchanter and agree to enchant each other's alts if you provide mats.
---
&gt; The system you use should be in accordance with the goal. Every player I know, enters the dungeon to get better gear. I've never come across someone that says "I'm just here to ensure no one ninjas loot."
---
I think this is simply false. When I enter an instance I want better gear, I want xp, I usually want to complete quests and I wouldn't mind sweet drops to sell either. You cannot assume everyone has one and only one goal, that being better gear and nothing else.
---
&gt; The best system for ensuring you get better gear is to "need on shit you need and greed on the rest."
---
I think this is not true because the value of a BoE is fungible. If a BoE worth 50g drops and you get it and you can equip it you get the value immediately, and if someone else gets it and sells it and buys upgrades they get the value later, but either way someone gets 50g.
---
Giving that BoE blue to someone in the party doesn't maximise overall good outcomes because the expected outcomes are the same whoever gets it. Only with BoPs do you maximise the good outcome by giving it to someone who will equip it for a while before they sell/shard it.
---
This is a repost. 
---
I know because I used the original, made months ago, to help me learn about enhancement Shaman in raiding.
---
I like how "Account Status" in German is "Accountstatus"
---
Just buy invis potions and never get corpse camped again
---
We already know everything as we walk into classic, so why would anyone roll a shaman to play enh?  If you want to melee dps just roll a rogue or warrior.  If you want to heal and be highly in demand, roll a shaman.  I don't get why you purposely want to do something we know is bad before we even launch the game.
---
&gt; city teleport? try my fucking SUMMON TO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BRO
---
Got to go there first to summon people, kind of sucks. 
---
&gt;oh you have a cool ice shield? LEMME SACRIFICE MY DEMON FOR A BETTER ONE
---
We also have a mana shield. And a completely impenetrable block of ice. And fire + frost absorbs. And a bunch of defensive buffs. 
---
&gt;oh you can magically summon food and water? shame you dont have A STONE TO HEAL YOU AND A STONE TO FUCKING REVIVE YOU FREE WHEN YOU DIE
---
We have a stone restoring our mana. Who needs health and soulstones anyway if the enemy can't get to you?
---
&gt;oh you have polymorph? shame that ANY DAMAGE BREAKS THAT SHIT OH YEAH FEAR OP BABY
---
Who needs fears when you can just slow and freeze people so they can't reach you, and if they somehow gets to you, you can just blink away. How are you doing with movement abilities, locks?
---
And how does it feel having your most important buff bound to a specific pet, instead of being just a normal cast?
---
And have you seen our lovely little spell called "counterspell". Doesn't that look nice?
---
no way, just contact your guild enchanter
---
Warcraft Chronicle Volume 1
---
 Yes it’s a good read. It’s a very basic historical overview of the WoW universe. Ends just before the dark portal.
---
Exactly. No top end guild is going to run enh in their raid comp. . .
---
Just logically speaking (not suggesting anyone does this) but 15$ / month would buy a pretty decent amount of gold, enough to pay another enchanter to put the enchant on. After all you are only having to tip said enchanter as the mats arent souldbound to your enchanter. I do not think its worth 15$ a month just to put some enchants on your own gear
---
Gladiator rogue here, for what its worth. I dueled a few mages on a private 60 server and had some success. I was playing daggers specced into improved ambush + backstab. 
---
1. Open before an energy tick with Ambush -&gt; Backstab. This should break their ice barrier and get them to \~75% hp.
---
2. Vanish their first nova (be careful of blizzard and other aoe)
---
3. Sap their first aid/eating, wait until full energy
---
4. Ambush +  Backstab again
---
5. Improved sprint second nova
---
6. 5pt Eviscerate (with cold blood if you have it)
---
At this point they're probably dead. Sometimes they'll live though, depending on gear or if they did something like a cold snap + re ice barrier, in which case you just blind or prep vanish. The good thing about ambush spec is that iceblock is essentially useless  because the damage is instant and upfront (You can't preblock an ambush unless you're literally Jesus). If they ever block just stand next to them and blind when they come out. If they ever blink then just kidney shot pop a thistle and 2 shot them.   
---
Obviously its not always this linear, but it pretty much boils down to blowing your energy bar on an ambush + backstab, and then resetting via vanish or blind. With prep you should always win imo.
---
Pala is among the worst leveling classes. Not sure where you got that idea.
---

---
EMBRACE! \*giggle\*
---
I instantly got anxiety looking at this picture.
---
Oh, very occams razor but I guess that makes sense. Cheers man
---
Shaman is more fun. Faster and more proactive
---
Negatives are that if you work full time, have children and can play for two hours and want to run that dungeon to get that sword you truly want to improve your dps by a lot...
---
You might get into a WPvP fight, sometimes with people 10 levels higher than you and that's something you should expect when choosing PvP/PvE server.
---
If you're fine with that, hey PvP is for you.
---
If you have 2-3 hours of playtime and truly want to get that shit done, BRD or whatever, yeah give it a second thought.
---
The problem is you can't know for certain where the skin color starts. When you click on say Dwarf female rogue, it will be different than if I clicked on Dwarf female rogue. They are initially randomized and you have no way of knowing where you are in the rotation to know how many times to hit the arrow and change skin color.
---
Was that an April fool's joke? I feel like that's something a lot of people want and isn't a good joke.
---
That's the point, people who no life or have endless time for WoW will be able to do that to you and you can't answer back because I have a job and a life.
---
Therefore if 2 rogues camp me for 2 hours, there's nothing I can do but log off or switch zones.
---
Not everyone can play WoW 16h a day here mate!
---
just running for example another warrior in that slot instead nets you more damage than the imp windfurry does tho.
---
They are probably still parsing public opinion so they don't screw everything up.
---
The dps increase the raid would gain from imp windfury is less than if they just put another warrior in that spot.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLDnPiXyME0
---
&gt;people realize how overtuned raid bosses were on private servers.
---
Bosses on private servers have 5% parry. Classic WoW will have 14% parry. Private servers are extremely buggy and have wrong numbers. I wouldn't be surprised if raids are harder on Classic than they are on private servers.
---
I almost subbed again. Almost. Clicked it off and kept it moving. I'll do a 1 month sub in August and make m determination from there. Until then FF14 all day.
---
Doing new things. Maybe someone wants to pvp as shaman. Maybe someone likes being the underdog and making up for it. I am sure you could think of multiple reasons yourself. 
---
You don't have to be optimal about everything. People do self imposed challenge runs in various games.  Why would anyone play rpg on very hard difficulty when you know that its easier to play on very easy?
---
I said it wasn't about getting your pre-raid bis *by 60.* which means getting your pre-raid bis by level 60 isnt the goal, but getting as much done to get your pre-raid bis before 60 will lower the amount of time you have to farm it at 60.
---
Well no, because you don't spend 18 levels leading up to them.
---
The human starting zone is unique in terms of its story-driven approach. None of the other zones do that because the developers literally ran out of time.
---
And by the way, I agree that DM is more logical, but I'm just explaining why people called it VC even before Dire Maul was released.
---
I caved and joined a private server. I'm having a fucking blast but trying not to overdo it
---
He didn’t make it
---
Level 1, head to Darnassus.  Stick to leveling in Night Elf quest hubs.  You may be able to hit exalted, but you need to do all available quests that give darnassus rep before the quest level gets 6 levels below your current level and you start taking a rep reward hit.
---
Some classes like mage don’t use the pve sets for raiding either. The issue with dps pal really is with the class itself. It’s a hybrid. It’s pretty good in pvp because of that, but not as a pure dps machine.
---
You don't get it.
---
gnome warrior called Gnommash
---
How much success do you usually have dodging blizzard after first vanish?
---
Why turn in cloth at 60? You can do it at 40
---
Yeah but i think many of them will be very tempted because of less p-server drama and quality and stuff and so on.
---
Sure, it costs a fee but not that big. And (hopefully) quality! (Otherwise march to Activsion HQ and burn it to the ground.\*Fingersign EXCLAMATION MARK\*)
---
I’m picturing a ret pally just riding his armoured horse through infinite blackness, getting more and more frustrated and confused, but refusing to be afraid, calling out things like “Show yourself, mysterious demon!” And “Face me or forever be stamped a coward, fiend!”
---
For some reason he has Daniel Radcliffe’s face.
---
you finally got that epic you wanted now that “she” isn’t bothering you, nice
---
I'm well aware and I feel like it's the one thing that ruined it all. It wasnt a huge thing in vanilla, but towards the end of tbc it made a huge impact. 
---
It's not a high horse man, it makes good sense :)
---
Just carry some invisibility potions and you can't really be camped.
---
Back in the days i did this with my dwarf. I think, i made it in the mid-40s.
---
There was a site that showed you which quests and areas gave you reputation for each race (Stonetalon and Desolace for example). Don't forget, there are quests that give you reps for the whole fraction, to do as well. 
---
So, it is possible getting your Mount before 60.
---
Even enh shaman pvp is bad.  ele is the god mode pvp spec.  This isn't a game to gimp yourself when 39 other people are relying on you.  Sure, do whatever gimped shit you want in a single player game, who cares.  I don't understand players who want to purposely not carry their weight in a raid, but whatever man, you do you.
---
Thanks for trusting me with this. Would be sweet to have it in the wiki. Will do!
---
There’s a lot of other stuff you can do for 180 bucks a year
---
Nerding out on consumables was, for a time, considered a joke. The first few raids featuring kills where consumables were heavily utilized were laughed at on tge forums. Of course, the strat was quickly adopted, though.
---
My point is, until you get to the level where every edge matters, farming is pretty light. 
---
You're not losing out on content if you pass on logging in today to farm. Tomorrow's Sunday, you might have way more time to chill and enjoy farming. With WQs, you need to at least see which are up. And if you miss out on some dailies, you don't just get another chance. There is no catchup, you simply missed out on the opportunity.
---
Also, on the topic of comparing farming/buying consumables to live, people keep saying Live has such a lower barrier.
---
Let me just grind my islands for the week for my neck, do my +10, do LFG/LFR for runes, farm for potions, farm for scrolls, farm for flasks, farm for feasts.
---
Just because most casuals bum their flasks and food from the cauldrons &amp; feasts actually decent people farm up, and don't bother with any other consumables doesn't compare. You didn't need consumables for MC either, which was the casual raiding content by the time consumables was the meta.
---
Me too I’ve been leveling a warlock for the last few days and I just hit 24. It’s practice for actual classic lol
---
Just reserve the character name and worry about the looks later.
---
Greetings from Iraq
---
Yea now cuz u cant rppvp on modern wow. They should at least have 1 server.
---
But that shouldn't dissuade people from being a hunter.  Hunters aren't worthless, in fact, they're extremely beneficial and in some cases even necessary.  Sure they're not as face roll as another class. But the guy I responded to was saying it was too bad he wasnt gonna get into groups because hunters were worthless, which is 100% not the case.
---
But you can just go on wowhead classic dressing room right now and make your guy, even print it out in colour if you want for quick matching!
---
So what you are saying is that on a pvp server pvp can happen?
---
isn't it easier to find a vendor than a mailbox? And aren't there always some kind of vendor where there are mailboxes?
---
No explanation needed.  He said it harshly but it is still true, playing anything but resto as a shaman in a raid is purposely gimping yourself and not carrying your weight.
---
Pre 40 is still mail vs leather so STILL a huge advantage, dumbass. Also 1-30 doesn't fucking matter. Literally nobody cares what the fastest of slowest 1-30 class is. 1-60 is all that matters, and warrior are without a doubt better than rogues in this regard. And you know you lost a fight when you're trying to grasp at technicalities. And BY THE WAY you didn't specify that the discussion was ONLY about 1-30, which would have been your only way of saving yourself. You also can't just add a tiny little 4 character bit in your post to completely shift the discussion. This is about ONE TO SIXTY. Basically, get fucked, bitch.
---
Typically when a fresh server launches I roll a hunter first because they are the best to make gold with. But I'm used to DM being available at launch. So I may just roll a Warrior when classic comes out and make a hunter for gold farming later on.
---
Though I guess I could always just sell Princess runs.
---
Hahaha.
---
What are you saying makes combat dagger good at pvp? Ambush? It’s not great if you don’t spec it. Really both are pretty bad at pvp. And both are amazing at pve, and again, on par. I’ve played both extensively and reallt, the difference is gonna be on your end and on the preparation you put in.
---
That would without doubt be a momentary lapse of reason
---
Yeah I mean if I wanted to watch Netflix that would be a great strat but I want to play classic wow and there’s some good pvp to be had fighting over lotus
---
And cut a healer? Yeah obviously
---
Yeah that’s right my mistake
---
What’s different this time?
---
you're welcome
---
Yep. Pretty much.
---
And PvP also includes a guy 20 lvls higher than you killing you over and over, or a group of the enemy faction not allowing you to do WC after you traveled for an hour to get there.
---
I doubt you've ever actually enjoyed a game.
---
If I remember correctly, if char A mails it to char B, it will sit in their mailbox for 30 days. After those 30 days, it gets forwarded back to char A where it'll sit for another 30 days - at this point, it gets deleted.
---
Or just randomly crash your server after you dodged them initially. At least this is why I don't want xfers
---
No shaman either
---
humorously, pandas are truer to the lore than most of WoW's additions, like putting Blood Elves on the horde.
---
[sixtyupgrades.com](https://sixtyupgrades.com) and create your own gearscore system with preference for spell damage and stamina.
---
25% stun resist is a lot. I killed a lvl 12 pally on a private server as a lvl 7 because I resisted his stun twice.
---
They've already said they never intended for people to use all the buffs and trivialize and outright break raid mechanics. 
---
Sorry kiddo, but that shit won't fly.   They're not going to allow that in classic.  The change that makes the most sense is to just not let them stack.
---
Confirmed, story at 11.
---
I was trying to explain that when people look at the class they look at what the worst playing this class can do. If I’m inviting a random hunter I’m going to quiz him to make sure he knows what to do. But if it is someone I know I’ll let them play.
---
Inviting random hunters to your group is asking for a disaster to happen.
---
Chen is from an Easter egg level in wc3 as well
---
Wow really? I never knew a pvp server had any sort of risk involved of pvp occuring. Thanks for the info guy
---
Arguably +5 axes is worth far more.  The problem is that there aren't that many good 1h axes.
---
Depends on your class- there are a lot of class discords available and most are fairly active with PvPers if you know where to look.
---
There's also guide sites- I'm writing guides / making more videos and I work with Classicwow.live so you might be able to find something there no matter what your class is.
---
But I think the best move is to find a friend who knows a lot about PvP and ask whatever questions you might have- if you ever have any questions PM me here and I can give you my discord info so I can help you with whatever info I can share :)
---
Nothing is different from back then either. Not everybody playing vanilla wow was no-lifing it then.
---
Welcome to the life of a video game that doesn't hold your hand.
---
I'm planning on being broke because of professions, skills, and random outbursts of generosity and all that. Besides I want the full vanilla experience and I was broke then too.
---
The manuals created more hype than any other thing we have today
---
By exploiting the stupidity of people selling items on the AH for less than their vendor value. Works fine on private servers so with the influx of people who haven't played for many years I should do well.
---
It's not even my first time. I played the original right after release, I just feel so out of the loop because its been SO long. I will start the search for my first characters class with these suggestions, thanks!
---
Crazy Bernie could be a gnome head
---
Had to check and you’re right, the 45 second shared CD was added in 3.3, my mistake!
---
Spotted the Alliance player
---
Only way to get bad data.
---
I love Kompositas
---
The whole thing about this pic is that lore wise BFA’s whole story and plot is nearly identical to MOP’s plot. With the whole horde warcheif becoming the big bad and the factions putting aside their differences to kill them.
---
Don't hate because I'm pretty
---
Good players are gonna kill your succ if they get the chance. You probably won't get a re-summon off without master summoner and fel dom. I'd go for something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZbxhuRZxx0tMLtt
---
(Obviously points are movable and I'm not sure if fel stamina is just better than imped succ. I don't think the extra duration is required. Maybe it helps with DRd seduces, idk.
---
To be honest I turned it off after I heard “HAIII”....already annoyed
---
You make it sound like this is news somehow? Anyway, I have played emulated vanilla on 10k+ peak pvp servers and never had any serious problems. Maybe got ganked now and then but never worse than 2-3 ghost runs to enter any dungeon.
---
There’s no originality.
---
No he isnt. You could recruit him from the tavern. And his name was chen stormstout. He was also a part of founding of dorota quest alongside rexxar.
---
Same I tried to roll alliance for the first time and got my hunter to 25. After getting ganked in Lakeshire a few times and watching the alliance do nothing while I'm dying made me go back to horde real quick lol
---
Rogue\*. You might as well level skinning to 300 and swap to engineering at 60. You don't need engineering while levelling.
---
Plate only is not pre-raid BiS. Sorry.
---
Guess what else they won't have. You!
---
Don't know why people who are going to play on PvP servers get so defensive, I'm going PvP myself but these are good points.
---
Private server raids are 2-3 times harder than Classic will be. The bosses have way too much armor, they hit harder than they’re supposed to, and use their abilities far too often.
---
Because you won’t have that much gold at 40.
---
Yeah so many downvotes. I just wanted to give my opinion on playing on a PvP server.
---
I love PVP and world pvp and good, epic fights but when you roll on a pvp server you also deal, sometimes, with that dude who's bored for 2 hours.
---
Think of it as a relationship test.  If you guys can communicate and express your feelings in an honest matter ( I realize this sounds lame but just fucking do it, it works) during this life changing event (because it will change your life, even if it is temporarily), then it will forge your bond even deeper with each other.  
---
If the relationship doesn't survive the release of classic, then it is highly unlikely you would have had a successful marriage.  Silver lining: you dodged a massive financial bullet and years of regret.
---
Also, I've heard if you play horde in classic you have a small pee pee.
---
As a blacksmith in OG WoW I made hardly any money, and the Mithril/Thorium part is very expensive to get past. I think there are better profs if you only want gold
---
Strategy? You log in make any toon with a name you want and click the button. If it’s says not available you go to choice #2? 
---
When you want to create your real toon, create a dummy, to decide what appearance options you want. Delete your placeholder and insert your planned toon.
---
The likelihood of someone grabbing the name you want in the time it takes you to click a few cosmetic options is minuscule.
---
Sure, but that's not exclusive to hunter. That's good policy for any class.  I wouldn't discourage anyone to play hunter though because some people aren't good at a certain class.
---
They’ve already confirmed that they’re gonna keep it nochanges. Sorry but you’ve lost, obviously lmao.
---
I planned on following a similar path, but one of my friends mentioned my bags would be insanely flooded with shit (skins, stones, ores, gems, soul shards) which is making me reconsider.
---
Thanks for this.
---
Video is wrong.
---
I think it would take 4 full plate paladins to have the same +healing as 1 actual pre-raid BiS paladin.
---
Guide to playing enhancement shaman: You can’t.
---
Well, I already have a hardcore ally guild, so no, we won't have any shitters or shamans anyways.
---
&gt;I'm not telling you to roll PVE servers, I'm asking you to consider the pros and cons and make a choice.
---
Thanks chief. Without this post I never would've known that PvP happens on a PvP server. You really saved me.
---
Fuck pvp servers.
---
1. Let wife make night elf female
---
2. Show her goldshire
---
3. Give her wine (wake the slut up)

4. ???
---
5. profit
---
Windfury is not PPM. Any non-instant cast will reset your swing timer. I also would not recommend that point in parry going anywhere else as it is one of the most (if not the most) potent damage reduction effects any class can get for a single point.
---
You're likely to have well over 200 hours of gameplay before you even hit max level, should give you lots of time to really understand the game, zones, your class, your role, how certain gameplay mechanics work, etc etc.
---
Yes yes, we get it, min/maxing is not fun, got it bud.
---
&gt; good    
---
&gt;family
---
pick one
---
It was an April fools joke and they had fucking screenshots and everything. It's not in their archives...maybe it was someone else who did the joke.
---
Thanks for this, good walkthrough!
---
Why cant you rppvp on modern wow? RP has some of the bigger servers in the game.
---
If you think server transfers is what ruined Vanilla, you weren't paying very good attention.
---
Not having server transfers would be foolish. Which is why server transfers have been an option in every remotely successful MMO ever.  Because there are good reasons to server transfer, and it is a needed service.
---
Eh, it's fun in a different way. I'm leveling the characters I had maxed out in Legion, it's a bit of fun to see the new zones, new music, and to mess around with different specs, but the sheer faceroll nondifficulty of leveling gets old very very quickly.
---
Sounds dangerous, I'd rather fuck pve servers they are tame and submissive.
---
I don’t miss the lines the load time or the info Vienna was.
---
No normal person would ever consider playing on a pve server.
---
Yeah, no high end raiding guild will allow a full-plate holy pally in their raid. Like i've said in a previous post, I think it would take about 4 full-plate holy pally to equal 1 actual pre-raid BiS holy pally's +healing. It's just laughable. I'm sure you can do it but if you do it's probably in a guild full of people who have never played vanilla / pservers before. Who cares I guess.

cuz there is no pvp
---
Yeah from everything I have read/heard pallies basically just heal and that's it :b
---
Maybe 75%+? Blizzard isn't terribly hard to dodge. Most mages will blizzard slightly in front of where you last were, so I run at awkward angles as I vanish, sometimes backwards. You can also try blinding instead of vanishing if you're getting popped out a lot
---
&gt; There is only one reason to do a server transfer; beeing to lazy to make a new character.
---
Not sure if you are that ignorant, or just a lousy troll. Either way.. you sound dumb.
---
I really thought pandarians should have been the Alliance BC race. I only knew the Dranai from Warcraft 3 and they were an ugly all around terrible and insignificant race. Seemed weird to me that they got the spot. I do like the way they turned out but man... Blizzard pls.
---
??? Theres a ton of pvp, the WQ zones are all mixed together. I have more world pvp in retail than I did in private servers

Combat prep rogue wins because of 2 improved sprints and no mage expects it.
---
What are you talking about.. this isent true. Feign death, or void sac. Not to mention fear, if its bot immune
---
sorry, let me rephrase. you are correct, 25% stun resist is a lot. but stuns are only one of MANY types of CC you will run into in PvP. sure they are a fairly common one (especially as horde going against alliance). but its still an RNG gamble.
---
meanwhile WOTF removes charm, fear and sleep on a fairly low CD. the removal of fear alone is better imo because iirc the vanilla PvP trinkets couldnt remove fear....only thing that stopped fear was WOTF, resisting it or dwarf priest fear ward (please correct me if im wrong). plus a lot of classes have a fear mechanic (off top warriors, priest, warlock)
---
so basically it comes down to would you rather have a 25% RNG chance to resist stuns (which a lot of classes straight up dont have) or a 100% chance to get out of a potentially long ass fear that may or may not break at a point of damage that otherwise cant be broken
---
I’m going through the Beta completing nearly every single Alliance faction quest, including all Darnassus rep quests as well as quests that give spillover Darnassus rep, and I didn’t reach revered until level 33 (I’m level 36 now with 1,500/21,000 revered). Reaching exalted by 40 is not going to be possible. Doing all of those quests will certainly get you closer, so you won’t have to do as many turn-ins once you run out of quests.
---
Just farm the mats and give it to a guildy?
---
If you have money to burn sure.
---
I mean, if you have 2 hours of play time each day you're not gonna be doing many dungeons anyway. Even something like deadmines can take more than 2 hours between forming the group and a few wipes.
---
Drakova would like a few words with you.
---
??? ambush? no why would you spec ambush in combat daggers. Have you ever even played Combat daggers for any length of time or are you just speculating? For pvp its not ideal because you dont have x2 cooldowns with prep. It it is entirely doable, especially if you supplement with thistle tea, also being proactive raider and getting Renatakis charm of trickery, as well as having enough tier gear for the extra 10 energy. Not to mention engineering, faps, and anything else you would use on a regular basis pvping.
---
Gotcha thank you
---
Example... I play a mage and when I am up against more then 1 people, I set the one I want to CC as my focus(with a macro to do so while in combat efficiently). Now as I kill the main target, I can still interrupt the focus target and sheep them because they are my focus target so it makes things more efficient
---
People here have a hard one for pvp server. Fine for them but its going to suck for people that wanted to roll on pve but rolled on pvp because this is what /r/classicwow told them.
---
Most private servers have rep values wrong on quests. I believe the buffed rep rewards in early BC, maybe even 2.0, which is where most of these values come from.
---
The video is using private server reputation values which are wrong.
---
Ya that's fine. That's not what I was criticising at all. I'm saying they are having people pay to test a 15 year old game. 
---
I'm not saying "there aren't any bugs, they don't need to test it hur dur dur"
---
How did this get downvoted? It's true. This place is ridiculous.
---
GLADLY
---
I've looked up the three names I've chosen on the Armory and WarcraftRealms.
---
Name A has 103 "active" results and 106 historical results.
---
Name B has 75 "active" results and 124 historical results.
---
Name C has 12 "active" results (1 of them my own) and 43 historical results.
---
Even though Name C is the name I've been referred by since WotLK and across almost every other game, Name A will be my main, so I'll be grabbing that one first.
---
Though most of my guild agrees the East Coast isn't getting more than 1 PVP server, we have a plan to determine the realm choice early in case this is wrong and Blizzard hasn't given us realm names ahead of time.
---
I'll be ready at 6pm EDT August 12 or whenever the moment the name reservation begins.
---
I will create my 3 characters on my second account, only caring about faction, not race, class, or appearance. I might do the same for bank alts and others on my main account, but I don't really care.
---
After a few days, I'll login at some ungodly hour and on Main Account, choose the race, class, appearance I want, type in the name, then delete the character on my Alt Account and immediately create the character on my Main Account. Repeat twice more, then reserve 3 other names on my Alt Account.
---
Stahp. My hopes and dreams cannot cope.
---
Right... So if you want to beta test it, you have to pay a subscription. It's even worse than I described. You can't pay to test it. You pay to get a chance at testing it.
---
Only runecloth is repeatable, and requires level 50. Also, you will need a lot of runecloth. A lot a  lot.
---
You couldn't be more wrong
---
My guild back in the day let Shamans roll on clothie gear but had to pay a 50% DKP "cross-dressing fee".
---
We've been removing this question as a repost, or as a post that should go in Simple Question Sunday stickies. We don't have official minimum specifications yet, but, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/?) recently to try and answer this question.
---
For now all anyone can really say is that if you can run BFA, you can definitely run Classic. We're hoping for official system requirements very soon.
---
Did you play at release? It was a completely different game. Pets had no agro and died quickly so feign death would only result in a dead pet. Fear had a cool down and was expensive. Mana went fast and was near impossible to regen mid battle. You had to rest after every non-elite fight to restore mana.
---
What about blind? If the mage is close enough to CoC or nova than the rogue can blind them. You might say they block the blinds and that's fair but what if the rogue rocket helms after that
---
Thanks man, fixed my mentality (and math, not in this post) regarding the subject!
---
Pservers.
---
The beta is dead. They gave invited to a bunch of current retail partners and they didn't bother with it. The second any BFA content came out they abandoned it. Giving it to their "actual customers" was a bad move. 
---
My whole point was that their beta requires an active sub to play. If you get into the beta and you sub runs out, you can't keep playing till you re sub.
---
I’m saying ambush is not great if you don’t spec it, and since you don’t when playing combat dagger, I’m asking you’d say that combat dagger is better than sword in pvp when in reality they’re both largely inferior to any sub spec variant or even a seal fate spec. 
---
The +10 energy doesn’t really help when using a combo generator that costs 60 points. And energy comes back in ticks of 20. 
---
Thistle tea and zg trinkets sure help, but just as much as they help the other specs.
---
I really enjoyed their solution to this in BC I think? When pallys got a bit of mana every time they were healed.
---
And battlegrounds existed for far longer without cross-realm bgs than with them. So I guess cross realm bgs are a change. If you want to quantify simply by how long something existed in Vanilla, then apply that universally. Don't pick and choose.
---
But the question that should be asked is: what's best for Classic. And that would be not having dishonorable kills. What is their intent? To stop trolls from killing quest mobs over and over? Well, they didn't achieve that purpose since those trolls couldn't care less about their honor, because of the very nature of what they're doing and why. So you sacrifice city raids for absolutely no reason. Great mechanic.
---
This is the guy you're going to want to listen to on the subject. Unlike lazy "content" creators who just copy paste information from private server databases and consider it to be true without doing any real research, Shadow is doing actual research and theorycrafting on the best approach to city reputation in Classic.
---
Wow, you didn't mention me - how rude.
---
I'm EUs most wanted Bärchen.   
---
I'll play Classic WoW exclusively and fulltime.   
---
If you like German accents, good audio (invested a lot of time into gates and noisefilter and stuff) and a chill but really dedicated approach to WoW and gaming in general - I might be your cup of tea.
---
(twitch.tv/zircus)[www.twitch.tv/zircus]

(instagram.com/izircus)[https://www.instagram.com/izircus/]
---
I plan to release a couple of YouTube videos in the meantime. One of it will be something like 'how to prepare for classic wow AFK'.  
---
Your boy zircus (lawl)
---
Or when the tank pulls 5 mobs and you drop fire nova and one mob just randomly decides to kill it before it even attacks.
---
fel dom - conflag is a build tailored exclusively towards solo roaming World PVP and, to a lesser extent, duels.
---
the idea is that, as a warlock in wpvp, you can often be caught out with the "wrong" pet. this is especially a problem for destruction specs because the succubus is often favored, but felhunter and voidwalker are also critical tools. having fel dom means you will never be caught with your pants down when you have the unoptimal pet out. additionally, you will have voidwalker bubble, and can swap off of succubus after seduce/fear DRs.
---
the loss of affliction spells isn't ideal, particularly Imp Corr and Imp LT (the spec will have mana issues). however, corruption isn't necessary to win fights and actually can cause problems with Seduction (unlike CoA, which can be overwritten with CoT or CoE, and Immolate, which can be conflaged off).
---
it is vastly inferior to 7/7/37 and nf/conflag for BGs, but a lot of fun to play and will throw people off guard :D
---
Wait until lvl 40, then respec to ele. Otherwise you have a 3 second cast time on lighting bolt and leveling will suck.  You will need to have water on you though. I leveled one on [private server] and it really wasn't bad. Pretty decent in 5 mans too.
---
You won't top charts, but you're more consistent than enhance. Just remember, like any non-min/Max spec you need to have lots of consumables and the right gear if you're going to be scheduled into a serious raiding guild. 
---
Personally, I like elemental shammy. Decent for BGs and pretty fun overall.
---
Supply and Demand, none of these things even have the potential to happen if the supply of tanks is in check with the demand for them. Generally speaking demand outpaces supply and then tanks may choose to "increase their price" by reserving a righteous orb or piece of loot.
---
Thanks for the idea. I will head over to classicwow.live to check it out, where can I find the content you posted there?
---
Thanks so much! Looking forward to talking with you sometime! I dont even know what questions to ask right now. I have one friend who plays wow, but I dont know if he know what he is talking about, I've never seen him play the game. I'm going to try to find a guild when I start but I'd imagine it's just gonna be me fumbling through the game at first.
---
580+2400g
---
Another 15 bucks per month is hardly 'money to burn'.
---
its a promotional item from the lootboxes a few years back
---
I mean I dont wanna get into the semantics of whether a loose hunter got r1 on a smaller bg or not. It's not impossible I guess.
---
I was answering that comment as to what classes had a clear disadvantage throughout that expansion to help him pick something strong since that's what he stated was his preference, I think you'd find it hard to argue that hunters defintely were on the weaker side.
---
Having all that said. I got r1 back in bc in 2s and 3s, and finished every season at least in the top5 in 2s and 3s, playing mostly on bg9, ruin and nightfall. (Got r1s in all 3 over the years).
---
I don't think I've seen a single hunter in the ratings I was playing at throughout those entire expansions. Paladins were rare, and definitely on the weaker side too but they existed. Shamans, I think gc zilea and hoodrych got r1 s2 on bg9, which I remember thinking was an absurd feat of strength at the time. Other than that there were a couple that played somewhat high, but still nowhere near the strength of any of the good rmps or wlds.
---
Some people make things that are weak work, sure. There was a resto druid that got r1 in europe s5, when rdruids were at an all time weak point. And god I know how hard it was to play with one, I tried really hard and couldnt get r1 with 1 and had to do cheese strats every single match to even have a chance. 
---
But if the guy is planning on pvping and wants something strong. He definitely should not pick hunter. And he probably shouldn't pick paladin or shaman either, but who knows, play something you don't have to be the next Kollektiv to make it work.
---
I laughed way harder at this comment than I should have.
---
Paladins are BORING.
---
Boring doesn't = slow. I'll be punching Onyxia in the mouth before the 1st reset.
---
Warriors would like a word
---
Lol awesome, I too may be a pally snail
---
Thats one of the main reasons i like vanilla wow. It lets you advance at your own pace!
---
It’s a travesty that you haven’t framed it.
---
Paladins aren't even the slowest... Just boring AF.
---
Does Blind affect spells?
---
I'm waiting till 60 to join a guild, but I already have friends to play with while leveling. It might be smart to pick one in advance if you're more hardcore and planning on rushing to 60, but otherwise it shouldn't really make a difference if you wait.
---
It saves time for sure. $50 for about 1,000 gold is a pretty good deal. Saves you 10-20 hours depending on how fast or efficient your farming method is. 
---
The risk your taking is that all of your time becomes wasted if your account gets banned. And also all of the money you spent on sub fees and the RMT.
---
If you're standing around at midnight on the 26th you already missed the launch by hours since its Aug 26th at 3pm PDT/6pm EST (at least in NA).
---
The free server transfers were good. 
---
The paid server transfers were horrible and a way for players to reset their reputation by paying a small sum instead of investment ng 10-20 days to work on a new character.
---
No need to throw personal accusations mate, were just sharing opinions :)
---
Is DKP still a thing? I thought we solved point based gear systems with EPGP
---
The pirated server shitters better be prepared to eat a dick.
---
Keep in mind there are 3 year olds that can play this game.
---
That's really cool to know! thank you.  
---
better pick my leatherworking alt's name carefully, if people are potentially going to hang onto the gloves forever.
---
Remember the launch?! It was rough...
---
You would need 2 accounts for that neutral auction house thing though right? I believe you couldn't buy your own auctions.
---
I’m a big fan of mages as bank alts, as well as hunters. Super fast leveling and all the perks you said. Used to park my alt in Kargath and sell ports for a gold
---
Ah I didn't know it required level 50 that sucks. I have tons of runecloth at 40 from fishing in beta, so I was thinking maybe you could do that.
---
And the ones from that instance, rfk or rfd, look so cool
---
We can't get enouhg of the fluffy things.    
---
Put on auction, they sell quick. Lok'tar Purrrgar!
---
Ahaha he changed the title. This is much better though.
---
All specs are pretty much viable in 5 mans.
---
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Sargeras and the Betrayal?
---
It's just one group of goblins making a business deal with the horde. Most of the goblins are the same as ever
---
Idk, they're usually ranked 7th or 8th in terms of time to level. Still slow as balls.
---
Just look under mage on the site- you can also check out the post someone made in this subreddit with a bunch of other sites + all the class discords
---
I guess Chen’s Empty Keg doesn’t exist in Vanilla anymore. 
---
Tbh, Pandaren aren’t a big deal, I don’t get why people throw so much hate at them.
---
On a non pvp realm you can.   
---
For PVP servers this isn't allowed because people would abuse it. Would be easy to spy on what the other side is planning, or logon to your alt and send a message to someone you've just corpse camped etc
---
It’s funny because private server players are gonna shit all over easymode Classic. They are used to overtuned private server content and now they’ll be in for a pleasant surprise when they realize how piss easy Classic raiding will be.
---
Not sure if this is a real "guide" or r/woosh
---
Who in their right mind levels a bank alt beyond level 5? I
---
Yea, I'd probably only do it once to help with getting 100% speed mount and never buy again. Too much risk
---
This is the key point. Im going to be 2boxing just for inventory space early on.
---
Skinning herb on main
---
Leather enchant on alt
---
Shit. People argue about the amount of time spent leveling to 10 vs how much value you get out sprint; here you are leveling a Mage to 42 for portals
---
Just a heads up: (almost) anything you are going to find now, is based on private server mechanics. There will be subtleties that will come up in PvP when classic hits. So don't get too bogged down in the details.  
---
Are you interested in joining a premade, or just having fun in spare time? This affects class calculus somewhat.  
---
Also: Get ready to use a lot of engineering and alchemy consumables.
---
The thing is, Samwise Didier had always wanted his Pandaren design to make it in to Warcraft. He even made Illidan's original glaives have a Pandaren design. We see Chen shows up eventually in Founding of Durotar. I think they watered down Pandaren for WoW, based on Sam's original design. Pandaren, i think, were supposed to be fat, like in the same way Kultirans are. They are big, but not over the top, and they are supposed to be strong. 
---
As someone who's main in a Pandaren, I feel as if Blizzard could have made them less silly, with their stupid jiggle stomachs. And people complain about MoP being too Chinese oriented for an expansion, which is a fair complaint.
---
The problem is, people seem to leave out the fact that other races have obvious influences from other real life cultures / places. Tauren are native Americans, Trolls seem to be inspired by cultures from the Carribean, Dwarves are Norsemen and Scottish, Worgen are British, Draenei are east Indian, I think. Playable Goblins are New Yorkers, and I am sure there are other parrlels to the other races I didn't mention.
---
Again, I do know that the main complaint is about how MoP was basically China, and the real life influences on the races being compared to an entire expansion is admitted, a weak point. I just get annoyed when people say the Pandaren race, specifically, is silly or out of place.
---
I really don't think Pandaren are out of place in WoW, just, mis-designed. 
---
Of course you can still dislike them. I enjoy the lore of every race but I still find myself disliking a few, based mostly on their designs, and IMO, Pandaren have gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to that.
---
But then there's people who just think Fur = furry.
---
Or space goats.
---
If you are so spineless you’re swayed by a circlejerk of strangers you deserve everything you get.
---
Remeber higher end mages will be arcane for molten core and bwl so go to pound town with no ice barrier.
---
After spending years trying to be a peacekeeper, orcs dropped a ~~nuke~~ mana bomb on her home. That's when she decided fuck it, let's fight it out
---
It should be up as it was in the game from the start, but not ALL of the recipes should be in the game 
---
[Flarecore Leggings](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19165) are a great example- they are very powerful early on like titanic leggings from 1.10 and will probably not be available from the start
---
Level 10 I think
---
5, 10, 20, 35
---
Eh, I’m used to it. Lots of casuals and tourists visit this subreddit. 4Fun players who don’t know anything about the game.
---
What the hell did I just watch...
---
yea, why stop at 42 when you can go for the epic mount. Already more than half way there!
---
Yup, then they'll quit and the game will fail.
---
I know people explored like this in the original beta, but I think it was changed before release.
---
It's a great piece for leatherworkers, but I doubt you'll be making any money off of it in phase 1.
---
Blizzard has mentioned they want to gate powerful items that were added later on in the Phase that corresponds with the patch they were introducted.
---
[Since Corehound Belt was introduced in 1.6](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Corehound_Belt), the same patch as Blackwing Lair, my guess is it'll be in the game in Phase 3.
---
Why are you warning people about this? Same shits been happening in pvp realms for a decade now. Hell even with this shit war mode it still happens, it’s part of the game. 
---
The warning should be, if you’re an emotional wreck who can’t handle getting griefed do not roll on a pvp realm.
---
It's pure fun. Leveling is a tad slow and doing the same rotation gets stale but pvp and world pvp shenanigans are amazing. Not to mention you can do some serious dps as a combat swords build after 40, even in raiding if you put just a bit of time into pre bis gear. Topping dps charts is a lot of fun once you get that spell rotation down.
---
Seriously can't wait to roll my Troll rogue. It's a blast sneaking around with a group of fellow rogues in capitol cities.
---
Don't get me wrong. I get it - you just want a pat on the back for your work. But the very principle of 'post naxx content' other than TBC has to tackle 5 major topics - and terrain design is the least of the worries here
---
Naax equipment was so powerful that it remaining viable till mid TBC. STARS Illidan kill with half their guild still wearing most of their T3 is proof of that (admittedly they used it due to the xpac launching right away with patch 2.1 in their region - but that doesn't change the fact that they did it 
---
Blizzard has learned their lesson from T3. While progressive itemization was still alive and optimal in TBC &amp; Wotlk. They've never created gear again that trivialized the follow up content completely like how T3 did it with T4 aside from niche roles and fight whereby people used a bit of T4 for the higher stamina values.
---
\#1 How would they handle the power naxx gear in 'new' PvE zones - knowing that it even trivialized the first lvl 70 raids in TBC. Will they give out candy to get everyone up to the same level and kill AQ40 and everything below in the process?
---
\#2 How would they handle the naxx gear situation in PvP. Even the naxx updated Rank 14 gear could barely hold against it and everything below was just boring to fight as you roflstomped your way through everything.
---
If TBC would have arrived 6 months later you bet your butt that the drama about that imbalance would have escalated way more than it did in vanilla...
---
3# What story is going to drive the content. Like it or not the theme and plot are what gave the general direction for big content patches during vanilla and what defined the respective xpacs that followed afterwards. Why would they invest money into new stories for the old system to effectively create 2 mmos (which they've stated plenty of time they want to avoid at all costs)
---
\#4 There would be no point to artificially cripple the system to emulate a 2004 software anymore when it turns into a 2020 game. Changing the entire player interaction and the functionality of the software entirely.
---
\#5 Vanilla has changed every couple of months with massive patches changing and mixing core game mechanics, balancing, buffs/nerfs and class changes. The moment you open Pandora's box to change/add something the classic project turns from 'preserve history' to 'make a wish' 'beggar's paradise' and 'angry kids demanding elements they know worked better for various classes and specs in TBC'.
---
In other words they will want more viable hybrids. They will want their feral buffs, they will want their paladin taunts. They will ask for their steady shot fillers. Rage normalization and so on and so forth. It begs the question why they would even bother with all that when a) TBC has all those things and b) those changes would rub the 'core audience of the classic preservation' movement the wrong way.
---
Unless those questions are answered in a way that the userbase is content with. New art is the least of their problems.
---
Or to go with the quote that every designer hates - The 3 Fs
---
&gt;Form Follows Function
---
Not the other way around. Until function
---
Not to mention that all of this is trivial from a investment perspective. To go into TBC is a safe bet and it is way cheaper than to tackle all of the above points.
---
Do guilds like this have good progression? I would imagine a more serious raiding guild would run the content enough to get more of the items to off specs.
---
You are not going to get skinny eating hot pockets and drinking Dew, as you level mining 12 hours a day.
---
Weird flex but alright
---
Hopefully this helps show everyone just how viable it is to level with 5 melee in dungeons up to 60! A great alternative to those who hate the warrior 1-60 process.
---
They’re a big meme
---
Yeah, but then the reward was a just a mount. Currently I can't create a voidelf (or anything other than dark iron) because I haven't grinded the rep/quest/whatever dailies.
---
I can't fully partake in the game because of dailies
---
Well id recommend reading ALL the novels before touching chronicles... but thats gonna cost more.
---
The chronicles is really good but its not as detailed on the happenings than the other books are... im not saying chronicles is bad, im just saying its alot cooler to know all the details while reading the chronicles.
---
Atleast to me when  i get to certain stories i  was like "oh i remember this... " and flashbacks of the more detailed happenings in the books came to my mind like PTSD. :D
---
Dot + Wand FTW
---
I just switch zones or grind in a safer spot. Ideally there are higher leveled players in the zone who will help out, but not always, especially early in the game.
---
Depends on the guild but less than a progression minded guild
---
You mail shit to an alternate character.  It sits in the mail 1 month, then it's mailed back to you.
---
Wc 3
---
Big oof
---
I meant mail it to an alt and leave it in the mail system thus obtaining infinite storage
---
What race did you roll? Huge difference between nelf, human, and dwarf/gnome
---
What about engineering for sub-60 PvP?
---
Appreciate the detailed response! The fact that there is some money in engi means I might just do mining + engi since I would like to world PvP sub 60 anyway
---
