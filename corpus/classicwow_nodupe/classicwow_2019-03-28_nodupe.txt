&gt; So I'm stuck between maining mage or warlock horde.
---

---
They couldn't be more different from eachother. They are both casters but comparing them is like comparing a Warrior to a Rogue.
---
&gt; I work so won't be able to no life. I love world and BG PVP and would do raids for gear mostly.
---
Most people can't no-life. Consider this though: Mages are the best farming class, but at the same time they are quite gear dependand for PvE and PvP alike. Warlocks are good at farming as well. Their gear dependance is similar, except if you focus more on PvP and spec into SL, which requires a significantly *leaner* build than standard SM/Ruin, since you only worry about spelldamage and stamina.
---
&gt; I was thinking undead for each class but seeing how many seem to want to Main undead mage makes me consider a more obscure or seeing which race would be min max for pvp.
---
Orc is the best PvP class for Warlocks. You get stun resistance which is *huge* for Warlocks. Also your pet does a bit more damage. For Mages I would say it is 50/50 Troll/UD. WotF is very powerful but overrated since it is more situational for ranged/casters than melees, Berserking can make or break a fight. Choose the one you like more.
---
---
---
I was wondering the exact same thing. The gnome int bonus would be nice but I’ve decided on human. My reason being an increased sense of immersion and class fantasy. I didn’t get to play vanilla, but I’m going to try my best to recapture the magic of when I first starting playing. If I’m playing a gnome, the only thing I’m going to be able to think about is how much I would rather be a human. 
---
Nah. They immortalized this player and their character. We’re still talking about 13 years later. 
---
&gt;I know that the house isn't clean because I'm still in the process of cleaning it. I just wanted to give you a glimpse so you can hype up to our summer vacation in my house.
---
If the vacation will be in the summer, then it's far too early for vacuuming - a new, thick layer of dust will come.
---
Cancels out the -5% Spirit from Demonic Embrace.  That's a win for me.
---
You get more xp per kill/per quest at higher levels so wouldnt't you have to account for that?
---
Undead spriests are unparalleled duelists but don't underestimate trolls. Shadowguard is extremely powerful, it scales with gear and can proc blackout and shadow weaving. Also the 20 percent healing reduction is awesome considering how rare those effects are.  A druid or mage really has to be on the ball to realize he needs to remove it. 
---
&gt; I'm planning on playing an Undead Shadow Priest because I'm dead inside :,) Is this good for solo play leveling and PVP?
---
Yes it is. Shadow Priests are very straight forward to play and very powerful against average players of any class. UD have nice caster stats and can break Fears, which is great. If you consider min-maxing your race choice for PvP I would advice Troll though, because of Blackout proccs from Shadowguard and the consistency of Hex.

All my RL vanilla friends not playing anymore and probably wont start.

And when we meet I incidentally talk about our amazing times back then when we ware at school and preparing for MC. But not as main topic to talk.. I just say 1-2 sentences and then I change the topic to something else.   
---
And Ofcourse I dont talk everytime we meet/talk about wow, once 1-2 month and just when it fits..\^\^

Its like planting a semen and hoping he slowly growths
---
This is me... 
---
Lolvtjay fractures the community even more than sharding in the first 10 levrls
---
I like them a lot. I leveled one to 50 sometime before the 2.0 patch hit and used the free respec with the patch to get the fel guard. I tried them in TBC/WOTLK and didn't care for them very much. That being said, I recently leveled one up to 60 and fell in love with the class. They feel like a mix between a hunter and a mage with more utility than both. They're jam packed with flavor and their gear looks amazing. I mained a hunter on retail and a mage on Nost, but neither complete. I felt like I was missing some core part of their kit. Warlock doesn't feel like that; they feel complete as a class. Shaman is similar and that's probably the only other class I'll level. 
---
Least packed zone will be all of them, as sharding is used in the beginning.
---
I raided in vanilla as a ret, I didn’t get too far but I managed to clear MC and almost clear ZG/AQ20.
---
No one ever had a problem with me dpsing as ret, only time I would run into issues is if a group was missing 1-2dps out of a 40 man raid they usually said no to me. A fresh group would always accept anyone who was up for it in my experience.
---
Can’t speak for the other raids or horde side.
---
This is the exact same for me. Got my druid to 42 and switched to my warlock and never looked back.
---
Some of my first great memories of wow were the epic battles between Southshore and Tarren Mill before the BGs were released. Making leveling there damn near impossible but god it was awesome to witness.

Is that what she wanted? To be immortalized?

Tauren is very underrated as hunter, I know alot of skilled hunters who play hunter. Stun resist is very rng based but warstomp can be used every other fight as you like: warstomp &gt; FD &gt; trap to save your scatter cd. and my personal favorite for when rogues use frost reflector, you just warstomp into a iron grenade and it's duration is gone. the 300 extra hp at 60 is very good too, i've seen tauren hunters who stack alot of stamina with 6.5k hp. super hard to kill that.
---
I tend to forget about how different leveling is now, since I have not created a new character in retail for years, and have played on private servers.  More people may die who play retail than a brand new player to Classic!  
---
In 1v1, yes. But in an MMO you can group up to play to your strengths and shore up your weaknesses. The 1v1 balance of a game matters far less if the game is more focused around group content.
---
Bro..
---
Neltharions Tear
---
group 8 isn't showing in his raid frames because it's his group

Dartol's Rod of Transformation

The end. 
---
oh nvm then :)
---
Definitely thissss
---
I've played a lot of Warlock over the years, and the fact that you keep bringing up Affliction tells me you haven't played Vanilla since 06-07. Some Guilds will give a few debuff slots to Warlocks so they can spec into Nightfall in Affliction and keep Corruption up, but 99% of Warlocks will only be using their assigned curses. Never CoA, never SL. 
---
Also, sorry for the 0/21/40 comment - I was playing TBC recently and that's the highest DPS spec. Warlocks in Vanilla are generally either 7/21/23 or 30/0/21. 7/21/23 is slightly higher DPS and less RNG reliant (Nightfall procs for Shadowbolt) and also takes up less debuff slots, but some guilds do run this instead.
---
Bosses in Vanilla die very quickly. Most bosses in Molten Core die in under 60 seconds, even in only pre-bis gear on the raid. You don't have time to 'ramp up' your DoTs. Also the only DoT that ramps up in damage over the duration of it is Curse of Agony, which no one will be using anyway. Honestly unsure if it's even worth giving up the GCD on such a quick fight.
---
Bops will be 50% to this probably 
---
I remember it being painful, since we have no healing a good amount of downtime and not much aoe ability

&gt; The min/maxer in me is saying dwarf, but realistically I won't have enough free time to be a regular raider, so I'd be min/maxing for what purpose?
---
PvP. The advantages of a Dwarf priest in PvP are even bigger than the ones in PvE.
---
It is not just about Fear Ward, which can save your life, when the enemy Orc Warrior just feared away your teammates while swinging his axe with Mortal Strike at you and Windfury from his Shaman Friend, who is by the way precasting a Lightning Bolt to finish you off.
---
It is also about Stoneskin. It is the only way you can remove poisons (Viper Sting drains your mana, Crippling will slow you down etc.) as a Priest and bleed effects.
---
These days you will have hunters using Nightfall.
---
They're the best at keep up the debuff due to wing clip spam and their dps falls off in later raids anyway
---
Lame.
---
Anathema/Benediction. It better damn well be in there or someone is getting a stranglin.
---
It sucks that there's such a stigma with Night Elves. The moon priest is one of the most unique takes on the class in classic and their racial is pretty neat. 
---
It will one of the less popular "unique" starting zones, in that only one race starts there.  So definitely Tauren.  
---
World PvP will happen in Classic ;)

I plan on becoming much more active on your discord now that I am positively hooked and the game is just around the corner
---
Keep up the FANTASTIC work my friend! 
---
I believe its called \*Skill Coil\*. Dunno what death coil is.
---
If you are looking for advanced rotations then you need to have a look at Hunters or Feral Druids. But in the end you'll be DPSing which means you literally press buttons in a predefined way. Raiding as a DPS is as straight forward as it gets so I would advise you against to even consider the rotation and look at other factors.
---
One of my fondest memories was our raid leader screaming "who the f**k put shadow weaving on the boss?" and none of our priests admitting to it (it was me.)
---
I'm curious. Which items were wrong? I've digged through some guides for hunters and found this one to be the best one.
---
Actually the whole point with sharding is to have a much larger pop at launch so that when the retail tourists and others leave there will be a healthy population long term. That's what Ion talked about at Blizzcon.

That was very well done and gave me chills!
---
Maybe your right but maybe you are not and it would cause issues. What benefit is there to having them released so far in advance that outweighs the risk?
---
Some of my favorite instances are in the 40s too. I'll run ZF and Mara a few times each.
---
Depends
---
After naxx comes fresh.
---
No reason why you couldn't heal a 5 man as long as you had good healing gear. That was one of the magical things about vanilla, shadow priests felt like dangerous rebels just like in the lore. Considering you generally couldn't raid as one, and had fierce competition for gear, seeing a geared shadow priest was a frightening sight. 
---
Yeah that's definitely true. You also have your offtanks carry nightfalls to use when they aren't tanking, because they won't be doing great damage anyway. From my undersstanding they try to mimick the R1 wingclap spam with their hamstring spam lol. 
---
Yeah, These Anti-Change circlejerkers are gonna do a full 180* and beg on the forums and complain here for updates when they get bored of Naxx
---
I want to have some versatility, and I don't want to be tied down to a role necessarily. While I want to raid eventually, it's not my end-all-be-all. Naturally, I consider druid, because it and shapeshifts and stealth and such seem fantastic.
---
But opinions seem so extreme on whether the class is shit or not that I'm genuinely a bit concerned about being completely underpowered as a newbie player.
---
Thoughts?
---
You can't go wrong with either of those. Consider Shaman over Priest because they have more synergy with their melee buffing totems and they have Ankh, which serves as an anti-wipe mechanic in dungeons. Consider Priest for their healing efficiency and flexibility.
---
On Private Servers there usually comes a fresh realm after Naxx. When that fresh realm also reach Naxx they will merge realm that are on the same patch and open fresh again.
---
I keep saying this to people who want to play rogue, warrior or shaman. These 3 classes use a totally different spec for PVE and PVP and it's important to know this if you chose to play one of these classes and don't have time or want to grind 100g every week. All other classes have specs viable that lets you do both without respeccing.
---
Thunderfu..
---
Tidal charm
---
Then why the Frack did I spend all those hours and weeks killing Furbolg?
---
Or Dark Iron?
---
Or want a cat mount as a non nelf?
---
But yea. . its not as completely bad as the constant rep grind of today's retail, but its still important.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Yeah. You might not top the meters but you should be more than able to fill your raid's needs; moreso than say, an spriest healing.
---
Wow this is incredible :o this is exactly what I want to be doing in classic. I hope we can find a way to coordinate which server major wpvpers are going on when they announce the list.
---
People keep saying Shaman is bad don't play it but it's literally the only class I enjoyed enough to make to max level.
---
They have never said that.
---
Let's just not pay attention to stuff we don't want to, and spend more time enjoying what we enjoy.
---
My boy Mor'Ladim will be busy this summer.
---
At one point you have a 45 minute baron run... which was tuned with the thinking that "raiders world buff, flask, use potions, food, etc... so tier 0 geared players should too if they want to do this"
---
So you basically need a fully buffed and flasked group to pound through undead strat... and we were doing it in full Tier 1 and Tier 2 and pushing 30 to 35 minutes. In Tier 0 most players would be pulling baron at 40 and if you wiped you'd have to start over.
---
So sadly I'd really doubt anyone in dungeon blues is going to do any "jumping in solo" past the first step of that quest.
---
I think your going to be an alcoholic like that Jerry meme
---
&gt;We know items added in or after 1.10 are out at start.
---
One of the ONLY things we know is that the above is not true. They used the example of Titanic Leggings
---
&gt;Are the 1.10 versions of these items available at launch
---
Probably. They're the "little changes that don't have a big effect on player power" from their view point.
---
 We also know they seem wary of progressive itemization (items changing over-time), but are considering how implementing the final updated PvP Weapons would be given that they want to use 1.12 values where possible.
---
I’d love to get anyone’s opinion on if I should roll Dwarf Healadin or a Nelf holy Priest.
---
I have my race/class down to these two. I’m trying to ignore ‘optimal’ race/class combinations because I want my classic experience to be laid back. I will be playing with my wife who has decided on a night elf hunter. She has never played WoW before so I expect I’ll be saving her ass with heals once or twice.
---
I am curious about the paladin because I’ve never played one before. I also really love dwarves (honestly, my wife and I are huge LoTR fans and half the reason I want to play a dwarf is so I can macro /yell NEVER TRUST AND ELF to bug her). I’d like to heal I think hence why I want to roll holy.  
---
On the other hand night elves are my second favourite race. I love the option of mind control as a priest as well. This would also give us the option to potentially avoid some wpvp if we want via shadowmeld. 
---
Does anyone know which class is less painful to level as holy? I’ve heard plate healing gear doesn’t really drop until 60. I’d rather not be running around with 10 level outdated gear if I can help it.
---
1.) We get to know where the streamers are playing and avoid them easily
---
2.) We get to know which servers will be overpopulated on day 1 and avoid them easily
---
3.) We get to know which servers will have lopsided faction populations and bolster the weaker side or avoid getting rekt
---
4.) We get to know which servers will have lopsided faction populations and people who were previously planning to run their guilds on that server can go to a different server to lower the overpopulation on the larger side. 
---
5.) The "risks" of knowing ahead of time are not a real thing to worry about, it'd be much worse if they were to say decide not release the names at all until launch
---
Hearing healers talking about stance dancing being easy is hilarious lmfao
---
Druid is the way to go based on what you're describing. Google "Taladril's Treatise on Bear Tanking" and look up any cat form dps videos by "Shedo" and you'll see that you'll be more than able to fulfill whatever role you take on as long as you play smart. The catch is that you have to put in the time to learn the rotation and farm some items and gold for consumeables. It's not going to be as easy as an optimal class, but you can absolutely do more than just fulfill a support role as a druid. 
---
FWIW I feel pretty similarly to you and will likely go feral with an emphasis on tanking for Classic.
---
now i think everyone uses AzerothAutoPilot
---
Everyone is going all gathering profs off the start. Your probably better off going engineering
---
&gt; Stoneskin
---
Don't need stoneform for rogues if they can't see where you are *taps forehead*
---
We already have new content. . Its called TBC
---
I had an OG orc rogue, and we were extremely rare. I much preferred my brother's undead rogue at lower gear levels though. Getting psychic screamed was a one way ticket to kite town and inevitable death against a dwarf priest (Sprint had an obnoxious cool down back then.)  It also made warlocks a free kill. 
---
I'll fully admit I might not have been playing optimally though, it was a long time ago. 
---
This. Dwarf is legit master race for priest. 
---
People make it out to be much worse than it actually is. They can break the fear ONCE. You have plenty of other tools as a warlock and it's definitely not game over just because of a single racial.
---
WOTF has 5 second fear immunity. and then theyll trinket after most likely
---
Oh I see what you're saying. Good point.
---
Are you EU or NA? The guy who made that guide have started a guild for world pvp/pve guild already. 120 members right now! It's a EU guild mostly but also open for NA players and other timezones.

---
I used to grind Deadwind Pass as warrior too. I remember I got the epic warrior tank shoulders there too, and then believe it or not, they dropped again, think they were the best thing pre MC you could get as a tank and may have been better for tanking than the Might gear too.
---
Wanna say stockade pauldrons. 
---
The way I see it all of the above outcomes only occur if we have the list months in advance, there wouldnt be a "streamer server" or "overpopulated server" or "lopsided faction" server nearly to the extent there would be than if you gave players months to corral each other to specific servers for specific factions and play styles. 
---
This  reminds me of the guy who grabbed the biggest bat he could find in EPL and called it "Blocksurview" and just sat near the ironforge mailbox all day. 
---
&gt;spam shadow bolt, that doesnt seem fun
---
So let's cast frostbolt for an entire raid instead
---
Tidal Charm and Mind quickening Gem 
---
if u play sl lock u need to die
---
It is a very uncommon spec but it has its strengths.
---
I'd say it would be viable for PvP. Very aggressive. You'd be hanging back and cast Lightning Spells/Purge and some Shocks like an ele/resto but you won't be supporting your team as much, instead you'll be a formidable threat in melee as well.
---
As for gearing it wouldn't even be that much of an issue actually as weird as it sounds. Because it has good synergy with the Dungeon 1 and 2, very good synergy with the PvP sets, ZG set and the AQ set.
---
As for PvE: I don't know. If I were a GM I would let you try it out under the condition that you respec into resto or at least ele/resto if it doesn't give good enough results. And then we'd maybe try again after aquiring either ZG or AQ gear.
---
All the biggest streamers are already planning to play on the same server, so whether we know the servers now, a week ahead of time or at the last minute, there WILL BE streamer servers, and there are overpopulated servers on retail and have been since the beginning despite there being no streamers or people planning their servers as intensely as you seem to think is going to happen.
---
Long corpserun, that horrible ‘barrow’ layout and stupid amount of mobs *shudder*
---
Yep took me until my 8th class tried before I fell in love.
---
I just really like doing professions :( 
---
Haha, this is the opposite of me, but the mindset is still relatable. 
---
I knew a guy in Vanilla because he was the GM of our sister guild, so one day I get invited to MC cause they need people so I say sure! I'm super stoked cause it's my first time raiding, well I get there and they find out I'm not a healer (druid) and they tell me bear tanks sux and to respec, I tell them basically never mind I'll dip out so they can find a healer.            
---
             
---
Well turns out they needed a tank and said fuck it I can stay and off tank as long as i throw heals and innervates. Well as soon as I joined their Vent I'm immediately met with this shrill assholes voice who going on and on about druid tanks are trash and whatnot, so i mute the dickhead. Well I'm whispering my friend what the pulls are because no ones explaining shit, he tells me which marker is mine because the dipshit I muted was the raid leader. So i unmute this kid who freaks out over every little thing and is always screaming like the [-50 DKP video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDytJC655c) but not Asian and insanely fucking unfunny, hes the main tank.               
---
          
---
This Warrior tank sucked ass, I dont know if it was gear or rotation but this kid was constantly screaming he needed healing and were on trash. Well low and behold fearless leader dies, next tank grabs it and also is one shotted, another Warrior taunts and eats dirt.           
---
       
---
I figure fuck it, might as well try so I taunt and grab it and like some kind of magic it's barely fucking tickling me but the ENTIRE time this kid is screaming "BREZ ME, BREZ ME, BREZ ME!!!" so I say "I fucking cant i'm tanking like a druid boss!" well we kill the mob/s and this dude flips shit going on and on about druid tanks are trash and if I cant follow commands I can fuck off, so I left. But I was still in their vent so I hear one of the healers talking about how much easier I was to heal so spazoid goes off on him and he says fuck it and leaves, so now they are down a healer and a tank.                  
---
Well I left Vent and my friend said it all fell apart 5 minutes later and I never got invited or ran with them again ***but this is how kooky*** this mother fucker was because were still sister guild so we got info from them especially when TBC dropped because a lot of their members came and joined our guild. So this crazy mother fucker is telling his guildies NOT to buy TBC under any circumstances. That he will kick them out if he sees any of them ding 61 UNTIL they clear every Vanilla raid, including Naxx. Well this crazy ass shit goes about as well as you can imagine, people leaving, some upgraded and just stopped raiding.             
---
              
---
This guild leader has such a god damn mental break down he took a baseball bat to his PC while on vent, one of the officers knew him in real life and found out when his wife ran in to see what all the commotion was he either by accident or on purpose struck her in the face.                  
---
           
---
So the neighbors call the police (apartment) who upon knocking on the door are greeted by his wife whos sporting a giant bruise on her cheek and she tells them he accidentally hit her and they see the Dell PC in shambles, turns out it's against the law to break your own shit or something so he gets arrested and at some point ends up in behavioral holding at the hospital.                    
---
I never heard anything about the dude after that other than all off the officers in that guild changed servers and we never talked to any of them again. But anyways that is my very long MC story.
---
The troll casters will litter their islands with the bones of the interlopers. Self-healing mobs that also cast lightning shield will be the death of many melee.
---
Battlemasters will be in major cities, but expect long queues for 20-59. K3 private server allowed you to queue from anywhere in the world and it really was a great idea as it doesnt force you to pick either PVP or leveling, because thats exactly what stationary battlemasters do. Those who havent experienced vanilla recently will be shocked at travel times, and it simply is not worth it to run all the way to the SW keep to queue for WSG when it takes about 15 minutes to get there from your leveling zone. I wager that 80%+ of people will not queue because of this, when if they had the option of queueing anywhere they would.
---
It will almost certainly be bad the first month or two. After that we will see...
---
There are overpopulated and imbalanced servers in retail because slowly servers made a name for themselves as the "Alliance PvE Server" or the "Horde PvP Server" and such. This was just a product of time as people knew the names of the servers and could point to one and congregate there. Thats exactly what giving a list months in advance would do. Its a natural process that certain servers will become more popular for one reason or another but let that happen organically with peoples choices being more random and scattered to start.
---
When I was a kid I leveled my druid from like 43 - 48 exclusively doing ZF runs, took months
---
If you want to spend hours raiding with the perfect spec and more hours doing high level pvp, then be willing to spend hours farming gold.
---
I'd almost be tempted to roll one just because they're so rare. On pservers at least I've only seen a handful, you definitely stick out.
---

My character was in &lt;Drama&gt; also. Not sure why because I was terrible and didn't raid and had no idea what I was doing. Pretty sure this screenshot is from the first day of the honor system.
---
I fkn loved this song. From Vanilla to WotLK were the golden years of the machinima genre.

"Check your MySpace". God time flies. Never really was on the site other than to listen to free music.
---
OP mentioned you in his post.
---
Imagine trading out being uncrushable for being able to shadowmeld on a tank lmfao 
---
Not to sound rude, but at the very least you ought to have faction and type of server decided. There are a lot of what-ifs and maybes in your post and those things aren't particularly attractive to potential applicants.
---
He could just say the same thing back to you 2 lol.
---
I can't help that I only like leveling with rested XP! 
---
“I’m taking a pic and posting on the forums”
---
I really miss the forum trash talk. It was fucking merciless, especially on my server. If you did anything wrong people would pounce.
---
Good times.
---
It’s time for a second subreddit.
---
/r/classicwownext
---
/r/ClassicTBC
---
/r/ClassicWrath
---
/r/BeyondClassicWoW
---
Any of those would work fine. This discussion is irrelevant to Classic WoW in its Vanilla form
---
I figured it would be closer to what I experienced in BC and early/mid Wrath. I remember people would check basic stuff like that or ask your healing/spellpower for a range of numbers. I won't have time for hardcore progression but once a week raid night would be more my speed. I look forward to it when I get a chance!
---
Bonereavers Edge! Nice! I had it for my DPS spec on my tank.
---
I'm gonna agree with this guy. Almost everyone gets their 31 point talent, and that's a huge upgrade. The levels just start to fly by after getting that.
---
Yeah I was working under the assumption that most guilds would need to worry about the tank surviving more similarly to in vanilla than the guilds doing speed drums on private server will likely have to. I also forgot about the defense re-itemization, but that'll just switch enrage from never up to rarely up for heavy mitigation geared tanks. But for sure, going all out dual wield threat spec will change things significantly. Also interesting on countering the death wish. I never saw people tanking progression fights with fury and back in vanilla people didn't pop potions as much as they do not, so that could work.
---
I'm also now wondering about my memory on Nef. I feel like you could just stance dance every fear, but it was long enough ago that I'm not 100% sure.
---
it was a wotlk thing
---
Remind me why Nelfs cannot be uncrushable? Pretty sure any tank but bear and paladin can hit 102.4. 
---
Vehn maybe? I only say because I was looking through my old screenshots and found a picture of him with all of that except Deathbringer. ( Old t2 models also! )
---

Dam i really liked that . Was wondering why i never saw anyone mention  it.  
---
Undeads look so cool when full set
---
what about slow fall
---
99% of it is just spamming your AoE, kinda pointless in my opinion. I’d rather just go around on my own or a 2-3 man party killing whoever I/we find
---
&gt; I think that's very good advice. But what's the matter with undead rogues for pvp? Being able to shed a fear will keep you alive against a (especially dwarf) priest until you're rocking 5 piece Tier 1 and can pull of a complete stunlock.
---
Your job is not to Zerg with the others and kill priests. In WSG you'll be defending and hunting Druids, who have multiple ways to stun you. In AB you'll be solo deffing / attacking a flag / backcap which means you're again, fighting Druids or other Rogues and maybe Hunters. All of them can stun you. In AV you'll be mostly hunting down respawns and only few classes have fears. Allthough this is against premades. But when we're considering min-maxing were not looking at premade vs. randoms because there it doesn't matter what you choose.
---
&gt; It also turns warlocks with their succi out into a free kill.
---
Already a free kill for Rogues regardless of WotF if the WL gets caught he is toast, especially considering he wont be an Orc since you are playing Horde. As a Rogue you'll already have charm/fear removal with your PvP trinket. On top of that, you'll have better stats for melee, which is only a slight advantage though.
---
Keep your head up! Im sure by the end of april we’ll have a release date:)
---
but then, after 2 years, he makes it to 60, and has all consumables for free...
---
up to level 60. Now he has to get level 70.
---
Yes, like that it would be efficient. But I wouldn't ever consider it *over* mining or herbalism.
---
\[Gael\] rolled Need: 99 on \[Ironfoe\]
---
\*enters moonkin form\*
---
staff of dominance or mage t2 shoulders, I will reserve the hell out of those things no matter the costs.
---
Eh Idk doubt that. All the ones I know have said they will roll PvP. Its the true vanilla experience. They know that just as much as anyone.
---
That was a long time ago, the internet is a very different place now.
---
&gt; And if you're going Shadow . . . Berserking is all well and good, but if you have the mana . . . UD Shadow Priests are unstoppable face melting machines.
---
I consider Hex of Weakness (curse -20% healing) and Shadow Guard (proccs Blackout) to be far superiour than anything UD Priests can do. I'am maybe biased since I played a Troll priest, but I wouldn't even consider an UD over a Troll for PvP purposes especially if speccing into shadow.
---
OMG, the level 1 blizzard/rain of fire... that's brilliant... 
---
The items that show up in the "stat weighs" slides: 
---
pre-bis: 4pc dungeon set instead of Bracers of the Eclipse/DM chest/DM belt/t0 boots.
---
* 4-pc set: 45agi+40AP+21 agi from boots
---
* Other items: 44agi+24ap+2% crit+21 agi from boots
---
That gives you ~16AP weighed against 2% crit, which is ~60 AP @30AP/crit%.
---
Band of Accuria is never going to a hunter when melees/tanks should have prio on it. By the time hunters would be eligible to get it, they have much better options. Ditto for DFT, especially DFT. Hunters don't even need the hit for their hitcap *and* DFT has 56 AP while the class trinket from the Dire Maul quest has 48 AP.
---
DFT is almost perma-bis for melees and is an 8 AP increase for hunters. It should never go to a hunter.
---
It's a similar story for Brutality Blade and Quick Strike Ring. QSR especially is perma-BiS for fury warriors.
---
Damn, I'd join that if I was EU. That sounds amazing.
---
I absolutely loved ZF and Uldaman in vanilla, those levels are the best. You also have SM to run which is great. 
---
Actually looking again he is group 6. I guess it really is just 34 people. 
---
The socializing is one of the things I'm most excited about. Some of the funnest times I've had on WoW in the last several years were those rare times when one of your LFG groups would actually talk and mess around. 
---
I love all the things you mentioned, especially excited to want to level my professions to get some awesome item upgrade during the leveling process.
---
I was gonna say Force Reactive Disk, but I really wanna see how well [Argent Defender](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13243) works in low level instances.
---
You should definitely go Paladin for increased survivability while leveling.
---
The glorious thing about leveling a healer is that you don't need to spec holy to heal while leveling. You don't even need gear with int on it and stuff. Until you get up to the higher level dungeons (Sunken Temple and up) you will be just fine leveling at ret or ret reckoning and healing. The added benefit of being a pally is that you can also tank content while leveling. That will be a HUGE boon to you and your wife's play experience. 
---
I really wouldn't worry about the gear. The level of your character is far far far more important than your gear while leveling. On my last play to 60, my priest kept a level 24 blue from Shadowfang Keep until 52. I was healing dungeons as full on dps shadow spec. Zero issues. Besides that, as a holy pally at 60 most of your best in slot items will be non-plate so get used to the idea of wearing green cloth items over shiny purple plate stuff :P
---
As far as class goes -- fuck yeah dwarf master race!
---
Not really considering basically nobody can name the player who the ‘funeral’ was for
---
Those are optional grinds that most players does not want or need to complete, it's not really similar to what someone from TBC or wrath would see when they think +10% reputation gain.
---
My first screenshot was when I was thinking "Does PrintScreen work in this game?", and then found out the game actually cares more than I thought
---
Brutality Blade and Core Hound Tooth are unrealistic melee weapons unless all your Rogues and Warriors already have them. Stick with Dal’rends/Peacemaker/Barbarous Blade until the Weapons from Hakkar.
---
Similarly, Drake Fang Talisman should be given as priority to Rogues and Warriors.
---
*world PvP is toxic*
---
Ok lol
---
That was me originally.
---
To be fair, Nelves are much more popular than taurens as well as the zone being much smaller, but like you said, it doesn't matter too much because we'll most likely have sharding.
---
Yeah. There are some perks in vanilla crafting professions - tailors get a class-specific cloth chest &amp; a set bonus for bloodvine, blacksmiths have some BoP items, and there's engineering... but I enjoyed the flavor of wotlk
---
Don't feel bad, I was so bad that I deleted my leggings, and I had no clue what a GM ticket was, nor did I know english good enough to write one. On the uppside, I invented a killer money making method by running around without pants begging people for gold to buy new ones.
---
I *know* I'd get shit for this, but if in Classic they gave each class the TBC talent tree's up to the ones that require 30 pts, the game would undoubtedly be so much better. Talent's that benefit skills that didn't exist in Classic like Rogue's Shiv just wouldn't be included in those talent nodes.
---
I.e. The enhance shaman would suddenly be legit, likewise with prot paladins.
---
[example Shaman TBC / Classic hybrid Tree](https://imgur.com/i7y4xqX)
---
I remember when I was waiting for the first WOW release.
---
And my sister asked, "Why is F5 the only key that has no dust on it?"
---
Nuke it, dot it, help the whelp groups
---
Probably just logs
---
To anyone that's going to be an Alliance Warlock, if you want to have a hilarious time: just cast Curse of Tongues on a Shaman. Basically that spell + felhunter that renders us cannon fodder.
---
Not only full of shit now. You seem like one of those guys that would 1 up someone else's story. Weather your story is true or not. Just shut the fuck up dood. Nobody likes that guy. Chill out and you will make some friends.
---
Ich sprache nicht Deutsch, though
---
yeah it's still way more useful while leveling and in BGs. 
---
do priests trinkets not break fear? I guess in a premade dwarfs are great cause they can fear ward paladins but solo Q id rather be a night elf any day 
---
I dunno man once the undead warrior breaks your fear three times ya start wishing you leveled engineering.
---
Buddy, you should really have a fresh look at what you just wrote and then have a look in the mirror. Good luck to you.
---
Ravager!
---
Do paladins stun when they are low on hp or do they /sit? Do warriors try to open charge and kite into intercept stun or just /sit? Do warriors in open pvp ever get a fappable CC thrown on them or do people ignore them? 
---
Do rogues try to kick your heals or just let you heal? Do hunters save scattershot for when they are at 1% or use it when the gap is closed on them?
---
I love how theres even another lvl 1 being created at the very moment lmao
---
&gt; I probably won't listen to the whole pod cast, but do you have a time stamp where they talk about this? I'd like to hear about it because I tanked pally in TBC, would have loved to be able to MT in classic for raids. 5 man's it was no issue but raids was a no go
---
There are paladins on pservers that have tanked every raid boss in the game. You just need to find a guild that's into doing weird stuff. I actually tanked more raid bosses on my warlock than I did on my paladin, so there's that too...
---
You'll have a hard time finding a hunter that wants to spam wing clip in raids. I've seen so many people saying hunters will be relegated to Nightfall swinging yet the truth is that nobody wants to do it. 
---
Nobody is doing that on private servers, I've seen a grand total of two hunters (and only one of which was swinging NF full-time) ever swing Nightfall in raids, and I've seen plenty of PoVs/speedruns/logs.
---
The offtanks/that one fury will keep Annihilator stacks up and swing nightfall, and they even do it better than hunters if they are specced into Fury and have the Flurry talent.
---
44? Maybe if your goal is 60 as fast as possible
---
My goal was progression in raids. At level 53, I was already clearing BRD. So, if talking about the halfway point to 60, it was about 56-57 for me.
---
But, if talking about the halfway point to endgame, then I got my first pre-BiS item at level 45 in Sunken Temple. And I entered STV at level 31 or something. Leveling speed before and after STV is beyond comparison. So, halfway point between 31 and 44...
---
I've never designed addons, is it plausible to catalog items, use inspect data to find the relevant stat totals of a player, and assign stat weights (with respect to class) to reach a quantifiable, comparable number? It'd be a lot of work (especially trying to quantify proc effects) but hard work is nothing new to vanilla min-maxers
---
Ok cool guy that is awesome humble brag. Enjoy your awkward silences in life.
---

---
It was fixed at some point during vanilla. Just like when they put a cap on the number of reckoning charges you could hold.
---
whenever i see these kinds of images i think theyre just from private servers pretending to be legitimate but the pvp trink on during trash in mc and using titan at all makes me think its real
---
Thanks for these, Josh. Keeping me tied over until launch. 
---
Yeah let’s put level 31s in an AB game with 40s on mounts
---
It's fun to laugh at my own pain.
---
For some reason I'd rather replay the same handful of level 1-20 zones ad nauseam rather level cap even once.
---
I am a big fan of shadow meld, but I would not say its more useful than the racials dwarfs get in BGs. Fear ward on flag carrier ?  Fear ward in 1v1s vs 3 different classes? 
---
&gt; Also, let's not act like vanilla dungeons weren't mostly linear or close to it
---
You can skip most of the bosses in BRD if you want. Most dungeons from TBC onward made it very difficult to skip anything.
---
You can also cast fear ward on the melee dps to shorten fight times. Having 4+ dwarf priests precasting wards helps a lot with raid dps.
---
You had Quel'Serrar though. So you were pretty l33t back then.
---
Warlocks don't really stop casting, so they don't really get a chance to benefit from spirit that much
---
will never understand the people like this that are THIS obsessed with stats over utility
---
do you think skull of impending doom is bad too because you lose a weapon slot as warrior or rogue?
---
As a person that absolutely loves healing I too am.the bottom one. Well reading that I remember letting some fury warrior die as he charged into a group of 5 mobs. Fwar: why didn't you heal? me: dumb fuck 
---
invisibility isn't the same thing as stealth just fyi
---
howd that go
---
I don't think they should make any changes to the "WoW Classic" servers, but I would love to see this new dev team take a crack at a forked set of expansions on separate servers. 
---
Imagine we just pretend TBC and onward didn't happen and they make a new expansion where we do Northrend from levels 60-70. Just leave out Flying mounts, arenas, LFG and all that other junk that ruined the game.
---
definitely this, that area where Zalazane spawns is going to be a hot mess  
---
In the case of enhancement shaman, it would be better just to give whatever "tbc" bonuses we wanted to give them upon spending the 30th point in enhancement. That way, we wouldn't have to mess with the talent tree. (I say 30 instead of 31 in order to allow for a shaman to potentially go 21/30/0 or 0/30/21, instead of locking them into stormstrike). So if you want to give them unleashed rage and same sort of scaling with AP on their shocks (I'd probably limit to to shocks instead of TBC's general spellpower), do it that way instead of forcing them to spend talent points on it. 
---
I respect the troll mage, I was never able to get over the no boots visual. But I love the lore of the Darkspear. I did not play in classic, I started at the beginning of WOTLK and rolled a blood elf rogue. Planning on horde for classic. LOK TAR OGAR
---
If I recall correctly, druids were the least popular class in vanilla.
---
Hey bud, not butthurt at all
---
Wait for the day you stand in IF and a streamer has 40 people around them meming out like its twitch chat and you cant even scroll fast enough in trade to find the guy selling xmutes 
---
I don't care what anyone says, Night Elf Priests are pure class. Probably the classiest combo there is aside from Dwarf Rogue.
---
God damnit Leeroy
---
I'd play a female dwarf if it wasn't for their laugh!
---
I get it, you think I'm either lying or just a bad person, and you don't like me. That's fine. I would like to point out that I did poke fun at the fact that I realize what i was writing was some not-so-humble bragging, so i get the impression that you didn't really read what i wrote or misunderstood my intent. I hear ya, i wrote about experiences that, in my own words, made me feel like a god. And that's an awfully conceited thing to say. I think what you missed was the part where i own that. It's okay that you don't like me, and I'm sorry that I've upset you so badly here, but you do need to understand that even if you don't like me you do have to remain civil in the way you speak to people.

Its not going to be reverted, but that's how it was before AB came out.
---
We can differ in opinion.. Its ok.  It is the internet after all :)

Nah I meant to say these kids who donate to said content creators pay their electric bills.  My b
---
It's been a while but I'd think without decent gear it might take a while to burn shit down.
---
The third option is every MMO from the late 90s like Everquest and DAoC because as soon as you get in game you close all the windows blocking your view, which includes the combat window, and you just /attack everything until someone mercifully tells you how to get your UI back 40 levels later.
---
Well I honestly like Kargos sometimes but I dont believe it should be isolated, but it is absolutely true.  How many videos are out about the best grind spots, best white items to hold until late content, and best farming circles for gathering profs....too many.
---
Every time you spot a node you will get there and it will be gone.  All those mats you want for your consumes will be camped, gonna have to buy them all
---
In tbc i played sl/sl
---
Come at me bro
---
Whoosh
---
I honestly dont understand mages.
---
Like you chose to be a warlock without all the cool stuff
---
I want to say this is... D2? 
---
part of me wants to tell you "dont be stupid" but i dont think you know any better:
---
1. windfury totem only applies to the mainhand and subsequent mainhand strikes so it doesnt matter if youre dual-wield or not
---
2. if youre healing, youre not using wf and air. if youre focusing on uptime on both totems, you might as well play enhancement for improved totems since you have nothing better to do 2/3 of the time
---
your thinking still falls flat
---
It's the internet. And you come off as a fuckbag. Reread your douchy replies to me lol. You are gonna get all the girls though, and be a sweet cool guy with that additude. It's so admirable. Keep it up bro. So much pussy coming your way dog.
---
Cool but then you're an alliance warlock. PepeHands 
---
&gt;Dwarf Healadin or a Nelf holy Priest
---
PvE or PvP? Paladins make some of the best BG healers and MT healers in the game. Dwarf racial is strong in PvP. Blessing of Freedom + your hunter wife = good counter to a lot melee classes
---
Nelf shadowmeld + Mind Control = hilarious world pvp. The Nelf-special priest abilities are meh though. If pvp is a concern, I'd roll dwarf priest for fear ward and stone form. PvE, priests are "the" de facto raid healer.
---
tl;dr - PVP paladin, PVE priest.
---
&gt;Does anyone know which class is less painful to level as holy
---
Don't level as holy. Ret for pali, shadow for priest. I wouldn't consider respeccing till at least mid way through 40, but preferably late 50's or lvl 60. You can heal just fine for dungeons and leveling as DPS spec.  But if you want an answer, I would say priest is probably easier to level as holy.
---
&gt;I’ve heard plate healing gear doesn’t really drop until 60. I’d rather not be running around with 10 level outdated gear if I can help it.
---
You will probably not be wearing as much plate as you think if you are playing a holy paladin. Holy paladins got gimped on plate that gives healing till raids. So get used to needing against clothies for robes lol.
---
Funny you say that. My 2nd char is always a paladin.
---
Guess its just cause they're total every way.
---
I also love shadow priests.
---
I want TBC and Wrath more than Vanilla even but seriously, piss off with this shit. We haven't even gotten Vanilla yet. We don't need a post about this every single day.
---
Strawman, it was toxic, they had the freedom to be toxic though. This was about a real life person dying, would you crash a real funeral with 40 other people? I guess by this standard crashing any funeral is fine. I can't wait for the Klan to shout some of their favorite words at the next MLK remembrance, it's only the lulz. I actually agree with the free speech thing but this lying about what it is is just stupid.
---
Not to mention Blizzard could have permanently banned them if they felt like it, TOS and all.
---
&gt; At some point during vanilla you were able to cast Aimed Shot while melded, not sure if they removed that before 1.12 though?
---
Casting Aimed Shot always broke shadow meld. The thing is when stealth breaks you have latency and the destealth animation before the other player can see you. This means you can normally get half of your aimed shot cast before you are visible. If you're a priest you might be able to cast mind blast before they see you.
---
I think blizzard should really step up their april fools game again; it used to be some really funny stuff like ordering chinese food in game or battlegrounds actually just being a window where players play warcraft 3 vs each other.
---
Early to mid 20's is easily the biggest breakpoint for me in vanilla.
---
God the high 90s in D2 are ROUGH. 
---
95 is the highest I ever got.
---
I just ctrl f'd "objectively correct opinion" and don't see anything. 
---
gotta love how people think horde warriors somehow magically do 2x more threat
---
even though windfury is a TINY amount of damage (and subsequent amount of threat) on a prot warrior
---
It was pretty good until they buffed wands.
---
You missed some really good ones like ordering chinese food in game
---
Corrupted ashbringer. I'll have you again my love
---
yeah and then they vanish your sac and resto pot your dots off and  kill you once your sac is over
---
that was spirit well spent, with the refund taking up a racial bonus, opportunity cost is big.
---
Best 1v1 pvp class.. Druid.. warlock? I mean they’re fun to play but... come on lol
---
It's the internet, but even reddit has rules to prevent people from being trolls and insulting each other like that. Because reddit would be a horrible place to hang out in if it didn't. 
---
fear drs in vanilla lol
---
Haha I made several competitive lvl 19 twinks in tbc before I ever got to 70.
---
The most Vanilla-y part of this for me is how cluttered your UI is. Mine looked very similar!
---
What did he do wrong besides sink your argument?
---
Druids are more fun than Locks in vanilla. Just as much lore, but more variety of play. 
---
Was this the moment you realized how to take a screenshot? I had a similar experience and once I figured it out, I took so many! Lost most of them over the years, unfortunately.
---
Yep same here. 33, 29, 24, 21, 21, 19, 16, 11.
---
I never got higher than 33, but tbf that was on a pserver that died
---
vanilla UIs cause me physical pain 
---
Undead are close, no doubt!
---
&gt;you see a rogue heading towards you and stealthing!
---
all these examples are pretty bad
---
when you use perception it shows up in the combat log, any good rogue will just keep distance and los until you try mounting up or wait it out if you're below 40 and then go on you
---
Ret: am I a joke to you?
---
yeah, you're preaching to the choir on this point  :)
---
This is nuts, it's always been hard to comprehend people losing it over such unimportant things, their lives must suck I guess... at least I got a good laugh out of your story
---
Yeah I'll look into that, thanks for the tip.
---
Obsid blade or arc reaper 
---
LOL I know right? I look back at my UI and I think how glad I am to have such nicer tools today!
---
Druids are good at a lot of things. Just because a developer says something doesn't mean it's the absolute truth. The artist does not get to decide how his work is interpreted, and that also applies to games. I would say druids are a well-designed class after the revamp, and just like every class, how good it is for you depends what you want out of your character.
---
Paladins are pretty popular on alliance.
---
You literally make macros that can do it for you with a few clicks. Anyone with half a pulse can do it.
---
the murlocs north of eastvale logging camp tend to kill a lot of people. they are so densely placed and some of them pop a healing potion mid battle :O
---
This is me on private servers at the moment. Highest character is 46 and all the rest are 14-25.
---
Huh... I really can't remember ever running into Blue Dragon Spawn.
---
Uhm. . he didn't. But he did use the royal we.  "most players"  That's all. 
---
And why am I even answering you?  :)
---
Warlock is at the end of vanilla, no contest.
---
Right click on taskbar and pin it, then it’s one click and it’s open
---
Yes.
---
Classic might one day develop into the true WoW 2 - lessons learned edition.
---
Same here. Cost too much time and attention, and probably can't keep up anyway.
---
Yes contest 😂
---
Mist of Pandaria had some real warlock class fantasy brought back. Sick xpac for locks, or shadow priest for that matter.
---
Then warlords rolled around and ruined everything.
---
Sharding is here to stay!
---
how did I end up on there? :O
---
Add Karazhan to classic
---
Thanks for the detailed reply.  In vanilla, I almost exclusively engaged in world PvP since that was what I was used to coming from games like Shadowbane.
---
Interestingly, I did play an orc rogue as my first character to 60 anyway. 
---
Why are people discussing it [in this thread from 2 years ago, then?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4g4ycj/question_warcraft_logs_tank_sitting/)
---
It's well hung though.
---
That's why you play horde so you don't fight undead ;)
---
Yeah, Vehn is the only other NE warrior that comes to mind immediately but I didn't include him because he was infamous for using a fucking blue from UBRS all the way into BWL, lmao.
---
&gt;I can't wait for the Klan to shout some of their favorite words at the next MLK remembrance, it's only the lulz.
---
you accused that guy of strawmanning and then posted this? l0l
---
We posting tbc screenshots now?
---
This was the day I first played wow, my 13th Birthday. 
---
Crypts questline in tirisfal, also the caster murlocs on the coast that do insane damage.
---
Its not posted “eVeRy. fReAkInG. dAy” 
---
Stop overreacting. 
---
Nothing happens, the game dies, or blizzard makes a new expac or tbc servers that will probably be optional.
---
Yuuuuuup agreed.
---
That way the human warrior can only break 2 fears so your third lasts 4 seconds maximum.
---
Should be possible to pull the item ID off other people’s gear and then cross reference that against the list of items to get their +stats.  Then someone has to convert that in to a meaningful stat that makes sense at a glance rather than try to interpret what the individual ingredients of the stat sandwich are.
---
Report me please, see if they care. I am doing you a service, and you should be thanking me.
---
Thankfully, i quit in wotlk before this game shit the bed
---
Lmao, hilarious screen shot. What were you guys doing out there?
---
It was a sweet troll shaman name coj
---
I kinda wish they had kept more stuff like that, would make for some interesting gameplay lol
---
255 is the answer, but yes: unreachable.
---
same
---
thats what im hoping
---
If we can channel our pop into one server and aim for a 50/50 faction split, that would be sick
---
That's the one, yeah. Highly sought after.
---
Thats gold.
---
I did not use the royal we, I'm stating facts. Obviously if you do want to do these quite unusual grinds, then you should consider human.
---
What exactly *is* an "Aldi man"? Do they shave and shower?
---
So you are against people sharing knowledge to the masses? In specifics, knowledge about gold farming spots?
---
there are some downsides of high pop but i would much rather have high pop than dead server. can't think of a worse wow experience than that
---
The fact that pure DPS classes don't even operate at 90% of each other makes his statement almost completely pointless. Regardless of their intentions (and honestly I have a hard time believing they had any difficulty calculating the DPS of 1-2 spell DPS classes) they made a game where certain classes dealt more damage than others, and the ability to heal came with significant balancing factors.
---
Personally I think class balance actually came out extremely well, if you consider the entire game and it's various types of gameplay. If you only consider raids, the balance leaves something to be desired, but I don't think that was necessarily the intention, and I'm glad for it. I play the entire game and I think it's nice having classes do certain things better than others.
---
Like I said before, we ended up with a game where hunters, for example, deal significantly less raid DPS than warlocks. I think it is fine. Despite both being "pure DPS", hunters have significantly better PVE soloing and farming ability, even compared to warlocks who are one of the better solo classes. In PVP hunters have the benefit of longer range and near-total immunity to silence and interrupts, despite being ranged. Hunters have more utility spells like tracking, and can deal most of their damage without mana.
---
Did Blizzard ACTUALLY put all of that into consideration when they designed the classes? Did they PURPOSELY make Hunters deal less damage to compensate for the reasons I stated above? I don't know the answer, and I don't particularly care, because if something is good, it's good, even if it wasn't "intended" to be that way.
---
Cmon Bruh.
---
Maybe not huge but they're significant. The raids and BGs have associated rep grinds, with rewards, never mind the optional reps. If I have to do 1 less ZG or AQ20 run to hand in my token for purples, that's a nice little bonus.
---
In theory we could do sims, but that would still miss the bigger picture. For example Nightfall axe - that's a 15% boost to the raids spellcasting. So how do you sim that? Or a shadow priest with a debuff slot to help warlocks damage- how many warlocks? It gets too complicated.
---
Yeah we can do a basic sim or pure stats but that doesn't even start to tell the full story. So I don't think it will be a thing.
---
The pre-raid BiS are pretty well known, so pug leaders will look for that. They also aren't hard to acquire. And pugging will be limited to Ony, MC, and sometimes ZG. So the problem that an addon would be trying to "solve" is actually pretty small. People will gear up and find guilds, make friends, and nobody will care about gear. Or so we can hope. That's how it plays out in private servers.
---
I imagine there will be quite a bit of coordination among people here and on the pserver subreddits to amalgamate into the biggest server
---
many people out there love the high pop experience. if they announce server names early people have an easier time coordinating
---
Damn he really showed you don't know shit about vanilla lmao so you hit him with the grammar nazi. Love reddit
---
The 40s suck hard as alliance on horde side 20-30 is fucking dogshit.
---
Thus the word mostly. BRD is super non-linear, sure. But most vanilla dungeons are, or have a side wing you can detour to and then back to the main route. 
---
Imo it's the best racial in the game if you have a job. 
---
Dwarf priest on fear relevant fights means the boss dies significantly faster, which means less healing done, which means the spirit didn't come into play at all
---
True. A while back I was considering posting a topic here in the line of "sad that he isn't here to enjoy Classic with us", because I thought that he would've been a fan. But then researched and found that he wasn't a fan of Classic at all. I still miss the dude though. Probably one of the best gaming journalist and reviewer we'll have in a very long time.
---
Or find a guild like mine where we do 2 days off 13 days off and still hit all the resets! It is great for those who want to PVP!

Yes, I was aware that I was stretching the metaphor to the breaking point.
---
And yes, I should do some vacuuming.
---
How do you come by these facts?
---
Listen. I don't know you. I don't know if you played vanilla or if you only PVP or what your deal is. But I do know from experience that these are not unusual grinds for vanilla. That is all.
---
Your world did not revolve around them. Others did. That is all. Just watch the definitive statements of "facts" is all I am asking.
---
But yes. Go for human if you want that bonus.  But most of all. . play what you want. Play the way you want.

Sometimes the question is more difficult to phrase than the answer we're seeking.
---
UBRS, Deadmines, Wailing Caverns (yes it's linear, you just choose what side to do first, either left then right or right then left), Ragefire Chasm, all of the Scarlet Monasteries, Gnomer was still linear with side attractions, BFD is linear, I'd argue RFK is linear. RFD is linear. SFK is practically linear. Strat Live is, pretty sure Dire Maul North is. 
---
The point is, I said mostly. Congrats, there are ones that aren't linear. Duh. BRD obviously exists, as do others. Congrats on your galaxy brain fact checking. 
---
arguable whether or not troll is better than UD, devouring plague does a lot of damage. I would probably prefer Shadowguard on a hybrid healer/shadow build.
---
You can still migrate. I would and will in such situations.
---
100% Mulgore. Least played race along with troll/gnome, who had their starter zone lumped in with others. Tauren are all alone on the plains. It's pretty thematic IMO, Mulgore is so peaceful.
---
That's...what I was saying. How am I getting downvoted for this? 
---
Yeah there are counterpoints to the linear thing (thus I said mostly), but a lot of dungeons had some small branching or alternative route that didn't substantively change the dungeon. You have 2 routes in SFK that basically just changes the trash you fight and lets you skip a boss (which no one wants to do anyway). That kind of stuff. 
---
Do people in retail transmog their gear down? Thought it'd be funny with full tier gear to transmog it down to the level one starting gear, just a blue robe and a gnarled little staff on a mage.
---
Hmm, so the developers are using unsigned char... A bit cheap, but does mean they just need a byte. Might just add up when all the network traffic for all the players is taken into account.
---
Back when the word “toxic” wasn’t used, better times indeed.

This is one of the reasons I was interested in a RP-pvp server. I just have no interest in seing people with "ttv" or "yt" in their names, or just generally memey names

The barter economy has led to rapid inflationary cycles throughout raptor history. Like the great raptor market of the first age. Raptors would frequently consume their own goods making it hard to establish bulk prices seeing as supply could vary wildly throughout a day on the trading floor.
---
It has been speculated that raptors use silver currency out of convenience seeing as humanoids mint it. Raptors could get a quick payday by attacking humanoids. This is why raptors are typically aggressive, they’re mugging you.

Thank you!

Hi! You can find more at CountdownToClassic.com or just by searching for ‘Countdown To Classic’ on spotify/iTunes etc :)
---
well admitting you feel powerless and frustrated by someone's success usually means anger, jealousy, and resentment. People who want to be on the streamer server can go there, I'll avoid it.
---
Thank you! I’ll give it a listen 
---
Another thing to keep in mind as well, there will be tons of people playing classic who never set foot in a p server. (Such as myself) I started playing late BC/early Wrath so I’ve never touched Vanilla in any form.  Not everyone playing Classic is going to be a seasoned vet or know the encounters inside and out. I have a reasonable amount of knowledge based on recent runs through in retail, but gear is so much easier to come by these days, it really trivializes everything. I got a +17 intellect weapon from a level 10 quest on my warlock as my first green and they started rolling in after that that. And with the guaranteed loot you get from queuing in dungeon finder everyone is pretty well geared at low levels. 
---
I think a lot of people are going to underestimate how difficult Classic dungeons are going to be. 
---
Because people try to go there at level 5 instead of hitting up Razorhill first.
---
I was thinking about a RP PVP realm myself actually.

I'm upvoting you for the creativity even though I fundamentally disagree with the message.

Altoholic 4 Lyfe, yo.

I wish dps meters had an option to account for the extra damage boost provided by CoE/CoR/CoS.
---
But have you ever used shadowmeld in searing gorge to mind control people into that hole just south of Thorium Point? They go so deep into the slag pits of the cauldron it will take 10 minutes to get out IF they know where to go!
---
I remember them being particularly bad ass in PvP, but that was one of my first times being surprised by one at max level PvE.
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of The Windseeker?
---
They should be dead or close to death before your second void sac is even over, if they pull the above move after your first void sac then just hold off on the second one and let soul link eat most of their burst when they stunlock you. then pop a healy rock, engi net or helm, and reapply dots and fear.
---
What about arcane intellect and mage food?
---
If OP wants to level with their spouse smite Priest would be viable instead of shadow.
---
While I agree with the sentiment somewhat, the gear would still be terrible for a lot of the specs that would be "fixed". Blizzard eventually basically gave up on making feral and ret paladin gear ect.
---
The real life friend who got me to play the game never got to max level, he'd log on after like 6 months and ask me to run him through Dead Mines and then he'd quit again. I think the highest level I ever saw him was 42 during BC.
---
From what I can see in that thread, they are sitting to be crit so they can take more damage because his trinket will proc when he goes below a certain HP%. 
---
That's not the same as an effect proccing by being crit like reckoning. This also doesn't seem to be about vanilla wow at all.
---
It's definitely very powerful I agree, but it's on a cooldown and likely cured. Just less consistent than a Troll. But if you want to roll UD, do it, you will *never* regret it if you like the class and the race.
---
Ya, it just took blizzard entirely too long to "fix" them and by then the roles were already established. It was well into TBC before people dropped some of the bias created by this.
---
Hey man I am not frustrated by their uhhh, “success?”
---
I am certainly not happy that the content that is supposed to take TIME and community effort will be blitzed and the market saturated with the necessities we all need to succeed too fast.

Soul Link Warlock and Feral/Resto Hybrid Druid, Hell yea bro. I don’t there are any better classes for 1v1 dueling.

This is the only thing I don't like about starting Classic at 1.12 - in vanilla, warriors were hard to find until 1.8, and most people who started them before 1.8 wouldn't play them even after.  
---
Now, with PServers touting 1.12, warriors are everywhere... =/
---
Haha omg I had no idea this was a thing. I missed so much when I played vanilla. 
---
Ah I see now, the point made was effects on crit and not crit while sitting itself.
---
I've noticed that the most vulnerable are those who are keyboard steering. If you're pressing both mouse buttons and steering with the mouse, distract rarely works for more than a fraction of a second ('til next slight movement of mouse).
---
I think there were a lot of druids, but like hunters, were grossly underwhelming due to the amount of people who had no idea how to play them, making routine experiences with druids forgettable. This led to a stigma against the class in general, and most raids would only bring one, or maybe two, almost exclusively for MoTW.
---
There's wayy too much to unpack here gotdam that was funny 
---
I didn't end up PvPing much in Naxx gear just due to other stuff while I was raiding Naxx, but even when I got Sulfuras earlier (it is kind of end of AQ start of Naxx quality) I saw that effect.  The first BG I did after getting it, about 3 minutes in my response was "this is stupid. This weapon shouldn't be in the game." And it just got wise from there.
---
I still remember doing this even on my server. Except I never got to really see it because the entire server pop on Hyjal packed into the zone. So much lag that the zone server ended up crashing and by the time I was able to log back in the gates had already been opened. 
---
This clip is exactly what I posted in my vanilla guilds facebook group when I decided I wanted to play Classic. "I don't need it...I don't need it...I DEFINITELY don't need it..."
---
can also use it to troll low levels in your own faction hah
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8Hxutm1XiQ  guide to warlock evil from vanilla
---
Yeah that too, it honestly didnt work all too often but when it did, it was a good laugh
---
&gt;Regardless of their intentions (and honestly I have a hard time believing they had any difficulty calculating the DPS of 1-2 spell DPS classes) they made a game where certain classes dealt more damage than others, and the ability to heal came with significant balancing factors.
---
Oh I definitely agree that the healer tax is rough in a 1.12 world. It's not so clear to me that that was the case early on. For example, pre 1.4 an enhancement shaman would have dealt competitive DPS (if not better) than a fury warrior for example. Though of course this idea seems foreign by the end of WoW's life. 
---
&gt;Personally I think class balance actually came out extremely well, if you consider the entire game and it's various types of gameplay. 
---
Hot take. 
---
&gt;If you only consider raids, the balance leaves something to be desired, but I don't think that was necessarily the intention, 
---
and I'm glad for it. 
---
Right he's stated explicitly that poor raid balance was not his intention.
---
&gt;I play the entire game and I think it's nice having classes do certain things better than others. 
---
I think what makes the game fun is that classes do different things from one another - not necessarily that one is better than the other. Most people think that TBC class design was much better (and less homogenized than Vanilla). This was achieved by fully fleshing out class and spec identities that were unique from one another. And it didn't have to rely on some specs outclassing another at certain aspects - what was relevant is that they accomplished it in a *unique* manner, not a *better* manner. 
---
&gt;Warlock vs Hunter
---
That's all well and good (though I think it's a bit of an odd example considering that SL Warlock is considered one of the best PvP classes at higher gear levels, whereas hunter is not). But there's some specs that really don't excel anywhere. 
---
My go to example is enhancement shaman. They're worse than average levelers. They certainly don't excel at solo gold farming. They're fine in dungeons (but this says more about the difficulty of dungeons than it does the state of shamans). They're terrible in Raid PvE. They're terrible in premade PvP (not even considered for the 2 fairly open flex spots). Where's the balance? 
---
&gt;I don't know the answer, and I don't particularly care, because if something is good, it's good, even if it wasn't "intended" to be that way.
---
I'm really not sure what's at stake here. Do you disagree that  certain classes or specs are undertuned or overtuned? 
---
Mage/Warlock is a good combo too - port to closest dungeon access point, then summon everyone else. Throw in a paladin/shaman to keep those two alive in wpvp while running to/summoning, you're pretty much g2g. (Paladins with crusader aura makes it even quicker).
---
I’m just saying I can count on one hand how many times I’ve lost to either of those on my rogue 
---
You just suck it up and respec each week. I raided and did high level pvp and I definitely blew a lot of gold on that as a druid. Just get a good money-making profession and sell your stuff and you’ll be good. 
---
Or since pvp will not be a thing for months into classic, raid a bunch first, then take a break to rank up. When you’re done with your pvp grind head back to raiding. 
---
Ah yes, a good place for the thousands of reposts to go.  
---
Blink. It's all about blink.
---
That spell does make me jealous
---
I don't see them raising caps past what vanilla had, there is no upside. There is a tiny minority that wants these overpacked horrorshows but it breaks the game in so many ways it is ridiculous.
---
Those double D shoulder pads tho

I used to get really high during raids.

Made that shadowbolt spam alot funner.

Just tried palatanking in tbc. Its a very different experience.

What do you think will be more rare in classic, human or gnome warlock?
---
Gnomes.

Humans are the most common alliance race
---
Warden staff
---
I always have my first death in the jasperlode mine. Or is it jangolode? The one with goldtooth. Man fuck those kobolds. 
---
The high pop experience on p servers is a broken game. Blizz can't be that dumb even now and so the servers are likely to have original server caps. However I do support them releasing servers and letting people organize to allow people who want more people to find a server that will be packed and deal with queues all the time to roll on and let streamers telegraph where their toxic fanbases will land so I can avoid all that nonsense and play on a regular server with reasonable numbers of people.
---
Perception tho... 
---
Sadly this won't return, there was QnA at the blizzcon announcement where someone asked just this. Basically the new world is made out of spheres while the old was made out of squares which made it possible to wall-walking. They saw no point in returning this feature as it was mostly used for exploits, such as getting on the roof of WSG and camping there with the flag until the EFC died and then cap the flag.  
---
I also really wanted to see this return aswell, as I spend a third (aswell) if not even more of my time just trying to see where you could get by wall-walking.  
---
Not seeing this return will for sure have an effect on me when it comes to nostalgia.

There was one point in leveling this character that I had 1) boots that were COMPLETELY invisible on the male troll model; and 2) [Aboriginal Loincloth Of The Owl](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14119/aboriginal-loincloth) . It was bad. Bad.

Hello world. This is me
---
Beautiful. &lt;3
---
That is so fricking cool! I guess I would have been 10 years old at the time, turning 11 in June. I had played before, on a friend's account, but this was the first day that I played on my own account.
---
This, not sure if people are talking out of pservers experience or because they head there way to early, if it's from pservers experience. I can tell you already that the shamans are heavily bugged compared to how it was durning retail vanilla wow.
---
Orc male bow animation begs to differ.
---
Blood elf’s also have the ears that peak through helmets so I feel your pain to a degree. It’s a horde burden my man. We do it for the warchief. You have to love Thrall
---
You just made my day, dude!!! Thank you. (:
---
&gt; can also use it to troll low levels in your own faction hah
---
OR you can use it to BUFF low levels on the opposite faction. 90 AP is a bunch at low levels.
---
You can also cast it on our hunter friends to make them immune to fear when they do the silithus demon.
---
So many options!
---
Sometimes when you were strafing back and forth a lot it could bug out and you could start moon walking.
---
I didn't understand mages until Wrath - then I rolled a mage, and eventually out-dps'd everyone on my server, including a fully heroic-25-man-LK-geared mage (I was full 25 man with some heroic peices). And then I realized, like most classes that are "easy" - there are soooooo many intricacies that are easily overlooked.  
---
But then Blizzard "fixed" all those intricacies and made everything cookie-cutter so it no longer mattered if you cared about your class. Simply farm raids for heirloom gear and then get the same spec/enchants/gear as everyone else, stand in fire or don't, and spam your top three abilities. So I quit. It's not fun anymore - it's a grinding wheel of torture made so a blind, disabled monkey could smash a keyboard and have the same success as a software engineer with an MIT degree.  
---
Classic has me coming back, though.
---
What's up with your ammo bag, it's seems abit "full".
---
I hate that I'm laughing.
---
I don't understand your post.  
---
&gt; as all of the 1.12.1 addons won't function on the modern API.
---
Why do you think OmniCC needs to be ported to the modern API when it already works on the modern API?  Classic isn't going to be running on the actual 1.12 client.
---
Mage bis is two piece pvp gear but this is solid.
---
I mostly raided in my esoteric pvp builds unless it was for a new dungeon. For me, I played a feral Druid which was a bit of a novelty, especially before talent tree balances. Because my character was known for being a cat Druid, I’d get carried through raiding and helped people push rank in returned when that was released (I was in high school and played 12+ hours a day). For new dungeons, I’d respec for the week into a hybrid healer build if we were losing endurance fights and needed an extra innervate.
---
The difference between a druid and warlock in PvP is the druid doesn't die but can't kill anything, while the warlock doesn't die but kills everything.  
---
So yeah, pretty much the same?
---
NOCHANGESSSS lol jkjk this was in beta right?
---
Yeah, no. Its telling that even when you get agreement for your idea, its just not enough. You need to take something AWAY from others in order to be happy. And thats why I won't support this. You are literally being given runway to pursue what you want, but you just aren't happy unless you can remove the 1.12 servers also. So ridiculous.
---
"We can't stop here, this is maga country!"
---
Str is fine, but more important is using your tremor totems timed well to break your dps'ers fears, purging everything, and using earth shock to stop the big heals and let your dps'ers overpower the fight. 
---
Idk... I kinda like it on a gnome.. but I was a gnome warlock back in vanilla..
---
Wasn't even aware that OmniCC was still a thing, cooldown numbers have been baked into modern WoW for a while now.
---
True. Cata was just plain terrible.
---
Me too. I had the misfortune of rolling Horde on Swiftys server in Vanilla. It took a bit but the servers basically became unplayable.
---
I never played RP but would be interest to try it if there was PvP. How does it work in WoW, are you expected to stay in character the entire time, or once you get to know people do you bounce in and out (pretty typical of the d&amp;d I’ve played).
---
&gt; Of course, they should leave the option for original, unchanging servers. I can't see them lasting very long with an alternate progression Classic though.
---
Maybe maybe not, but Im glad you agree the 1.13 server shouldnt just be erased. No reason to, let it live out its life, do the 1.14 stuff on a fresh new server. No need to remove options instead of adding them. I have no problems with this. Hell I wouldnt even mind them starting such a project immediately.
---
I played a hunter in BC - by far the best DPS class in that expansion (sorry rogues, say what you will but you couldn't keep up with a well-played BM hunter). I goofed around with one in vanilla, and it was pretty good, but I was new to the game and didn't have a chance to learn it much.  
---
Ultimately in vanilla, though, warlocks were better for raid DPS due to CoS/CoR/CoE, health candy, soulstone, repair summons, and more reliable DPS. Meanwhile, even though a GOOD player could provide competitive DPS and very useful missdirects, far too many huntards would raid-wipe by forgetting to turn off Aspect of the Pack, pull aggro and cleave-wipe melee DPS, forget to turn off pet taunt (cleave-wipe melee DPS), miss-direct to a healer instead of a tank... you get the picture.  
---
I'd take a warlock over a hunter any day. In fact, most hunters I knew in vanilla were only brought along so the guild wouldn't DE every peice of Agi mail armor...
---
Repeating
---
the difference is entirely insignificant 
---
Thats one of my issues with gnomes. You cant really see your gear or its very little.
---
These posts usually get deleted but I'll see if I can find the great big link of "after Naxx" posts.

Hell yeah have fun! Will you do me a huge favor and let me know how it plays games and if the heat system is pretty good?  That's what km nkst worked about is the heat but otherwise this laptop is a good ass deal.

Thanks for posting this, I was just talking about looks and tier and this really helpee me out
---
Oh, well that was being said in some other reply chain in this topic, so I just carried it over to here, oops.  Then, that's good it's not THAT inaccurate on private servers!
---
I had some friends do that to me - I was upset about it at first, and then realized how funny it was to them, so I was good natured about it. (They paid my repair bill later anyway).
---
so the 24 thing was throwing me, i didnt have autoatack in a slot.... but then came up with this that does not require it anyhow:
---
    /run AssistUnit("player")
---
    /cast Seal of Righteousness
---
As someone who plays horde, and remembers not even bothering with the fear totem most of the time, I agree that people overvalue fearward way too much.  
---
My latest calculation shows that the mid game (at least for a 1-60 speedrun) is half way into level 43.  The newer routes get through the 50s a bit faster, making the mid game sooner.
---
Yeah, that's true, it's just funny to think that Impale was ever questionable for Protection Warriors back then, at least as far as I heard in the raids I was in and other places back then.
---
Only if you're blind.
---
You could just roll horde and not have to be surrounded by a bunch of people who only rolled dwarf priest so raids would want them. 
---
Troll Warrior or Troll Hunter.

My "goal" for Vanilla will be to collect as many Unique Rare items as possible. By this I mean items that are.... "one of a kind" so to speak, such as The Emporer's New Cape, Piccolo of the Flaming Fire, The Book of the Dead, etc. Things with unique abilities and/traits. There are some exceptions, mainly things that are to insanely rare (like legendaries and the Hook of the Master Angler), that would be nice to get but not necessary for my goal. 
---
So naturally the Warrior would be the best pick for this as they can equip everything except for wands. 
---
The Hunter on the other hand can't equip Plate armor, Maces, and Wands. But can have certain pets.
---
I've played Hunter before and really enjoyed it, I just like having all these traps and abilities, and having a big monster fight for you is pretty cool to. I've played a Summoner in FF14 as well, I really do like pets and having many unique abilities. (I've saved a few wipes with a quick revive, and I hear using Jumper Cables and Feign Death you can sometimes save the raid from having to walk back).
---
I've never played a Warrior before. I don't necessarily mind the leveling experience being harder as my goal is more end-game focused. I did try tanking in FF14 to but didn't get to far, it was kind neat trying to draw as much aggro onto me as possible, I felt somewhat important? 
---
So in short, Warrior would let me equip more but Hunter is (probably) more enjoyable to me. A big question is how many "unique" items and bits of gear consist of Plate Armor and Maces? 
---

Hey just a quick question but is there any proof that Classic will be a fork of Legion?

Will do! Doesn't arrive till Friday so will let you know by end of weekend :)
---
The proof was in the demo which had many Legion features that hadn't been turned off like right click to report and raid finder, etc.
---
''they went straight for the priest that were gugging lava''
---
Hahaha, gugging lava! xD
---
Yeah the demo is not proof that we'll be using the Legion client in Classic's release.  
---
And people keep saying there was a blue post "somewhere" but can never produce it.  
---
My search continues.  
---
Could a paladin tank the all adds then they get dragged out one by one as they die?
---
&gt;Frost - OP DPS in PVE
---
Nope :p Not until you go fire in AQ and Naxx I'm afraid.
---
I dunno how much you like the look of items on your character but if you care about that I'd highly recommend orc's instead. Troll's generally don't look good in armor in classic.
---
Locks were the only class that challenged BM hunters in PvE - but in the right group, with a player who knew what he was doing (Cheeky's spreadsheet was the bomb), BM hunters would always outperform locks.   
---
I ran an Orc BM with a survival hunter in a raid-group with a shaman and feral druid, usually pulling in a second BM hunter to round out our 5. Our group always had top DPS, usually me or the survival hunter (he had much better gear than I did, and played BM better too, but did more than I could as survival so as class lead he elected to make the switch so the group could benefit).  
---
We crushed DPS races - made everyone mad, too, because they were "supposed" to be better based on gear/class etc. On some fights I broke 8k dps - which people claim is BS., show pics or it didn't happen, yada yada... wish I could, but that hard drive is long gone. =/
---
I mean, that's kinda how guilds used to be. If your looking to move up you leave a guild that's stuck for one that's further.
---
I quit at the end of wrath, too. Then a few friends tried to get me to come back for Pandaria - so I gave it a try. Got to the raids, and simply couldn't handle the panda's anymore. That was the end for me, thought I would never come back.  
---
...I'm back for classic!
---
Un'Goro is 50s. You may be thinking of Hinterlands.
---
Dope! You going to be playing classic? If so which faction? 
---
&gt;Yeah, no. Its telling that even when you get agreement for your idea, its just not enough. You need to take something AWAY from others in order to be happy.
---
Do you really think my motivation is wanting to take 1.12 servers away from other people and make them unhappy? Literally read my response before this one. I detail why having split servers would be a bad idea - namely it would provide a terrible incentive structure that would lead to a terrible class imbalance between the two servers. The servers would be both unblizzlike and also unhealthy. I assure you that's my sole motivation. Seriously, I think that if Blizzard raises the server cap that they should offer smaller, blizzlike cap servers, since I'm not motivated by taking away what's blizzlike, rather I'm motivated by ensuring the play experience is good...
---
Honestly, I'm confused by you even responding to this post and not my previous one. The post you responded to is basically saying that progressive release 1.12 isn't really that blizzlike, whereas a rebalanced 1.12 is more blizzlike. I didn't talk about why it was a bad idea to offer both types of servers. It seems like this is the idea you disagree with more?
---
&gt;And thats why I won't support this. You are literally being given runway to pursue what you want, but you just aren't happy unless you can remove the 1.12 servers also. So ridiculous. Even the classic wow fans who begged for this project for years weren't arrogant enough to demand that retail wow be killed off in favor of Classic. Geez.
---
I can assure you that your assertions of my thoughts and reasoning is extremely incorrect. I played extensively both on Vanilla and on 2 different private servers. 
---
I am in no way motivated by some desire to spite other people. I really don't know where you're getting this from - again, I stated explicitly why I think it would be a bad idea to have 2 different types of servers. Please read that explanation if you haven't. If you disagree with my assessment of its probable effect, then let me know what you think I missed (or why my assumptions are incorrect) and we can have a discussion about that.
---
Regarding "as I said before" I had originally started to talk about a hybrid there, and "said before" was referencing the first paragraph about hybrids. I changed my mind after a few seconds and didn't proof-read, oops.
---
I think BC class design is hot garbage compared to classic. A LOT of the new abilities served to cover up class' weaknesses, rather than playing to their strengths, and I think this led to less interesting classes with more homogenized gameplay, due to balancing the game around these new abilities. A few good examples off the top of my head... cloak of shadows single-handedly combated ALL of the biggest rogue weaknesses: dots, faerie fire, and mobility. These weaknesses defined the rogue in classic. Lifebloom covered up the one hard counter to resto druids: dispels. Ice lance covered up one of the few weaknesses of frost mages: reliance on hard-casted frostbolt. Instant casts in general are often un-interactive designs that move the gameplay away from strategy and more toward ability spam.
---
Enhancement may be shitty for damage but at the end of the day, it's a mail-wearing melee class that can heal, interrupt, and snare (literally the only class in the entire game that can do all 3 of those very important things, by the way) with plenty of utility totems including fear breaking on no cooldown. It's not as if they have nothing going for them, they're just not great for raids.
---
&gt;Do you disagree that certain classes or specs are undertuned or overtuned?
---
Yes. It's not perfect, nothing is, but it struck a better sweet spot than later expansions have, where they homogenized raid damage without considering anything else in the game.
---
he was the crazy guy from New Zealand, always angry
---
Lol I did the same with my first char, hunter, stopped at 52, rerolled rogue, totally worth it. 
---
I almost put in a disclaimer to not choose this one but wanted to see how many people would do so haha 
---
I played paladin back in vanilla. I've never even touched a warlock in my 14 years of playing. Should I roll a lock for classic this summer? 
---
Good answer, that was a close one
---
I mean, that's the dream for a lot of us, including some high profile streamers.  I think it's often left unstated because people realize it's unlikely and don't want to jinx the small chance there is that it will actually happen.
---
Either way it doesn't matter.  They're level 8-9 mobs, the Durotar Tigers are 7-8 versus the Kul Tiras guys who are 5-7 and Razormane dudes in the area just southwest of Razorhill that are 6-7.
---
This would absolutely suck. I REALLY don't want to get stuck on a streamers server. Good god what a travesty and waste of time that would be for me :(
---
Yea I thought about that to (given the HUGE shoulders), but I'm more partial to Trolls. I like their more laid back culture. 
---
Ah man. The city raids in Vanilla/BC WoW were some of my favorite moments in back in the day. We had this obsession to go and raid all of the Alliance cities that it became almost like our "weekly raid" equivalent. My guild weren't particularly interested in raiding, however we really enjoyed the world PVP, idk if it was because we all came from Warcraft 3 or what, but we always wanted those giant battles between horde and the alliance. We got fairly known in our realm as the jackasses who went to burn down Stormwind every other Friday. On some days the Alliance players would very quickly organize a defense and attack us back on the same days. 
---
~~Fuck me, those were the days.~~  
---
Need hell choosing between Warlock, Hunter, and Shaman.
---
I will be doing mostly 5 mans and BGs since I have a family now which means no time for raiding.
---
Which class/spec/race combo is best for that setup? 
---
I always think there's a debate but in the end it'll be horde. Probably UD mage or priest.
---
You?
---
you lack context
---
depending on your class an enjoyment of farming you could go alchemy / engineering and buy the herbs / ore you need or get a farming alt. 
---
It’s very much like the D&amp;D. Some people are more hardcore than others. You’ll see cool RP events in the open world. I tend to find the players to be more serious about the WoW experience and having fun doing whatever. PvP is a necessary part of wow RP because you can fully get into the faction vs faction feel. 
---
Oh man, we had our Warlock friend come with us to Stockades and would summon people and kick them so they'd have to exit and face the angry mob of Alliance we caught the attention of on our journey into the dungeon. I think only 2 of about 10 people shift-clicked our name to see where we were.
---
&gt; The druid can, well, turn into a sealion and be useless 
---
Baaaaahahahahaha - this is the greatest synapsis of druid play in Vanilla WoW, perhaps EVER!
---
Right?
---
Rogue: hah! yeah! topped damage again!
---
Lock: Yeah...10% of that came from my curse, so we'll just add that to my pile...
---
They look so cozy
---
...also why I always enjoyed interrupting the case on the dreadsteed - and never cared if I died for it, it was worth it EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
---
wow classic will only be on mobile.
---
Yeah when Nost got shut down and that big petition happened I got real annoyed with his attitude toward the whole situation. Him and Jesse Cox going on like "Its an illegal private server what did you expect, stop whining" totally missing the point.
---
Please
---
I'm curious why you liked Alliance Warlock? It seems they're a bit unrepresented on Alliance. From what I can tell Blessing of Salvation might be the real difference maker in terms of Warlock PvE. I'm still juggling alliance lock or alliance mage as a main. 
---
TLDR It seems like alliance Lock is a great choice for PvE? 
---
 
---
I want the 41 point talents so badly. 
---
What about stacked souls? Instead of taking up a whole slot, why not even just 10 in a stack?
---
Iggy.. from archeage ? Is it you ? 
---
Thank you so much! I just got home. I’ll give it a read tonight :)
---
Anathema/Benediction 
---
Not to mention, get that mount at 40 and everything starts to get a whole lot faster.
---
Excitement building
---
I miss portal 
---
Yes because it's blizzlike well on pvp servers.
---
Can't forget that Den in the Nelf starting zone
---
fucking pwned
---
click, click, click i can hear it in my head
---
That is what’s commonly referred to as an analogy! Regardless, it’s extremely reductive and dishonest to say crashing that funeral was just “world pvp”.
---
i meann u can still tell how strong someone is based on health pools obv doesnt show if theyre any good but u know that really hasnt changed much
---
honestly you see everything ppl wearing trash, wearing full sets and then ppl trying to be creative
---
These guys were all asshats and proud of it. 
---
It's good that you know who you self-identify with.
---
Oh wow ok!! I thought vanilla was 10% too!! Good to know! That makes it easier to go NE!!!
---
&gt;Enhancement may be shitty for damage but at the end of the day, it's a mail-wearing melee class that can heal, interrupt, and snare (literally the only class in the entire game that can do all 3 of those very important things, by the way) with plenty of utility totems including fear breaking on no cooldown.
---
Enhancement cannot snare. Maybe you meant slow? Their fear breaking ability comes from grounding totem, which ticks in an area around it every 5 seconds (importantly, you cannot cast grounding totem when already feared). And I don't really get the point - nobody seriously contends that Shaman is good (or that, for example his healing or CC is good). Your point is totally agnostic to how good they actually are - suppose enhancement shamans dealt 10% the damage they currently do and healed for 10% of it. You could literally write the exact same thing you just wrote. To show the importance of numbers to the discussion, let me create a parallel argument:
---
Melee priest may be shitty for damage but at the end of the day, it's a melee class that can heal, AoE Fear, silence, dispell, and shield (literally the only class in the entire game that can do all of those very important things, by the way) with the ability to heal you even after he dies! It's not as if they have nothing going for them, they're just not great for raids. 
---
See the problem? Melee priest is fucking terrible. Yet I made him sound pretty good, at least until you look into the numbers. It's only be looking at the numbers that you actually get a good picture of the state of balance (Of course this also draws into relief the question of - just because some particular playstyle is bad, does that mean we should buff it?)
---
&gt;It's not as if they have nothing going for them, they're just not great for raids.
---
What is this "something going for them?" As I said earlier, they're worse than average levelers. They certainly don't excel at solo gold farming. They're fine in dungeons (but this says more about the difficulty of dungeons than it does the state of shamans). They're terrible in Raid PvE. They're terrible in premade PvP (not even considered for the 2 fairly open flex spots in a serious premade). 
---
I ask you seriously - what aspect of the game did you have in mind? I feel like we're talking past each other here. You pointed to particular abilities they had, which considering the aspects you identified, were probably relevant for PvP. I'm pointing out that *despite having these abilities you identified* they're not even considered for one of the 2 open flex spots in a serious premade PvP group. What's the relevance (from a balance perspective) of somebody having some particular abilities, if even if they have that ability, they're still terrible? 
---
This is why I don't think they should release a mapping of "these original vanilla servers should go to server X." Would suck for your home server to be bundled with a streamer server. 
---
Pure evil.
---
What about trying to speedlevel and failing miserably at it?
---
Holy human pally for the win... played a month before tbc as one but switched to blood elf pally right at start of tbc. Gonna be a hard change going from horde to alliance main but ill be a pally main till the day i die. Love seeing these polls
---
The skull is a completely different topic imo. It is an easy to swap slot. That means he goes into general utility like world consumables, potions and gizmos
---
The catseye googles give you a chance to have the upper hand before it comes to a fight, but they are worthless to you once you are in said fight. Simply because you can't swap them on the fly. (with only two classes as exception for this ... or X if you count switfy's exploit that won't be available in 1.12 anymore
---
That lowers their overall value for my personal preferences. Doom is a nice utility tool. Same goes for alliance with the always overlooked or forgotten 'Zin' trinket to become poly/blind/gauge/sap/trap immune.
---
1) Streamers are not going to announce their servers beforehand. That would be stupid. It guarantees they get flooded with trolls and griefed. By keeping it secret, there's a lot less of that and shards dilute it even more. 
---
Serious question: why does it seem that 90% of all Horde hunters in Vanilla were Taurens ?
---
It’s also easier to be one of the best nelf priests on your server.
---
Could also just go mage on horde, you naturally dont face many locks on alliance which are your bane and you're basically the most op class in the game in almost every aspect/patch.
---
Idk. I preferred it.
---
Diablo 2 allowed for another level of prestige and character development if you were willing to Max out the leveling.
---
And it’s OP in WSG.
---
You've not played many RPGs then. 
---
Yeah, I had spent the past few months watching my 3 older brothers all playing, it was a nightmare haha, I used to get to play when they were alseep on weekend mornings, I would have to sneak into one of their rooms to play! Good times.... haha
---
You usually need to grind out at least 3 levels in the 40s.
---
Note this is a reference to private server Barrens chat. I can't remember the last time I've actually seen somebody use Barrens chat on retail. 
---
Hello guy from Daggerspine
---
&gt;but the ideal PVP spec is arms. 
---
Swifty would like to have a word with you.
---
Which they probably won't be doing, as it just means they will be plagued with trolls. 
---
So basically 3 strong weekends of play to hit 60.
---
No rush :)
---
I think by high pop he means consistently near the 2500-3500 cap. Not increased pop realms. 
---
I clicked my spells all through vanilla and BC. Forced myself to switch before wrath hit and it was difficult at first but once I got used to it, it’s much much better. Just gotta bite the bullet and accept that it will suck for a little bit but ultimately be worth it.
---
Shaman confirmed, only healer to never have to wear that fucking light blue dress 
---
I still cringe whenever I see a hunter T3 listed as BiS for anything other than OG/IF strutting.
---
I would be happy to hear from you how you are doing me a service.  I actually feel pretty strongly that - if communicating online is the new norm for interpersonal interaction, we're going to be better off if we can learn how to have civil disagreements - learn how to treat each other with respect and empathy - like real human beings talk to each other - *especially* when we disagree.
---
So, I'm down! I challenge you to explain to me how you are doing me a service, and I trust you're a smart enough person to figure out how to express your thoughts in a civil manner :)
---
I always loved the fantasy of the warlock class and knowing that they were under-represented on alliance side was a bonus for me.
---
From a "social" aspect: We never really had more than 3-5 active warlocks in our guild at one time and just by being super reliable, showing up to raids, and having consumes/summons ready to go I was able to move up in the guild and become an officer/class leader quick and easy. As a player, I enjoy notoriety, guild politics, and being a greater part of the team so by playing a class that wasn't "a dime a dozen" I was able to achieve that easier than maybe a mage or rogue would be able to. 
---
From a game play aspect there is a lot to love about warlocks: 
---
1: Easy to find a guild and raid spots
---
2: Competitive DPS once hit gear becomes more common-place 
---
3: Important utility functions (summons, debuffs, healthstones, blood pact)
---
4: Free mounts
---
5: Breezy leveling
---
6: Strong PVP , even as alliance. 
---
Salvation is a game changer for Alliance warlocks since we lack any aggro reset abilities.
---
Some drawbacks compared to a mage might be: 
---
1)A mage of equal skill and gear will always out-DPS you, but that isn't a huge deal breaker for me personally.
---
2)Mages have better options for grinding gold and they are usually much easier options than what a warlock has available. I usually relied on herb farming to make my cash which was a slog at times. 
---
3)Portals
---
Neat! Rising early on the weekend mornings, that's dedication... but it had to be worth it, lol :-\]
---
It’s weird how all the spells come out of the other hand there haha
---
multiple reasons I guess.
---
The biggest being that no one cared (or new) about min maxing (and to tell you a secret, aside from a patchwork dps d-ck measurement contest its completely irrelevant)
---
\-
---
For PvP they were and imo still are a better choice.
---
the entire 'outdoor boy/gal' of the tauren and the general 'hunter' theme both appeal to the same audience
---
I agree that most of the lock tier sets will look better on a human, but I'm still gonna roll gnome to try and hide that Bloodvine that I know I'll be wearing.
---
Also T3 lock set doesn't look half bad on gnome.
---
Currently bouncing between a mage, warlock, and shaman. I've never really healed before, so I'm a little apprehensive about sham, but the class fantasy really appeals to me. Mage sounds fun, I've heard they're just great DPS all around, but I'm still just a lil worried about gear competition (even after that post I made lol oops). Warlock sounds like it has less pressure than a mage and the utility sounds real nice, but soul shards sound like a pain and I'm not as interested in all the evil death stuff. Plus, I'd like to play orc and they look a little dumb on a horse imo. In an ideal world, I'd raid as enhance, but that's not realistic apparently. 
---
I like PvE and I like utility. I'm open to any other suggestions! 
---
If you want to roll a gnome because of mini maxing then trust me roll a gnome. If you’re a compulsive mini maxer and you roll a human you will regret it.
---
Trust me.
---
I know.
---
Winter 2017.
---
It's like fat shaming a fat ass. So hopefully they cut that shit out and start taking care of themselves. You help save thier life.
---
So in your case, maybe it will take you out of your delusion and back to reality. Look at your decisions in life and what brought you here to speak like this. Ultimately, speaking to me, you have gone wrong somewhere. And you will now work on that.
---
Or learn nothing and be the same you that you have always been. You choose the left side mentality or your right side is to strong and learn nothing from our interaction.
---
It was a watercooler.

TLDR: modern version of wow is getting modified to become the classic wow.
---
warlocks are premier dps once aq and naxx roll around
---
Try this. Someone posted the Blizzcon footage to youtube.
---
[https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=527](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=527)
---
Haha just remembered this, mages in my guild would do similar. Either drop a Darnassus port when everyone's asking for IF port after a raid, or drop the Darn port on the exact same spot as the IF port, so it's 50/50 which you get when you right click.
---
Wow, that popped right into my head. It's amazing the recall we can have associated with fond/traumatizing memories
---
Daggerspine was the shit and your name sounds familiar
---
&gt;plagueheart being out of this world, and it feels kinda wasted on a gnome.
---
Nah plagueheart looks sick as shit, just roll male gnome ez clap
---
Let me say two things
---
**ONLY ONE MAY RISE**
---
and
---
Hey you need rep for this set quest? So tokens go out to people who have that rep finished. That's what basically any form of reasonable raidlead will do. 
---
With that said (only gonna roll humans on warlock alts and everything else is living in NE land :p ) 
---
I rolled on a new server, darrowmere, in vanilla. My guild master was on his fourth warrior to hit 60. Idk his logic. 
---
AO represent!
---
I'd be down
---
When I was a kid and my warlock got that spell at 42, I almost couldn't believe it was real. Like, this far into playing, I get this tremendously good spell? It's like fear but instant, and life drain but instant, and can't be stopped by fear immune? Wat?
---
&gt;Proof has been found by great individuals that the stereotypes of classes and specs do not hold true if you're willing to work. 
---
Okay I'm on board
---
&gt;Sincerely,
---
Retribution Paladin 
---
Nope.
---
Really Sticky Glue from the quests in sinjin. Fun fact: Some time before 1.12 it wasn't BOP and was godlike in PvP. I used to roll a character just to earn and sell it on the AH for a ton of money. Paid for med school, so to speak. 
---
Depends on the class, somewhere in early 40s is the halfway
---
You know what would put a smile on my face. If they shut down the entire thing for the classic servers
---
Sadly that won't happen. At least I can relish in the knowledge that people who rely on healbot and decursive on their Plague servers will struggle really hard as those scripts/bots are violating the EULA
---
Gotta go fast.
---
The same thought on the topic as back then.
---
I dare anyone who did something like that to stand up in a bar with other wow players and to openly brag about it
---
Mainly because I always wanted to see how someone tries to pick up their teeth with shattered hands ;)
---
Okay so not specifically 7.3.5 then.  
---
Thanks.  
---
40s is great until lvl 46-47 which sucks if you can't find a group to do jintha alor quests with, you'll have to grind mobs or do zf/mara
---
What did he use?
---
Oh man I have to go to bed soon, does he specifically say 7.3.5 legion client in the panel? I've rewatched the entire thing three times for various reasons and I can't seem to remember him being that specific.  
---
Fyi, the shield used by the warriors is a healing shield. The one you will be using drops from Sapphiron.
---
[Fire flakes?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzewAOVcTt8&amp;t=30s)

Morgan Freeman should do the voice. 
---
I advise watching it tomorrow with fresh eyes. Its very good info. . And its the modern client and from one slide it is apparent that it will be kept modern to fit the systems.
---
Hi guys iggy here 
---
Heck of a lot further from Ironforge, though. If you have to walk to BG entrances, low level BG's just don't happen.
---
I thought more set bonuses were strong enough to make up for the drop in stats
---
Like I thought I remembered something about shaman t1 8 piece set bonus being very strong
---
High effort meme
---
This is what I'm going to do lol. 
---
So far? None of them.
---
They are all based on glorified solo dps simulation examples
---
When people tell hunters to go for T3 over keeping T2 to snowball each other, to sit and drink during fights, how T3 is turning sitting and drinking into a thing of the past, how they value cats over wolfs because they don't even consider to be within 15y range in a melee (or alliance even a full hunter when every howl buffs 10 entities every 10 seconds) groups or to always go dual wield and never to consider raptor diving between AiS rotations based on IAotH procs you know why they are performing so miserably on plague servers

Thanks, this was the type of response I was looking for.

Being immortalized is closer to being alive than being dead. Pretty sure they wanted to live.

Search 'after nax' on this sub. There's over 20 results, and that's not even including the 'What about TBC/Wrath?' threads, of which there's probably dozens more.

get ur pve out of the way before doing pvp

rofl frostnova basically no cooldown, he nukes the shit out of that rogue and then just novas and repeats.

Don’t like PvP, don’t play on a PvP server.

Oh okay so not specifically 7.3.5 then.  
---
Thanks 
---
Depends on if the old epic mounts are available or not.
---
An odd question, but I just wanted to get a feeling for something. How much actual discrimination would you expect I would reason come launch playing a Gnome Warrior in PVE? I mean, would it be to the point of not being able to get a tanking/dps spot in a raid?
---
You can’t really see boots on Tauren though !
---
What connection do the two have? I don't understand your statement, I am talking about the guy in the wow raid who is angry.
---
I swear I was in a guild with that person...was that guild part of a server transfer? I believe the original guild name was Gankers Inc.
---
Fury. I also PVP'd as fury from early bc till I quit in legion. It's not as strong and I'm not swifty but it's the spec I played because it's why i played a warrior. 
---
people actually pick their classes because of better racials and not because they want a pretty character, guess im the minority now lmao
---
Nolimit is the person I described
---
Damn why do mages look homeless up until the end? 
---
You got that dodge bonus, nelf tanks aren't bad.
---
Everytime the mage finished a cast i couldn't help but think of the Age of Empires Priests going wohlololo.
---
"supposed to take time" Yes it takes about 5 days or so to get max level, that is how long it takes? Anything slower is a player choice which is great because WoW is an openworld game where players get to choose how fast or slow they can access content. 
---
I say frustrated because you describe a series of events which you aren't really seriously entitled to be shielded from. People can spend mommy and daddies money, people can force feed gear to streamers in exchange for celebrity status pumping up guild numbers, and all other situations. I doubt any streamer will ever pay for a lvl 60 mount, people who won't donate real money might send them any number of gold they feel like. So none of these things really violate you personally, but you are here complaining about them feeling entitled to immunity. Your original post is cringey, it reads like a jealous little kid in my opinion. I already said I sympathize with not wanting to be on a streamer server also, I agree it isn't fun for some people subjectively.
---
For some reason in my head i thought i usally went 48/49. But might just be because the zone shows 48 i have that feeling i actually think it's 50-52 u usally start going their, so yeah u are correct :p

I raided with Crimson Dragoons, Eternal, abd Fury of the Boggling in vanilla.  I ended up in Impulse with a few of the guys in this screenshot in TBC. 
---
No problem. I'm a bit confused why your thread got downvoted so hard. I'm sorry about that.
---
I dont know. I dont personally remember this. Screenshot looks like its from world of roguecraft. I always assume that was just a bug with the MyWarCraftStudio or whatever that program was called.
---
That is, in fact, solid advice. I missed vanilla once, don’t wanna do it again
---
We were all too broke/cheap to rent a vent server, so at one point, we used Skype for 20mans (RBGs, raids, pugs, something, I don't remember).
---
Yeah it was about as goddamn terrible as you could imagine. 
---
One guy, I swear to god, had his microphone glued to his mechanical keyboard, and he button mashed HARD. One guy had like 7 kids with a TV on in the background, one guy lived in a college dorm and people were always partying or screaming while drunk, another guy had like 4 dogs that barked at each other every 6 seconds, one guy was either always sick or always high on coke and was constantly snorting/coughing ... 
---
I'm getting some form of PTSD by typing all these horrible memories out. 
---
Gnomes are just stupid. Now I might not gank other ally races if I'm feeling nice. But gnomes are dead 100% of the time.
---
Roll what you think is cooler. Esp because Alliance Locks should be rare. Nobody really will care.

I mean it was sarcasm, but the point is I think when people choose to grieve a dead person online and you do know will cause that level of emotional stress to them, yes I would compare it to harassing people in a real funeral, and using words or actions that you know would offend them.
---
Where is my strawman? I chose a sensitive subject sure, but I could have drawn 1 million examples. Holding signs and laughing at people who have to euthanize an old pet would be pretty bad.
---
If my example that you want to try to isolate is a strawman, then calling that "just computer gamingz" is also a strawman. Both are really just forms of speech you can't physically harm someone in a videogame and in both cases no real threats were made.
---
I don’t need it...

Are you claiming that screenshot of the in-game player named "nolimit" is the same guy in the NZ event?
---
You mean The Face of death?
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=23043/the-face-of-death
---
God I hope you are right, this fits MUCH better than that healing shield.
---
I want to go under Stormwind
---
Yes thats the one. It will have almost identical armor and block value as the healing shield from Kel'thuzad.
---
This is incorrect. Casting aimed shot would not break meld until you let loose the ammo. You could cancel midcast and not break stealth. I found an old post saying it was changed in 1.10, though. So it looks like it will break meld during Classic release.
---
Yeah, it would be sweet if they implement those. I always wanted one on retail, would love to secure one on the official servers.
---
breaking your own shit is not illegal. hitting your wife in the face is. 
---
The thing i love the most about these screenshots are the names, good solid RPG esc names now days its just xXpussyslayer69Xx and xxillidaanxx and stupid shit like that.
---
I didn’t raid on my hunter till BC. Vanilla hunters are supposed to rotate raptor strike between aimed shots? Tell me more. I’d like to be as good at vanilla raiding as I was in BC. Completely different class, here I was planning on playing shaman. 
---
All the subtle passive aggressive remarks are not going unnoticed. Having to try and moderate or handle him when he just said the grinds are optional.

---
* "it's ok" Yeah I think again we are talking about a game
---
* "it is the internet after all" new scientific discovery

Your entire response to him saying those grinds were optional, which changes their consideration gets ignored by you in favor of just 3 empty responses that look like gas lighting.
---
Am I reading too much into that?
---
You're replying to the wrong person/
---
are you stupid. he’s just describing the player you posted about. 
---
my bad, that last comment was directed at itsnotmywallet\_, he replied to me.
---
brings back memories of how hard it was to get a full raid sometimes. and no one wants to go to the trouble of finding and bringing multiple pugs who would often throw off the whole loot system and then leave early anyway. 
---
This is provided the API will allow it.
---
* Questie: Zygor has stated they will look at porting once the beta is out. It would also be nice to see the old QuestHelper picked up. But I suspect Questie might get updated.
---
* OmniCC - Is available in retail and used now. 
---
* LoseControl- Is updated for retail
---
* ThreatMeter - I would use Skada or Details! if they update. Both of these will give you DPS and Threat.
---
* Enemy Cast Bar - Hrm. I know there are things out there and might even be part of the new UI system
---
My list of wanted addons

It's a super weird thing to say by him.
---
that's funny cause I ended up in Impulse too but quit right before TBC
---
Damn, I was hoping to see [this guy](https://i.imgur.com/1GitpjE.jpg) in there somewhere.
---
Honestly my buddy and I plan on doing the 49 twink thing. With that it doesn’t matter what end game content is. Your end game content is running BGs and having fun. :)

I thought paladins could dual wield, so I rolled need on a cruel barb despite having a better main hand weapon.

Yep
---
Yeah I'm really gonna miss this, was one of my favorite parts of vanilla. Is this the video you were thinking of by any chance?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb2dBpCtGb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb2dBpCtGb4) 
---
It wasn't changed till BC and even then it was in the late S3 due to NE druids simply drinking in stealth.
---
Prior to that change eating, drinking and casting did not break Shadowmeld prior to actually firing/finishing a cast
---
Thought it was like Diablo: Every man for himself. I needed int-daggers with my warrior, and tried to run a bit of a scam on person (didn't work, though at one point unrelated to this a dude stole 100g from \*me\* and THAT sucked). 
---
Turns out the game doesn't work like that... At ALL. Fortunately all that happened when I was about level 14 or so doing RFC. 
---
Ooohhhhcchhhhh. Keep that to yo self 
---
Wheres Ret Pally?

Don't fret, there are lots of gnome only clans and are great in pvp for horde who don't tab target, +15 engi has its perks,(ALL PVPers are engineering)  and escape artist is neat, 10 arcane resistance is somewhat good vs sheep on the odd chance it misses 
---
Plus gnome squads look dope as hell, 
---
Pink bobble head gnome is iconic same with demon face bald gnome or beardygnomes  
---
Mechanostriders are the coolest mounts 
---
Not if your playing with high settings and i believe there even is a distance option
---
i completely agree. thankfully i think (most of) the community will not be assholes about well-meaning modern-playing folks who just don't get it, because of course it's more rewarding to help a player out than to just kick them out... unlike SOME mmos lately
---
Warlock. Top tier raid spec along we with very good pvp spec in SM RUIN
---
Yeah, but I expect that to keep the same in Classic once people are back there.
---
My brother got to level 30 before he figured out what the Hearthstone was for. He’d just deleted it when he started and just ran back and forth for everything. 
---
I remember a long time ago, maybe like 2005-2006, Blizzard released a list of the NPCs with the most kills for that month. Pretty much the only thing near the top that wasn't a raid boss was Defias Pillager. So that should be your answer.
---
You could get the naga (or other brand similar mouse) and only use a few until you get used to it. I have the naga (along with keyboard binds), and modifier variants of it it's no issue to know which spell is where once you're used to it. Think I'm at 70 binds atm? Still trying for more but slowly having to change my muscle memory. 
---
Packed or no, I really wish I could port my char to Mulgore and do 1-12 there. I just love the feel of it.

"\[Play Dead\] has been removed"

What a *crock of shit*
---
That's me! I didn't reply to you, I replied to a guy who replied to you lol
---
People who stick to a raid-specific spec tend to have pretty good gear and access to heavy consumables. That alone makes up for it. The other day on a private server I fought a Fury Warrior with Thunderfury + FAPs and he played me far better than any Arms Warrior that I ever went up against. (Still killed him, though.)
---
Hybrids in particular (Druids, Shaman, Paladins) have popular one-size-fits-all specs that allow them to heal raids with 95% of the effectiveness of a full healer build. In Vanilla, your class is more important than your specialization - a Shaman is a Shaman regardless of his talent choices. That gets reversed from TBC onwards.
---
All of the gaming mice have issues, not just Naga. Naga is vastly more popular and thus more people are seen complaining. If you search for issues with the Logitech and Corsair ones you'll see they have basically the same issues (double clicks and whatever). 
---
Good to hear haha I've always been a horde player but alliance is fun to experience all the different content sometimes. Probably going to do hunter or mage or warrior on troll, orc, or undead all those are cool. 
---
We should play together when it launches I got no friends to play with gotta start at some point. 
---
yes!!!
---
the first time i played vanilla wow i rolled a shaman and ended up grouping with two people for all of the durotar quests so it wasn't too rough, but when i did my first solo toon... you mean when thrall tells me to go in that cave i can't just charge in by myself?! woah, it was awesome and eye-opening tbh
---
As I’m forming dungeon groups I’m definitely going to be asking people what their experience in WoW is so I’ll know if I need to give them the “this isn’t retail” talk ahead of time to prevent groups from falling apart after the first wipe/corpse run when their expectations don’t meet reality haha :) 
---
&gt; T3 over keeping T2 to snowball each other
---
At the point you are considering wether or not you use T3 you are already pretty much done with raiding. Full endgame gear is *mostly* there for eye candy and PvP. Also I doubt your argument has any merit.
---
&gt; cats over wolfs
---
Both are often recommended and we're talking about very insignificant differences here for content where Hunters fall off (AQ/Naxx) their pet damage and howl becomes less and less impactful so basically it doesn't matter nearly as much as you make it sound.
---
&gt; and never to consider raptor diving between AiS rotations based on IAotH procs
---
That's actually not true. I remember at least one in depth guide that discusses rotations. It is also common knowledge on pservers to use Raptor/Sapper in rotations. If anything Hunters got much better in the last years than they were ever before.
---
&gt; well at least we know why they are performing so miserably on plague servers
---
They aren't performing miserably at all. They are just not keeping up with pure DPS in later raids, but are still essential.
---
I didn't want to go back and change anything in the list, because as I noted there are always debatable alternatives and of course the fact that not everyone will get the BIS stuff reliably anyway, but in this case I'm changing this nasty looking healing shield post haste.
---
When I made the screenshots I was mentally prepared for certain items ruining an otherwise good look, but this healing shield combined with the epic Dreadnaught actually broke my heart.
---
Same deal with Shaman T3, which looks so badass, but again the turquoise/blue abomination ruins everything.
---
Prating for a PFUI or is it PUFI port !?! That UI is honestly so helpful. Xp per hour gold per hour, time, customizable bars,ui frame. Really sweet custom profiles. I'd never want to use any other ui addon

&gt;Scholomance is now spelled "Sko-lo-mance" to alleviate confusion about its pronunciation. In addition, a sound file has been added outside the instance portal which will phonetically sound out the name upon zoning.
---
This one would have actually been helpful =D
---
Mage for decent damage and portals for fast travel everywhere. Warlock for instant dungeon pugs (LF2M DPS Dungeons, can summon, already have tank heals) You'll have 0 wait time for dungeons, but with the mage option you won't spend so much time traveling after unlocking portals.
---
No problem was just saying sorry, cheers man.

---
Shaman 30/0/21?
---
I personally think it’s a perfect way for them to pick up
---
Subscribers that have been sitting on private servers. 
---
Might as well host them yourself and get the subs. Not saying it’s their motivation but their own analyst will or should realize that it benefits everyone. People get to play on supported servers and they get subs. (I understand that classic will be tied to retail sub)
---
It is an option if the fight allows you to stay close to the melee zerg. However it doesn't mean that its always ideal either.
---
The core concept is that you have a free window between two aimed shots whereby you are just standing there chaining two autoshots in a row. That's the timeframe you can fill with something useful
---
(auto, aimed, auto, multi, auto &lt;space&gt;&gt; auto) 
---
During this  window you: toss a grenade, FD to swap trinkets, get bored and pick your nose
---
Or you can dive in 3 yards for a melee hit (preferably combined with a sapper charge when rdy as raptor is on the next swing and not on the gcd) and dip out back out 3y into firing range
---
The key point is to understand that you only need to glance the melee hit box (the transition from the 8y dead zone and the 5y melee range) you won't stay there.
---
When a haste effect like improved aspect of the hawk/rapid fire is up this nets you no benefit as you will lose out more dps by delaying autoshots (though this depends on your gear and the potential 2 handed weapon's dmg)  
---
It also depends massively on the hitbox of bosses. Some of them have hilariously small hitboxes (as silly as it sounds giants are a perfect example for this) that force you way closer. In those events its once again not really useful  
---
Didn't you know? They didn't exist in Vanilla, and nobody will play them in Classic because they're so dogshit therefore there's no reason to encourage any type of BiS list or include them in anything regarding raiding or premade PvP. In fact there are rumors Classic will release without the Retribution tree, much to the delight of every person that's played on a private vanilla server a.k.a Casters, rogues, and warriors.
---
I actually did something similar. I just deleted just about every starting item because "I wouldn't need it". Glad to see I'm not the only one 
---
I learned everything that I know about women from Barrens chat.
---
Talk about chaotic evil! How did you get scammed though?
---
*Damn*
---
Haha, I actually just got this a couple of days on a private server, sold it to a lock for 150g.
---
I didn’t say it was easy. I said you should be doing it anyways. 
---
Hold on now, (DM is in Phase 2)[https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346].
---
Obviously we don't know timeframes, but at least for me, I doubt I'll be in a position to afford it very long (if at all) before DM comes out.
---
The one advantage to the dynamic modern internet I think is that we can have crazy player organized events, you could have like a bunch of mages all meet up and agree to melee eachother or walk a bunch of horde into stormwind without any players fighting
---
Late to the party but US Medivh resident.
---
There were four alliance players I remember vividly. Kalahad, who was the first individual in the world to open aq gates to get scarab mount, he was a dwarf warrior MT from Fury. Ryanoasky(spelling) perennial grand marshal night elf warrior. I swear I beat him in a duel once... Teagen, second in realm pvp, female gnome rogue. Axedragon - human paladin who was the face of goldshire. At one point had the largest guild, filled with low level players. 
---
There was also an high warlord orc shaman with hand of rag, but the name eludes me.
---
There was also a group of guilds on the server that were along the lines of OMGLAZRGUNPEWPEWPEW
---
Dude did a few dungeons with me and asked to borrow the last 100g for his epic mount. I was an idiot and agreed to it and he never gave me it back. He was a Night Elf Hunter named Syvaris on Stonemaul. 
---
sorry no, sac is awful against good rogues, you are dead after the first one
---
Also there is PvP there if you get lucky.
---
its because you value some shitty stats more than the actual benefit the item gives

that's a good idea! i'll do the same at the beginning, then

"and why am i even answering you? :)"

&gt;Remember that Vanilla is rock, paper, scissors.
---
And Shadow Priest is lava until they go oom.
---
...what’s a paladin?
---
All I see are totems
---
I'm in the same boat. I was set on rolling a healer myself but tried a lock on pserver and it messed everything up because I absolutely loved it. Now I am 90% sure about rolling Lock but worried that I'll miss healing.
---
likewise, I remember there was a time when tauren shoulders were too small.
---
They missed a golden opportunity to use the quote "Taste the flames of sulfuron!"
---
**The Light is my strength.**
---
Ally lock is the only option for max DPS. Blessing of Salv really allows Locks to let loose the damage. And a lot of people pick Orc for stun resist. Not as bad as you think.
---
And how noticeable is the damage increase? 
---
On wolves:
---
an average of +50 dmg on 10 entities (ideal in hunter group) every 10 seconds equals 50 raid dps (prior mitigation)
---
or +30 raid dps before armor mitigation in a generic 1 hunter melee group
---
Cat's can't keep up with that. They aren't even close to it. But hunters still go for cats because it pushes their own e-pen meter over the raid dps.
---
-
---
T2 snowball is way too insanely good to ever forsake it (aside from resistance fights, or raids with a low amount of hunters in it)
---
A mistake many guilds made during the beginning of naxx was to move away from it.
---
For the math: People consider 1000 agi the moment to reroll into SV for the net bonus on attack power they get over just running trueshot (leaving the additional crit out of the way for the moment)
---
So not counting AP buffs and items you have a hunter with 2200+ range AP in naxx.
---
A typical alliance raid during classic was running 4-6 hunters each buffing all of them with +450 range ap for 7 seconds every time their set procs.
---
Sounds negligible - right? That's the catch on the topic You don't overwrite another hunters debuff when it procs. You place your own. So you can have 1,2, 4 or even 6 debuffs on the target. 
---
We are talking about fluctuations between +0 and 450xhunters RAP
---
This was the reason why old thottbot was filled with hunters complaining about aggro when their raid got more and more full T2 sets
---
This was the inspiration behind reintroducing the mechanic (on a singleplayer debuff level) with patient sniper in legion. (the launch version that changed the 30 sec debuff to the short and much more potent one)
---
All because it was so f-cking overpowered. And I still don't get it why this private server crowd is so fixated on their 'muh t3 set' vibe. Sure T3 looks fancy, and it sims better if you only count 1 or 2 hunters in the raid. But that's all that's going for T3. (not to mention that we sadly never got the original T3 design with the hunter going ape_flip berserk when the pet dies. I was so giddy for that when it was initially announced :( )
---
to be honest, they're a lot like D&amp;D 3.5e wizards, just the other side of the coin. summoning and binding demons? check. damage over time spells? check. siphoning the life force of others? check, iirc.
---
mages got the elemental, "melt-your-dick-off" spells, while warlock got the debuffs and summoning.
---
lionheart bis in all of vanilla
---
Not to me. I love the 40-50 zones. Ungoro, tanaris, hinterlands and feralas always feels like a breeze, partly because you can just snag all the quests at once and grind them all together in one fell swoop.
---
25-35 is where I dread though. STV camps, desolace, arathi...it sends you somewhere else, then back, then to again with so much running w/o a mount. I always feel like I get 3/4th or maybe a level everytime I clear a zone in this range before heading off elsewhere..
---
I always go to ungoro at 48/49 personally. Might be inefficient but its possible. 
---
Yeah, I'd remember his name a decade later as well if he stole that much from me. 
---
Sulfuron brings the shoulder boobs.
---
Slows are snares. Frost shock and Earthbind are snares. Anyway, I don't really get the priest comparison. Everyone knows that enhancement shaman damage is [decent at worst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmUMxLk-E4&amp;t=10m27s). You seem to have a bizarre bone to pick with enhancement, they're really not as bad as you seem to think, and they have a VERY solid ranged tree available to them anyway.
---
The point of my first post is that the talk of developer intent is pointless, not to argue over what classes are better than others. Hunters and warlocks were just examples. I really don't care much to argue over what specs are better at what things.
---
Realistically there is little to no room for improvement or rebalancing. The developers have repeatedly shown that their idea of "balance" is very different from the game that classic players want to play, regardless of the original developers' intent. We'd end up with garbage like "pvp-only nerfs" and breaking the 14 AP or 3.5 SP laws. There are some small changes that would be reasonable enough (for example I wouldn't mind seeing seal of command be a % instead of PPM thus making paladins the only class incentivized to use faster 2h due to spell damage's scaling with SOC), but I genuinely don't believe that the current staff at Blizzard understands the game well enough to make good changes. Hell, even during actual vanilla, only about half of the talent revamps were actual improvements to the game overall: mage, rogue, and priest buffs were really not necessary, and while I don't disagree with paladins getting buffed in 1.9, thematically the new trees are a mess. Again, though, I do not believe Blizzard is capable of fixing any of those issues in a way that preserves the game that I want to play.
---
Exactly what I did every time a vanilla private server launched 
---
60 warlock, just follow a low level warrior around and keep Curse of Weakness on him
---
What’s a better MH than Cruel Barb at level 20? Unless you did DM at level 30 with level 30 weapons. 
---
its almost as if..... there's more than one way to play the game.
---
in all seriousness, why would you care if one or a few servers were allowed to have high pop?
---
go ahead and pick low pop, no one is stopping you
---
There's a couple exceptions, but most people have to choose or cough up the gold to pay for switching frequently. SM/Ruin Warlocks, Combat Rogues, Shadowpriests and Arms Warriors and Arcane-Fire mages get away with the best of both worlds in a lot of ways, since their most commonly used raiding specs are also pretty competitive for pvp. These builds are technically suboptimal for raiding but the difference between the optimal build is largely negligible. Especially in the case of Locks &amp; Shadowpriests, as they tend to run into issues of capping on threat, as well as the need to conserve debuff slots. If you enjoy healing for pvp, you also get to double dip a little.
---
There may be some guilds who disapprove of using these builds for progression, and that's understandable, but when you're killing farm content for the 17th time it's not really relevant that you run optimal builds.
---
Thank you! I mained troll shaman in vanilla. Might do an orc lock, troll mage now. 
---
I fully blame Jagex. 
---
Used my talent points randomly in all 3 specs on my druid. I ended up having most of my talents into resto and balance but I leveled in cat form. I did this till like level 40 until I finally respec’d into a proper feral spec. 
---
Is that one name per pet or one name per character?
---
You really think that English speakers are better at English?  My brother's a lawyer who goes out of his way to use precise language, and then goes onto WoW and asks me, "r u ok"
---
best case scenario you are not losing anything and purely benefit of your raptor strike's average dmg/15 (as you still need to cover fd trinket swaps you can't do it during every AiS rotation)
---
worst case you delay an auto by 0.x seconds. Then it's up to your actual equipment to give you a finite answer.
---
Thanks everyone!
---
is that echeyakee
---
I guess it depends how hardcore you want to go at endgame and what class you'll be. As a warrior I always knew alchemy has saved me more times I could count but engineering is definitely very fun to have with all the little gadgets or bombs. 
---
Overall, I always think alchemy has more utility for raids, world pvp abd especially for leveling when you need that extra health pot or speed potion. 
---
of course I value 120 hp and 2 % crit more in a fight on a rogue/hunter than +1,5 more stealth detect levels
---
especially on a hunter when you already sit at +10 lvls without paranoia and well beyond the range of most basic shots to spot rogues before you can actually attack them
---
But apparently you are just here to be grumpy - or you didn't get the memo that we are comparing a leather and a cloth item
---
Alchemy is always good and brings money. Engineering is best for PvP.
---
My brother in law gave me his account before the release of TBC he had core hound tooth daggers on his rogue I kept dying while playing and the daggers were broken and red so I vendored them thinking they were done for good. I was probably 13. 
---
This. Never got it on my priest back in the days
---
&gt;in pvp there wasn't a class I couldn't take on
---
Priests are a pretty hard counter. You basically have a bubble's worth of time to get it done. Mana burn is really all they need and then you can't even dispel anymore.
---
You can also be kited to shit by a Hunter.
---
&gt; Your PVE spec is likely to be prot or fury but the ideal PVP spec is arms. Do you just eat the cost of respeccing every time you wanna go PVP after a raid or do you just subobtimally PVP in your prot/fury spec.
---
If you have enough money to buy raid consumables then you also have enough to respec.
---
&gt; This is true for some other classes too, like druids healing in raids then PVPing in feral, etc.
---
The standard PvP spec for Druids is a healer spec. When you see videos of players wrecking WSG with Druids then they are most likely 8/11/32 or something very similar. Feral is good too because of how strong HotW is. If you find an off-tank spot as a raider you are probably not going to respec, and if you are a healer then you will probably get away with just staying in your PvP spec. Balance/Resto or Moonglow spec is also good for both raiding and PvP, but you won't be your typical flag carrier.
---
There are almost no classes that have a spec which is optimal for both PvP and PvE raiding, but there are some who can make small tradeoffs to be viable in both or have a raiding spec that is decent enough to PvP with. Also there are often way more good PvP specs than there are raiding specs. PvP is often much more about your playstile and having more utility than pure efficiency.
---
&gt;er.net for working out gear upgrades - is there a similar site for shadow priests? Failing that, has anyone theory crafted anything like SpEP I could use to build such a site?
---
If you care about maximizing your damage: you always take the item with more spell power. Intellect is a pretty pathetic stat in longer PvE fights. Especially for Shadow Priests, who get basically zero benefit from crit. This means that green items with the "of Shadow Wrath" affix might be better than epics. Carry some stamina gear (or a Flask of the Titans) for when you absolutely need it - which won't be very often.
---
Regardless of how you choose to gear, you should keep in mind that your primary job is to stack Shadow Weaving for the Warlocks. If you need mana regen on your gear to help you keep casting so that your debuffs stay stacked on all targets, then you should wear the regen gear. That will be more valuable to your group than a few extra points of spell damage.
---
Whats top tier bis foe hunters?
---
Changing specs isn't that hard. 50 gold isn't even a lot.
---
&gt; To me, it seems that while engineering is good for pvp, alchemy also looks incredibly useful. That with **alchemy being better in pve** and gold making
---
Thing about engineering is its really strong in both pvp and pve. Dynamite and sappers can add a lot of dmg, as can arcanite dragonling and gnomish battle chicken. All of the alchemy consumes you can straight up buy so I'd recommend not dropping engineering for alchemy unless going alchemy is the ONLY way you think you'll have potions.
---
For pve it’s not a big difference. The intellect racial gives about 0.2% more crit and slightly more mana than Human Warlocks. 
---
But for pvp Gnome is very strong. Escape artist is incredibly valuable in vanilla pvp and it’s on a 1 minute cd which makes it completely broken. 
---
Aesthetically speaking, yeah gnome is pretty awful. All that shiny tier and pvp gear is barely visible. 
---
Daaamn that’s what’s up !!
---
WSG only had a 60 bracket once released. I remember playing what was probably the first WSG on Ahn Qiraj EU on my hunter that just dinged 60 vs a sole undead mage
---
This. Well said!
---
I aaid this the other day and got downvoted to hell. All I said was..why are people making class advice based off .01% of the time you'll be paying the game. It's like people can only enjoy their class if they know it has the potential to be OP.
---
Lol at people saying “I’ll wait 1-2 months after release before I roll a main so I can find the best server.
---
SUUUUURE 
---
For pvp you have orc stun racial
---
Leveled a priest up to 40-something without ever shooting my wand. I thought they were just for stat boosts...
---
I wanna roll troll shaman but Im weary of their use in game besides healing.  I want to be able to have good dps.  Is shaman viable in classic?  Is troll a good race for it?  Would I be able to be viable as dps?  Is it even fun with all the totems?  I guess I wont know until I play but still.  Just want to have more info about shamans.  Thanks!
---
Jumper cables as hunter ftw
---
I’m assuming you mean 100c or 100s
---
100g is the full cost of a mount.
---
The Dungeon 2 set is actually pretty good for Druids and Shaman in PvP. Those are the two classes that might get the most benefit of that particular set. You can compete with just about anyone as a Druid wearing full Feralheart or a Shaman with the Five Thunder set.
---
The first PvP set is better, though. You can get all of the pieces in that set at Rank 10. If you start playing at launch, then you will be able to get the Rank 10 set before the Dungeon 2 set. You will only aim for Feralheart/Five Thunders if you: 1) start late, or 2) if it takes you a year and a half to reach max level.
---
What about Troll Shamans?  Iirc they look sick.
---
Engineering is just as important in raids.  Dense dynamite, goblin sapper charges, reflector shield, goblin jumper cables, battle chicken, and arcanite dragonling bring a lot of extra utility. 
---
Why not go engineering and alchemy? There’s enough  goods you can make with alchemy where you buy herbs and sell potions back to the auction house for profit.  Or go herbalism/engineering and get a lvl 35 alt who is your alchemist/tailor.  That alt will have a steady income of arcanite transmutes and mooncloth crafting.
---
Engineering is an outstanding profession for dps in both PvP and PvE as North has indicated, many of the benefits of Engineering also require Engineering to use. Alchemy has some pretty intense benefits as well, but those benefits are not bound to the alchemist in the same way that Engineering, (Or even Tailoring for the bop crafting) will have on the early strength of your character. This allows you to purchase the fruits of Alchemy with gold.
---
This is true actually, I can definitely just buy what I could have made with alchemy + have the exclusive engineering items. That said, how does herb + alch compare to mining + eng in terms of gold making? I know herb and alch can do very well making gold throughout all of classic, but I'm not actually sure how mining and engineering do. If I end up spending a lot of my gold getting engineering items, buying transmutes etc I might not have the gold to buy the potions, and I also might be able to get the epic mount much faster with herb alch.
---
Yeah idk even stuff like MM hunter is just suboptimal for PvP since you aren't getting Intimidation or Counterattack with it. Your typical raiding disc Priest isn't going to afford to put full points into Spell Warding, Holy Nova and Blessed Recovery.
---
What I'am saying is that there is no optimal for both. You're always either something in between or weaker in either raids or in pvp. So yeah, farm 2h and respec if you want to be super competitive in both.
---
Any character can use alchemy items. Only engineers can use the majority of engineering items.
---
Any level 35 character can max alchemy. If you plan on making flasks - recipes are pretty rare though - then maybe finish leveling to 60 so you have easier access to scholomance. But if you just want to turn flowers in to elixirs and potions or transmute arcanite, then all you need is level 35. Perhaps an account full of level 35 alts in fact!
---
Okay.
---
All of these are reasons I quit retail, and cannot wait to come back solely for Classic!  
---
Also, no panda's.
---
all Ive ever wanted is the original big shoulders on undead
---
Come on, keep it comin' - these are all so many things I loved about WoW, and as they disapeared, I found fewer and fewer reasons to stay, until I left as Cata released, tried panda, but couldn't stomach it anymore, I was officially done.  
---
...now I'm back!
---
&gt;Slows are snares. Frost shock and Earthbind are snares.
---
Hmm, I've always heard snare used to refer to root effects, like entangling roots. Maybe this is just a the private server jargon.
---
&gt; Everyone knows that enhancement shaman damage is decent at worst.
---
They're not invited to serious premade PvP groups. I'm not sure how much premade PvP you've done, but the standard team is a core of druid FC, MS warrior, Factionclass hero, frost mage. Then there's an additional 4 which are almost always brought, which is a priest, factionclass healer, MS warrior, frost mage. And then you have 2 relatively free flex slots that will change a lot depending on the premade. This is where you'll see a rogue, warlock, or hunter. Often it's just another 2 frost mages. Enhancement shaman is not even considered for those spots. The issue with enhancement shaman is that they just get absolutely kited to death - they're a melee class without any good ability to get up to the enemy caster line. They try to fulfill the same role as a rogue, and just are terrible at it. And they can't fulfill the warrior roll because they don't have mortal strike, nor do they have a rage system. In fact, they have extreme mana problems and their damage plummets when oom. This is a big problem because the heals EASILY outlast their mana pool. I specifically criticized their ability to function in premade groups. In a duel with no healers where the person lets you whack them in face they're totally usable. However if your point is that they're fine in pug PvP, color me unimpressed. Every spec is fine in pug PvP - most of the fights will go the way of whichever class has the better gear (and who has the opener). That's hardly a touchstone to determine good balance. Especially considering you need to be in a premade to push for R14. 
---
&gt;You seem to have a bizarre bone to pick with enhancement, they're really not as bad as you seem to think,
---
I have no bone to pick with them. I mained enhance in Vanilla, and even raided with it! And on Nost as well. (Though on its successor server I played hunter). Do you have much private server experience - because they really are as bad as I say.
---
&gt;and they have a VERY solid ranged tree available to them anyway.
---
30/0/21 is extremely good. It's actually optimal for premades. That factionclass healer I told you about? Yeah that's a 30/0/21 shaman, and you're bringing at least 2 in a premade. But that 0 is the enhancement tree. The "they" in your sentence refers to "enhance." So as far as I can tell, your argument is that enhancement is a good damage dealer because it can put 0 points in enhancement and put it in elemental instead. That's like saying fury warrior is a good tank because you can respec. Prot warrior is a good tank. Warrior is a good tank. Fury warrior is not a good tank. 
---
&gt;ut I genuinely don't believe that the current staff at Blizzard understands the game well enough to make good changes. Hell, even during actual vanilla, only about half of the talent revamps were actual improvements to the game overall: mage, rogue, and priest buffs were really not necessary, and while I don't disagree with paladins getting buffed in 1.9, thematically the new trees are a mess. Again, though, I do not believe Blizzard is capable of fixing any of those issues in a way that preserves the game that I want to play.
---
Fair enough. I suppose we just have different levels of confidence in the dev team to rebalance the game without ruining the specs. 
---
This is a great point actually, and I'm wondering if it might be better to go mining/engineering on my main. Would it be more beneficial to have mining to support the engineering on my main, or herbalism to support the alchemy on my alt? I guess it comes down to what is going to require more resources in the long run, alchemy or engineering.
---
 /cry
---
I played a human on pservers and loved the spirit benefit, but it's actually less useful with the disc spec. The spirit really comes in handy when you have at least 3 set T2 for the 15% in combat regen, along with the talent 15% combat regen for a total of 30%, as well as the 25 points in holy for 25% of spirit added as increased healing/dmg. All of these together make spirit highly useful and it's where humans can really shine, get darkmoon card blue dragon trinket for even more regen and spirit utilization.
---
But I can't disagree with how useful fear ward is; it's just so useful that the stat differences don't make up for it. 
---
Regardless, you should play whatever race/class you like and will have the most fun with. That's what classic is all about.
---
I won't be playing for long hours at a time but voted speed-leveling anyway because in the time I do play, my only focus will be to level quickly.
---
Oh man, TBC heroics was legit - remember when they opened up the Sunwell plateau? Even raid-geared players had some trouble in there at first...
---
Lines up nicely considering I wanted to main a warlock ;D.
---
This is the most cruel shit of all time. "Fear Ward is now only available to Dwarf Females."
---
T1/T2 depending how many hunters in your raid give uptime to T2 8piece
---
Shaman DPS in PVP is amazing. In PVE it is probably the weakest of all the main DPS "offspecs" -- Feral Druid, Ret Pally, and Shadow Priest. Ele and Enhance might both be a step above Boomkin, but not by much.
---
That said, I have seen an Ele shaman do slightly-better-than-middle-of-the-road damage in a casual / semi-hardcore raid setting, so it's certainly possible to not be *the worst* if you min/max consumes
---
Not really, usually groups are more than the sum of their parts. Dungeon elites groups and bosses take a while to kill as well. Shamans specifically scale up their efficiency with each group member.
---
The reason why some people do solo dungeon farming is because it is convienent, not because it is more efficient. You're almost always missing out on some sort of synergy and you cannot clear/reach all the stuff anyways. If you do dungeon farming with a good group you should always look to repeat it as well like guy above you explained.
---
Whats the next best thing to that for druid? I seriously dont want to wear that fucking color
---
Indeed laddy
---
I’d say Enhance is more valuable. 
---
Usually a raid will not have 8 resto shamans to give each party totems, so it’s nice to have an Enhance for extra totems. Plus he can use Nightfall, spec into improved totems, and he can focus on totem twisting since there’s not much else he can do. All things considered it makes the Enhance a somewhat valuable raid member. 
---
This guys got it right.
---
If you feel like going as far as lvl 40-45 to get restorative pot reacipe from badlands you can. At that point you may as well make it a herbalist and lvl to 60. camp some lotus spawns. Make it a rogue so you can vanish if you are training mobs to nodes. Hunter also works and much easier to level. 
---
The transmute is a nice bonus 2.
---
I don't think that Arms is viable for raiding mostly because of Deep Wounds and Mortal Strike taking up valuable debuff slots, other than that it would do just fine
---
Blue-black-white dress for the win!
---
Pro tip: Play what you like most.
---
Especially with healers and tanks, nobody cares that much about those special perks. They are a nice to have, but healers on itself are mandatory.
---
Hey I sent you a pm.
---
He should pick whatever looks coolest to him. Trial by fire, I say.
---
Heh, well Syvaris also was the name of a character in a pretty obscure board game I played at the time (Heroscape) so that helped. 
---
**\[A\] Kiwi/Aus Semi-casual Raiding Guild (NA | PvE)**
---
In Vanilla WoW, many more people ran dungeons as they levelled. It was common to meet likeminded people and make friends as you journeyed through Azeroth. The world was huge, with lots to experience – and that experience was magnified for people who joined a guild whose members supported and helped each other.
---
This is a guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and give and receive help with classes and game mechanics.
---
**Are you a progression guild?**
---
This is intended to be a guild for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60, but there is an expectation to gear up and delve into raiding (and a bit of level 60 PvP).
---
**What are the requirements?**
---
The guild has a few rules:
---
* Be open and willing to accept all different kinds of players, with different levels of experience, a different approach to how they play and different real-life commitments
---
* Have a good attitude to the game in general and towards your guildmates, regardless of how they choose to play; be willing to help others where needed, albeit dungeon runs, supporting alts or helping people with group quests
---
* Be willing, as you approach level 60, to work towards pre-raid gear
---
* Be free for three hours, two nights a week for dedicated raiding progression
---
* Be communicative: let the guild leader or other guild officers know if you need to take a break or can’t attend a raid or event.
---
This is about community and helping each other enjoy the game; but understanding that sometimes life itself prevents you from doing everything you may want to do.
---
**Is this guild only for Kiwis/Aussies?**
---
We will be raiding 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week – but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Do I have to have played vanilla WoW?**
---
I suspect many people who are going to jump into Classic experienced vanilla WoW to some degree. There may be a few dabblers or people who started in TBC or Wrath; but I predict that the majority of those who stick around through to level 60 will be veterans coming into the remake with a nostalgic view.
---
This guild is a place of acceptance, where anyone with the right attitude and willingness to learn and improve can find a home. I’m looking for people with dedication, who are willing to level to 60 and enjoy playing with like-minded people as part of a supportive community.
---
**I didn’t see a name. What is the guild called?**
---
I have a few names in mind, but I’m going to put the guild name to a vote once the game goes live, for two reasons:
---
* If I name the guild now, there’s no guarantee that the name will be available when we get the guild charter up (call me paranoid)
---
* Collective, or at least majority agreement on the name, will give people more investment in the guild
---
I understand that some people may not want to commit until they know what the name of the guild is. We will have many weeks, if not months of levelling to 60, so I don’t expect a full 40-man raid of committed members when Classic goes live. But it sure would be nice!
---
I am also hoping that those who are happy with the choice of name when the time comes will be willing to pitch in and help pay for the guild charter. The more people who pitch in, the sooner we will be able to secure the name that we agree on – if enough people contribute to the 10g fee, we may even snag the name we want within a few days (or even hours) of release.
---
**How do I apply?**
---
We have a guild Discord server ([https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3](https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3)) where you can put in an application; or PM me on Discord: Lokhor#2882.
---
Peace.
---
What class is that?  I’d like to try it.
---
It might have been 10g now that I think about it... I think it was 100 though, he was saving for his epic mount... Bleh, it's been so long. I can tell you one thing though, it sure as hell wasn't 100c or 100s. 
---
I had a long post written about how you should go Ele/Enh shaman and do PVP but then I realized that Warlock Shaman and Hunter pretty much all are good in 5-man content and PVE and you can't really go wrong.
---
Truly. Pretty much any spec of any of those classes would be good for your purposes. Your instincts have served you well.
---
It’s only 2 minutes and it’s absolutely brokenly strong. 
---
You win.  I just read your name now and you double win.
---
I mained an undead rogue in vanilla and enjoyed it a lot.  Now I’m thinking about either the same, UD mage or warrior or s. priest.  Mage is leading right now with tailor/skin and enchanting bank alt but feel like there will be too many.  I likely won’t have time for a raid schedule, so mostly just pvp, 5 mans and the occasional raid.  With more responsibility now, I just won’t have the time.
---
Are you me? Rerolled my druid at 42 aswell for a warlock. Never looked back at the druid, although I did take a small glance on my rogue. 
---
It's more a matter of you being in the middle of questing, and shadowmelding so that if someone on the opposite faction strolls by, they can't kill you. Or more importantly, to vastly reduce the chance one of the creatures you were previously farming kills you while you're lecturing your kid.
---
I resemble that!
---
...seriously, though, I'm planning to play with my older brother. He started playing WoW during the tail end of Wrath and into MoP, so he's looking forward to learning how Classic will be different, but one thing of which he's absolutely certain: he's going to main a warrior.
---
Meanwhile I'm over here still deliberating over whether I want both my druids to be female or maybe make the boomkin a male; am I going to have three hunters or just two, what are each of their pets going to be and which one is going to get the honor of doing the suicide run up Teldrassil to tame an owl and a nightsaber (yes, I know I can get nightsabers in Darkshore - it's a nostalgia thing); do I want a troll mage and an undead priest or vice versa; do I want my warlock to be a human so she looks cool on the dreadsteed or a gnome with pink pigtails for maximum absurdity points...
---
The only ones I'm actually firmly decided on are my shaman being a tauren with elemental spec and my pally being a dwarf female with braids (Best. Casting animation. Ever).
---
It's gonna' be *ages* until I get to 60 with any of them. And I can't freakin' wait.
---
Give the taunt a 25 yard range, just so he doesn't have to body pull.
---
Support classes are gonna support. Rogues bring nothing to the table except their damage. 
---
Made a night elf hunter and I wanted to learn 2handed sword specialization so bad so I made the trek from Darnassus to stormwind. Ended up buying a grey 2h sword and I was upset when I found out it was less effective than using a bow. I should just made an arms warrior  
---
The only logical option.
---
If you consider spending 20 minutes prior to the raid conjuring water for the raid, or clicking Arcane Brilliance on a few classes every hour a mechanic, then I don’t know what to tell you. 
---
I have no figures to back this up, but I’d be very surprised if BoW gave more threat than BoSalv reduces their threat generation by, unless they are mostly afk
---
Oh god
---
Yah toss that shit on your mages. They will be able to tank better then a pally and you can spam heals on them.
---
I didn’t know how to move spells on my bar and had about 40 Smelting spells on it.
---
Eventually I got annoyed and tried holding shift and moving one.  To my absolute astonishment, it worked!
---
Humble beginnings, I suppose. 
---
bears can tank very well. Cat is a utility form with stealth &amp; mana-less damage, the Druid heal toolkit is unique as is its overall utility. Super surviveable, can do it all. It’s a jack of all trades class, master of none and does that very well. Nothing wrong with Vanilla druids.
---
They aren't chuck Norris jokes, they are chuck Norris facts. 
---
And healing is literally the easiest role in vanilla. So speaking relatively, it's funny. 
---
Will of the Forsaken is hell on Earth to deal with. I’d urge you to roll horde, if you plan on doing warlock PvP. 
---
They're really smart and are copying the player races. 
---
We know they're smart because we drink their horns. 
---
I don't understand what you think I should learn from this interaction, though. You think I should "cut that shit out" but what shit are you talking about? What delusions do I have that you refer to? I get that you are just trying to help me, to "save my life" but could you please be specific what you are trying to help me stop doing?
---
Also, don't you think it's a little conceited on your part to speak of yourself like you have all the answers, like after you shame me I might go about the process of fixing my life? I'm not trying to be rude and just attack you here, not trying to get into a tit for tat, I'm asking you honestly: if someone talked to you the way you are talking to me right now, do you genuinely feel like you would walk away and say, he's right, he showed me that I have a lot to work on, I am really grateful for his help.
---
You are talking to me like I'm the only one who has something to learn from this interaction.  But what does that say about you?
---
Make azeroth great again?
---
Aside from LAP (zul gurub) no really relevant elixir or potion is rep gated as far as I remember so a twink to brew and farm herbs is always a good choice. This leaves the main up to whatever you want to tun on him/her. With the tryhard pvp and pve obviously favoring engineering for utility, grenade/sapper dmg and straight up resistance items (excluding nature)
---
I got it on my paladin much earlier and it was amazing to play with. Hitting a JoC on to the stun proc was very satisfying. I got r14 sword when they released buying gear with marks/honour, but didn’t feel anywhere near the accomplishment I did with the unstoppable force 
---
Hmm interesting thanks OP, will definitely save this for reference. But man that some fugly looking gear on them. 
---
It would take my hdin bots weeks and weeks from 98 to 99 running almost constantly. The highest i ever got leeching baal runs with ondals and anni was 97. I never knew a single person who got to 99 without botting.
---
None of the classes are "hard", just do your research and realize what you're getting into with a class. Do you want to heal? dps? tank? pvp? pve? and go from there
---
Until he picks a paladin thinking he's gonna tank in raids or a druid and think that he's gonna tank in raids.
---
Part of me dont want me to tell you the same thing. 
---
Im not sure where i stated that DW tanking benefited more from WF? I was obviously referring to MH with WF and OH with extra white hits. 
---
But hey, thanks for stating the obvious. Same goes for totems being on gcd. 😂😂 you still have time to weave. 
---
I highly doubt the BoW is gonna give you more threat than BoS will reduce
---
Yet stuns are something the hunter pvp trinket can counter. While tauren give you more control over whoever is in your deadzone/melee range.
---
Tauren also synergize better in tryhard pvp comps
---
(no bias - past and future alliance speaking here :p)
---
Gypsy Unit frames! Why? Because its Vanilla!
---
ClassicSnowfall, with BOTH on KEYUP AND KEYDOWN!!!!!! The most imortant addon to maximize DPS/TPS
---
The more logical progression to me given the storylines direction is WotlK first then BC. bC was just too out there as Space Fantasy and it turned me off. Great class design tho.
---
Like I said, trial by fire. Sometimes life disappoints you.
---
Great clarification!! And no I agree it makes total sense for them to get mace specialization. I mean their race weapon of the freaking totem log is a mace.
---
Shadow Priests have always and will always be the strongest 1v1 class. Good matchup against literally every class. A very highly geared mage can get lucky and burst them, and SL locks turn it into a stalemate where neither can kill the other. 
---
You have lost site of everything. At this point you cannot be helped.
---
I have done my best, you may keep your delusions about bwl and your big dick dps.
---
It's also a huge benefit to have the druid / mage assigned to decurse not get feared right before a curse goes off leaving a tank with a 75% heal reduction for 4-5 seconds or longer if you get feared in a bad direction. Has happened to me a few times. 
---
0
---
you can still kill him even when all minions are dead. All that happens is that he starts to knock people around like crazy. That is annoying but nothing that really would wipe the raid
---
At equal skill, SL locks should beat rogues. 
---
The man himself!
---
Yeah, I mean just stats with pretty unhelpful set bonuses (from what I see?). But I probably don't have a real shot at t1/t2 until the general progression of the server is higher and getting into other's guild runs who just need a warm body or PUGs is easier.
---
Honestly if you can name one that captures the feel, ill play it
---
But thats's why they're asking for information.. as to not be disappointed. Why would you wish someone on someone that clearly is taking steps to avoid it?
---
Oh I thought they were the Blood Elves that got banished because of their research in The Void, and since Blood Elves are High Elves with a new name. I'd say that It's nice to have some High Elves back in Alliance.
---
U fkn nazi :O
---
No they haven't, they've said they didn't think it was popular enough and haven't planned for one but the outrage and feedback from the community after that statement pretty much require them to have those. 
---
The halfway point of levelling exp wise is 48
---
Originally they are, but now they're Void Elves of course.
---
We have no idea what his friend is like or what would disappoint him. It's best to just let him pick whatever he wants.
---
One per pet. If you tame a new one, it's named Cat or Owl and you can give it a name once.
---
I stand 100% corrected - you're right! Derp. Was thinking it was a passive thing like a warlock's paranoia
---
Exactly. The game isn't going anywhere so no rush.
---
Just go have fun and see what class sticks.
---
Not really, it’s only like 8x the xp per mob at 60 compared to level 1 
---
Doesnt the Zin trinket damage you a lot? And it’s not on-use, simply having it equipped will damage you. So if you’re in combat you’re stuck with the trinket damaging you.
---
Delightful.  Makes WoW seem like xmas... somehow.
---
...I need to make myself up some sort of Classic advent calendar.  Maybe one of those chains of paper rings things.
---
These seemingly genuine questions always make me smile, because I imagine it's an innocent BfA player sincerely asking for help about an otherwise no-brainer question if one has even the slightest experience with Classic.
---
The answer is that Salv is the go-to threat reduction blessing in all cases.
---
Bless you, friend.
---
Freaking Heroscape. Love that game.
---
yes but will be gated I'm pretty sure
---
Gonna be so boss.  
---
..also fuck Exzabius.
---
Qiraji Crystal, Baron Rivendares charger
---
This would have been ok advice 13-14 years ago. Since Classic is so community-driven, you have to play the classes/specs that the community deems optimal. It doesn't matter what his friend is like since the only way for him to join groups will be to play what is good.
---
Id consider up to 5 max
---
Some way to get mana back too maybe - in TBC they got mana back from being healed, which worked well.
---
But they said Orc Rogue
---
Its an RP PvE server, they're allowed to report for non-RP names. 
---
While I hope it does not make it into Classic, I am not able to tell myself it definitely wont. The playerbase is the way it is, it has evolved throughout the last decade+ inside WoW and outside with gaming as a whole growing to what it is. It would not shock me if it creeps its way into classic.
---
No wonder rogues are so aggressive and bitter always ganking people.
---
Literally leveled 2 priests to 40 in TBC/early Wrath with a similar situation. I mean I knew they worked but didn't realize they were good on a priest. I would simply cast spells and go oom all the time. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if I passed up Spirit Tap.
---
Every class can get into groups. He'll be fine no matter what he picks.
---
Who hurt you?
---
hah, he said something I don't like, let's condescendingly reply!!1!!
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; FW is quite good for PvP.  
---
It is, but there's definitely times it will not be available for some reason.  I think stoneform is the better power in pvp.
---
What do you mean? I'm just repeating what most people say.
---
Doesnt zg have 3d tho
---
I didn't mean to come across as condescending. I was just making a funny.
---
This apparently  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=22272](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22272)  i don't know what it looks like, the quest was bugged on nostalrius so i never had it but the stats aren't bad, you pretty much just lose 13 +healing.
---
Edit: oh i found an image  [https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/11282-forests-embrace.jpg](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/11282-forests-embrace.jpg) 
---
Don't let your memes be dreams. I have faith you will be the world's best classic Retribution Paladin. &lt;3
---
You can have the entire raid fear warded if you have a couple dwarf priests, thats even better than just having it on your tanks. Dwarf priest is vastly superior for that alone.
---
Also stoneform in BGs pretty much saves you from rogues
---
Not putting ammo in the far left slot, REEEEEE
---
You get armor aura, kings, might, light, sanctuary and salvation on everyone in each raid. So your incoming damage is lower, you have higher armor, more hp, more ap and you have massive threat reduction on everyone else.
---
I'm not the one that doesn't want Ret to be viable for raids, so idk what you're talking about.
---
This is what I had in mind. I haven't played in a while so I didn't know you can shadowmeld during combat now.
---
The guide wasn't written around server launches, it assumes a much more even spread of players at all levels without congestion. [Check this out for an alternative leveling route.](http://www.vanilla-questing.me/)
---
Enh Shammy with Nightfall. 
---
Making my hunter choice tougher now 😂..
---
“Reada like a jealous little kid.”
---
Im 31, entirely not jealous haha, and not at all mad at streamers
---
You fail to see my point, so you disagree, like I said many would
---
Interesting :) ty
---
Thats me, AFTER i get my main to L60.
---
Crazy
---
You only have to make one kidney shot "miss" with that 20% chance before you're like, huh, this ain't so bad after all...
---
You'll still require druids though.
---
Planting a semen in your friends? Say what😂
---
Incorrect, Illidan is a sorcerer.
---
if they start playing classic then..why not? \^\^
---
Im sure its linked to how good certain actual stats were for a example a healer. Im sure i tunnel visioned with the color coding on stuff, thinking epic must be better than blue... without really understanding the stats that the item actually had.
---
You fear, he uses WotF, rocket stun him and wait for will to wear off then fear, he uses trinket, use grenade, fear again, get out of combat to reset diminishing returns, kill him. 
---
&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA-PVP| semi-hardcore
---
Undaunted is recruiting members prior to the release of classic wow. Welcoming all players that are experienced or new with determination to progress at a steady rate and dedication on making the guild a better experience overall. We want to have a strong core of members when the game launches.
---
This guild will be semi-hardcore, Horde, and with a laid back demeanor but still seeking to progress with a goal to leave no one behind for those that show up on raid times, etc. Ideally a strong core roster of experienced players would be preferred to help out around the guild and bring everyone up to speed. We want a good sense of community within this guild so don’t be afraid to speak up and talk to others, in the end remember to just have fun with the game as well.
---
We will be doing PVE and PVP content with raids times being listed below but we do enjoy world pvp when we get the chance, perhaps even forming BG groups later on when they get introduced. When raiding starts we will be doing 3 nights a week. We are currently recruiting all classes, just play what you feel like.
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 7:30 - 10:30 est
---
We currently have a discord channel. We have tabs for class/dungeon guide talk to help people out not familiar with classic wow and you can usually find me in general voice chat. Feel free to add me on discord or bnet for more info on joining it.
---
Bnet: Feral#11785 Discord: Feral#0846
---
This is what I'm thinking lol
---
Are there any number crunchers out there that have calculated how many fewer BG's or dungeon runs the Human racial would allow for based on average rep gains per instance etc?
---
Okay. That's settled then. I wonder what it's like...I've only ever played the same paladin for 14 with basically no alts above 20 lol
---
&gt; Those have lesser stats  
---
I mean, they technically have more int and spirit...
---
I did the exact same! I had no idea about what stats I need for the warrior and equipped the "colourful" stuff with the bigger numbers. I would never want to use grey or whites even if they were 20 levels ahead of my green/blue gear that I may have had. I only found out in late BC that warriors don't need fucking intellect 
---
Wasn't this a comment chain where I said "you'd be wishing you leveled engineering?" Coulda sworn I said something like that. It's the darndest thing. I must not have said that, I guess.
---
I am beginning to regret this thread 
---
Way to fuck holy and ret paladins, there.
---
Not realising talent points even existed until I was level 35 :)
---
It's Reddit.
---
You're at a huge disadvantage against more than 1 enemy in WoW. Even if they're lower level than you. There's just no way to consistently beat equally skilled, geared and prepared players when they outnumber you.
---
Rogues &amp; Druids win this by default because they can choose to only ever fight 2+ people when they actually have a chance to win. Next up would be Mage - Polymorph one target while fighting the other. Warlocks to a lesser extent, but not as well as Mages - they usually need to use Fear to kill their primary target and can't spare the CC for a secondary one.
---
Is shaman fun to level/raid with in your experience?  What is the best race for shaman?  I like the way trolls look out of the three but I hate hat throwing weapons and bows are their specialty haha.  
---
Damn mages invis was in beta? 
---
Safe to say that priests got the most consistent, good looking items 👌
---
You don't EVER go Stonetalon with Alliance, it's INCREDIBLY bad. 
---
I can tell you that, because I've done every single possible quest there.
---
There is WAY TOO MUCH of a running. I wouldn't consider to go there even with a 60% mount available. 
---
There's HELLUVA LOT running multiple times between the Charred Vale and that goblin hut/camp above. FP is also on the opposite side of the map, which is a horde questing area, you have nothing do to here.
---
It also required to go Ironforge/Stormwind, which is located on the other continent, as the chain goes. Gnome in Ironforge wants you to bring him some AH'ables to make the explosives.
---
Then, Mauren in SW asks you to go Westfall and kill Dust Devils, whose presence is scarce.
---
Not only that, but you also will have to visit Ratchet and go back.
---
Don't ever consider it, unless you wanna go for the "Loremaster" of Vanilla like I did. There is enough quests like Worgen in the Woods in Darkshire, which is a chain, but it doesn't require much movements without a mount. You just kill dozens of mobs and get a good chunk of exp and rewards along with it.
---
You need to run through to get the Stonetalon FP and preferably the Desolace FP as well while you're in here. You need them in order to be able to fly through to Darnassus from further south later on.  
---
The few quests there are ok; they can be dropped easily if there's too much horde about. The main thing is to get the FP
---
Those chains of ice looks sick though! Much cooler than just ice
---
It should be whatever class he's most excited by
---
OHOHOHOHOH
---
I switched from Diablo 2 to vanilla back in the day, and I always thought Warlocks were siblings of Necromancers thematically.
---
We need the server list now, not to coordinate but to actually make sure which server types will be available and in what regions. 
---
In battleground you can precast it on a few players. It's really strong.
---
Especially in wsg if you can make sure the druid fc have it as often as possible as fear is one of his main weakness.
---
We even get pants for a little while 
---
I assure you I played Vanilla my friend. I just always had to tank for the guild I was in back then. The pally was like someone's other green lawn to me back then and I want to make it work at least for 5 man/10 man.
---
Mug o Hurt?
---
No one?
---
I dont care what stats exist, my dwarven priest always rocks this xP
---
Impressed by the rogue ones.
---
They are not going to make the same mistake twice.
---
What would happen if you had 15 hunters in full T2? Would the hunter DPS outpace the other classes? 
---
And then you'd have a completely fucked up economy in terms of gold. 
---
For all we know it's july the 16th. That is our best bet right now. Other than that it is pre speculation.
---
I just need my confirmation for RP-PvP and I'm okey with them releasing the server names on launch. 
---
Do you plan to stay hidden and not moving all the time ? As soon as you start to play and a rogue see you it's game over.
---
To be clear guys I never asked if it reduced threat or over threated salvation.  The point is that in 5 man/10 man can the threat level be close enough that wisdom would be the proper choice in terms of team wide dps.
---
Only your one or two main tanks in a guild needs to be full prot spec, MS dps isn't as good as fury but as long as you're not in a tryhard guild you can raid in a PvP spec. 
---
&gt; However with the immunity potion, healing potions, mana potions, damage increase potions, and magic resistance potions, I wonder if engineering is only slightly better. 
---
The thing is you can just buy all of that with gold, you're not required to have Alchemy as a profession to drink any potion in the game.
---
With Engineering however all of the useful gadgets you're going to use require you to have a certain skill level of Engineering to use, so unless you have the profession you won't be able to use them at all.
---
If the Engineering items weren't locked behind having the profession obviously a lot less people would take it and just buy all of the trinkets and gadgets with gold like you can do with Alchemy for example.
---
Mained warlock in vanilla, enjoyed huge crits with shadowbolts and being 1v1 god. I kinda still missed mobility and i want to play either mage or rogue in classic. Mega torn for weeks between these classes now. Any points that help me to decide with this kind of priorities? Will be playing super hc, doing lots of world pvp and raiding in a good guild  
---
World pvp &gt; 1v1 ability &gt; Scaling for pvp in later items tiers and possible tbc expansion(does the character get better with later item tiers) &gt; Raid rotation &gt; Solo gold farming ability     
---
Any comments are welcome!
---
Literally no role in Vanilla is really difficult for today's standards. 
---
Diplomacy and Shadowmeld/Wisp are meta-abilities for people with lives.
---
Ehh, anyone else in the in between group? It's gonna be pretty fast because I'm used to playing WoW so I know how everything works, but I'm not like planning some minmax route to 60. I still want to do every dungeon, but I know when a quest isn't worth doing. 
---
I feel personally attacked. 
---
Oh, that was a great pun. 
---
I think you needed to add a /s AND a /whoosh to your initial post.
---
People get angry way too easy :(
---
If you don't do the March Of Death, you aren't a real night elf!
---
Ever seen an Undead Mage?
---
They *always* look homeless.
---
any info on what day/hour their pax panel is supposed to be then? i cant find anything in the schedule other than some 30min wow history talk with a book author
---
Most to least, roughly, is usually something like:
---
Human &gt; Undead &gt; Orc/Troll &gt; Dwarf/Gnome &gt; Night Elf &gt; Tauren
---
dat halo, man.
---
Rolling a priest so Benediction. 
---
Even more so with a robe/kilt.
---
Those are the reasons I don’t particularly enjoy the 40s as much as the 30s or 50s. Level 30 you look forward to getting your mount and perhaps your last tree talent, but after getting it lvl 60 feels so far off, like hitting your goal and then thinking “now what”?
---
Just quest in duskwood or ashenvale if you really don't want to go there
---
Will healers need engineering? 
---
The one thing I'll miss from TBC in Vanilla is \[Dirge\]
---
I couldn't disagree more. For myself somewhere between levels 40 and 45 the character I'm playing suddenly becomes *my* character. It's always right around the time I'm using Gadgetzan as a quest hub. I have made my share of alts before, but none of them have hit level 40. Once they do, they become my main. It very quickly feels like a chore playing any other character (including other 60s).
---
I remember i played my Warlock SM/Ruin. I put some points in Curse of Exhaustion so it was more likely PvP, but also could PvE with that spec very well. So for the main SM/Ruin build there isn’t any differences between pvp end pve. Just for the little things like as I said CoE.  I guess there are builds for other classes as well which support that. 
---
Also reminds me of [cleave on every bar button, clicking everything else from the spellbook.](https://youtu.be/xOk8HINdDVs?t=24)
---
It would be pretty badass to set off sapper charges since they are instant. In some aoe packs I've done 8-10k damage with 1 sapper.
---
But other then that and some dps utility I dont think so.
---
I got your point, but it isn't really an objective standard, you're just complaining about your own personal preferences not being catered to.
---
Hope not, it doesn’t make sense for a shaman to be an engineer, in an RP scenario. And I’d like to be able to herb the BoP black lotus. Yet I don’t want to be excluded from content. 
---
Would you fuck off with the true vanilla bullshit. Half the poplulation was PvE.
---
BL is not bop in 1.12

Leveled as a balance Druid

Considering the fact, there is a tons of "What class to pick" videos, explaining what role to expect by picking any class, the question is basically about noob-friendly class.   
---
In regards to this I might agree, that your friend should pick whatever looks cool for him.   
---
If you don't want to make him pick, and wish to do it urself, I'd consider this:   
---
1) What class you are going to play, find the mos profitable variants to boost your own character. Don't look at it from the point of selfishness, if he hates the game, atleast at that point you will gain something  
---
2) His personality. I have friends who like being engaged, like hardest classes in different games etc. like different little tricks about the game. And I have ones who hate doing everything themselves when they start playing, gameplay should be straight and some things like "feeding pet", "keeping arrows", "unoptimal specs" would just kill their experience   
---
I play with loads of healers that are not engineer. You will be fine as a shaman. If you can put wf totem down you will be seeing all the raids lol
---
As a hunter I will be extremely happy to get the +2 Agi, +6 int ring from DM. To see it drop and win the roll will make my day. 
---
He also has mortal strike.
---
My first main was a pally. I got him to level 10 before finding out my friends were playing on a different server. My second character was a night elf hunter. I got all the way to lvl 30 before deleting her and making my next (and still current) main, a dwarf hunter. Why did I delete a lvl 30 toon in vanilla? Well, I thought my Nelf hunter was the chosen one, so I named her accordingly. The one problem was 10 year old me was constantly mixing up choose and chose, so I got to lvl 30 before my dumbass realized I was running around playing the "Choosenone". My shame was too great. I couldn't look at that name every time I logged in, so she had to go. RIP Choosenone. 
---
Daggers for rogue in t2??? How dare you
---
Managing stance dancing is definitely harder than spamming 1
---
Fine. Fear him and run away until he pops WotF, death coil and Tidal Charm him until WotF wears off and fear the fucker again. He might trinket but only undead warlocks can trinket charm so you can safely seduce away with the succubus. Will actually be interesting to see whether people start rolling more undead warlock than orc on Classic. On private servers it's pretty known that ally warlocks are rare, so WotF is really situational where the orc stun resist is a lot more useful, so most PvP oriented warlocks choose orc.
---
A good warlock will ofc not rely on fear as his only CC especially since fury warriors are immune to fear for like 30 seconds. Then you have to be quick on your fingers and use all the shields you can get. 
---
Er, I don't think you can Shadowmeld in combat, and regardless this is about vanilla in the end.
---
Point is, kill a mob, shadowmeld, afk.
---
Using sap takes you out of stealth unless you’re sub spec, in which case it’s only 90% chance. 
---
I never got a chnce to play FT before WoW dropped. Just W3 ROC so I never experienced the Rexxar questline until I finally played through both games before BfA dropped. Gotta say, if I had played that extra campaign back in 2004, I very likely would have picked horde instead of alliance. Running around with Rexxar and Rokhan was awesome
---
Lmao that upscaled Gnome rogue 
---
Lol, talking about talents, I was paladin back then and tried to go for any usable skill on talents bcs passives were not fun and actives were :) 
---
Alchemy is stronger in PVP than Engineering. It's that you don't need to have alchemy skill to use potions, while you need engineering skill to use engineering items.
---
If you plan on buying pots from AH (or have a level 35 alt for it), go engi, if not, definitely go alchemy.
---
Do most **alliance** guilds really have 4 warlocks on most raid nights? I remember in 2006 that it was more like 2 on average but I think locks were less popular then than they are now?
---
Except that AQ tier looks like preraid bis at best.
---
Implying Azeroth isnt great already
---
And the vocal minority is a lot worse these days
---
That isn't really a bad choice in 1.12. Sure, feral is a bit better, but you can level up as balance fairly well.
---
The fishin hat.
---
I still remember i got something  270 honorable kills before I hit 60 and I never went to the battleground. Just world PvP while lvling. I loved my warlock 
---
It's about the experience, not the loot!
---
41 quests...
---
They were the worst tanks in T4, but they outscaled the others in T6.
---
I've took my time leveling my current char on a pserver, but when classic gets out i have to speedlevel because i wont have much time to play, so I have to gear up really quickly while I will have time so I can just raidlog afterwards.
---
No idea of his playstyle
---
As long as he doesnt want to run a shit meme spec anything is fine
---
I could generally recommend gnome/undead mage or rogue
---
Is that an addon that changes the display putting gold and everything at the top?
---
Oh I see. I withdraw my skepticism then!
---
I guess I've become too wary/paranoid of troll posts that I see them everywhere.
---
Pick what you like and looks the most appealing to you.
---
That being said, Hunters do have a slightly higher survivability rate as they are effective at killing things, can use their pet to tank for then and if all goes tits up they can drop out of combat with feign death
---
Human, detect invisibility, Felhunter spell, perception and engineering head = detecting rogues from 40-50yd xD video here in reddit
---
Can't you just cast Levitate yourself? This works in modern WoW at least. I used to mind control low level players in mop/wod and give them Power Word: Fortitude and/or Power Word: Shield.
---
Dagger fury warrior. Nuff said :P
---
Rogue or Warrior if Alliance (gnome)
---
Shaman or Warlock if Horde (orc)
---
Which would you say is the strongest in PvP overall (wpvp 1v1 and 1vX, BGs)? The most fun?
---
The easiest/fastest to get good pve gear for pvp? 
---
&gt;annihilator 
---
Is this a "main hand" weapon, so you can only use one?
---
What is world PVP like levelling as a shadow priest?
---
I am amazed how many people liked to see just an old screenshot and how passionate this community is in the comments.
---
I actually have every screenshot I've ever made in WoW saved, so I will surely share my first 0-60 journey with a lot of pics soon :-)
---
Ok, I'm gonna check that out. Could be poorly scripted pserver though ^^
---
Yup... a lot of "we're all elite here" mentality - which can make a run interesting, but frustrating as well. Especially when there are members who are making mistakes and not helping with the save - like by throwing out a CC, or using a CD to burst/mitigate damage.   
---
Makes you a better player by having to compensate for them, but they're not the kind of people I will want to raid with, for sure!
---
Mini orc shoulders and short shorts bug in tbc was my jam. 
---
Just do not take candle you fuck lol :)   
---
It's not. It was destroyed by deathwing. 
---
I love the night elfs, my main in vanilla was a nelf druid and later I rerolled nelf priest. I'm gonna roll priest in classic and I really really really wanna roll nelf. But, everything in the text in this meme is sadly true. It's not that the nelf traits are bad, it's just that the dwarf traits are much better.
---
Sure, we can tell ourselves that the nelfs racials aren't bad and that they can be useful, and we'd be right. But in the end the dwarf racials will be More useful. Fear Ward is not just a good-to-have in PVE, it's also a god buff to cast on everyone before a BG starts and will give your team a much larger edge than any Shadowmeld+MC off of AV LM cliff will give you. Fear Ward will also give you more safety when questing (on PVP servers) and desperate prayer will be more effective than EG since it "works on all opponents". It's a sad but true story
---
would be epic if someone had Hydrocane in their inventory and equipped it at the last second
---
Death to All Talls!
---
In vanilla you couldn't see an opponents health - there were mods you could get that would estimate it, but iirc, there was nothing more than a simple green line that slowly got shorter, or quickly got shorter...
---
Don't forget both Tauren and NE zones have a lot of quests that require items to be looted.
---
While we’re sharing hopes, I would like to see the vanilla servers progress to BC and Wrath for sure. IMO, the best option would be for classic servers to progress as planned, then when they reach the point of possibly moving to BC, new classic servers would launch simultaneously (sort of reminiscent of the Diablo 2 ladder system). I also think if this were the way they chose to go, it would be nice to have the option to remain in Vanilla, leaving some servers to never progress past that point and offer free character transfers to those servers during those transitions (or some variation of that).
---
Duskwood has lots of quests
---
Mix it with wetlands/hillsbrad/ashenvale and some stockade runs
---
NE &amp; Tauren zones. However, Mulgore has a lot of quests that require items from mobs, special mention to the Swoop Trophy quest and there aren't many Swoops around in comparison to how many players there will be.
---
Teldrassil has a few quests like this too, special mention to the quest with the Furbolgs and you need the 3 ground spawned items that only 1 player can grab at a time.
---
In my opinion, regardless of population, Dun Morogh + Durotar are still the best, even if they have more players.
---
I still remember the first time I asked someone "what are 'mats'?" - I got a 15 minute explanation about professions, and he crafted me some green legs... the game was never the same after that!
---
We should make a Pally-Pals Club, haha so many people seem to hate pallys in this subreddit.
---
I think humans lool very mediocre
---
Do u really think u will get tier3 btw?
---
Yea, it's Titan Panel
---
Im gonna play rogue this summer. I'd pick usability over looks 99\\100 times but man, this time im gonna be undead for sure. 
---
I guess on gnomes all u see are shoulders and head
---
DPS warrior Dual-wielding Bonereaver's Edge and Maladath? Alright then.
---
Invisib=/=stealth
---
its the cat potion
---
Bloodvine stage? Gnome rogue early gear?
---
This makes no sense , why doesn't shaman have the blue dress while paladin does ? Pally could wear the shaman's chest if it's really better.
---
And it's wrong as the chest is the best for shamans too
---
I didn't say complex, I said involved.
---
Compare this to mage for example ....
---
I'm gonna assume this is *the* McConnell, the same McConnell who talked about Paladins in Classic like a fucking retard in StaySafe's stream and got mad when people kept calling you dumb. So fucking clueless, as always.
---
&gt;Stone
---
Right, but on the same PVP server, how many times WOULD you have been saved by stone form and how many times WOULD desperate prayer have saved you and/or someone you were healing and how many times WOULD FW have given your BG team enough of an edge to win instead of loose? Impossible to give an exact answer of course but, think about it
---
UC elevator.
---
Haha yeah, I am picking usability as my top priority for my 3 mains, although I also like the looks for those race/class combos so its fine.  
---
But there's a good chance I'll make a rogue alt, and I think that's the one i might just pick undead even though I know orc is better. I'm telling myself it will at least be better in BC, if I'm able to transfer my rogue.
---
I went out of my way to find the Logitech since I have read many bad reviews of Razer products. They seem to fail frequently and I will not put this kind of money on a possibly unreliable product (we're talking a price of 100€ where I live).

Because shaman &gt; Paladin

The record has to be hunters and Focus. They had focus instead of mana in early beta IIRC, then it took until like Cataclysm for focus to replace mana.
---
You can buy all of those consumables so I’m not sure why you need alchemy. Just buy it with gold
---
It depends on how many tourists check the game out. Vanilla barrens is vastly different from retail, and without the built in quest helpers there’s a good chance people will seek help from the general channel before falling back on google (same idea as people posting stupid questions on reddit instead of looking it up themselves).
---
This makes so much sense but I never thought about it before.
---
Agine if WoW had started with just 3-4 classes and some of the existing less flavorful ones were "sub-Tree" specs.
---
Like Fire Mage could have been a "sub-Tree" for Destruction Warlocks. Just say at 25-39 points in Destruction you could take a talent that gives you a whole new sub-Tree with Three Tiers of talents. 
---
Then you could have had the actual mage class focus on portal magic, shield magic, and time manipulation magic. Instead of the basic as heck stuff. Idk... Just ideas.
---
lmao that spin pyroblast.
---
Until they run out of ammo lel.
---
Wow those are som sick casting animations:D
---
don't forget the fact that playing several hours a day is beeing a casual and that casual gamer is now an insult.
---
then the irony of it all.  
---
guilds that call themself hardcore take pride in clearing content that was beating already over 13y ago.  
---
or taking pride in killing a boss faster then other guilds. records that were formerly held by casual guilds since the progress guilds did not care for it.
---
laughs in mastery rank 30 warframe

My best experience with leveling professions was to go with what I got. If I wanted something crafted, I either farmed for it during "grind" levels, or I wouldn't craft it. I never bought plans I didn't intend to use for leveling a profession or on my character. And in that way, I would only buy the best plans suited for leveling.  
---
Buying every pattern/plan etc., IS a huge waste of money though, and crafting most of the "best" items was a waste of resources. However, if you used a minimalist method while leveling, you could keep most professions such as tailoring/engineering/blacksmithing within a close range of your level, and craft green gear to supplement your questing/dungeon upgrades. This made good use of what you found without wasting too much time leveling a profession - and made the grind at 60 a little easier since I didn't have to backpedal into beginner zones and either zerg resources from lowbies and get complained at, or go camp cross-faction zones and gank lowbies and get complained at...
---
That's great advice and will save you a trip to UC if you decide to run RFC with your buddy. I always forget about this quest lol.
---
amen brother warlock for life
---
Wasn't Atlas the one that helped with quests/locations/resource nodes?
---
[Work Work Work] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMKCDvFSzIA)
---
fury
---
You get a message in chat, something like "You have learned Claw (Rank 2)"
---
Linking thunder fury was a WotLK thing. WotLK fucking sucked. 
---
It was more of a gap-filler. Buy only the patterns you need for leveling the profession, and occassionally pick up a pattern if it will fill a gap from something you need.  
---
I.e., instead of running lvl 40+ instances with lvl 26 boots, maybe you'll have a patter for green lvl 30 boots, with mats easily available at lvl 40...
---
If you're talking about the bar at the top, thats the addon called "Titan Panel"
---
I've used that one myself for ages, really handy.
---
I don't plan on using any addons or guides for questing. I will only pull up thottbot if I get stuck trying to figure out a quest.
---
I can definitely see that. 
---
Deathflayer in Durotar has a 1.6 attackspeed, whereas the other Scorpids all hav 2.0.  
---
So Deathflayer is the best Scorpid you can get
---
I got a wif o the wife
---
I'm pretty sure, there will be german servers, maybe not as many as now in retail wow, but there will be some for sure.
---
Awesome thanks
---
Thanks a lot :)
---
While this seems like an amazing QoL improvement (which it is) - that's kinda what classic tries to avoid. The more QoL improvements we get, the closer we're getting to WOTLK and beyond levels of ease. The slippery slope argument applies, I guess.
---
*But man, would I welcome such a change as stackable shards...*
---
People have known how good warlocks are on private servers for years, and it is still one of the classes that you usually struggle to have enough of in almost every guild along with druids and shamans for horde.
---
Or something like 10-20 mana every time they block with holy shield active. Just something to supplement on top of Judgement of Wisdom, just to let them tank longer fights with the help of mana potions.
---
It kinda really is, and iceblock. It's those two spells mainly that makes mages able to take on multiple dudes in PvP at once because they break CC.
---
Troll rogue is life.
---
The point here is perception as a rogue counter. 
---
I ran VC till level 30 on my hunter so I could dual wield cruel barbs and look like Drizzt
---
I guess it must have been easier to just copy and pasted the mana system, instead of the focus. Never understood why they had mana. 
---
Most russians don't speak english well in my experience. That alone is really annoying. There is this player, taking up space/nodes/mobs and I can't communicate him about the incoming horde ganker or whatever. It's frustrating.
---
Same goes for chinese in pservers and italians to some extent.
---
Nordic european countries have good education, so your average player will be adequate enough to speak with.
---
What goes so wrong with druids at level 42?
---
lol, thanks for the laugh
---
Why do people always wants to play meme specs (not fury war obvs)
---
Hunter pet diversity is only really a thing if you aren’t hardcore, though. In raids you should always use a wolf. 
---
Man, this has helped decide between DPS Warr and Rogue. DPS Warr looks like the youngest child getting the hand me downs.
---
it is a gamble that much is true. It deals 100-500 physical dmg and drains 100-500 mana per second
---
however it sticks to the value it has when you equip it. So you can put it on and off multiple times till you reach a semi comfortable level. The constant dmg ticks can be well worth it to become completely immune to basically all of the fragile crowd control mechanics.
---
Even more so when you play in a group with a pocket healer
---
This is not even a comparison. Alchemy is completely unnecessary to have on your character. Often it doesn't even add value, many times I've seen potions be cheaper on ah than the herbs the potion was created from. Flask recipes go for 1000+g while flask making tip is 0-15g.
---
Meanwhile you actually need to have engineering on your character. Choose your engineering spec based on teleport location as you can just have the opposite spec on alt or ask people with the opposite spec to make stuff for you).
---
When I was level 15 or so I was super excited to go on my first ever dungeon run.  The dreaded Wailing Caverns!  The Worn Turtle Shell Shield dropped and I ended up needing on it because... well... it was blue which obviously made it an upgrade.  The tank wasn't happy with me and chewed me out but I think the group realized I was a noob and they didn't kick me.  I didn't understand why they yelled at me... I thought they were mad that I didn't equip it right away.  I couldn't use the shield quite yet so I figured I would just keep it in my bags until I could use it.  Surely it would just be a few levels until I would be able to learn shields right?    
---
I was a hunter.  
---
I still have that shield.  Iv kept it in my bags all these years waiting for the day when I may finally be able to equip it...  Its currently resting between my Haunted Momento and my Tabard of the Protector as one of my most treasured items.
---
As a mage, your pre-bis gear will look like this: [https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/818516.jpg](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/818516.jpg) 
---
Imo, it looks really good, since none of the items seen on the pic are set items. This look gets "torn apart" with the ZG patch, that bring in the bloodvine set, that looks like total crap ([https://classicguides.app/content/images/size/w600/2018/06/bloodvine-1.jpg](https://classicguides.app/content/images/size/w600/2018/06/bloodvine-1.jpg)) 
---
25g 
---
All you need? That's gonna take 20% out of his HP. You still have 80% to go while he's wailing on you and interrupting you.
---
Even I dont
---
people just played a spec somewhat suited for both.  
---
check out Kenions famous PvP video eviscerape. or Niar.  
---
these guys raided Naxx in full deathdealer with PvP specs.
---
out MT did very well in PvP by defending flags in AV and AB or grabbing flags in WSG.  
---
a good tank is a nightmare for a melee heavy team in vanilla.  
---
which a lot of teams were.
---
IMO, it adds an element of IRL issues.
---
Sometimes you meet people IRL that you can't communicate with either.  
---
Sure, it is a bit annoying, but come on... just like in your daily life when you come upon an obstacle, find a way to overcome it.
---
I was not ready for this.
---
I refuse to believe that Cryptstalker doesn’t outperform Giantstalker. That miniscule Multi-Shot bonus shouldn’t outperform all the extra stats and mana for higher ranks of Multi-Shot. 
---
Optimal for what? All classes get to groups. He asked what is most fun and will hook him. That is the one he finds the most cool by himself
---
I would never let a shaman show up without mana tide totem. You would have to join a very casual guild.
---
I was looking for this for quite some time, thanks for putting in the hard work!
---
For me it's more my favorite class is Paladin, my favorite role is dps. So you put the two together and yeah.
---
Well, as it was in classic, most of those players stick to artificially "made-up" Russian/Spanish/Italian servers. But in general I can see your point, makes sense to me 
---
Warlocks too
---
And lol paladins shamans look shit most of the time
---
PAX is this weekend - we will most likely get an update here :) hopefully ...
---
So a meme spec is not fine?
---
its from the level 50 sunken temple quest, a quest added in a later patch just think nost never got that far in its patch cycle
---
not sure if trolling, but for the sake of arguing we still have a 16 slot debuff cap.
---
Then again based on simple no ppm limitation and the old assumption of at laest 2 IAotH procs (and no rppm implementation at this point) you could probably get 4 procs per hunter per minute for an average of \~8-10 stacks. 3600 to 4500 RAP
---
You know i really thought you were trolling with that question. Now I know that I have to wait more than a year and a lot of convincing to get multiple hunters from different guilds together to try it out. Back in the days people hated us so much they would have never agreed to help on something like that. Even the 40 hunter rag raids were a pain to organize and had to be initiated with alts
---
And titanic legs
---
I would buy all the underpriced items / and sell them at a profit.
---
I welcome anyone who can speak English, but as the other commenter wrote a lot of Russians can't. If you're able to, you should be able to swap over to the English realms if you so wanted, but I think there should be a 1 or 2 Spanish/French/Russian realms for those who can't. 
---
There is nothing more annoying in retail than joining a dung/bg group with people you can't communicate with and it does nothing but infuriate all parties involved. Knowing how fucking terrible it feels in retail I can't even imagine how much it would suck in vanilla.
---
And rogues and prot wars
---
Laughs in vael top dps
---
Same. Planning the character, levelling alone, letting your imagination go wild, it is so much fun
---
I had 12 chars, almost all of them max level. Never done raids
---
Zoom intensifies
---
That was an issue for one and a half weeks
---
for a very short time period after 2.0 hit the servers t2.5 with 3 pieces of t3 and the aq20 set was BiS
---
You could get rapid fire's cooldown down to 1 min and 19 sec uptime. With hurricane you were firing an arrow every 0.28 seconds with IAotH. Not that hurricane dealt much damage, but the frustration about the cast push back was hilarious :D
---
I always speed level. I love leveling in general but I also like min/maxing in games. I also think the leveling process takes long enough as is. In addition I've seen all the zones countless times already so it's not like I'll be reading quests and trying to figure out what to do. I do hope I'll be able to have some days off when launch happens though.
---
If the appearance at first bothers you, but you choose to min max anyway, you will regret it later when you have to stare at that same character model for the rest of its days.
---
Haha
---
I said to myself many times...."just an undead mage"
---
Yesterday i accepted that i would make a feral druid too
---
In a few weeks i will probably be planning a third char
---
I wish we cant use any addons
---
Lets see who actually is hardcore then without all the handholding
---
Hahaha recognisable. I started playing WoW near the end of Vanilla, and got max level for the first time in WotLK only. Of course I had about a million characters at medium level at the time xDmp
---
Not as a shaman with ghost wolf. zoom zoom.
---
Mags and rogue are Normie classes for normie players 
---
He **specifically** says 7.3.5 at [12:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;t=12m45s). Again as I said in the last thread, there's a chance they'll also merge it with 8.1.x for the actual release version.
---
100% honor
---
* Region- EU
---
* Server Type- Not too bothered. On a RP realm atm on live but I think a PvP server could be fun.
---
* Faction- Horde
---
* Notes- I started playing at the end of Wrath but I've always been interested in vanilla style servers. I've played a few private ones before but never got that far. I'm looking for a guild that doesn't mind bringing me on board and teaching me all I need to know. Not sure how devoted I'm going to be to classic, it depends on how much I like it. Looking to play an Arms Warrior (which was the first class I ever played back in the day). We'll see how it goes really.
---
Cheers
---
They are not re-creating patches. Game will be in 1.12 with some content and quests artificialy time gated.
---
That's the level you realize that you rolled a druid in vanilla. 
---
You can BUY everything alchemy gives you. You can use Herbalism and engineering and get \~same amount of gold just by selling materials to alchemists, if you want. 
---
Also the time you get your mount and lose the only advantage druid has. 
---
&gt; Do you plan to stay hidden and not moving all the time ? As soon as you start to play and a rogue see you it's game over.
---
I think it's for when they need to go AFK for a quick few minutes food/bathroom/work/school related things, in those cases stoneform would help them exactly 0% of the time, where shadowmeld would help them 100% of the time. Unless, of course every ganker just assumes a night elf is shadowmelded and goes full on "If i were an AFK night elf in this &lt;random patch of land, and searching would be a massive waste of time, but ima do it anyways.&gt; i'd be.. here!" and then, the night elf would still win even if the ganker did find them.
---
 But if they were actively doing stuff and a rogue jumped out of stealth poisons and bleeds galore? Stoneform might save them. If the rogue was the same level, and wasn't one of those coldblood gankers who in one rotation would just kill him anyways, without poisons or bleeds.
---
Engineering and alchemy isnt really worth it, the only thing you cannot do on a ALT is major mana potion (of those that you really want). So a L35 char can do almost everything. Just take herbalism and engineering if you want to farm for potion materials instead of your dynamites/sappers. With mining you would get arcane crystals you can then transmute on your alt.
---
stats from private servers stats vanillaradar (i think we can expect about the same on official vanilla): 
---
human - 27.7%  
---
orc - 13.5% (+) troll - 7.5% = 21%  
---
undead - 19.6%  
---
dwarf - 6.7% (+) gnome - 7.1% = 13.8%  
---
night elf - 11.6%  
---
tauren - 6.3%
---
 Succubus seduce macro.
---
I asked my friend this recently, who played Shadow in vanilla. He said Pre-40 (Shadowform) it was significantly tougher, and the main issue is your mana. (Often run out of mana before you kill the enemy).  He said if you adapted with some wanding, dots and kite between your flay/MB it will really help out against melee. He recommended not engaging casters unless you had full mana.
---
Again, not from my own experience, but a close friends.
---
The problem with artificially "made-up" servers is if you accidentaly roll on that server, and you find out about it when its too late. Like I found myself on a turkish server, where litterally more than 50% of people didnt even speak english. It was not fun.
---
Alchemy isnt really a moneymaker, you realistically make money on transmutes (and its a quality of life improvement when you can make what you need). But VERY rarely you can buy herbs, make something and sell it for a actual good profit.
---
Lets say a fire resistance potion, the potion price is 95% based on the one hard to get material. Most times the actual potion sells for LESS than the herbs you make them from.
---
This is a great answer. I would like to add that in WoW it's best to start keybinding on a fresh character where you only need to worry about a few spells at a time and once you get comfortable with that transfer the binds to your main.
---
Don’t play vanilla then LOL 
---
I see you used the same unitframes as me
---
STVietnam of course still got nightmares from ganking rogues and hunters
---
The only good thing (and it is a really good thing) are the squishy wyvern there. Aside from that it isn't really worth the effort for alliance aside from passing through it to get to desolace.
---
right-click reoprt, that is!
---
This is useful for everything
---
Hey man my favorite is 2h Enhancement. Play what you think is fun and challenging. One of my favorite things to do is to try and figure out if there is some way to make a spec viable that everyone craps on. 
---
&gt;a lot of Russians can't.
---
Or just plain refuse to.
---
Manga started in 1999, Anime in 2002. 
---
And then your just applied immolate ticks.
---
Definitely not a troll, just wondering what it would take to make hunters not the worst dps. Would be hilarious if it turned out to be better than any other raid composition. THAT would be the troll to every other class when stats got posted. And they can’t nerf the t2 set bonus, no changes 
---
Blessed post
---
Thanks man.
---
If you were to buy all of those Potions + leveling engineering on the side your gold would be swallowed faster than a lvl 1 attempting to solo Ragnaros
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUPexEfCG7g
---
It’s the T2 set bonus stacking for all hunters that is better than T3. T1 is irrelevant. 
---
Which are the class/spec combos that do both PvP and PvE (dungeons/raiding) with 1 spec, even suboptimal in one or the other? I dont like respeccing few time a week.
---
Reading this makes me very glad I have already decided to roll RP-PvP... if we get them! (We most likely will though, I hope)
---
Lol no, its completely different from start to finnish. The example you used with soul fire/shadowbolt, those are viable in 1v1 cause the enemy is locked down... GL casting any of those while fighting 3 people at the same time.
---
Paladin would need alot more than a taunt to work.
---
I'll admit I had to read about the fight again after all these years - https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Nefarian_(tactics) says nothing about two tanks having to swap aggro on him, since there's just no mechanic requiring them to do that. Am I missing something? Nefarian casts his fear every 30 seconds with a 1.5 second cast time, giving the MT enough time to react (also the ground is shaking). If the MT gets a call out, people need to watch their threat, that I can see. Just like when paladins get a call out (which can't be prevented by FW as far I'm aware). 
---
Glowing hands from scrolls. Cool little visual effect to pvp with.
---
I played BC on a “Brazilian” server : / Gurubashi. I think I transferred halfway through. 
---
Wait. Wotf doesn’t work on it?
---
But druids/mages can just stand at 35 yard range and be completely safe from the fear, can't they?
---
This would take the awesome class identity vanilla has and turn it into the boring as fuck spec identity of retail.
---
Oh, yes, I'm a warlock but right now I don't know how to cast Shadow Bolt... let me just press this button on my interface... ohhh, I can see it now. Yes, I remember how to cast Shadow Bolt! But, what is this... I no longer remember how to cast Rain of Fire?
---
No thanks.
---
Crusader Aura wasn't added until TBC :(
---
&gt;I ignored legendaries except for Thunderfury, which is still a reasonable goal if you are one of the few gifted hunters.
---
FTFY
---
What’s different about the Russian WoW community besides a language barrier? 
---
99% of the time, trying to 'speed level' in Classic would result in a much less fun time for the player, so overall the experience might be more negative.
---
Leveling in Vanilla was slow (not hard necessarily), no matter how you looked at it. Granted, it was way more tedious to make alts and take them up to 60, but this is why having a level 60 mattered way more and the character felt special and meaningful.
---
Also, this time around, the novelty of being 'one of the first' and even doing raid firsts would be way less, if any. This is why I think everyone should try to just take it in slowly and have a good time. I mean sure you should still do 24/7 marathons just because #nolife, but I don't see the point in hardcore 'speed leveling'. At least not at the start.
---
But to each, their own.
---
I wouldn't know. Effectively the same thing though
---
I was in a 80% greek guild back in the day. High tempers, rampant disconnects on bosses and poor English. There was a certain charm to it, but at some point it does become too much if your communication with the individual is equivalent to trying to talk with a brick.
---
I would welcome servers with dedicated languages in Russian/Italian/Spanish etc.
---
Darksorrow?
---
I love how resto Druid wears the dress until Naxx, lol. 
---
So you are into [wolf packs](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903#wolf)    ;)
---
Not many go as far as aq so its less relevant to talk about. And its ugly.
---
Naxx is iconic
---
If your favourite class is paladin, you should definitely go ahead and play that. Remember that alts are (almost) mandatory in Classic so you can always make a warrior down the line and scratch that fury itch. I recommend maining the class you like the best.
---
*Teeth grinding intensifies*
---
Its a massive handicap if u wanna raid as ret so warrior then
---
Speedlevel then get distracted by anything
---
well with 14 stacks (keeping the bare minimum of sunder and either clap or thunderfury for the minimum mt survivability) we would be looking at min-max ranges of 2100 (apdpsX2.7) to 3100(apdpsX4.1) non crit autoshots out of ashjrethul (the most likely weapon to be the average among such a collection of 8 piece T2 chars)
---
no glances are possible so the braindead afk autoshot hunters would sit at 1100-1200 dps.
---
Bit it is highly unlikely that you will ever see a 14 debuff uptime even with 25 hunters. At the start of the fight sure ... but a single FD resist. God the poor tank :D
---
brpsee... I recall this channel name somehow, though I don't remember what was it for
---
me but instead I have leveled 3 characters to 60 in 6 months
---
Orc warlock
---
My experience from gaming is that Russiand are often very toxic. A lot of raging and name calling. Could be confirmation bias but that's my perception from private servers, dota and cs. 
---
&gt; That was 13 years ago; think about how much we've advanced in game knowledge since then. Many people are going to smash through the T1 content with relative ease.
---
You know what else has changed in 13 years? People's standards. There are now expectations about clear times, you expect to be done with whole MC in one hour or two if it's a pug for example. Anyone who has done that will not go back into 3-6 hour clears. You will not get those fast clears if you don't even require proper specs from people. I'd be really curious to see a guild recruitment that has good clear times by modern standards while also saying you can be whatever spec you want.
---
This is true.
---
Oh thank god you watched it for me. I was dreading the idea. See? Now *that* is proper evidence. Now I can move on to the next issue. 
---
These stories are wild haha
---
Rogue
---
Look for a non-hardcore or semi-hardcore guild. Be there on release.
---
Be an active, friendly, helpful member. Post in the forum, talk in Discord.
---
Make friends with your guild mates, especially the officers. 
---
You will get a spot in the 40 man raid as Ret if you do these things.
---
Lol
---
Haha, I actually remember the guy who was claiming world of roguecraft 1 was staged, it’s funny how after all these years, I can remember the forum drama on the Arthas realm forum.
---
In anticipation before the movie was released, there was a guy posting as a level 49 female undead priest, spamming every thread about the upcoming movie being staged, and that there was no way a naked rogue could kill rank 14 geared players.
---
This was before the stunlock was shown, and there was no rogues before that who actually utilized sap as a way of waiting for diminishing returns to reset.
---
If I remember correctly, he shut up after the movie was released.
---
Its one thing to break the norm and find new optimal ways of being an effective player.
---
But its another thing when the game is patch locked and actual game mechanics actively fuck you over.
---
This really won't be the case, if you find the right guild and/or friends on your server.
---
You know what else is like irl? Using the brain to avoid pointlessly annoying things.
---
It might also be tied with that AQ and ZG are not linear raids. Viscidus is skippable and many ZG bosses are. Could be why most people prefer to benchmark MC, BWL and Naxx as there is only one way to complete them.
---
Haha that’s looking like burning crusade DPS! Looks like I’ll be pugging BWL on my hunter whenever I can. 
---
There are more mages but many are needed
---
If u dont have good attendance its better as mage I think guilds need reliable healers. And mages dont need great gear for pvp.
---
Moonbrook. 
---
It's very expensive to buy your potions, you will clearly use less if you're not an alchemist.
---
Sorry, i know I'm not helping you ;-)
---
Pls no
---
Shaman dps sucks in pve
---
In pvp its a meme relying on random procs. Its a youtube montage thing where you need cherry picked rare moments to look fun
---
Totem management sucks in pve but for pvp u dont need to keep all 4 just key situational ones
---
Renataki's charm of beasts
---
and they will never know what hit them
---
&lt;3
---
Never seen gnome only groups
---
You are correct at that point, but any advancement passed that stage, the pet itself gets no additional benefits. Thus the pet starts to become less useful damage wise. AQ for example, they are significantly less impactful than they were in MC (This is why hunters were modified in TBC to scale better). 
---
There were some cool ones. I was in a guild called Los Papas, or “the dudes”. Not “the potatoes”. I remember a dude named krovikan had terribly hilarious English. I was in ventrillo with him and a real life friend and he started rapping in Brazilian. Then my friend jokingly insulted him. As a comeback, he said “..tell your mother.. I got samthane..” 
---
Was fucking hilariously nonsensical while still getting the point across 
---
Yes, playing well and going fun is NOT FUN. We should all play like you for our own good.
---
Most guilds will allow it
---
Just try harder for consumables and preraid bis
---
retro wow
---
100 dollary doos.
---
Either way, what a bitch.
---
Thanks for the reply, very informative and helpful:) Isn't it ironic that more knowledge and insights only makes choosing a class harder?
---
thats more like it
---
A paladin with BRE... thousands of private server players are crying out in terror
---
Could probably find somebody with a solo private server and just invite 40 hunters and give them the gear GM style for testing.
---
Let's do the world championship of rowing without any oars. Just pure hardcore rowing with your arms.

Aside from what others have said so far, the 3 raids you mention drop tier 1,2, and 3 so they get mentioned more. 
---
AQ I only did a could of bosses in 20 man but ZG I did a lot of it was a good raid but intended as a catch up raid for gear as items from there sit between MC and BWL in terms of quality so if you're going for firsts or you're in a good raiding guild early then you've more than likely surpassed ZG for gear so no need to do the raid other than enchants and other sundry items 
---
ZG is considered a catch-up raid. You don't need as many players, the fights are not that hard and the gear is great if you are newbie, okayish if you already progressed well in 40mans. 
---
I might be wrong, but if you already farmed BWL you don't get that many and that huge upgrades from ZG.
---
Blizzlike cap of 2.5K-3.5K. Having a huge population like Nostalrius did is a fun novelty at first, but it eventually wears on you and makes playing the game a chore (e.g. when players outnumber the mobs in a zone 3:1) and it will make dynamic respawns for gathering materials a necessity which in turn will tarnish the economy.
---
It’s been 15 years. No one will magically find a way to make ret work. 
---
What are you talking about? "*... for your own selfish interest*". You're very good at twisting what I'm saying and providing one-liners such as '#nochanges', and honestly quite terrible at producing solid arguments.
---
Obviously I'm not trying to force my idea onto the community and I'm most certainly not trying to say that the developers must implement this because I want it. I was simply asking to see what kind of interest the community has in this idea. The reason being that to me, as I mentioned earlier, there is a HUGE difference between adding items and mechanics to the game vs. adding more options for VISUAL-CUSTOMIZATION during the character creation screen.
---
Character creation != actual gameplay. It's mainly for this reason that I, as I stated earlier, find your comparison between adding mounts and adding more character options to be unreasonable and not relevant.
---
This might just be me, but you feel extremely biased towards your own interests in this discussion. I recommend, for future discussions, that you attempt to take a step back and view things more objectively.
---
Mind u spec means nothing for 5mans
---
Id go orc warlock SL for high durability but slow damage. Basically just outliving the enemy lol
---
Nelf hunter bm with a cat. Gonna be fun ambushing people thinking they can sneakily cap a bg base.
---
Enha orc shaman for meme procs instakilling low gear people.
---
I think u have to pick what is less gear dependant. One that does better in tier 0 or 0.5 and pvp blues ( Doubt u gonna get highrank for epics). I think it can be hunter cuz the pet carries you ( and u get a great starter gun from quests) but warlock is nice too when u get a bit more hp. Enha seems very dependant on a good 2h and +crit but maybe arcanite reaper can last u a long time? 
---
Im a bit out of the loop and appreciate if you would give me info: is TBC coming after Classic? Because TBC was my absolutely favorite expansion an it would bring back so many memories.
---
3,5K cap in the beginning to prevent massive overpopulation in the starting areas slowly increasing towards healthy 5-6K population would be ideal for for me. I’ve been playing on pservers with 10K players and the game feels so alive that the pros definitely outweigh the cons. If the population stays at 3K you’ll have problems looking for groups to do dungeons with, let alone daily MC/Ony pugs (which practically wont happen). PvP queues would take forever to pop and world would feel empty with very low amount of wPvP whatsoever. But that’s just mine opinion, some people prefer smaller population.
---
I hope Blizzard add more realms than they've estimated they'll need with the intention of merging those that end up with very low populations.
---
Nope. Its not counted as a fear effect, Horrify IIRC. Can be despelled though.  
---
Pet set on aggressive, true Vanilla hunter here :D
---
We have different perspectives. I look at this through quite casual lens' as that is usually the majority. My leveling during Nostalrius was casual due to other time commitments and it took me 2 and a half months just to level to 60. That's a very long time to be playing a single game and I am glad that the dungeons required some tactical and strategic depth.
---
Sure, if you keep playing the game for longer you will end up at a point where you will have done more level capped dungeons than leveling dungeons but what about when I make another character? Maybe of the opposite faction where the leveling experience will vary wildly. That's another month or maybe more for a casual player to experience the dungeons.
---
Again, I am not disagreeing with you about the difficulty of high level M+. I think it's one of the great things about the game. But when I played in Legion in a semi-HC guild that pushed mythic progression, I noticed that the vast majority of our guild members (the casual members that didn't raid) didn't push the weekly chests ever. Most would do +4 or +6. Many didn't even bother doing M+.
---
I understand if we're looking at this strictly from a skilled veteran's perspective, the situation will change drastically as the most optimal pulls and routes have been figured out and they will gravitate to the easiest method.
---
This meme template is something I didn’t know I needed until now. Bonus points for changing the angle of the face in the middle picture.
---
Shoutout to Kobold Geomancers near Jasperlode Mine and the murloc camp by Eastvale Logging Co.
---
Dispel range is shorter than healing range so you'd have to run in. I'm not sure if mages can out range the fear while dpsing so they would have to run out wait then back in to dispel. Either way it's much easier to keep fear wards. This also prevents tank from losing all his rage (minus whatever they have in TM) when they dance so their TPS is higher. 
---
5-10k
---
Thanks for the reply
---
&gt; One big thing I suggest you weigh: How much effort do you want to expend every time you fire the game up
---
This is a great point. I don't mind learning some complicated mechanics. Interesting that you put Lock last. I always imagine lock being quite demanding with a ton of keybinds and spells; things like Felhunter sef-dispel macros etc. 
---
I am however not looking to commit all my time to this game. So I'd prefer each piece of loot being great for both PvE and PvP. That'd leave leave out druid and shaman, no?
---
&gt; Other part 2 : How savvy are you at the ingame economy? How do you plan to make your day to day gold? 
---
I want an epic mount ASAP to help with ganks etc. Hunter / lock would be fine for gold farming obviously. As a healer I think I'd rely on farming rich thorium and crafting mooncloth + arcanite. Any other suggestions?
---
&gt; Even if you, by the numbers, farm more gold with Hunter, or have a higher win ratio in fights with Lock, a good PVP healer requires a certain type of person, and that type is not common.
---
I do absolutely love PvP healing. But it's also what I've been doing a lot. That's another question many are struggling with as well I think: New experience or tried and true? Thanks for the reply
---
Yeah this is problem with any game. I don't hate Russians as persons but it's impossible to play with thems as I can't understand language and they don't speak English. I want to play with people not with "bots who don't communicate" 
---
Anything other than 2.5k or maybe 3k is a really major change to the way real vanilla WoW was. It was *meant* to be hard to get groups and organise pug raids. Vanilla WoW is *meant* to be a relatively lonely experience. The pirate server bullshit zerg where every single spawning point has three people camping it is not vanilla. It is not even close.
---
Massively overloaded pirate servers effectively have cross-realm battlegrounds and LFG switched on, because it is incredibly easy to get dungeon runs or PvP at will. That is not now it is meant to be.
---
Shard management is a buzzkill tho
---
Its what put me off pvp
---
I think you'll be very frustrated with the sorry state of ret pal if you call yourself a competitive player. With Naxx BiS gear it barely reaches the DPS of a blue geared pre-raid warrior. Base damage is bad, scaling is bad.
---
Sorry for not sugar coating it, I'm just being honest and I'm sure you know that already since you are not a rookie and went through the issues of being accepted with such a nerfed build in the past.
---
Do you want to paint the room or watch it dry?
---
Warlock sm/ruin iirc
---
There arent many ally spriests either
---
?
---
The curse of envy
---
Those won't be in the game until around AQ iirc
---
Except for hunters
---
BG's with a healer, I would say you're going to be hard pressed to beat a geared warrior. Vanilla very much felt like you were built for the constant fight to fight layout. 1v1 they are pretty strong with reck popped, without it comes down to hell well the enemy can kite/you can stick to them. 1vX they will be very hard pressed if they know what they are doing. Your strat here will be to try and gear a fear, potentially hamstring a melee and stick to the ranged. Unless you can burst one of them very quickly or use toys from engineering to cc one, it won't be smooth. WPvP I've left as its mostly a mix of the above.
---
Rogue will be insanely good for 1v1 as you would expect. Great damage output and with access to Engineering/Thistle Tea it will continue to do very well 1vX given the CC you have available, with resets from Vanish. Hunters will be your bane, with hunters mark/pets autoattack being notoriously hilarious in vanilla, chasing rogues for absolutely miles. BG's they continue to do very well, especially when geared &amp; using combat your sustained DPS is excellent. Great flag assassins. 
---
Shamans. I can't speak for Elemental or Resto as I never played it. Just bear in mind that the crazy 2h WF proc 1 shots aren't going to happen all the time. IIRC WF has a 20% proc chance, combined with a 3-3.6s AA it takes a while for you to get your damage out, the key will be to use your other abilities, totems etc (Of which Shaman has LOADS aha) to kite/cc between swings and minimize the damage you take. When it procs, it will be VERY satisfying. As a result however, 1v1 you are very competitive, but 1vX will be your downfall without a 1 shot. BG's they are good, but again you will go down easy and very susceptible to being kited yourself.
---
Warlocks will be very strong, potentially king of 1v1 with Fear/Succubus, curses and very impressive damage output &amp; survivability. 1vX again will be much easier with the CC you have at hand, even without things from Engi. Same goes for BG's. I may be bitter given I never played Warlock in Vanilla, but they always felt horrible to fight unless I burst them down. I distinctly remember, infact might even have fraps footage of a warlocks staff of atiesh/Zando hero charm 11k shadowbolt on my then \~6.7k hp warrior. 
---
1 arrow per projectile.
---
Pleasure.
---
I have the same problem
---
Ud rogues look awesome
---
But theen there is SW
---
Btw if I walk there as horde do I still hear the bridge music? While ganking afkers lmao
---
Except southern barrend
---
Warstomp means you can get away from the enemy. Really good trait.
---
It's 10%, not 20, where it would actually mean something. And why would you use such important skill as kidney shot, which eats your cp, not behind the target to negate dodge/parry?
---
I was a lvl 13 tauren hanging out in ogrimmar, a random lvl 60 tried to trade me 1000 gold (he even pressed trade and everything)
---
But I didn't get what was going on so cancelled the trade.
---
Still keeps me up at nights 
---
Yes, you would have to literally run 5 yards. I know that's hard to perfectly execute in an encounter, but if we're theorycrafting so hard then let's go all in (something I really don't see the need to do btw). If I remember correctly, with arctic reach, frostbolt has a range of 36 yards, so yes they should be able to out range the fear. If the lead assigns a mage to decurse (a druid probably makes more sense tho), then yes he will have to run 6 yards in, decurse, and run back out. Incase he fucks up und runs into a fear (not sure how often these spells overlap), he can ice block afaik. Not too complicated of a role for a last boss if you ask me. 
---
About tanks losing some of their rage when stance dancing.. can't argue with how much impact that really has, but I'd guess it's negligible. They won't sit on 100 rage when they stance dance, but instead use some of that before they are forced to switch stances.
---
How do you deal with the PvE tho
---
I guess the community aspect is really the biggest argument for blizzlike population caps. When you are on a smaller server your reputation and accomplishments really stand out.
---
First of all, I’m not saying that it wouldn’t be a change, because it would. Damn, some changes are already confirmed to be in the game. The pservers I played on didn’t have cross realm BGs or even LFG option and they were quite close to authentic Vanilla experience. 
---
Secondly, the cap was 2.5K because the HW couldn’t handle any more back then. 
---
Thirdly, this is something that almost everyone would benefit from. 5-6K, however scary it sounds to you, is not bad when people are nicely spread out all over the world (that might happen after a month or two after release). You bump into people often, but that’s the principle of MMORPGs. 
---
I hope for the same. Being on a low population server is not fun, neither in retail nor classic.
---
My brother did this shit. Called it his army.
---
Too true
---
Lots of people look at the high end problems the dps and gold farm for naxx but lmao 90% still wont set foot in there
---
OTOH there are more raid slots for mage
---
Yeah its the master class
---
go to r/wowservers for this. they have a list. 
---
Man those geomancers...
---
Golemagg will be so sad
---
So you’re telling me there wasn’t a community on Nostalrius? Have you even played there? What definitely wears on you is lack of players, long searches for dungeons, long waits for PvP queues and inability to find a guild that raids in your desired time of the day or not enough items and/or ridiculous prices in the AH.
---
U only gonna need like 500g
---
Paladin q?
---
T0.5 quest
---
Thanks for the reply, very valuable comments
---
&gt; Are you leveling as Disc?
---
Although it'd be cool to level as disc, I think leveling as shadow is too good to pass up on a PvP server.
---
&gt; Melee pressure is difficult to handle compared to other healers/casters.
---
This is my experience as well. I've PvP-healed as Shaman and Druid. For druid of course pressure is no problem, just run away. For shaman it's very annoying, but they're quite tanky. Priests are very squishy though. What do you think on how priests deal with pressure comparatively? In my view it's not too positive, but might be biased because of year of playing Shaman and UD rogue.
---
the countdown to classic podcast just did a segment on aq.  but I think for how iconic the gates opening event was, and how iconic cthun is, no one really seemed to enjoy aq like they did the other raids. it's also only a tier 2.5 set.  but I think most of what people say is true for aq 40 in terms of team needs but there should be guides out there if you're looking for optimized raid comps. 
---
Wtf am I supposed to do on the weekends? Talk to my wife??
---
Druid lashers how?
---
Its still warr &gt; rogue &gt; mage &gt; lock
---
There was a "community" in the sense that there were a fuckton of people, but keeping track of everyone was impossible and the idea of players having reputations of severely diminished. I played on both servers, but I preferred Nostalrius PVE which had a population of 3-3.5K and I never had any trouble finding groups for dungeons and I still ran into people while questing all the time.
---
I don't understand the notion that you must have at least ten thousand people on the realm or it's read came from, but we can probably blame Nostalrius.
---
The t2 chest is better than the dress so i don't know why it shows that...
---
Some will find they enjoy an actual MMO RPG, others will hate it because it lacks the brainless nature of having the game play itself or find the fact that players must interact with each other distasteful.
---
Most Retail players will probably try out Classic, hate it after not being able to fight 7 mobs at once at level 5, and then go back to Retail -- which is fine.  Both versions of Warcraft can cater to different audiences.
---
Oh that motherfucker! He's like what, 5-6 levels above his area? And elite? He snuck up on me soooo many times and just obliterated me. I feared that guy more than i feared stitches tbh.
---
I agree completely with BoA, DFT, BB and QSR.  
---
I was more wondering about the pre-raid BiS. I did the numbers myself and I think you're right, I got different numbers than you did though.  
---
4-pc set: 67 agi + 40AP.
---
other items (the same 4 as you used): 65 agi + 24AP + 2% crit. 
---
So it seems like the "alternative" pieces would be better yes. I'm guessing the beaststalker recommendation is on the premise of DM not being available at launch, whereas the other pieces are. So what he should've done is mark the DM pieces in green boxes aswell as the beaststalker 4 pc, to emphasize that these would be better once they become available.
---
I think they will react by bitching about classic not being more like retail - like we've been seeing
---
Oh yeah these, jesus christ you think you're gonna kill one, and you can just BARELY kill one your own level, and the fucker pops a healing potion. RIP.
---
"Secondly, the cap was 2.5K because the HW couldn’t handle any more back then." 
---
I don't know where this idea comes from, but it's definitely not the case. Blizzard purposely selected the server cap they did for more tight-knit communities.
---
Your assessment seems to be correct. Also note that strength increases defenses by increasing the block value of your shield. So agi gives dodge and str gives block basically. Both give dmg but str gives more AP and agi will include crit as you mentioned. Both are useful for a protection paladin. I think it would depend greatly on which gear you get.  
---
Also if you duo level with a lock, protection might not be the best option. Retri can dish out quite a bit of dmg while leveling and holy combined with a tanking voidwalker will allow you to duo very hard monsters. It's up to you of course. Also do not forget that while leveling talents do not pigeon hole you into a playstyle. For example, just because you spec prot doesn't mean you cannot heal.  
---
Best of luck to you!  
---
Strenght everytime. The amount of extra crit you gain from those leveling gear is extremely low. And I would think twice about leveling as a prot. Especially if your boii has a warlock (= he has a pet that tanks better than any pala could) rather go for that 2 dps more and go ret haha
---
Why is Vanilla Wow meant to be a lonely experience?
---
so while things may have changed.. for most of the recipes you can find them on live wowhead.. and it'll give you the red number for when you can learn it.. but for some reason on classic wowhead that number is missing.
---
but I've noticed quite a few things about the item databases on classic wowhead are broken. 
---
um, they can just revive at any spirit healer anywhere, and it will warp them back to the one nearest their body.
---
I like how he starts casting another fireball everytime they have like 5% hp left instead of just fireblasting them lmao
---
How are ZG bosses skippable? You literally cant kill Hakkar then? 
---
AQ is pretty linear, only really visci and ouro can be left out and are only a slight detour from the main path.
---
The people we don't want in Classic will either never try it, or try it and hate it. The fact that level 20 is where the game picks up for a lot of classes is great, means we can thin the heard early. 
---
ZG is quite clear as to why, it is a 20 man raid. In our guild we even got through with 10 well equipped guys.
---
AQ on the other hand I dont think is left out all too much. In raid footage yes, its just ugly af. But in terms of guides and shit I think it is quite well documented
---
One of the ways I use to overcome annoying obstacles is to avoid them in the future.
---
First of all, it doesn't compare so you shouldn't. Secondly, I like to think of classic as a more hardcore version of retail. Retail is more like a theme park where classic can actually be punishing and therefore also more rewarding. Classic in my opinion is also more immersive. I think there will always be a crowd of people who are more interested in this play style (regardless of age or nostalgia goggles). Asmongold (youtuber) likes to mention this as well. He says that there will always be a new generation of young neckbeards who just want to slay dragons. Also retail is more friendly to players who have little time to invest whereas classic really rewards people who can put in a lot of time. Usually younger people in high school/college have a lot more time on their hands than the people who were around that age in classic and have actual responsibilities now.
---
Yeah but when you sre in aq gear you don't need do go to every zg.
---
The community was awesome and I knew a shit ton of people and almost every guild. You won’t really know “everyone”, as some people prefer not to socialize at all. I’ve also never said that I wanted 10k pop. I’m just saying that I’d rather have 10k than an empty server. I also had a toon on Nostalrius PvE and finding groups was okay only during the peak times while practically impossible in the morning.
---
It depends on how you intend to level, tons of spirit and str with just enough stam is going to be the better way to deal damage and regen mana for heals.
---
Hell yeah just got 4 pieces of tier 2.5 past night I'm about to spec arms and go tear face with my Untamed blade and rip some PvP up!
---
Keep telling yourself that. 
---
I can give two shits about the raid, I don't play for them. If they want my help they have it but I'm not interviewing for a fookin job over here.
---
You increase spawn rates for quest mobs only, while decreasing their drop rates on anything not quest related.
---
This gives all players ability to complete quests while maintaining the economy and make those NPCs not worth farming.
---
Just so this in the 1-10 zones so players get out of those areas.
---
As a Pala main I say: go fury if wanna do them melees. Seriously, ret is, in essence, hoping for proccs.
---
Because most people don't like being a freakin' cookie-cutter BIS robot, and try and find some uniqueness in the meta. 
---
"Vanilla WoW is meant to be a relatively lonely experience"
---
Definitely disagree with that. 
---
Dang you mean I'll have to settle for soulseeker and let some lucky mage get wraithblade? staves are more badass.
---
Why would you want a reset??? Have two sets of servers. One static classic, one new classic progression. When new classic servers are being released, merge them. If the servers are going to be reset I don’t see the point in this. 
---
I want to say that there are armor pieces that are in demand for resists. I’d have to go back to look at some spreadsheets but want to say there are pants that are BIS for awhile until later raids
---
Armorsmith, provided you get can get Lionheart and/or Titanic plans early on.
---
"Our hero has fallen".

I remember on Cata, something happened to my server and everything froze. (A crash basically) and I decided to fly all the way to EK from Kalimdor. After a lot of autopilot cruising I came across this wall. It felt very mysterious and awesome to discover something you were never meant to.
---
What part of that is wrong?
---
not happening with modern servers
---
With hostility.  A lot of retail players with no desire for classic that I have read comments from think that Classic is taking resources away from retail.  They view us Classic players as effectively thieves stealing from their pocket directly.
---
STR is better. 
---
But generally it's a much better idea to level 2h ret with a friend, like really.
---
Players have changed over the years. We've "evolved" from small communities, to towns into even bigger cities. In small communities you've known the names of almost anyone. Back when i was playing Q3, I could name almost all the people I've played with. Couple years down the line, things got more mainstream and towns started to evolve (read: player numbers got bigger and bigger). This was the time where you'd possibly still known your neighbours names but you had no actual idea who lived down the street. But things didn't stop there and things became more and more mainstream. We're a full blown major city now and you're LUCKY if you have neighbours that you can call by name. Because just like yourself, they don't really care about the people surrounding them. They mind their own business and technology has allowed for people to stay in closer contact to those they actually like rather than those they might get to like, if only they'd give them the chance to know each other.
---
If anyone believes that WoW: Classic is going to be a small community they are super mistaken... It's going to be town sized at least and it is up to us to create communities within this town to not be affected by the people who strife to be living in the cities. We have to find people that like communities. We should allow for contact to the lost people and show them how great communities can be but if they show any signs of resistance, quite frankly I'd kick them out of my guild faster than you could argue against it.
---
Ultimately though, we ALL have changed. No one is playing WoW - even wow classic - the way they did back in 2004. We know all the quests. We know all the bosses. We know everything that is to come (read: content, not #nochanges). There is no more mystery. We've now "seen it all". This alone changes things a lot. Most of us are also older which means that we don't have as much time as we've used to. Therefore going out of our way to help some dude for a couple of hours in many cases won't be happening. 
---
I'd like to believe that all people who I'll meet on classic want to have a good playing experience. I would really love that. Most likely though the hugest part of the community will be self-centred and trying to get to 60 as quick as possible and get the best gear as fast as possible. Simple example: I'd be very curious to see how many mages will pass on Cookies Cooking Rod because that Priest in their group hasn't found a wand yet.
---
This is kind of embarrassing because this was just 3 years ago when I leveled on a private server lol...I had no idea you could make your pet auto taunt every time it was off cooldown so all the way from level 10-60 I was spam clicking taunt for every mob...
---
I thought that some alchemy items were Bind on Pickup?
---
So you can't use all potions without the profession right?
---
Yeah, or you do manage kill him seconds before his two buddies smash you.
---
What do you mean?? That Robe of the Archmage is classy as fuck
---
When you are playing the game in yellow predownloading state you still can encounter this blue wall.
---
Anything like this for WOTLK?
---
Is anyone interested in playing Alliance on Asian servers?
---
Speed level to 40, get my mount and then take it slow. My goal is to hit 40 one week after release.
---
Why not greek server? It looks like it was your problem lol
---
Agreed.  Every DPS warrior needs Lionheart; only the warriors that want to help out caster dps, need Nightfall (be the latter).
---
That first self crafted lesser wand 
---
Mark Kern said this in the classicast episode with Mark Kern and John Staats.
---
I had a dream about launch day and the character creation screen, it was really exciting and then I woke up.
---
Ret pala will not be invited in competitive raids. Just a fact.
---
Which is sort of funny, since one can just go play retail...
---
you may want to change the dressing room link to something else than a naked nelf :D 
---
tho I actually like how dwarf priests look
---
more than human and nelf ( for males)
---
LAZYPIG
---
I explored a ton of Vanilla and my memory is completely blank on this wall. Was it across every part of the border, or only in specific spots?
---
See you on the battlefield 
---
Not anymore. It's invisible now.
---
Wait, was it a thing on Classic? I thought they added it in Cataclysm, I recall flying to the edge of Outland and there was no such thing.
---
The big question is are you dedicated to doing DPS in raids? I know paladins can have a hybrid of holy/ret to still do damage outside of dungeons and be a fun pvp class with its holy capabilities while healing in raids for gear. If the class is truly where your heart is I feel like there's a compromise you could make in able to still get into raids for gear and still be able to do damage in pvp/farming.
---
Yep! Enter a duel with them in Silithus, CoR them, and follow along - but don't get too far away - as they kite the mob.
---
I didn't even know that such thing even existed, I started playing in April 2007 and I still learn new things about this game.
---
I never used that. 
---
Half the fun in fearing people was watching them run around like headless chickens.
---
With either it comes down to being able to get the recipes. Food for thought.
---
It's actually two different dresses, the one from aq40 just have the same color. :(
---
I seem to recall there were *some* mobs in raid you definitely *shouldn't* use CoR on.. but I can't remember which ones.
---
The biggest thing you need to know about professions is vendor specific recipes and which ones are dropped from dungeons. The reason you should learn which vendors have what recipes is because they are limited quantity on a reset timer from when someone buys them. So some recipes may be worth buying early before your mount. I/e the free action potion recipe is bought from a vendor and it’s the most camped recipe in the game. 
---
2H, STR, all the way. One handers suck for leveling.
---
..and sap.
---
sometimes.
---
The AQ upgrades pale in comparison to naxx gear, and ZG is all about doing the mechanics and not being afk or retarded.
---
If you try super hard with 30 obscure consumables you can sort of do same dps as a mediocre pure.
---
Only if your healers suck. There is not a single boss that should go without CoR.

I'm more worried about elitists than retail players honestly.
---
If you don't like Classic for whatever reason, you don't last long, you just quit after a bit and your impact ends there.
---
I also believe we often underestimate younger players, I think many will like the challenge and become regular.
---
Elitists are there to stay instead, and can be quite poisonous sometimes, that's a long lasting impact, unlike those quitting because they don't like the game or interacting with the community.
---
That laptop is good to go, I would suggest replacing the HD with a 1TB SSD, they’re only like $115 now a days. r/buildapcsales

I really wanna try pally ret in vanilla, is it really that bad of a spec?

---
well they definitely won't be able to level to 60. they probably will say its boring, repetitive and slow paces. i expect a lot of dps rotation mocking.
---
Shamans want mp5, thats a mp5 chest
---
I'll be playing shaman, but for sure! 
---
Summon an infernal in a friendly lowbie town, then letting it loose.
---
More points for using Ritual of Doom instead and kill a lowbie with it.
---
This massively. The fact that they \*can\* coexist is a big thing most are overlooking, it isn't a binary option. 
---
I personally will live inside of classic once its out, but I know it won't appeal to all. I mean look at the BlizzCon demo, I loved it going back to slower gameplay where class differences are very bold for example. Not everyone has access to a CC button, Big defensive button, etc.
---
Not really. People read about warlocks and see a few awesome people playing them, but when push comes to shove Warlocks are overwhelmed with more or less useless spells and pets, and lose at least one bag slot for soul shards, and on top of that they're never topping DPS charts and usually only wanted in groups for their ability to summon people.. and that summon still required two other people to come to the warlock, so the warlock will go to the instance, while everyone else plants their butts in the auction house and whine and moan for a summon.
---
Most warlocks won't make it to level 30.
---
Can you speak Russian?
---
I’m no expert but I have leveled a paladin to ~36 on p servers and it is basically just auto attacking. Overall dps is much lower than other classes but your survivability and versatility is much higher.  You wear plate, you can heal, on demand stun, 10 sec immunity, and so on.  Oh and you provide buffs and everyone likes buffs. 
---
However, you could mind control another priest. Make them cast Levitate on themselves. And then jump of the cliff. 
---
Is the mount thing really different though? They're just visual variations. Same mount speed, same single rider function, no altering of game play.
---
From experience people who play meme specs generally are not willing to put in the effort to make it sorta viable. People who want to put in effort don’t gimp themselves
---
I see, guess it's warlock/spriest time :V
---
Negatively, because the people who still stick with retail, despite the state it's been in for more than half a year now, won't see the appeal of Vanilla. Just take a look at /r/wow in the past month or so, the things they're most outraged at recently are cosmetics and the removal of conveniences (portals in this case). If you offered them a choice between High Elves or a complete revamp to the game's systems, an alarming amount of people would choose the former.
---
Of course there are still a sizeable amount of people who are disgruntled over the state of class design, but what they're looking for is more balanced and action packed gameplay, and Vanilla does not exactly tick those boxes.
---
Retail is an action collection game while Vanilla is an MMORPG, the games are so different that it's only natural they'll attract two very different crowds, and I feel like that's part of the reason Classic is even happening.
---
I would be fine with the old pop cap amount but I would like to see sharding in the starting zones due to so many people who are going to be questing at the start, it will make the first 10 level be miserable. But once you get to westfall the sharding is over and you can only see people from your realm. I am not a huge fan of changing it but I would rather have a semi playable first 10 levels and getting rid of all the people who just wanted to try it for a few hours not ruin the experience by it taking 4-5 times longer to do every starting quest. 
---
Yeah if you throw too many shadowburns it becomes a problem. 
---
It's not a big deal since you didn't play vanilla.
---
Well lucky for you I’ll be orc =P
---
I think almost everyone agrees that 12k or whatever nost had was too much. But i'm not gonna lie, 5k was when i had the most fun.
---
I'm fine with them keeping the cap at 3.5k, but i feel like a slightly higher cap was more fun. I still knew all the guilds and players, but there was just a lot more going on in the world with wpvp and dungeons and getting groups while levelling.
---
It's not a big deal since you and Asmongold didn't play vanilla.
---
I will be rolling an alliance mage and have been debating the gnome vs human for awhile now. If we're talking pure min/max, gnome is the better race, however gear aesthetics are kinda important for me (I like to be able to see the gear I'm wearing in more detail) and with gnomes they're just too damn small to appreciate the gear.
---
Blue walls still existed in last patch of Legion. Not sure why people are saying they don't exist anymore. If it's removed, it had to have been removed in BFA.
---
WOTLK was my version of your TBC raiding and PvP. So pumped for classic drop. I think I’ll level substantially faster and more efficiently than I did back when I was 12 😂😂😂
---
There’s never fewer rogues. 
---
I introduced a few freinds to wow and always recommended hunters or mages as a first toon. Didn't want them to start a warrior and get discouraged due to the frustration.  But it really boils down to what they want to run with.  Explain the pros &amp; cons of the classes as best you can and let them make the choice. 
---
Guess I'll see you outside Orgrimmar, then. ;)
---
HINTERLANDS 
---
i hope the majority stays away. they are mostly instant gratification millenials now or people who have maybe 5-6 hours of free time a week and still demand to progress just as fast as anyone who plays 24/7.
---
These people will be a constant pain in everyones ass and there is a SHITLOAD of them out there
---
That was based on that when asked in English they clearly understand what you are talking about and then just keep on talking Russian in text chat.
---
Suddenly when they want/need something from you, they can talk in English just fine.
---
I think you mean the former 
---
They already confirmed they would do sharding in starting zones upon release. I also think it's some kind of necessary evil in this case. Letting hundreds of people into the starting zone at the same time is a bad idea.
---
Former devs have literally said that. It's not something I just made up.
---
What do you mean by mainspec? Are you melee hunter?
---
I know they talked about but haven't confirmed it but I think it's smart to do since the beginning areas don't really mean much in the grand scheme of things. 
---
Portals, man.
---
Portals!
---
Think of the *gold*!
---
I don't want to play with Russians. They often speak broken English, they setup their own isolated communities, and they are not pleasant people to play games with in my opinion.
---
Whenever i see someone with "RU" or "RUS" in their name i actively avoid them. Hopefully Blizzard adds Russian servers, this isn't even a change to the game, just an infrastructure change.
---
Dimishing returns wasn't a thing back then as I recall
---
I suggest 2.5K-3.5K because Nost PVE had that level of population and it felt just right to me. I wouldn't mind if it was closer to 5K, but I absolutely do not want to see 13K players on one realm ever again. That shit was not fun if you cared about actually accomplishing anything in the open world.
---
Ret DPS is interesting? Uuhh isn't it just pretty much autoattack 90% of the time?
---
I would seriously consider gnome if the warlock mount wasn't a horse.
---
I can handle armor clipping.. but I can't handle a gnome on a horse!! :(
---
[All hail Gone Warlocks!](https://i.imgur.com/sr90EAU.jpg)
---
That's not how the word half works. 
---
It has an actual halfway point, not an opinion on what it felt like. 
---
It's more than a bit annoying, it makes the game straight up not fun if you get into a dungeon group and the people start speaking russian while you just sit there.
---
No different than playing with chinese people. It's not fun.
---
Like you said, it's a different game than what they're used to/prefer. A lot of them might be pleasantly surprised, but for the most part Classic just doesn't have the content that most retail players primarily enjoy about modern Wow, like collecting stuff and quick solo or queueable content 
---
I used to play a ton of Path of Exile and always heard about how great D2 was, so eventually I tried it out. It was interesting enough for a few hours, but compared to what I could do with PoE, it sort of fell flat. I think that's gonna be the case for a lot of retail players. Most of them probably won't hate it, but  the slow pace and back-to-basics RPG feel isn't for everyone
---
I ran it until 28 on my mage because I liked it so much, small amount of grinding in duskwood as well but mostly just non stop deadmines, RIP Omgshoes on nazgrel the best worst mage ever
---
i wouldn't say that age has anything to do with it - i've seen really entitled and nasty adults (from college to middle aged) playing modern and straight up kids playing classic.
---
but, if their current response is anything to go by.... not... good? definitely not good. not every modern player, but there is a very vocal minority that absolutely DESPISES the idea of classic. you know, the same people that live and die by the wall of no. even recently ive seen them arguing abt how blizzard is taking resources and devs away from modern, even when they LITERALLY showed their brand new classic team at blizzcon.... some people just don't want to listen and want to blindly hate.
---
It may not be there since we are getting legions client.
---
True, blowing someone up in a second is a meme indeed.
---
Tis my first meme ever.. actually took me a while
---
A Russian that can speak (decent) English and tries to be a good guy is one of the most fun players to hang around with. They're always relaxed in their mentality and just wanna have fun.
---
So go ahead, welcome to any EU server =)
---
As an orc hunter in TBC, those were the worst days of my life. Nothing says depressing like teeny tiny Riftstalker Mantles.
---
He said epic mount, so 1000g is the full cost.
---
I would argue very much so, yes.
---
A personal example: I would gladly give away all of my future potential loot from ZG in Classic, literally every single run, as long as when (if) the Swift Zulian Tiger drops I'm guaranteed the item... mounts are easily part of my top 3 favorite things in WoW. Don't judge me. :b But yeah, in this sense it does fundamentally change the way the game works. At least for some people.
---
Another example would be if they added 10 new mounts but they cost like... 1000g each, or w/e. This would also change the game, acting as a giant gold sink.
---
The only example I can think of to make the comparison between more mount skins and more character customization options closer to 'fair' would be if the mount(s) in question were given to literally **everyone**. If this were the case, then I suppose I'd *probably* be ok with it. The reason I say 'probably' is because mounts visually take up a much larger visual space than your character's face &amp; hair features.
---
&gt;I was just watching Nixxiom on youtube "So i played the Wow: Battle for Azeroth free weekend...". He mentioned the community of the current game. The video shows him trying to interact with players and the players being extremely rude / ignoring him. 
---
To be fair, he was interrupting roleplay with OOC chatter. Most of the time, he was admittedly being followed by annoying twitch fans. I wouldn't had responded to him most likely. He would had looked like a troll to most roleplayers. That says nothing about the community, just miscommunication on server norms, which is odd since he claims to be an ex-RPer.
---
Nah it can get interesting when you factor in stuff like Nightfall and how much that increases your raid dps, one handed ret, fights that require you to play differently because you play ret, SoR proccing things twice over SoC. What I meant was there's a bunch of things that you can explore to see if things work rather than working on what people have already found to be the best method.
---
The problem is not that they are Russian. The problem is when they do not speak English or even worse when they start speaking in /1 or /2 in Russian with each other.
---
I read that as: "my old friend the great blue whale".
---
Was not quite sure what to expect, but I have to say i was a little bit disappointed to find out there was no whale patrolling the edge of the map :(
---
I'm a retail player and i'm going to be 100% in on Classic when it comes out... doesn't mean I wont pop back on to my retail character to show up to like, alt raid nights just to kick it with my guild.
---
You don't need many soul shards anymore. I don't even have a bag. Healthstones don't give enough benefit to make it worth trading, people use better or comparable consumables that share hs cooldown which don't waste raid time like healthstones do.
---
The other reason you farmed soul shards preraid is gone too. You don't go in front of instance to summon because if you die you lose your buffs. The entire raid HS's together and moves together to avoid death.
---
Mind-quickening gem
---
If I recall you use seduce to bait out the trinket at the start and use up the charge. This gives you time to cast fear and set up the play.
---
Play what race you think is cool. Don’t listen to the try hard losers that think you should do what’s optimal. If you log in and don’t feel a connection to a gnome then don’t play gnome :)
---
You talk good about nords, you get upvote
---
We are a simple people
---
Not just the DPS warriors. Every tank needs the helm as well. There's a lot of money to be made if you can get the recipe. 
---
I think once you get passed level 15-20 anyone you meet will be the people the game was made for. Me and my wife played a private server and I played up to level 20 while she stopped at 9. I was going to keep playing but figured I wanted to really grind when it officially comes out but it was clear that classic isn't for everyone and most will quit early. I don't think will see any people level 45 who come to the form to bitch about how slow and boring the game is.   Most will try it and either like it, or just move on. 
---
Ah man, yes him. Usually you don't see him and he comes charging from behind. First time he killed me I though I got ganked by a level 40+. 
---
Yea but let's just add the mounts to the vendors so I can customize my character more.
---
It's little things that you can do to make the game more challenging for you. Rule of thumb is, do what's fun, don't do what's not fun. Why wouldn't I eat my own cooked buff food? And if I'm in the mood to buyout all consumables on the AH and eat all at once, I'll do it. It's my money. If you don't get a pug invite because you're missing DM buffs, find another group or make a twink. Or do DM for fun and have the buffs next time.
---
I once left a forming group for Uldaman because they had a lvl 60. I said it would be boring. Man, that must have invoked puzzling thoughts in that group and maybe less enjoyment for their loot.
---
Do a 4man run of a 5man instance. Get a meme spec or try something with your char. Raid cities. Do all quests in your log until it's empty. Do Ragefire Chasm as Ally. Or simply do LBRS because you haven't in a while. It's a blast compared to any raid on farm status.
---
Thanks! This is super helpful. I love the way the dungeon sets look, which is probably why they are so popular. The PvP sets don’t really match them class fantasy. Is the purple PvP set better than the blue one? I can’t find out what rank I need to wear that set. 
---
Frost mage
---
Fuck you got me excited to watch a rowing championship.
---
That’s ironic because I feel that retail has robbed me of the game WoW once was and should have always been. 
---
From pre-raid to naxx? As if I'd be caught dead wearing gear with such a lack of style. 
---
As for you my brother, back to the prison you shall go, and into the robe you hate. Wear it until you love it! And die in it!

[@](https://www.reddit.com/user/duckst0rm)duckst0rm worked out last year that every normalised level is about 277 mob kills. You hit normalised level2 just before you ding level9 in game and the halfway point of 1-60 is level 44.01. This fits with Joanna's speed run so I'm convinced the halfway mark is indeed 44.

You probably need Hammer Smith to craft Sulforon Hammer. However, the hammer is BoE so you could have somebody else make it for you if you have the mats.
---
I agree they were annoying but if played right you can still beat them most times.  Mana burn did suck but with a rightly timed mana pot once you are in range you can burst down.  With blessing of freedom, cleanse and trinket cd I never had an issue with hunters.  Also the 8% on pursuit of justice sounds small, but really closes those gaps.  I can't think of any class a Paladin can just roll over but you are never gimped to point you are hard countered.
---
I think we will see people bitching in general chats, along with a lot of trolls pretending to be retail players bitching. Its possible some early dungeon runs might be ruined by players like that. I think general chats will be really annoying for a while, and then hopefully get better after a month or two
---
I have no doubt people will seen help, but I think there will be be more "memeing" than genuine requests for help. Classic wow is mostly for fans of classic wow, I'm certain there will be some new blood, but not that much.
---
Also it's just a different time on the internet these days. Like I mentioned above, old memes were Chuck Norris jokes and shit like that. These days it's mostly edgelords.
---
Honestly I stopped watching Nixxiom when he turned from machinimas to his annoying neckbeard rants.
---
How do people dislike gnomes? Literally GOAT race for every class they have. 
---
Couldn’t agree more with the last paragraph.
---
Totally agree they are the instant gratification crowd, it’s one of the things that annoys me the most about retail, but they are not millennials. Millennials are primarily the Classic crowd, where retail is gen z (I think?). 
---
You make really good points for both! I don’t think we’ll be doing hard core BGs but once and a while would be fun. You make a strong case for priests as we’ll most likely be doing PvE focused content. 
---

---
They're all so hideous. I love it!
---
I think we do and they don´t.
---
a priest that hasn't bothered getting a wand by the time they reach Cookie, wont miss the Cooking Rod that much, should they lose the roll.
---
It's not the responsibility of strangers to gear up slackers/newbies, but more power to them, if they choose to help out new blood.  
---
Wands are important for all casters, and the extra damage goes a long way when soloing, so the idea that you should be passing major upgrades because someone else is new/bad/unlucky, is not "normal".
---
How will elitists effect your play?  If you want to play casually join a casual guild.  
---
The devs have literally said it was a design decision not a hardware limitation you mental midget.
---
I think we're going to see an extreme number of Warlocks this time around, seems like everyone is leaning that direction
---
I guess you're getting downvotes from others because they can't discern sarcasm.  At least you have me! :)
---
Im sure they feel threatened, because it might affect ppl they play with. Making retail even worse what it is today.
---
damn she has a great ass
---
Looking at a Hunter with motherfucking Kingsfall hurts. That shit should be illegal
---
Yep, I'm disappointed because I was going to roll Warlock and it seems like we're going to have more locks this time around than Warriors and rogues combined.
---
Phase into raid/bg and go to shoot something - error message - no ammo zzzz lol ALWAYS check your ammo!!
---
i was talking about this with a friend - will they want to risk having to merge servers quite quickly?  it's a bad look for them
---
i suspect they might go with bigger pops and fewer servers.  think about this:  on day 1 a server might have 3k players, but by day 30 half of those might have realised they dont actually want to play vanilla (e.g. people who play retail but maybe never played it, or don't feel like doing the grind etc)  
---
if you lose pop that quick and are forced to merge after like a couple of months it doesn't look good!
---
So you mean to tell me that classic isn't about having fun in what you play but rather being bullshitting on what other play and don't take them with your group and what about the community and the(...)/s
---
Quivers increase wand speed jsuk :)
---
Yeah I was thinking of the skip runs just doing certain bosses.  It’s definitely more efficient to do that with two people and it’s more gold per hour than running the whole thing and splitting it 5 ways.  I misread his post didn’t realize he was doing full clears.

Can u pm cheeks spreadsheet?
---
While I’ve always been kinda a mental midget (gnome mage main), I can tell you that any more than 2.5K would cause issues. Even at 2.5K it wasn’t completely smooth, but you can’t know that, because you never played back then.
---
can't believe nobody has mentioned six-demon-bag that item is so god damn fun
---
Too big in my opinion 
---
I agree. Classic will do fine, we'll just have soem growing pains at the start. I'm guessing Blizzard is very sensible about Classic and the targeted audience so tehy will play dumb/deaf when the realmforums turn into qqfests.
---
Roflmoa
---
I see a lot of people who don't think it's taking resources away from BFA yet *still* are hostile towards it and acting like they're going to throw a party "when it fails." What's funny is these people don't even like BFA, so what WoW do they like? They're both far ends of the spectrum of what WoW has been. 
---
In this case though I'm also buying mats for engineering. Would it cost more to buy everything I need for engineering, or buy for herbalism and send it to an alt with alchemy?
---
&gt; a priest that hasn't bothered getting a wand by the time they reach Cookie, wont miss the Cooking Rod that much, should they lose the roll.
---
See, this is EXACTLY what I'm talking about. You know, by the time I've hit Deadmines the very first time around I had absolutely NO CLUE where to get a wand from. As the only wand available that time is through the auction house / Enchanting.
---
&gt; It's not the responsibility of strangers to gear up slackers/newbies
---
You are right, it's not. But I would still pass as a mage if a priest could use the rod. It's a freaking strong rod and they'd need it way more than I would as a mage...
---
&gt; o the idea that you should be passing major upgrades because someone else is new/bad/unlucky, is not "normal".
---
Yep, that's the mindset that has been created throughout the past 15 years. Back in Retail Vanilla people thought differently about this thing. 
---
2k pop was a design choice to create a closer knit community not a technical limit of the time. Source: Classicast with Mark Kern or maybe it was Kevin Jordan, I can't recall definitively.
---
I want vanilla not vanilla enhanced.
---
You can always sell ore to buy potions. You pick Alchemy to grind for epic recipes and use your arcanite cd for gold. 
---
this would suck but it further promotes the vanilla attitude - find people who are reliable and fun and group with them frequently
---
its kinda like the free market haha, based on trust and mutual benefit where possible
---
Depends what tier you're talking about. MC, absolutely, Naxx, not so much. Keep in mind that when you're not raiding you're going to have to be farming consumables. 
---
Hakkar would get a buff for each priest/priestess you didn't kill. AFAIK noone ever killed Hakkar with "full buffs" and most absolutly killed all 5 priests/priestesses for a smoother kill. But you still had 4 more bosses left which you really didn't need to kill except for the loot they offered. 
---
Oh my did i spent too much time chilling at the various ends of the world instead of gearing myself like a good guildie.  :(
---
Guess i was young and innocent!
---
Casual to semi-hardcore raiding will definitely require less time investment than it did back in 2005. I don't expect the average MC or BWL run to be lighting fast as on pservers, but highly doubt we'll see a return of the 4-5 hour slogs that were typical back in the day (for all of the reasons you mentioned). 
---
The reason people associate the 40's as the most painful bracket to level in is because of the initial lack of funds.
---
* At 40 many classes get iconic skills/passives from their trainer. (i.e. Warriors get plate, shaman/hunters get mail, etc)
---
* 40 is of course the original 60% mount which costs a bundle.
---
* In addition most people can't afford all their skills to begin with, so many people don't have all their tools/skill ranks available to them.
---
All in all, the reason 40's are painful is the "Gold Crunch".  If you have a mount, the 40's become easier, but many people didn't get their regular mounts until closer to 50 when they could finally afford it.
---

---
Still a benefit to not worry about any of that. Warlock call and skeles can cause some chaos forcing people closer to get away from infernals, and you assign a mage as backup for druid calls. I'm not really theory crafting I'm just sharing my experience from BWL. 
---
Should I go mining or herb though? Would I make more money buying everything for engineering, but selling herbs? Or using mining to support engineering and buying herbs for my alchemy alt?
---
Except that isn't how this works. Putting in servers that are broken from minute one on purpose means they would have to have all sorts of changes. Why would they want to leave new players with the trap of picking the wrong servers and not getting a vanilla experience? They don't want to run 2 MMO's and they would have to redesign the world to deal with the problems caused by overpopulation
---
I'm sorry that some tiny number of people don't actually want classic wow but instead they want an officially hosted nost. I would rather play vanilla like we have been fighting for since 2007 or so, not broken nonsense with hacky changes to try and make it playable.
---
The irony of someone who watches Staysafe calling another person dumb.  
---
OMEGALUL
---
Oh, they changed it again then. Because I saw it few expansions ago, not like in vanilla (obviously, predownload wasn't available back then).
---
Most guilds will crush MC, maybe BWL. AQ40 will ruin all except hardcore guilds until naxx comes out. Many guilds will get some naxx bosses down, but they'll need to bring their a-game to get up to 4hm. After that, it comes down to how overgeared or dedicated they are.
---
I leveled BS from vanilla, and have had a fair amount of success making other professions profitable enough to get an epic mount before TBC, and also epic flying (in TBC) probably before 90% of my server got it (that cost 5000g).  I can tell you that BS is (mostly) worthless for making money (compared to other professions like alchemy) until late game IF you've been lucky with recipe drops.  
---
Lionheart helm recipe is a extremely rare world drop which means you'll need to have a fortune on hand to buy the recipe - when it is finally for sale.  Nightfall and Sulfuron hammer require exalted thorium brotherhood which is a hell of a grind.  Also, the materials for nightfall and sulfuron hammer are extremely costly and difficult to obtain.  
---
The problem with these big ticket items is that even though they warrant a hefty price tag, you should be able to make more money with more common sales like potions, flasks, and gathering items.  I can't tell you how many times I've scraped together all the arcanite bars and enchanted leathers to make an expensive piece to sell on the AH, only to wait for days and days for it to sell, marking it down after being undercut.  The guys who end up needing sulfuron hammer will be only a few, and they'll likely have it made by someone in their guild after accumulating the materials themselves.  
---
If you're bent on BS, don't do it for the money.  If you're the guy in your guild who the plans of choice will be siphoned to (from raids), that's a good spot to be in as your guildies will depend on you.  You'll end up getting the really nice plans from raids and be able to sell some items and combines on the side for decent coin.  However, if you're not going to be in this position I would seriously reconsider your profession choice.  
---
Wow forums (and reddit) can be a brutal place to post opinions like this, but I don't think I'm sticking my neck out too far by saying that BS is BS.  If you think you're going to save money by outfitting yourself with gear while you're leveling, the gear you produce will be inferior to the gear you have access to through dungeons and leveling.  The level requirement to learn plans is higher than the level requirement to wear the gear, meaning you're making gear that lags behind your level.  
---
TLDR: It will be hard to make money with blacksmithing.  If you're going to be the guy getting all the plans from your raid guild, that helps.  But if you're not that guy, BS is very hard to make money with.
---
P.S. 2 things in BS that do sell well are shield spikes and weapon chains.  Not as well as flasks, potions, arcanite bars, and gathering materials....but still they sell decently.  
---
&gt;Oh my god the moment i mount that magnificent monster is amazing every time
---
That's what she said.
---
I thought health stones didn't share a cd with potion until legion?
---
wow, 1 raid a week to clear both MC and BWL...? Missed this thread somehow. Guess I'll swim in free time then. If this is real...
---
which video?
---
As a Rogue I had a quiver until level 50 because I thought I needed it to be able to shoot arrows. 
---
dont overlook the spellstone.  it gives a magic shield and removes all magical debuffs which is really nice.  mostly in pvp but prob has some pve benefits too.  since its a weapon slot it should be able to be changed in combat.  usually a slight cooldown before it can be used after you equip it
---
&gt; Modern wow is a hack and slash grinder 
---
Be honest
---
so is vanilla when u have to farm to prepare and that can take as long as raiding itself
---
and even the raids most of them are pretty simple compared to mythic
---
They don't use potion cooldown. They share cd with demonic rune and whipper root tuber.
---
I would pick Rouge or hunter. Both are perfect für beginners
---
Yup, it won't take long for people to figure out where they are but they aren't likely to let it out beforehand to avoid people taking their names and packing the starter zones before they can even get moving.
---
&gt;Most times the actual potion sells for LESS than the herbs you make them from.
---
I’m not sure if you’re trying to keep trade secrets hidden, but of course “most times” the actual potion will sell less than the herbs.
---
The key is that both those prices are constantly fluctuating. There will be times (especially early in the day) when supply is high and everyone is posting their herbs. Buy those low, then craft the potion and wait until demand is high: raid reset day. Then you sell and are making a profit.
---
I was there! Swc horde: Shimazu. &lt;Martyr’s Blood&gt;
---
\*Sigh\*... I had hope for you, but it turns out you're just another #NoChange-Sheeple.
---
You just had to imply that both of the situations we've talked about are somehow mutually inclusive. Which is absolutely absurd and leads me to believe that you're either not serious or just hell bent on doing your best to view things as UN-objectively as possible. SaddestOfAllTheBois.
---
The irony of someone who watches Asmongold calling irony on someone who has watched (a single) StaySafe stream.
---
Quite a pot calling the kettle black situation we've got going here, isn't it?
---
This also works in reverse too. If someone is a ninja or troll, they will have a bad name in the community. Actions actually have repercussions.
---
Having played in anywhere from 100 pop to 10k pop, I think anywhere from 2k to 5k is about right. A steady 2k would be ideal but people come and go. Below about 2k, AV stops being a thing so much which sucks, though raiding doesn't get hampered too badly until about 1k, at which point each faction only has one raiding guild at best.
---
That's kind of a relief, I can cross off root tubers from farm list!
---
Dunno mate. I can't really relate to that. Usually when you are nice and not *annoying* people they are nice too. Sure some will ignore you because of whatever dumb reasons but it happend in classic too.
---
In my guild we are having a cool time everything is chill and stuff. Also in communities; someone wants to do something and you usually get a group for that.
---
Most of us have probably leveled several times on pservers and are better at saving money at this point, I doubt it's going to be as much of an issue as it was back in the day. Although I am looking forward to new players figuring it out.
---
the big thing is blizz needs to be fast on the merges. They don't ever seem to move quickly to fix pop issues but that will kill classic servers. After the tourists leave and things stabilize a month or so in they need to merge low pop servers together to make reasonable pop ones. If you do it early enough the server community and economy won't have really formed yet and it won't be a big deal, if they wait too long it will be more of an issue.
---
Hope so! 3 hours is just so much more managable compared to 4-5. I rememeber feeling all "locked down" by raiding back in Vanilla, I loved it but it really crushed two full evenings a week plus time to prepare/grind
---
Crushridge perhaps? Very heavy greek userbase.
---
MC and BWL are going to be fairly easy. Most work there lies on the tanks to get the proper gear. In general Tanks are the ones who have to spend a mayor part of their time prepping for raids.
---
AQ and Naxx are a bit different then as the ramp up in difficulty and gear requirements is fairly high.
---
that was dope
---
Because people are quite like sheep. A majority of players say Druids CAN'T tank in vanilla, at fucking all. While they're actually (just like Paladins) great at tanking the 5man content, a druid could also without issues main tank MC and ZG.
---
That's because the elitist idiots think that the only way stuff works, is if you optimize it 10 times over and throw the rest in the trash.
---
We did MC, ZG, BWL, AQ20 and 40 + some of naxx with a Druid and Warrior swapping the role as main tank. Paladin off tank, Druid and Priest caster DPS  etc etc.
---
And I can promise your our players had a lot more fun than some feeling stuck with a spec they hate in another guild.
---
THat's the problem and effect of Elitists. They create a norm in the community that "MAN YOU SUCK CUZ YOU PLAY FOR FUN".  Seriously, a lot of them have said they won't even invite rogues into their guilds if they're not human for the sword spec racial.
---
I'm not educated enough on the subject to be able to tell you for sure, but I believe they will be using the newer engine/system and then attempt to alter the graphics in some way particular way to a certain degree (which I'm unfamiliar with) as to look and feel like Vanilla.
---
... I might be wrong though. :b
---
This. Or just quest and learn the lore by yourself and group with people you find around or friends you've quested with together in the past. Vanilla isn't all about dungeons and raids.
---
I know right. Whats the problem people have with those who wanna min/max the hell out of the game. Those who isnt aint gonna play together with those who are. Its just as elitist to demand people play like you dictate even if its casual. I bet this is just due to envy. 
---
Druid can tank in raids without issues. Both offtank and maintank.
---
I wouldn´t call it better education but more like a culture that promotes th classic western style living. Russians are more Asian centered and Italy, Spain and France share their own subculture. 
---
On private servers guilds are clearing MC + BWL in under an hour, while they may be undertuned or overtuned on these servers that gives you a good idea of some of the speeds guilds are capable of doing. Raiding is going to be A LOT easier now than what it was back in Vanilla, Even naxx.
---
Compared to what people we're like skill wise we have come a long way, you have to remember WoW was realistically the first MMO as games like Everquest we're too full on for the novice/new gamer and gaming back then had a negative stigma towards it compared to how widely accepted it is today.
---
what will immerse him into the game is what he likes. 
---
thing is ppl got different personalities and what for one person is amazing and everything they dreamed off, for other is really something they cant see themeself doing or being. 
---
as we don't know your friend personality, its impossible to say what would immerse him the best.
---
there are easier and harder classes. mage is easy for a starter.
---
Everyone needs it...
---
fury warrior 
---
try something new always people wont hate you
---
I think you are worried about a boogie man that doesnt exist.  Everyday there are posts on this forum about people looking to play ret pally and worried they wont be able to and they are told they will not be able to play in a hardcore guild but should have no problem finding a raid spot in a casual guild. 
---
The vast majority are not concerned with min maxing.  
---
As far as you had more fun.  Thats probably not true because you and I may have different definitions of fun.  You seem like the kind of guy that demands to be in that hardcore guild with your meme spec and get butthurt when they tell you no.  
---
As one of the younger generations players, I fear many players of my age would write it off because of what was said in the post.  
---
But for me, I've been playing WoW since I was 6 years old, back in late TBC. But I personally dislike the game in its current state. Every time I log on and do my world quests, I feel like there is nothing left to do after I turned that quest in. So I'm really excited to see what the WoW of the past has to offer!  
---
Having to communicate more with people you barely or don't even know, seems like a great thing to me (which might seem like the exact opposite to others).  
---
Over all, I'm really excited to get to experience what so many people anticipated to play. 
---
It's not about culture, it's about learning the language used for international communication, which is a basic skill. Or just learning languages in general.
---
With pre-bis swords vs pre-bis daggers? Swords pull ahead any time you have 'equal' choices between then (or basically all the time on Horde).
---
Dagger rogues are fine whenever and rogues have enough damage in their kit to do whatever they want really, but swords will be better in pre-bis as everything is 'equal'. 
---
engineering and buy potions 
---
from guild mates if you can for a bit of a bro discount
---
Making an awful lot of assumptions mixed in with some negative opinions there.
---
1) Assuming everyone on r/classicwow has played on private servers. (They haven't)
---
2) Assuming everyone on r/classicwow knows the "best" (quotes for sarcastic emphasis) ways to earn gold. (They won't)
---
3) Experiencing *Schadenfreude* because "new players" won't know what to do.  Seriously?  You'd enjoy watching genuinely new classic players struggle in the 40's, give up, and possibly quit?  Considering 99% of the people you'll be observing level and have economic struggles will be part of your faction that makes it even more disturbing.
---
Isn't that a 30 second cooldown? If so I think you do need to have it equipped or at least all dots are already gone when it's finally ready.
---
The problem with it for PVE is that you mostly get good 2H weapons while levelling, and at 60 1%  spellcrit is just not good enough for an off-hand. And encounters were decursing is necessary, one additional demagic per 3 minutes won't make or break an encounter.
---
Yeaaah. It's not like the hype of WoW vanilla comes from 25-40year old people who played vanilla back then and made Blizzard see reason with Viper and Daemon's pserver. 
---
The pserver vanilla WoW demographic is not the one consuming Fortnite.
---
With good gear yes. We did it back then. One evening for MC and BWL to gear the new members. Another day for Ony/AQ and another day for Nax. AQ20 and ZG were optional. That said, it will take some time till you get the gear to do it and in my eyes pservers aren't giving valid data. There will be a lot of guys who will tell you that the developers of the pservers have calculate the right data (dps, armor of bosses etc.) but nobody can tell for sure if they are right. So we will have to wait. My guess is it wil be faster then during vanilla but still slower then on pservers.
---
&gt;Still a benefit to not worry about any of that.
---
I can only agree with that, and I appreciate sharing your experience from BWL. However, I still think this fight is easily manageable and I'd rather people respect and learn mechanics (not that there are that many) than dwarfs making it easy-mode. 
---
Even better get its name changed to Cast  and just need to say the spell name to cast.
---
so cool to hear that voice after all these years lol.  liking the professionally made podcast!
---
You cannot stack procs with sit macro so good luck "blowing someone up".

😂😂😂
---
I leveled 1 of everything always jumping back and forth for that sweet sweet rested xp.  All horde actually now that i think of it and waited for BC to level a Paladin.  I don't think i actually know anything about the alliance quest areas actually...that gives me an idea.  
---
I feel a relapse coming on.
---
Use punctuation, it's unreadable
---
ive been a ret all my glorious vanilla life-long. ret is amazing fun if youre prepared to be the (probably)non-raiding unicorn. ive ranked to pvprank 10 and used unstoppable force for the longest time. youll get your gear together.
---
ret is (was back then, player skill/mentality has changed) a beast in duels and you have an awesome niche-use for AB premades, nothing better than a ret-pally defending mines.
---
if you want to roll ret do it, you have lots of variety in your skilltree, you can go 21 holy/ret, reckoning spec or pure retribution. all is fun and viable in the niches i mentioned.
---
plus the feeling of a try-hard ninjacapping rogue getting oneshot from your reckoning stats is just heaven.
---
if youre still intrested in being the most holy knight then feel free to msg me, we can chitchat about my PoV of a ret in vanilla or if you have any questions. :)
---
Shaman ele/resto is a popular one
---
I think he's level 35 and the mobs around the area in the beginning to mid 20s. So more like 10-12 levels. I remember the first time I met him, he was marked with a Skull.
---
Those sweet sweet talent trees are what kept me changing characters.  If i just got to 40 id get Moonkin form! What 40 gets me Shadow Form?  I get to wear plate at 40?  OMG free mount?  What level can i do that AOE ICE Mage thing ... Paladin has AOE omg how.  Druid gets what now..,you mean i can be a bear and a cat, what level...
---
I just couldn't help myself i found so many interesting things that i constantly needed to change.

Will be interesting how he will do. Just watch Shroud getting tired of having 50+ people drop with him in PUBG. The same will happen for the streamers on PvP servers. Constant relentless wPvP with your cloud of character against the streamsnipers.

Can't imagine this being very fun if you cant see your character for the better part of your playtime.

So triggered watching the raid frames order...

Hey guys. I am planning to have mining/engi at 60. I know that it is not the best idea to lvl engi from the beggining - i will stick to mining/enchanting (disench all items during leveling). Do u think it is possible to afford for example mount on 40 with these proffs - selling all enchanting dusts and maybe some ores/bars? 
---
You guys are both dorks
---
now youve put feral druid into my consideration too, damn you! i wanted to make my decision easier not harder :D
---
No you didn't read too much into it, you nailed it. He's one of those that can't about behind wrong and simply turns every failed argument into "that's just how I feel" as a way to dismiss any counter discussion, followed by some hand waving and some non responses.
---
You're not wrong.
---
Exactly. No dynamic respawn, no nothing. Just pure aids!
---
The flute you get in Ironforge train station that you use on the rats.  Then I am going to spam using it while waiting for dungeons and on boat rides
---
In high school, I was all too happy to trudge through wipes until 1-2 AM in MC. Approaching 30 with an office job... yeah not quite so much. 
---
So you’re implying that herb/alch is the best money in the game then? Because if it’s not the best money per hour then you are actually losing money because you could have sold the pots yourself. 
---
Maybe, I never did any of the DM Farms so I can't really say.  But I prefer the option to solo things anyway.  There's something super relaxing to me about just drinking a few beers and farming herbs/mining for a few hours.
---
I think it's a good thing if people that are looking for some fastfood content stay on retail and people who wish to invest more into classic.
---
To be fair, POE is what D3 should have been.  It is an upgraded experience to what D2 was.  D2 was amazing for its time, and only nostalgia allows me to play it at all compared to POE.  So POE is the same game style just updated.  Retail is a completely different game experience than vanilla.  But with that being said, I would love to have the same WoW vanilla game experience updated the same way POE is compared to D3.  New world, updated graphics, new content, but the same core gameplay.
---
enhancement shaman dps would be of no concern to me. my enh-sham playstyle wouldnt include raiding. 
---
rank10 gear combined with unstoppable force and AB exalted mixnmatch would be enough to have fun and grind gold decently i guess.
---
I did this too with my Tauren Warrior. 
---
Not one to defend the wow community in any shape or form, classic or retail, but this is just an utterly bad faith take on what happened. 
---
You are trying to make a case for something by presenting an asshole who interrupted players as just someone who casually wanted to chat. He was interrupting RPers and had a small following of trolls behind him, anyone and everyone was right to tell him to fuck off. 
---
This is the wow version of BEN SHAPIRO TOTALLY OWNS THIS LIBERAL SJW WITH REASON AND FACTS, aka an asshole who has a point to prove and provokes the response he wants so he can support his view. 
---
The idea that people who play WoW today (probably most 15 year olds) are so vastly different from what the vanilla players were in 2005/2006 is silly. 
---
Yes it’s a different game, people like different things, some will like both. It’s all gonna be okay. 
---
Stop trying to create drama or divide people, just get exited that a game you want to play is getting released, and be happy that many people who never got a chance to try it out, now will.
---
Negative opinions? Sorry, but you're the one jumping to conclusions here and making sweeping generalizations, which is what I thought was off with your first comment. I never said "everyone" but this is a very pserver player-heavy reddit.
---
I just enjoy begin around people experiencing the game of the first time, or re-experiencing all the things they've forgotten. If you're reading anything sinister into that it's all you.
---
Secondly, the gold for the 40 mount really isn't that difficult when you're not making mistakes like pissing away gold on white equipment or gear on the AH. You don't need to know the best ways to make gold. This is stuff people have learned from the current game and most other games for that matter. Players won't be inexperienced in the same way they were in 2004.
---
Rage quit when my wufe, a hunter, got a pet at level 10, and i, a priest, "glitched" and couldnt get a pet.
---
I thought everyone did and my game was bugged
---
And then you realize you the strength you wield when you do hit 60 in PVP.  You know the inner workings of every class.  Their strengths and their weaknesses.  You start your pvp career with big dreams, you are on your way to amassing great titles of legends aaaaaaand expansion hits.  
---
The MOMENT Blizzard touches class rebelance, you can bet that there's going to be hundreds of requests coming it, be it for Paladins, Warlocks, Rogues and so on. They know that it's a very sensitive subject so I'm 100% certain they're not going to do something like this. Best case scenario is that they notice that a particular item or spell isn't its correct value as we see on fan-servers and they will fix it.
---
i share you point of view about interest and enjoyment, the issue is that too much classes are hooking me :D
---
&gt;  Swords pull ahead any time you have 'equal' choices between then (or basically all the time on Horde).
---
but by how much?
---
Elemental sharpening stone, Shield spike, weapon chain and mithril spurs are your bread an butter and none of them have a spec. 
---
What's stopping other classes from asking for the same treatment?  
---
When do we stop tweaking items?
---
Like, boring raid boss rotation but everything elsse is basically spot on. Great control, high skill ceilling, great damage, great burst, free food, fast travel around the map I mean, we really do get it all in classic.
---
Curiosity, most likely. With the lack of meaningful things to do there will surely be a good chunk of people using their ongoing sub to check classic out. If it turns out not to be their kind of thing I expect the vast majority to not think about it too much and just drop it silently. There will, of course, likely be a few that will be like "why did people ever like this sort of thing?" in a mocking way, but I expect those to be vastly outnumbered by the already existing toxic anti-retail community (read: this very sub, as seen in the comments in this very thread) that will be flocking to classic.
---
This. That warstomp&gt;iron grenade&gt;fd&gt;trap straight up counters frost reflector so hard, its beautiful. And you get to save your scatter shot cooldown. Orcs are good too but its very rng based, alot of fights youll get zero resist and that sucks
---
No no no, Jagex announced mobile *while also* announcing some pretty badass updates for their games.
---
Blizzard announcing a mobile only game to a primarily PC audience is no one's fault but their own. 
---
In regards to only getting the pet quest in your racial start zones: is this the same case for warlocks?
---
In TBC it was a one-hand, therefore our warrior tank had 2 of them in pack to go for it if I was tanking.
---
Appearently in classic it was a mainhand weapon and could only be used once ...
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=12798
---
For sure man, guild nights are a laugh and a lot of mine won't dig classic :) 
---
I think there will be quite a lot of players who will play Classic despite not liking it. The reason is herd mentality. When a third of your raid rather play classic than retail, that will have a significant impact on the rest of the raid/guild.
---
Some guilds will be unaffected by this, but I suspect that large amounts of guilds will be a barren wasteland at least during the initial phase of classic. Guilds will dispand and new ones will be formed by players who want to commit to retail. 
---
So I assume a huge impact on retail at least during the first couple of weeks. Things will balance up after a while. But I fully expect classic to have more players than retail. Tastes aside, it's just overall the better game.

I felt so bad for all of the orc mains in my guild at the time.  You could hear the salt and depression over vent.

---
So what kind of time investment do you think it would take to be "on par" with content? I'm not hoping to go for serverfirsts, I just want to do content while it's relevant and back in Vanilla I remember it like only the really dedicated guilds got into AQ and they put in serious time to progress
---
I never said Herbalism with Alchemy was the best money maker in the game, I simply said that buying pots and such whilst leveling engineering costs a lot of gold... which it does
---
I somehow made it to 59 on a druid editor
---
Without realizing I was gonna be shoehorned into healing (back when innervate was a talent) once I found out I rerolled a warlock and didn't touch my druid again till tbc
---
yeh its def something you would wear when you anticipate or know you will need it.  30s sounds about right for the on equip cooldown.  its niche but at least it has some value, unlike the firestone which is garbage 99% of the time
---
Meh, there's a difference between the two grinds. The Classic grind is "I've got to get these consumables so we can tackle big bad guys so I'm -carefully- farming satyrs in Winterspring today." and the modern grind is "I'm pulling 8 mobs right now and AOEing them down (and not taking any damage) with sparkles and flashy UI graphics for this 2 minute world quest because it fills a checkbox on my map."
---
Modern WoW is bright, thick particle effects to distract you from the fact that you're not really doing anything meaningful. There's no raid prep, no real Mythic+ prep, you just go in and do because it's all just going through the motions. You get a dozen Epic items a day during your "grind" and smash them in a big machine to get a bunch of crafting materials you didn't even have to work(farm) for.
---
As for Mythic being "more complex" than Classic raids, Modern WoW is: "Okay quick, right now we need 3 people standing here stepping on this part, 1 person here to interrupt this thing, 2 people here hitting these orbs, 2 tanks here with an offtank on this guy, 4 people to carry this object here but ONLY during this 10 second window, and then everybody rotate to the job of the person next to you, etc. etc." 
---
Sure, that's complex, but that doesn't make it better. It's go go go, fast fast fast, hurry hurry hurry. Hectic, that's all it is. And Mythic+ dungeons are the worst. It boils down these locations that are supposed to be epic places with these influential bosses and turns them into pinatas to be smashed as quickly as possible. I don't find that fulfilling, fun, or anything in between.
---
Classic still has complexity in the raids, they're just more straightforward: getting 40 people together, making sure everyone has all the consumables, everyone is geared enough, managing of your consumables during the fight, managing of your mana, some light positioning depending on the bosses, etc. It's a slow burn, a slow buildup. It's lovely, and far more deep than modern WoW for me.
---
I think you’re right 
---
I want to say play what you want but ya... tanking is the one role where you basically have to be at every raid or you are really hurting your guild. 
---
Damn calm down 😂
---
I don't mind anyone trying to speak English even if it is really hard to understand. I'd even help them learn the language if I have the chance to.
---
Howeeeeveer, I would pay extra (a lot extra) if in return the French would have to play in their own server instead of the regular ones. I have been playing games hardcore for close to 15 years now and there is no community more toxic and game ruining then the French.
---
But culture can influence your understanding of what is international. The Chinese see themselves at the center of the world. Look at a Chinese world map, it looks nothing like the ones you know. So for them others should learn Mandarin. And Russia leans more towards them so they think less about that western agreed language that is english. 
---
ive played rbg´s in retail in legion with russians alot, the only negative thing that comes to mind is the communication issue because most of you lads couldnt speak english well.
---
other than that i always observed that russians always were well geared and skilled players. it seemed that they hardcored and tryharded wow way beyond the stupid weekly limits retail has today, most of my german fellas didnt do so.
---
I played human warlock with tailoring, first aid.
---
So this time I will play human priest with alchemy, cooking and fishing.
---
I want vanilla but not as a warlock again.

Say you have 500 gold. You could put it on character A, transfer over. Then you put the 500 gold on character B, transfer over. Rinse repeat however many times, bonus points if you have trustable friends.         
---
Now instead of only having 500 gold on the BC server, you have 500 * X amount of gold
---
Where are you even reading those comments? Because there are no resources to be taking away right now given how empty BFA has proven to be.
---
There are people on retail literally praying every day Classic will fail. I'm still subbed to BfA and whenever we start talking about Classic in Global chat, there's always that moron telling is how Classic will suck and how we will come back to BfA. Like really, do retail players think people will come back to BfA? Personally I won't touch retail until the next expansion after Classic is out.
---
Warriors are flexible, you can tank and dps with the same spec. You won't be MT of your guild but you can still tank 5 mans and get a raid spot as dps/off tank warrior.
---
Most will quit when they have to do Hogger. You can't do it alone and there is no LFG tool? Ok nevermind then.

Bloodlord Mandokir, Jin'do the Hexxer, Gahz'ranka and Edge of Madness are skippable boss encounters in ZG. Only the aspects give Hakkar buffs while alive.
---
By *pretty linear* what you meant to say is non-linear. It either is or isn't. A raid where you *can* skip bosses = non-linear boss progression.
---
I have been thinking about that as well so I will share my two cents.
---
Map out a leveling route, depending on your starting zone. Try to reduce walking long distance to absolute bare minimums if and when possible. Look at level maps that show the level for each zone. What I do as well is go and check the quests for that zone and see what gear I can get. Ideally you would like to get the maximum out the zome both in terms of xp and gear progression.
---
Create a backup plan if you are ganked or there is too much competition, this will reduce your time by a great deal.
---
First thing you should do when you enter a new zone is to discover the flight path, look at maps and be praperd.
---
When you are on the way to do quest, kill everything in your path ( if that is possible ). You will get more XP, loot and your quest will be completed.
---
Also what I find to help alot is plan your training. Depending on your class and spec, you dont have to go every two levels to your trainer to train. Look at the spells and plan when and what you will get. It will save you money and time.
---
Hope that helps!

Mobile WoW would be a very strange beast. There's MMOs/games out there that work by having very few (2-4) abilities/keybinds near the thumb. 
---
I'm not saying it's impossible, but trying to fit a class with 30-50 keybinds onto a few buttons is going to make the game feel very... incomplete. You could probably farm gold on easier mobs or gather find though.
---
Nope, Ravencrest.
---
I don't think greek servers existed back then. They just fell under EU. (could be wrong)
---
It's all just The Barrens. 
---
People not being as anonymous on a classic server will also help your concerns. People who are dicks will be known and purposefully not grouped with etc. 
---
Tell me about it. I got out the shower this morning and thought, I'd really like to play classic today.
---
You deal with cyber but you're not an admin..... Interesting. 🤪. Probably some low level analyst. 
---
Forest’s Embrace, level 50ish class quest in UGC.
---
Only available in the prenaxx patch though.
---
The first rogue quest on alliance side. You get it at level 10 i think? And you are supposed to pickpocket a goblin down by the docks. If he sees you he will spawn 3x level 12 guards and they will proceed to beat you into a bloody pulp, so you have to stealth and pickpocked him, sapping him does not work either as that will also spawn the guards and you instantly die.
---
The only thing is... pickpocket can be resisted. And for whatever reason he resists pickpocket WAY more than normal mobs. I think it took me five times dying because he resisted pickpocket before i could steal whatever papers i was supposed to steal from him.
---
Hopefully positive 
---
Other than that I don’t care 
---
Very helpful advice.  Thank you.  I agree that "low gear dependence" is key due to my lack of time.  To that end, Hunter would be the best choice, right?  I've been leaning Shaman because, since my time is so limited, I like the idea of having a character that can be a caster, melee, or healer all in one with a simple spec change.  I find healing in BGs very fulfilling.
---
Guilds usually pile all the best tanking gear on one main tank. If you get all that gear dumped on you and then don't show up.. then all that grinding and progress is gone from the raid on those nights. Most guild leaders won't accept that.
---
What is that orange axe on the warrior prot image 3rd down?
---
Keybindings...
---
You linked to the belt 2 times.
---
The following is all speculation, I have no experience myself.
---
MC you'll be able to waltz through, BWL is super short. AQ40 you'll be able to get down with a guild that does 2x 3hr nights. Naxx might be tough especially with the amount of consumable farming. 
---
ill be chosing a pvp server which name i like most. starting on a lowpop server isnt that bad - it can even bring opportunity if handled smart. you can always server-transfer to a bigger realm later.
---
hint: imagine buying 1500 icecaps for 50s/p on a lowpop server and selling those for 1g on a highpop server. dont pinpoint on the item i mentioned, but there will be some pricing differences that you can use to your advantage. also pvpranks will be easier to achieve.
---
Well, you dont need alchemy for that. Just buy herbs cheap and sell for more. Its playing the AH in general. Just saying, to make gold from alchemy, you need herbalism and black lotuses. The actual constant gold you make comes from transmutes. And thats about 5-10g / 48h.
---
Have you played wow in the last 10 years man? 
---
People try to min max +8 mythics, not because it’s needed in the slightest but because it makes it easier for them. If you think that’s not going to be the same in classic I have bad news.
---
Will there be casual guilds who don’t care what apex you play? Sure. But there will he just as many if not more people wanting you to be a prot warrior or dwarf priest.
---
Something to consider as well is that you can buy everything alchemy has to offer and you dont really gain anything by having the profession when you can just get the stuff crafted. I think alchemy is excellent for casual players that will end up leveling for a long time, because the potions can come in handy. But if you are an experienced player that doesnt take too long before 60, engineering is the way to go as its usefullness vastly overcomes alchemy at the max level. You could potentially run alchemy while leveling, then drop either herb or alch at 60 and train Engineering from AH (its cheap, costs around 100-200g max for close to full skill). But you will never regret having engi at the max level.
---
Essentially a "weed out" class for competitive majors
---
Appart for a few items.
---
queuing as healer? what is this queue you speak of
---
Honestly, one of the things I've been excited about going from Private Servers to Classic is for Russians to get their own servers, so we won't have to play with them anymore. It's not that I want to sound xenophobic or anything, but Russian players can often make such a mess of groups, whether it's a lack of communication, ninja looting, ninja pulling, unwillingness to cooperate, or just simply performing poorly, I've experienced all of those things while doing dungeons with them on private servers.
---
I think both Russians and Europeans will benefit from being separated, mixing them makes so many problems for both parts.
---
Thanks!  This is my dilemma.  They're all solid choices.  I need a class where I can play casually but be effective in 5 mans and BGs.  I'm leaning Shaman because I like the idea of having 3 separate archetypes (caster, melee, healer) at my disposal that will keep my char feeling fresh for years.  Obviously the gear dependence will suck and respeccing costs will also suck but paying 50G to get a whole new character isn't that much when you think about it?
---
The wait made me get so fucking bored that I researched multi boxing and now plan to run 5 frost mages, see what you made me do Blizzard?
---
The mounts are available to buy even without riding skill. 
---
Question is: if they implement old epic mounts and you buy one but don't use it, will it keep the old model when you do? (since the mount is way cheaper than the skill).
---
Nah, they're just quicker to level up. Doesn't mean the players will be inherently bad; there's good and bad players in every class. I'd wager you're going to see more bad warriors simply because it's such an overpopulated class, regardless of the time it takes to get them to 60.
---
Uh huh...you said it yourself, there will be casual guilds.  If thats what is fun for you play that way.  Dont make 39 other people that want to min max carry your ret pally .
---
Even the noobs on retail know to consult online for spec/rotations. They just aren't generally that good or don't have time to grind gear. There's plenty of material to find on each and every class leveling technique. This isn't 2004 anymore sorry :(
---
They get healers later, but a gnome hit squad has no healers, only death dealers , rogue warrior mage combo is unbeatable 
---
I was too young to raid as a kid. Always thought benediction was badass. I also thought nemesis skullcap on undead was the coolest looking shit ever. Still deciding which childhood fantasy to pursue 
---
Alchemy can be profitable, especially if you get your hands on some rare stuff like flask recipees. However, those are very very hard to get and without them, alchemy offers just a mediocre way to make gold. Any efficient grinding and using some farming method will be better. While engineering makes close to no gold (there are still ways, you could make sappers for decent profit if you chose goblin), its more of a performance profession, enhancing your capabilities rather than make gold for you.
---
Dont get me wrong, alchemy is still a great profession in comparison to like a blacksmithing both performance wise and gold wise, but there will always be the argument that you can buy anything alchemy has to offer.
---
My brother and I were talking about this last night. Rogue doesn't necessarily HARD counter warrior, for min max purposes, for that class you wouldnt feel the need to go orc. But for warlock, rogue, shaman it would be recommended. Hunter would definitely be nice because of what you stated above. Thoughts?
---
If you're not taking the first VG trip to stonetalon, how are you getting to Desolace when you need to go there?
---
Talk about a lot of unnecessary running.
---
The first time you're sent to Stonetalon is basically to get the flight point and knock out a few quests out of sheer convenience since you're already near the pathway in ashenvale.
---
You should be higher level than the horde in Windshear Crag.
---
Do the kill quest there, get the blueprints.
---
I died once from ganks at the goblin hut turning in quests since 5 horde were there at the time.  The GY is right next to it though so it cost me a whole 10 seconds.
---
Run by and kill the Wyverns on your way to Stonetalon Peak flight point.
---
The next time you come there (on your way to desolace) you should ignore the quests in Charred Vale and just run through, again you should be higher than the horde in that area.
---
will you be a full prot-tank or are you going to be a fury-warrior who tanks if needed?
---
with a healer friend, youll be able to do dm/east runs which are very profitable. youll get tons of herbs, felcloth and thorium/arcane crystals there if done right.
---
other than that i farmed the furbolgs in vanilla for gold alot. the winterfell firewater and other drops nettet me a decent amount of money. i also spend alot of time in northwest silithus, grinding the wind elementals for essences of air, i think they were worth 5-6g at the time and i always stayed there until i had about 30 of those.
---
Why do people keep saying hunters fall off dps so hard? I see them doing like 750-800 in nax parses other classes are doing like 900-1000 that's not a huge gap
---
Actually an engineer. Just have separation of duties and approved software installs that you're not allowed to dictate from due to security risks :). 
---
BRE on a Ret.... what a waste
---
&gt; Both versions of Warcraft can cater to different audiences.
---
Quintessentially this - which is the entire reason why so many did not shut up about wanting Classic servers in the first place: Vanilla and BC (and in some parts, WotlK) are an entirely different game when compared to current retail.
---
It's not that Retail is necessarily bad - it's that it just doesn't appeal to a part of the audience that originally were drawn in by WoW.
---
Not too concerned, as I think the gameplay itself will keep the people away that would have a negative impact.   
---
What I am excited about is to have some new (young) gamers trying out this kind of game, and loving it - and seeing how that impacts the rest of the gaming world.   
---
My biggest hope is that those of us that have a lot of Vanilla experience from back then or private servers, let newcomers enjoy the game - and the magic of exploring the world and getting to know your class, etc. 
---
&gt; spam one or two abilities 
---
To be fair, most of what a Warlock will be doing in dungeons &amp; raids is spamming Shadowbolt with the occasional curse.   
---
But really, the easiest way to tell good warlocks from the bad ones is soul shard &amp; pet management. When you jump down into Rend's arena and notice the Imp running around the long way, you'll know you got a Fun™ one.
---
How many raptors do I have to kill for the silver drop?
---
I played on the server Greekjuros (Genjuros). So many Greeks haha. Friendly people as far as I remember, but hard to communicate in a lot of situations. 
---
Hell yeah man. Looking forward to filling my friend list up
---
Thats a much harder question to answer (depends on how much of gathering you actually do and whats the competition is like, can you do much of this in instances without competition).
---
While you NEED engineering to get much of the great pvp/pve perks, after the initial cost of making trinkets etc the material usage slows down a lot, you make your dynamites/sappers. With that logic it might be better to take herbalism, because you keep on using herbs the same way, all the time. But thenagain mining would give you arcane crystals to do transmutes (and without mining you would buy these).
---
Obvious answer would be... level the alt to 60 and have mining, herbalism, engineering AND alchemy between the two of them.
---
I just started FFxiv and literally made a character for every class, I have a problem 
---
I know that there’s a vocal majority here of no changes but I wish there would be 1 or 2 servers where they buff up all the specs (all tanks on warrior tier, all hybrids can output same as pure dps specs etc) and compensate by tuning the raids to be insane.
---
If it follows pservers, raiding isn’t going to be the vanilla experience, in fact it will be much more retail like with how easy guilds clear most of the content (not including naxx).
---
Just take 10% off the rep u are targeting and look how much it would take to reach said 10% 
---
NO CHANGES means no changes 2.5k-3k can't have it both ways if people keep crying no changes then it should be no changes. Not "NO CHANGES except for this one thing that I don't think should be original"
---
I just hope they will focus on making the server close to 50/50. It felt bad playing on a server with 80/20. 
---
No it’s more going to be, LF39M MC, have full tier 3 or no invite. 
---
"what is this social interaction doing in my MMO?" - retail players probably
---
It does help with those Rep grinds.
---
https://youtu.be/zMEweKgWHro this is a good video about it, although, they may be overkilling it a bit.
---
I really wonder how they would enforce something like this though. Also once a faction starts to gain an advantage it will start to snowball. If more players from one faction feel left behind they are more likely to migrate to a server that is more balanced or even tipped in their favor.
---
Very insightful and helpful post. Thank you. Sounds like a majority still agree is the questing grinding route is the fastest to 60 :). 
---
It really helped people in TBC
---
OK GOTCHA
---
\^ what this guy said. Those rare recipes arent great money makers as most guilds will have them "in house". Its the things that people constantly want that makes more money in the long run.
---
Enchants and stuff. But that's it I think.
---
Adds texture to the game. Remove everything dangerous and different and you get retail leveling. Did I change your view?
---
moneymaking too
---
great solo/grouped
---
durability
---
no pets to care for
---
It really comes down to just one thing - community size. I remember reading a couple threads on r/wow where a WoW player from Korea talks about how the game and it's community work there - it's a completely different story, because they barely have enough players to do content. So pretty much everyone tries to help newcomers/people in general so that they would stick around and contribute to the health of the raiding/PvP scene.
---
Classic WoW, even if it's going to be wildly successful, should have less of an issue that retail in the West with player behavior simply because of the fact that everyone is bound to their server (at least for PvE) and the max number of players on any given server will be much more limited that anything we're used to on retail (and especially private servers).
---
So in short - the "retail community" has no bearing on Classic. Players will love or hate the game on an individual level and if they love it, they'll become part of the Classic community.
---
If only there was some type of guild system in game where like minded players can all get together and play the way they think is fun.  
---
Unless they roll lock, then its straight up ez mode.
---
fixed
---
Greeks are also so freakin angry all the time. My priest raid leader Adren would just shout "F\*\*K YOU MAN!!!!" if someone died :D I would shit myself laughing as would most in Teamspeak. Good times.
---
Whatever you think is the coolest. Some classes are easier, some classes are slower, but the most important thing is to feel a connection with your class.
---
join us humans, youll have amazing +10%rep increase which is worth alot in vanilla. besides that youll be able to see rogues in the enemy factions flag room if you pair perception racial with the warlock invis detection.
---
plus we look better, ladies dont like small men!
---
Literally unplayable
---
Not a big raider
---
Social status as it existed in Vanilla would be far more useful
---
 /S?
---
Imo playing "hardcore" sucks a lot of the life out of this game
---
Even on private servers with dedicated people, farming consumables needed for naxx is for the few. The raid was extremely taxing and you could expect to wipe on bosses you have on ‘farm’.
---
Up until naxx though, consumables and grinding isn’t really that big of a deal outside of progression. Even in vanilla, with a halfway decent guild (we cleared up to 4H), we didn’t really require or use much other than nature/shadow/fire resistance and the odd flask of you felt like it. 
---
The guild I played with had people struggling with the beam on cthun, believe it or not, and we still managed just fine. 
---
I think another more pertinent issue is getting a spot in the first place, those will usually go to the people who invest the most time, and that’s where the competition is at. 
---
I'm starting out fresh and am going to play a mage. I always liked spellcasters in RPGs and love the variety of spells they offer from damage, slowing, crowd control, food/water, portals, etc. I'd suggest just going with what you like. Some other classes I think offer a lot of variety are druid and shaman.
---
You can’t count private servers.
---
“Willing to get world buffs” doesn’t make it easier to actually get them. 
---
Also lose out on an entire bag slot for a slight dps increase. Id say the time you save by being out grinding instead of running back to a vendor cause ur bags are full is more valuable.
---
Me too, I never knew about it in vanilla, so I want to be a furbolg caster in raids since hopefully I won't be getting hot much to dispel it.
---
Definitely, just letting you know. I love me some pet diversity - especially PvP has a lot of it!
---
I have a macro just for this : « Dismiss Pet » because hunt and warlock always forget about that.
---
Merging server is not going to happen. Players will scream and shout if they have to change their name because it's already taken on the server they merge with.
---
If you’re not wearing Pink AQ robes as a male mage, you’re doing it wrong. 
---
He's definitely an RPer, as he joined one of my old guild's rp event some months ago.
---
80-100g for mooncloth is a bit absurd. 
---
Was it not in vanilla? Then my memory serves wrong. My apologies.
---
THANKS MATE
---
&gt;  I agree that "low gear dependence" is key due to my lack of time. To that end, Hunter would be the best choice, right?
---
probably
---
if you want the best battleground hybrid then its druid with hotw spec. If really needed and u out of combat to regen and swap gear u can use an addon to instantly change items with the healing ones. Its the best in WSG alone and stealth is always fun.
---
They made a really great choice condensing all the skills. I wonder why they decided to leave in individual weapon type skills?
---
You can do everything with war but it takes time to gain Fury PVE/Tank/PVP gears.
---
With not much time, you just have to focus on one or two things, not the 3.
---
If you must go a gathering profession on main, I would go herbalism alongside engineering and do alchemy on an alt. Engineering has so many unique items that are engineering only, while alchemy has literally nothing unique to the profession but is very good to have so you don't have to buy consumes off AH or bother a friend every week to make you some. 
---
This is a good spot. Those murlocs were always tricky before one could take 5 mobs at once easy. And now that we’re back to 1-2 mobs max.. it’ll be back to the nightmares of that warble, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qMPpnCvCZvw.
---
But do they actually read the rotation? The reason I ask is I used to play FFXIV and I was bewildered by the players that just cast their ice spells over and over as BLM. It is pretty simple in FFXIV the BLM is supposed to cast Fire until they run out of MP and then they cast Ice to regain their MP. Fire does more damage. And yet I see people casting only Ice. I then tell them hey you may want to cast Fire and they tell me to shut up. Maybe WoW will be different because there are damage meters. I dont think FFXIV has a damage meter at least none that I saw so players have no idea how terrible they are doing.
---
im gonna play a human but look, orcs are just are the pvp/pve masterrace as you said yourself (best example: warriors!).
---
while hardiness is definately the tip of the iceberg, you forgot to calculate in the huge on demand attack power increase and the 5 points weapon racial for axes.
---
But I need 8 of them!
---
I wonder if they had some sort of pet system coded and they were looking for ways to utilize it. Would make sense why Warlocks and Hunters were the latest class additions.
---
I leveled discipline with spirit tap until 40. I was hard to kill but not much burst dmg, so it was all about outlasting. Once shadow form kicked in at 40 I tore most things up, UD rogues were tough and hunters with viper sting. Anything was killable if not in my favor in a fair fight
---
My oatmeal brings all the dark iron to the ‘forge.
---
And I’m like. It’s better than yours.
---
Catered to?  I stated that it would be great.  I never pleaded for it and threatened my sub based on it.  Geeze
---
Not pre-level 10. However I did manage to Solo Hogger on a mage. But quite a lot of skill and planning was needed to make that happen. Also used pots and bandages. But it's possible.
---
Enchants, Rep and some off pieces.   The weapon drops are also nice since it’s hard to get them out of  40 mans
---
Yep, that.
---
I've have arguments with people on this forum where they insisted that playing anything other than the complete 100% min/max made you an asshole ruining everyone else's experience. Even in a casual guild or PuG.
---
They exist. We just hope they won't be the majority.
---
Well he killed me
---
I came here to ask this same question as I want to raid and PvP. Do druids have any specs like this?
---
From a pally perspective, you have healer neck, great healer mace (only nef mace is better at this stage), great trinket, BIS gloves through out all content and enchants. Two blue rings that are better than previously unless you have epic rings from MC/BWL.
---
So there are pretty damn good upgrades in ZG still. Depends on your luck in raid drops and how long you have between BWL start to ZG.
---
Another classes would say ZG class trinket as BIS in some situations and you want the fish +hit shit ready for naxx.
---
Or r/ClassicWoWNoChangeCircleJerk
---
What's weird is that mentioning that something doesn't have to appeal to anyone isn't looked too upon to fondly, at least on retail forums (not a wording issue either). I know I've pissed people off by saying word for word "It isn't going to appeal to everyone, and that's okay, it doesn't have to". 
---
it gets even more bonkers with stomp, goblin mortar, big one. You've just crowd controlled everyone around you for 10 seconds while - someone tagged a control point in AB or a flag carry casually walked by.
---
and I hated the damn walking steaks for it every time...
---
Then again back in my days entrapment was still bugged out and you didn't need engineering for that (it pulsed around the hunter and not at the trap location - you could run next to people and spam the root proc on them every second)
---
This is a very cool tool/guide...
---
Probably the easiest to go along with that I've seen. Super impressed...
---
Ah yeah, the rages, i remember the rages hahahaha.
---
im trying to choose lock or pala for classic.  I love the lore of both, and i love the gear.  locks are more interesting to play and level but I've also played them more :S argh
---
I'll never forgive Blizzard for making Frostfire shoulders the worst piece of the set stat wise....
---
This is also bothering me a lot. Im gonna go paladin, and everyone recommends engineering, but it looks really difficult to pull off, you need tons of mats to craft things. Whereas if you go alchemy and herbalism, its easier to level up, making potions and then in the late game you can make elixirs if you get the recipes and make tons of money.
---
I just know for sure that I wont be a blacksmith... But cant decide between Alch/herb and Engi/minning (if thats what they engineers should pick)
---
Just use T2 chest. It's more than good enough to replace the robe. You are trading some bonus heal for 1% spellcrit and a LOT more int/spirit.
---
What's the name of the add-on for the task-bar on the top of the screen? Trying to collect add-ons I will need for the launch.. Thanks in advance :)
---
[https://wowmodelviewer.net/new/](https://wowmodelviewer.net/new/)
---
When you said casual I thought you meant tanking dungeons.
---
Maybe this is just me but if I were a tank I don't know if I would feel comfortable tanking a raid until I had all my dungeon gear.
---
Maybe there will be a casual guild that does not care with progression but just cares about having fun. I played in a casual guild in TBC and we did not make it past Kara. We did beat Kara eventually but it took months. We still had fun though! :) I bet there will be guilds like that in Classic. At least I hope so. It may be harder though to find 40 people...I remember how hard it was to raid lead Kara and that had less people.
---
No.   Copy character and gear, thats it.  Everyone starts with say 10 gold, for flight paths.
---
Yes and no. There's no real "bis" for healers. You adjust your gear to the fight length and healing requirements. That being said, the T2 chest is more than fine for healing once you get that. It's even stronger with Moonglow builds.
---
&gt;  IF you've been lucky with recipe drops. 
---
u mean unlucky
---
 1:34 omfg bring back that pyro cast animation 
---
Most community complaints, in retail at least, come from the pug crowd. There probably will be a lot of backlash from classic not being as supportive of this play style I'm sure. Granted I often feel like I'm the weird one for doing everything from raids to keys with my guild. 
---
What is broken about hamstring kiting? Rage generation formulas from both taking and dealing damage is published information from blizzard. 
---
If you knew about those you would not say that warriors are supposed to get 50% of rage from taking damage. It makes you sound completely clueless about the subject. FYI You generate literally 3 times more rage from dealing damage compared to rage generated by taking the same damage.
---
Decided on either a Dwarf or a Gnome for RP reasons, not sure if Dwarf Warrior or Paladin or Gnome... anything.
---
Just use a bank alt for consumes and mats, will make inventory management so much easier.

I think a Gnome/Dwarf guild would be awesome. Tons of little short people taking on raids, all you'd be missing would be druids.
---
Amazing, I wish there was a mac version 🙈
---
What do you mean, when i was 14 i stopped doing dungeons with my warrior when i reached lvl 50 for some reason and grinded/did quests to lvl 60. 
---
Im sure i can still lvl warrior and keep it
---
Generally yes, but often the potions you’ll be selling on raid night will be selling faster and higher than herbs comparably priced. And if you take alchemy, you can take full advantage of increased demand by selling both herbs *and* potions on raid night.
---
difficult question, it will come down to the enemys youre up against. the best mage will fail to 2v1 if hes up against 2 good hunters.
---
if you put a gun ony my head, i think a frostmage has probably the best skill-kit to deal with multiple enemies at once. sheep, roots, slows, double iceblock and amazing on demand damage makes him a really scary enemy.
---
&gt;No one is playing WoW - even wow classic - the way they did back in 2004. We know all the quests. We know all the bosses. We know everything that is to come (read: content, not #nochanges). There is no more mystery.
---
You overestimate my shit-tier memory. 
---
Not that I'm complaining, it lets me re-live movies and games I've already watched/played. It has it's perks :)
---
Yup soubds good, I could live with those options, would have to be handled very carefully though.
---
Going priest, I'll probably wait until Dire Maul drops before I bother PVPing as shadow. A two-way respec is only like 1.5 hours of lasher farming from what I can tell. Until then I'll just heal BGs in raid spec and be everyone's best friend.
---
Just like anyone else, love/hate/indifferent.
---
One thing is the haters might be super vocal because they might feel cheated on somehow by blizzard. Since it is technically a different version of the game they are playing, there is no way some people will not complain that it is either shit, or that Blizz spent time and money on something they dont care about (no matter how stupid such arguments are, they always exist).
---
I have been playing recently retail, and I have tried two servers, and I have to say on one of them I still experienced player interaction. So it is not true (despite what I thought) that all the social players have left wow. There are at least some left still. I even had someone invite me for questing in a low level zone where it was really not necessary, he just invited me cause why not, and we had a good chat (about classic among other things). I was pleasantly surprised.
---
But I am afraid you are partially right. There are a ton of entitled players who want things easy. The whole "I payed for the game so I am entitled to see the content" mentality about LFR is a proof of that. It is sad that blizzard catered towards this so hard I fear a large part of the retail playerbase is like that... They will probably hate how classic plays, and hopefully just give up while leveling, and if they then spew shit on the forums about how classic sucks, I couldn't give less of a fuck about their opinion tbh...
---
So basically all the gold people earned during vanilla will be for nothing, and that no one will be able to afford flying?
---
Tell him to go a Dwarf priest, Shit at games? Doesn't matter have fear ward.
---
I see what you’re saying, and you’re not wrong. But you’re completely forgetting the fact that if you can afford it, you never ever bring mages in closer than maximum range due to their class call. The last thing you want is for a mage to run in and decurse just to end up polying the tank which will cause nefarian to turn on the raid (ideally, turn on to the warlock positioned behind nefarian who is chasing the tank’s threat). The warlock chasing threat strat is a horde strat so I’m unsure how that works over on the alliance side. 
---
It’s doable without FW - as horde guilds clear nefarian nonetheless. But FW definitely makes the fight quicker/easier as you have less to stress about.
---
Wow, being a male Pally sucks balls!  F\*\*\* that!
---
Same for Priest.  Male NE Priest....BWWAAAHHHHAAAAHHHAAAA
---
Jeez...what's the point of having Tier sets if hardly any classes even use them?
---
I'm just making a guild called &lt;Hardmode&gt; and inviting anyone willing to put in the effort to optimize their *spec*. Everything brings *something* to the table. Trivializing content by just stacking rogues, fury warriors, and mages is really boring anyways. I'd much rather see the occasional hunter outperforming people in the Naxx tier, a ret pulling his weight in MC, or an enhance that can optimize his tanking spec for guild 5 mans. 
---
Variety is fun. 
---
***
---
Folks bitch and moan about the homoginization of WoW and then argue for extremely specific builds to be invited into raid content. 
---
Nothing wrong with the chest. Shamans wear it all the time. Mp5 is only useful if you actually run out of mana. Most early tier fights dont last even close to long enough that you need the 10mp5 from the Mindsurge robe, so strat robe is actually better for the majority of the content.
---
I rolled need on a purple item dropped in sunken temple at the age of 12. I was playing a ret warrior during the time. The warrior on our team got really mad and I couldn’t figure out why. Anyway, I didn’t equip it. They asked why and I said: because I’m going to sell it. I thought anything was just up for grabs and that I could just do whatever I liked. 
---
Five minutes later I was kicked from the group and I kept seeing the name of my character in the world chat being referred to as a “ninja”. Good times. 
---
I think you could put it in range?????!! Maybe it was off hand but I just remember running the flag and getting a ton of debuffs then right when they were all in me...boom all gone
---
Same here, I'm a Retail player who can't wait for Classic. I haven't been happy with Retail lately and the direction the game has taken in recent expansions. I loved BC and WOTLK, and even Legion I enjoyed but it was definitely different. But BFA is just going in a lot of wrong directions and I've been leveling alts to get Loremaster because I just can't enjoy endgame. Leveling isn't as good as it was but I can still enjoy working for the achieve.
---
So I can't wait for Classic. I'll spend most of my time there I think. I miss games like that.
---
Most people are idiots 
---
Imagine everyone knowing what to do and banding together, maybe we could last longer?
---
It's annoying, because we want it so badly, but not ridiculous. Blizzard aren't going to want to set a release date unless they're *absolutely sure* it'll be ready for then. I'd rather they took their time and got it right than rushed it just so we can have a botched experience earlier. We've waited this long, we can wait a little longer.
---
I still think we're going to get the date in April. 
---
3 nights a week should be enough
---
u just gotta make time in between for ur farming
---
How much you wanna bet it’s on April Fools day lol
---
Having dungeons and raids in the same category seems like a mistake. I think seperating them will get you more accurate results
---
&gt; druids will be next, damning the old Gods and their stupid game balance
---
*laughs in WSG*
---
BM hunter does ok in PvP and since hunters are bottom tier dps raid spec doesn’t really matter since you’re just a tranq shot machine. Me and Lupos will see you all soon in WSG
---
This is only applicable for level 60 as you need your mining to progress with engineering while leveling. If you want to be efficient, I'd actually just do herbalism while leveling and wait for engineering at 60 as you wont have that much use of it before max level. Herbalism can be great way to make money (better than mining generally) so its great to have it leveled up, while you can just buy your engineering skills once you want to have it.
---
I'm not even gonna *look* at this sub on Monday. My heart can't take it.
---
&gt; all you'd be missing would be druids.
---
inb4 its the gm
---
Thats why you dont throw Shadowburns.
---
You throw hands.
---
I want to take 2 days off, but I needs a date to request! Damnit blizzard!
---
Part of me hopes that there won't be a testable beta, mainly because then people will test out everything and there won't be any secrets left. 
---
You can aoe farm dm East with a priest or paladin, which is quite easy money. Since its inside a dungeon 
---
im going Ele/Resto shammy gonna heal raids with no mana tide totem..... throw me in a meele grp. and then blow people up on the battlefields with CHAIN LIGHTNINGIN!@!!@@!@!!@
---
This means you'd have to pay 5 subscriptions, correct? But I think that's your only expense? You could essentially do this for a couple months, farm like a madman, and then just funnel all the gold to one character. Is that your plan? Or what are you going to do? 
---
majority of people back then didn't know better. But you're right, during the 15 years the average player has become more informed.
---
its gotta be whatever interests him in terms of aesthetics and lore and playstyle.  everything else you learn once you get playing
---
Russian containment servers would be PvE change I’m perfectly fine with.
---
Well, now I know you either didnt play vanilla or didnt pvp/was too young to understand =) 
---
Retri paladins with good PvP gear had insane burst damage. Extremely good pvp spec/class.
---
&gt; A two-way respec is only like 1.5 hours of lasher farming from what I can tell.
---
we have no idea what the coin value will be now
---
maybe more maybe less
---
Ive heard pickpocketing values might be higher tho
---
I actually fundamentally disagree that undead is a “flavor” or “aesthetic” pve priest pick. Speaking from my experience as healing as an undead priest in raids - there’s a fair few fear mechanics and being able to cycle wotf on certain fights is (imo) far more crucial than being able to get extra haste to fit in an extra heal. Especially once priests get the edge of madness trinket (40% cast time reduction on gheal for 15 sec on a 3 min cd), you end up gaining more healing by being able to remove an ony/nef fear and healing while other healers are stuck in said fear (which is a critical time to be ready to heal the tank) compared to the increased healing output you would get from berserking.
---
UD racial is more niche in pve, but there’s a fair few fear/MC mechanic (across raids and 5 mans) and having wotf can save a 5 man, or alleviate the stress on a tank during a raid-wide fear.
---
Mages can iceblock their class call and priests and pallys can dispel sheeped players (MT). I wasn't aware that class calls have a range though, it doesn't specify that anywhere, so I thought you'd have to deal with that anyway. Also if you don't mind, what's that warlock strat? Why not just have a second tank? 
---
I didn't say the actual rage regeneration formula was wrong. 
---
As we know you gain rage from dealing and receiving damage. That formula is in place. 
---
But what isn't correct is how hit % is generated as one example. Resist rates are off as well. If the private sever is attempting to base rage generation on blizzards formula, but then got the other formulas that also impact the play are wrong, it won't work correctly. 
---
And that's what happened on private servers. Rage generation might be correct, but everything else that makes up for combat is not. 
---
Hamstring kiting became more effective because the game didn't work right. 
---
But if you remove these bugs and have the game playing properly,  warriors will have a much more efficient damage take. Vs damage done ratio. 
---
But because the surrounding calculations are off -- meaning warriors take extra damage but also hit less -- the experience is off as well. 
---
It does not actually. And having alchemy or herbalism doesnt really make it cheaper, it just uses your own time farming mats while you could instead farm gold and buy it from AH. Just for refference, engineering to full skill can cost as low as 100g and full consumables coming from alchemy except for flask for one raid would cost you around 50 gold depending on your class, not mentioning that you make this gold back two times just from looting the trash + bosses. 
---
The key thing you have to understand is that while you are using alchemy and herb to make your own pots "for free", you could alternatively use this time to just farm more gold than the potions are worth, which makes you have more gold in the end compared to making the pots yourself. It's kind of a key realization if you ever want to be decent at the money game in World of Warcraft - dont make the items, farm gold and buy them all instead.
---
As far as the flasks go, I made my money with an herbalist/alchemist so I'm probably conflating black lotus sales with flask sales.  Arcanite and transmutes always sell though, if nothing else.  I made way more money on my BS character by selling surplus ore/bars than I ever did by selling items.  
---
Went to some french website talking about classic and was kinda shocked from what I read there. A lot of people saying they would not play if they dont put new graphic cause game was ugly or if blizzard dont do this or that change to have a more "recent" game alike experience i suppose. 
---
Guess veterans will come, maybe players from today expension but Classic is not for majority of nowaday players who consume game like they consume their everyday life ! 
---
Yea, back in Vanilla I remember there was one guild on each side that was "alpha" - they could poach more or less any player they wanted (was considered bad taste to steal a MT tho). They were typically at the end of a tier when the next 2-3 guilds started to progress in said tier. And then in the tier bellow was 8-10 "feeder guilds" that constantly lost ppl to he guilds above, slowly progressed but often fell a part and then reformed. 
---
I ofc believe that there will be a similar hierarchy in Classic, perhaps with full pserver-guilds coming in as the natural "alphas" but also that there will be guilds that will progress slower but without being a feeder guild since those players aren't intrested in playing more hours anyway and thus aren't "dreaming of the stars". Ah well, one can hope
---
&gt;I worry I gank the wrong person 
---
Don't worry, I seriously doubt they'll be brave enough to play on PVP servers.
---
&gt;Millennials 
---
&gt;[1981 - 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials)

Yep.
---
Instant gratification applies to every generation though. *Every* group has people in it that demand an easier or faster way to do things.
---
I had onboard graphics when I played vanilla, im looking forward to playing it with a nicer system.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/P1peL](https://imgur.com/gallery/P1peL) 
---
I remember going back to that zone 30 times to help every other person in the guild do Jinthaalor 
---
Rolling tanks was first available in MoP.
---
I was an active raider during TBC and we were a mostly fun-oriented guild, but still made it to black temple with just 2 3-hour raid nights a week. That would be totally fine for me, I don't need to be a main tain, but I don't want to remain in dungeon gear forever because there's just no tank spots available.
---
Paladin is actually a bis lotus farmer, you just bubble and pick it up. And you always have the CD ready
---
I'm thinking a bunch of people will log onto retail, smash their daily chores, then get on Classic. 
---
There's no reason people can't play both.
---
lol
---
Which is quite a hassle as prot warrior :-/
---
Wow why do you have to attack me like that? Before level scaling I used to have about five characters who kept turning off XP when I got max level for a zone so I could do every quest.  😳
---
Well, I don't need to be a maintank. But I don't want to be just a backup as well... 
---
In hardcore guilds yes. In more casual ones, no one will really care
---
I mostly played Shadow, but Disc Priest is also weaker at handling melees. I'm not sure who has more trouble. With Shaman I could drop a Searing, keep Lightning Shield up and spam heals on myself, and I took out Warriors 1v1 like that. But that was pretty early into progression when nobody had good gear.
---
Disc Priest has PW:S and Scream, but depending on what class/race you're fighting, Scream could do nothing. 
---
They're both pretty weak at peeling or disengaging melees when you compare to Druid, Mage, Paladin, Hunter. 
---
Eye of Kilrogg
---
Well, the trick is to make someone fall far enough away from their that the game registers another spirit healer as the “closest”. So if youre questing on a mountaintop and someone makes you jump off the mountain you dont die until you hit the ground. Then your spirit spawns even further away from the mountaintop.
---
I’m not planning routes or any of that shit but I intend to waste as little time as possible.
---
My eccounters with the French communities in wow have also left me with that impression. Though I have been told that the South American gaming community is supposedly even more toxic
---
I remember there was an MC anniversary version in WoD and people wiped like crazy.
---
Crafting professions are way less profitable then gathering professions (not counting super rare recipes). This will depend on server population, larger population will result in crafted stuff to be same price as mats, or even cheaper than mats (since they can be used in multiple recipes). It only takes time and stuff bought from AH and since you can queue a ton of items, it can be done semi afk.
---
Also in a guild of 60+ people it will be impossible to not have an alchemist, most guildies will not charge you for crafting potions if you provide the mats.
---
As for engineering it has unique benefits in both PVE and PVP, that only engineers can have.
---
As for buying transmutes they also tend to be cheap. Also you can level an alt to 35 and get max level alchemy for your self.
---
They'll be camped if they play PVP.
---
I watched a video of Asmongold exploring on the Classic beta and when he was using Eagle Eye out in the ocean, he was running into invisible walls - not blue ones.
---
Water walking us a very fun one!
---
I'm hoping there's a beta so that i can spend time before the official launch customizing the chars im gonna make so i get the names i want.. It should work out but i can take a while looking through the options
---
You never know whos autorunning....
---
I could be wrong too, but I definitely do not remember it and can't find any old videos showing its existence. No need to apologize, but just wanted to correct things. If someone can prove me wrong though I'd be happy to be corrected!

Played a Raid OT then MT through much of Vanilla. We had such horrible drop rates on 2H Weapons that I never was able to obtain any of the 2H Swords. If I have a Classic wish list, this is in the #1 spot.
---
I hear ya.  All I'm saying is that it's very unorthodox in the current meta from private servers. Maybe you can find a guild of people who never played private servers and are more lax with all these harsh requirements.
---
Dont forget about repair shops!
---
 This is a solid website for a ton of grind spots for both horde and alliance. It is what I will primarily be using to supplement my questing.

[capnbry.net/wow/gspots.php](http://capnbry.net/wow/gspots.php)

That is amazing. I think our trouble was that once we cleared Kara the people who got their gear would leave. So we would get new people and have to teach them and clear Kara again. It was a never ending process. I loved the bosses though. I believe in Wrath of the Lich King we cleared Naxx. That was fun. We had someone else lead that raid who knew how to explain all those bosses. 
---
Remember, theres nothing wrong with logging for literally a minute or two.
---
You cant pause Dark Souls either so id have to get creative. I know the struggle.
---
Like everyone else says, first and foremost he should play what he wants.
---
Now, if immersion is more important to him than being a top tier class, I would say Warlock or Druid are the two classes that really draw you into the world (of Warcraft).
---
That guide seems cool! I have only been using the vanillaguide addon before, and have gotten abit tierd of it. Is there any other leveling guides out there you might know of? :)
---
I wish warriors had a staff style of combat, that way those anomations have more purpose.
---
Good points. I’m sure I underused tremor and grounding. Tremor was a bit frustrating from what I recall. Purge and earthshock interruptions are terrifying, an especially hard counter to priests 
---
This is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
---
Obviously Lionheart wont be gated. What makes you think that?
---
unless u can play the AH
---
Night elves are top tier for pretty much all forms of IRL aggro. 
---
This beats THICCer than my dwarf female’s beer belly
---
Please. Really, I really think I'm in the wrong here going by the rest of the comments. My humble apologies, I don't want to complicate things.
---
Getting world buffs is a non-issue on both private servers and retail vanilla, i did it on both.
---
Druid Aquatic Form. I'm not sure if it is already over the top. More movement speed under water and no fear of drowning may be to much.
---
This is evil, in a good way! :)  
---
Enemies on your server will think your a healbot, but when that DM drops and you get gear you can surprise them with the facemelting power of shadow! 
---
That's the thing I like about Classic, we're heroes of our factions and Azeroth, but we are still mortal adventurers. In retail you're basically a god starting at level 1, especially if you have full heirlooms, shit's gay af
---
Racial for Tauren, the stomp... Used it lol. It was like a half second stun? Idk. 
---
&gt; Meh, there's a difference between the two grinds. The Classic grind is "I've got to get these consumables so we can tackle big bad guys so I'm -carefully- farming satyrs in Winterspring today." and the modern grind is "I'm pulling 8 mobs right now and AOEing them down (and not taking any damage) with sparkles and flashy UI graphics for this 2 minute world quest because it fills a checkbox on my map."
---
Exactly. The former is more relaxing and has a nice pace to it, the latter is hectic and that can actually get boring and feel like too much, not to mention enough of that sort of gameplay eventually makes my 30 something hands/wrists hurt lol. I'm not 25 anymore!
---
Fantastic file naming.
---
Simply balance concerns I think. IIRC mages had quite the kit in alpha/beta. We could unlock things, summon phantasms/familiars, go invis, on top of our portals and food/water conjuring. It may have been considered too much to give one class by Vanilla standards. 
---
So wrong
---
Controlling your pet as hunter.
---
Nothing better than this. Entirely useless.
---
I dunno wtf it is, but there's something horrifying about open water that I can't see to the bottom in video games. It doesn't bother me in real life, but in WoW, when i hit fatigue zone water and look down, panic flows through my veins. I'm getting a little ptsd looking at this image.
---
But Roguecraft taught me that warlocks were Mushrooms :P 
---
Agreed! I much prefer the create-your-own-adventure style of Classic over the hand-holding, GPS-gameplay style that is modern WoW.
---
You raid might want Trueshot Aura though? I'm pretty sure we're getting the nerfed version of Lupos from the start. 
---
The wait is soon over, my friend
---
Why? Just curious
---
Imagine dualwielding bonereavers with maladath
---
&gt;There will be a lot of guys who will tell you that the developers of the pservers have calculate the right data (dps, armor of bosses etc.) **but nobody can tell for sure if they are right**. So we will have to wait.
---
Actually we know for a fact that several bosses in Vanilla had about 3700 armor. Which is much less than the values private servers operate on. What does that mean? It means you will get 0 armor on bosses in Classic.
---
A lot of people still had dial-up back then.....myself included.
---
Not soon enough, I want it now!
---
I really hope somebody just remakes the current retail raid frames for both a raid and a party.
---
I hate having to heal myself from the character panel and everyone else from the party panel like most ubitfranes addons require, makes it so much easier when the party panel has all 5 members in it.
---
Felheart looks so so good on UD. I know I should go Orc for the pvps but I just can't.
---
Uhh, because its extremely op and wasnt added to the game until 1.11, just like titanic leggings. They've said these buffed items won't be in right away.
---
Oh my god it's almost like we have different ways to play the game! And we still enjoy ourselves!  *What a concept right? :)*  
---
Seriously chill the fuck out dude.  And no worries about staying away, I'm sure people like you will find yourselves alone quite soon enough because of your attitude towards others.  My guess is you probably act like the "50 DKP minus\~!" guy in voice chat.
---
omfdg does any 1 elze trhnk that blue wallz&gt; invisble wallz? me 2 thx
---
If you want to tank you better be prepared to show up every single raid. Tanks are too important for a guild to have them slack off and show up whenever they feel like it. And you certainly dont want to gear up someone who wont be there every raid to use that gear.
---
Ive been picturing an Asian this whole time, accents are hard, thanks for the info!
---
We will both probably be down voted into oblivion for even suggesting changes but i agree, One of the private servers had disabled world buffs and i believe tuned raids to be slightly harder for the first couple of weeks of opening which imo is a great change it gives the people who want to blitz to end game content on release more of a challenge as well as making the first couple of weeks of new content not a wash out.
---
I’m holding off because I know all I’ll achieve at this point is burning myself out on leveling before classic launches. Lol
---
So funny everyone says this.
---
My 2nd fav class is pala too. 
---
No... that gold will remain with their vanilla toon.  Why are you acting retarded?
---
That’s ok most alliance warlocks will be human and most will give up once they reach westfall and meet the harvest golems.  It was a notorious road block back in vanilla.
---
I don't really want tp be a hybrid player in a BG.  I like the fact that as a Shaman I can be top tier caster (ele), melee (enh), or healer (resto) by respeccing.  I don't want to do all of those things at once in a BG.  Except for perhaps tossing out some heals occasionally as Ele :)
---
I am someone that currently plays retail, and I am interested in playing classic because I feel like both versions of WoW do different things right.  
---
For retail, I enjoy the Mythic raiding scene, as well as Mythic + dungeons.
---
For classic I like the deeper RPG elements, better/more interesting stats, better character building and all of that.  
---
I will play classic, enjoy myself, get into a raiding guild, but what I mostly hope to see, is blizzard and the rest of the retail community realizing "hey, there were some cool systems back in classic that with a little work we could bring back"  and kind of getting a best of both worlds things going on.
---
I accept my cloth wearing fate as a paladin 
---
I don't think Rexxar ganks lowbies unless provoked.
---
Not to mention I heard certain things were not accurately implemented on private servers. So might as well wait a lil longer.
---
Hopefully we won't say the same thing after Classic is released. 
---
Sink or swim. Either way I don't care. Classic is the new WoW and if they want to keep playing real WoW it is their duty to adjust.
---
I'm not into hazing culture or giving noobs a hard time, but this is one exception.
---
It is our duty as vanilla enthusiasts to beat the living shit out of every possible noob. It's doing them a favor. They want the autism way of life but they don't want to pay the price. Everything worthwhile has a price.
---
If they can't handle someone stealing a mining node or ninja tagging a quest mob or ganking them with a 3 min GY run then they can't handle STV. If they can't handle STV they can't handle hitting 60. If they can't handle hitting 60 they can't handle dungeons. If they can't handle dungeons they can't handle raiding.
---
Wait backtrack that... MC is easier than dungeons. The point stands though.
---
eye of killrogg from warlock.    Nice to scout raid boss rooms and give the raid leader an heart attack because he sees something going towards the boss before the green light is given 
---
There's always going to be toxic people, but something I've found is that "smaller" communities with a passion tend to be overwhelmingly more benevolent. I play a lot of mil-sim tactical types of shooters and we are always trying to help out newbs and be positive in those communities because they are small, tight knit and we always want more people getting into the genre. Toxic people are booted quickly and not tolerated in the least and I think that attitude goes for any passionate community (which the classic community absolutely is). Another example is OSRS. There have always been toxic players but the community is overwhelmingly passionate about the game and making friends is easy. 
---
I saw the release announcement,
---
I joined the pserver,
---
I tested the classes,
---
I chose my main.
---
.
---
Now I wait,
---
'cause the journey will be long,
---
the time will be short,
---
and my will shall be great.
---
Uhh, is that a onehanded BRE in the dps warrior screen? Pretty sure thats a 2h ^^
---
You dont need to farm many of the consumables if you cant afford time to do so you can now just buy a token and sell to someone to pay for their sub. Wont be like old times where you had to earn everything unfortunately.
---
Just takes time and perseverance, I dont know why anyone would waste time with tedious grinding when you can literally just stay out of the AH with some self discipline, dont level professions to max and not respec every other day and you'll have it in no time.          
---
I know this because I didnt farm my Epic mount and I just stopped leveling professions for a bit. Maybe this guide is for people who want that epic mount ASAP dinging 60.
---
I remember that Event. Loved it, queued up and myself and maybe 3 other ppl had actually done MC in Vanilla so it went quite smoothly since we could guide everyone else.
---
At the end of the day all healers will be in high demand for raids. No priest will have a hard time to get into a raid. 
---
If you have that big trust issues, you can always just look up the names on Warcraftrealms to confirm they were real vanilla characters.
---
Right......I act like a team player who enjoys downing content instead of trolling and being a burden on others for selfish reasons.
---
I think vanilla had a certain amount of toxicity but trolling hadn't really fully developed at that stage. People were still perfecting the art of making children cry for their amusement.
---
ZG is also a large circle right?  With the bosses off to the side?  As long as you do Hakkar after the aspects you can do the bosses in any order you want if I remember.
---
Also you’re right about the non aspects.  I remember some pugs skipping jin’do back in the day.
---
Zin'Rokh the Destroyer of Worlds.
---
You must be kidding, stomp is incredible
---
If I remember correctly, and I could be wrong, but that was mostly a grindy bot spot for Chinese gold farmers... Or at least that's all I saw there.
---
If you want to PvP and dont go Engineering you are an idiot. It's hands down the best profession for both PvE and PvP if you care about maximizing performance.
---
DEEP Prot Warrior, leveling with Warlock wife so i'll let her kill everything. Plus you get in a few groups and they realize your actually speced for tanking and you start to flesh out your friends list fast.
---
Umm, i dont remember it that way, at least not on my server, but idk it was a long time ago and i was 15 yo lol
---
Please explain how hit% is not working. Resist rates and how they work are published information, and also completely irrelevant to hamstring kiting.
---
Honestly I think people who've never played classic will get REALLY frustrated. I dont see the majority of players who started in wrath and above sticking around for long.
---
I don't have too much time to be farming 100G+ per week for respecs so this is a big part of my class choice. MM hunter doesn't need to respec really so I'm thinking either that or Paldin because the main healing talent only requires 20 points holy then there can be quite a bit of freedom between reckoning, ret, or just full holy if I like it enough.    
---
SM/Ruin is a good choice but I played warlock back in the day and want a change.
---
I bite. What is special with 7.3.5 compared to any other 7.x.y version of the WoW client?
---
Find a healer and look into jump runs in DM:E
---
Not sure if it will work on classic but its a gold mine for war/healer duo in private servers. Also can help fund a thunderfury if you get to that point and have mining (highly suggested on war imo).
---
Definitely skull rock and thunder ridge where Fizzle hangs out
---
I think that was Questie or Quest Helper or something like that.
---
Atlas was the loot-list, so if you wanted to know what you could get out of a dungeon, you'd use Atlas Loot.
---
&gt;Lets say a fire resistance potion, the potion price is 95% based on the one hard to get material. Most times the actual potion sells for LESS than the herbs you make them from.
---
I dont think you get the concept of Supply and Demand. If the potion sells for less than the cost of making it, nobody would be making it, or you could just buy and flip it for guranteed profit.
---
Just play on the other faction to the one you're going to play in Classic
---
Kinda like the McRib.  Exclusivity breeds interest.
---
I know of James' leveling guide, which is available for both factions.
---
Alliance: http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/old_versions (30-60)
---
Horde: http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/old_versions_0 (20-60).
---
I'm personally using a weird amalgamation of Brian's guide and the guide I just linked you. The biggest weakness of James' guides is that they don't go from 1-60.
---
It was a great spot to grind. But depending on your class/gear it can be difficult due to elites and some clumping. I remember doing it on my pally and it was definitely not fast lol.
---
It gets brought up pretty frequently when people ask for non-dungeon grind spots. You needed decent gear or a partner to farm it efficiently, but can be a gold mine in runecloth &amp; BoEs.
---
[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] 
---
Affliction lock, of course.
---
The Druids Soothe Animal is so cool from a lore and roleplaying perspective.  I don't think Druid players even bind the spell to a key though.  Lol
---
Same. 
---
r/zoomies intensifies
---
Tried to do the same thing. Still not sure what server, faction, race and class i'm gonna play..
---
Choices choices choices
---
So don't grind. Don't ah. Don't profession. Get epic mount.
---
Good one.
---
&gt; crusader aura
---
U wot?
---
Or Troll mage with MQG if you herb in AV.
---
Having played on a couple of PServers and raided a lot, I was quite surprised by the number of teenagers I came across. Now, whether they were playing because it was free or they prefer that gameplay style, only time will tell
---
Pretty sure I was a Ret Paladin with healing gear/DPS gear combo. And went raiding with it at 60. Up untill the moment my GM gave me some money "to go and respecc to holy."
---
If you think doing basic math to add together the amount of solid stones and mageweave you need to make a Sapper Charge is difficult then perhaps this is not the game for you.
---
Aquatic form for sure :) 
---
Lol what? Tokens aren't going into Classic. Blizz aren't suicidal. 
---
Arms/Prot, 31/5/15
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSczf9AEATAD8ASg
---
Should be plenty good for tanking 5/10 man content (and perhaps off-tanking some pug Ony/MCs).  Also gets the goodies out of Arms for PvP.
---
May be private server/player issues, but every time I’ve had a mage try to ice block the call they just end up sheeting half the melee dps... which leads to some angry dps ;)
---
The warlock strat is to one tank the boss, and have a warlockdirectly  behind nefarian (at the tail) just doing all the dps they can to stay second on threat. When a fear does happen that the tank can’t remove (or if a tremor totem didn’t get dropped at the right time), nefarian just turns to the warlock who then either runs to the wall or pops a limited invulnerability potion in order to survive until the tank is no longer geared. Makes it so that you never have nefarian turning to the side (either facing or tail whipping the raid) as you traditionally don’t keep an OT stacked on the tank (no need to take the breath/cleave damage if not holding aggro). 
---
Mostly just has to do with how fear ward is actually pretty clutch based on my observations as to how we do it on horde versus what I’ve seen alliance raids do. :)
---
Most likely after Classic releases the only reference to private servers will be how they just got DMCA'd 
---
Not to mention even if you're a rogue they detect you as if you weren't stealthed lol
---
Dunemaul. Found a guild that I actually got to raid with for a month and then they decided to transfer to a normal realm, so I got f\*\*\*\*\* again. Stopped playing for a while after that.
---
I don't really want to "hybrid" in BGs.  I like the fact that Shaman's can be respecced to be a top tier caster (ele), melee (enh), or healer (resto).  I may throw out some heals as Ele, but for the most part I want to focus on a single role and do that well.   I'd love to hear from an experienced Shaman on how viable Shaman healing is in PVP.
---
Most people would want to get the epic mount ASAP. They can brag in the guild and show off in major cities. The speed of the mount is not that important for most :)
---
Also I prefer to have a consistent steady stream of gold income that can be calculated/hour and reach my goals in a certain time-frame.
---
Playing the auction house is good, but requires gold and time investments. For example, if you buy cheap twink items early on... you will have to wait couple of months for inflation to kick in. The same rule can be applied to a variety of things in the auction house, from herbs to elemental earth and essences. 
---
But I guess not everyone has this kind of knowledge and they will just prefer to brute force grind their way to the epic mount :) 
---
I did this. Worth it.
---
Untamed blade.
---
So funny that now classic is considered "hardcore" when at release wow was the most carebear mmo to date. 
---
Undead Warlock
---
T2 chest is a part of the BIS setup for 3-piece bonus in BWL, but yeah strictly not BIS to stack the most +healing.
---
People have found better and more effective ways to farm since then. Relying on BoE's to obtain a good gold/h is usually thought of ass too risky. 
---
The main problem with healing BGs in raid spec is that you die pretty much as soon as literally anybody selects you as their target. 
---
I would consider that as well. I played Shaman back in Vanilla so I'm definitely familiar with the class. The question is only if I'll find a guild that lets me raid without Mana Tide.
---
At least orc get the 5% pet damage. Troll extra bow skill iirc.
---
I see your point, then again when you compare buying pots to making your own pots with Alchemy, making them yourself is a lot more fun and engaging! And also, someone has to make them so that you have someone to buy from!
---
This would actually be my first choice but no-can-do because I love Ironforge too much.
---
Hunters are not a DPS class its a support class, like shadow priests and boomkins :)
---
Yea I wasn't sure about the usage of that specific word, but I think when comparing to retail it's quite a fair assessment. It is more punishing than retail, more tedious and grindy but therefore also more rewarding imo.
---
First time I level on Alliance side just for fun on a private server. I don't see Blizzard making Classic a good experience.
---
Gonna befriend a warrior and have them look after me in WSG/AB. Probably still get nuked in 2 seconds, though... 
---
I'm going classic all the way, maybe log back into retail to level up if a new xpac is released xD
---
What is chest in the shaman picture? I highly doubt there is another pre-raid (or even pre-AQ) chest that is actually better than Robes of the Exalted for shamans.
---
Also priests never have to wear it.
---
Also it's literally the best looking piece of gear in all of WoW.
---
So essentially you can theorycraft about autohitting and waiting for procs (which you then don't get to react to in a meaningful way because classic Ret sucked). 
---
WPL, the little grave yard outside Uther's Tomb. Talk about gold farmers! 2 to 3 hunters killing the mobs as soon as they spawn.
---
I sure hope we don't have to deal with them again!!
---
Yes, something like this: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/ARAFzJHM9oAEPPSIQA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/ARAFzJHM9oAEPPSIQA)
---
I don’t disagree with that in general, I just think in terms of WoW, millennials primarily represent Classic and younger generations, retail. That’s not to say there isn’t some crossover. 
---
Funny story. On my server it was full of Chinese gold farmers, and I befriended one of them. He'd sell me Runecloth I needed for farming rep, way cheaper than AH. I think the reason was because I'd go to Tyr's Hand where he was grinding, and it saved him the time of taking a trip to AH.
---
That sounds impractical in a teamfight tbh, you'd need to equip it just before and hope it won't drain you too much. Not to mention if the warrior has a pocket healer there's a good chance he could just get most CC's dispelled. But yeah, for example if a warrior knows he can blow up a lock with succubus before the trinket/dots kill him it's worth using. 
---
This entire thread is just full of stereotyping retail players. 
---
I've always been torn between being a support class and being a warlock. I love doing both so much... 
---
The larvae of the great worm is not even supposed to be in the game until the naxxramas patch (1.11), when they added a bunch of items to Ouro’s lootable. So mute point either way
---
It's a 2 second AoE stun.  It's very valuable in PvP especially for shamans who can get off a lesser heal in that time.
---
Don't even buy it let alone bind. You have stealth
---
I still have PTSD from Vanilla Barrens chat, it absolutely was a thing on my server.
---
Anal &lt;Item&gt; was trade chat.
---
I thought it was more just the cloth/gold/greys that made it good? I seem to remember the mobs dropping like 50 silver each?
---
Honestly, all the spots and strategies are so well documented now that it's not gonna be bad at all. Easily doable in a weekend. 
---
I play retail, but I've been playing since Vanilla.
---
I am very hyped for classic as I was too young at the time to really appreciate it. I know a lot of retail players who share the same opinion as me.
---
Don't throw all retail players into the same bucket like many in this thread are doing.
---
All fear the whale penis
---
This.
---
You don't need it if you're not in a caster group, and a major mana potion is better if the issue is your own mana. You certainly don't need all your shamans to have it, one or two will be more than enough if you even need it. 
---
Lmao Nolimit being a rogue and an edgelord - It's vanilla alright.
---
It's in WotLK for sure, I have been running around on a local private server and it is there.
---
No idea
---
The blue walls are only visible if the center-of-camera is within 1 yard of them.
---
If he was running into invisible walls with a character, it's because they were actual invisible walls, rather than hitting a block with no ADT. WoW Classic IIRC is based off Legion 735, which 100% has these blue walls (but again, only visible within 1 unit around you).
---
I never said otherwise
---
Hahahah omg. I want to join your guild
---
Awesome this is exactly what I was wondering. Maybe I'll go herb alch till 60, then swap alch with engineering, and get alch on a 35 alt so I can keep making potions.
---
Blood Elves are not High Elves with a new name, they have different physiology. Blood Elves have less paler skin, with a reddish hue from magic withdrawal, they also have fel green eyes and darker hair. Blood Elves are at this point on their way to be as different to High Elves as Night Elves are. They’re similar, but in the lore and reality no way the same. 
---
Thanks. Gonna check those out. 
---
A April fools joke is most definitely coming from the blue text. Let’s just hope it’s along the lines of “RELEASE DATE CONFIRMED AUGUST 2019!!!!”
---
“APRIL FOOLS THE SERVERS ARE LIVE TODAY!!!”
---
&gt;halfway to 99 being 92
---
It's just a troll you know :o
---
Being a main tank will not be possible, but off tanking/dps will be fine. You can tank all 5 mans with a dps spec. No reason not to play the class you want even on limited time. 
---
I think the bottom line of this post is "Will people that don't have time to spend 40 hours a week playing a game have an opportunity to run AQ40 and Naxx when they are released?" 
---
My answer to that question is yes. Like you said people had shit PC's, shit internet connections, and just were ignorant when it came to this game play. These three factors alone didn't make clearing top tier raids any easier and it required a lot of effort into getting into those places so it just didn't happen. Along with this the boss mechanics are still "simple" when it's compared to today's boss mechanics. 
---
I personally think the only "show stopper" from having casuals clearing Naxx is going to be guild health. However even then I think given enough time casuals will be pugging Naxx.   
---
What about consumables? You need time to farm those to go into AQ and Naxx... Sure you do... But if blizzard drags out the phases for 2 years like they should then farming will be EASY. Youll pop consumables for MC / BWL / Onyxia the first few clears but you wont have to spend hundreds of gold getting those every single week. Youll be able to create a stock pile of herbs and such after a few clears that will allow you to save up for AQ and Naxx. Will your guild want you to pop consumables? Sure... It makes things faster, but youll still kill bosses and get shit done without them. 
---
I used this method on my first 60 back in the day. But I killed the demons in Fellwood. It took about half a week on my hunter.
---
That could be done without server names but instead just a list of planned server types for each region
---
private server meme
---
I agree with you 100%. When I say it doesn't appeal to all some people take it as some form of condescension as in I'm saying "It's for us elites only" but it really isn't that - It will be slower, more clunky and such but some of us dig it :3
---
SM/Ruin all the way
---
More than likely there will be some changes people will not be happy with. No way Blizzard gets it right in one go when Private Servers couldn’t even get it right after hundreds. 
---
Plainsrunning. I was disappointed that one din't make it in.
---
Why so? The communication has been good so far, and the experience (technically, historically) should be close to the real vanilla from Blizzard than from PS.
---
Man I would gank someone just to get those hate tells and laugh my ass off
---
Most of the links are dead, but it's still got enough info to point you in the right direction.
---
Why are you seperating the wow community into a retail vs classic scenario. When classic releases it will be the wow community too, this us vs them mentality in a lot of vanilla forums is so stupid.
---
Why do you think that?
---
 No lion Heart helm for The tanks What is this 3 hour molten core ?
---
I've not played classic since vanilla and am happy I waited patiently. I'm switching faction, class, etc. in hopes that I can gain some innocence back when I explore Azeroth.
---
I don't want to feel like I "run through the motions." That wasn't what vanilla was and I don't want classic to be that either.
---
Yeah the fury warrior picture is seriously scuffed. It also only has 4 rows.
---
I’ve found that retail players tend to cling to ancient stigma way more than any pserver player, and are super zealous when expressing and enforcing those opinions. For example, when playing on the Classic demo, I received multiple whispers from complete strangers telling me to “play a real class” (I was a Druid), when Druid is in fact one of the strongest classes in many ways (levelling being the primary example). 
---
See, pserver players have had years to dispel a lot of these old fashioned rumours - Warriors are the only tanks, Tauren is the best race for tanking, Paladins are just buff bots etc. Needless to say we know a lot more about the game now than we did 14 years ago, and, at least in my experience, pserver players are way more accepting of unconventional specs and ideas (dual-wield tanking, for example) as a result. Retail players on the other hand haven’t touched the game since 2004 and only really know what they’ve heard. Combine this with the toxic attitude of modern gamers and I predict a recurrence of old fashioned stigma and militant negativity. Expect to be denied group invites because “Paladins are shit healers” or “Druids can’t tank” etc.
---
You sir have very very strong week-ends  :D
---
I remember that taking like a solid 30 minutes the first time we did it and most of the raid was completely lost as to what was going on.
---
English is 100 percent the language of business internationally and Mandarin is close behind.
---
Even the Chinese international business community stresses learning English.
---
I understand your point but either way English is king.
---
this, OP definitely posted a loaded question.
---
Greetings fellow inhabitants of Azeroth, Wobblecogg Sprockett here to announce that Random Encounter is now recruiting new members prior to the release of WoW classic edition. We want to have a strong core of players ready to go on launch day of WoW Classic.
---
Random Encounter is a guild for older/mature gamers. We have jobs, kids, spouses, and many other responsibilities other than World of Warcraft. We are laid back and are not too worried about being the biggest, OP, 1337, guild on the block. That does not mean we are not skilled at what we do though. We take our time seriously because many of us don’t have a lot of it.
---
We at Random Encounter do not look at age as a simple number. Your maturity and general interaction with the guild is what we are looking at. If you’re a 16 year old with a mature demeanor and attitude you are more than welcome to join.
---
We are currently working towards building a team to take on all of the content WoW Classic has to offer. We want to build a cohesive unit of casual yet skilled players. We hope to have all types of players including a competitive raiding group. When raiding does start we are going to plan for 2 nights a week for 3 to 4 hours. (This may be adjusted obviously) The main goal of the guild is going to be a community feeling where all types of players can come together and play without the fear of drama. My goal with any guild I have run has always been about not just being another chat channel, but being a place you can truly call home.
---
Alliance or Horde?  
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Type of Server?
---
We will be playing on a RP server for a more relaxed atmosphere. I know this isn’t for everyone, but I have always enjoyed this type of server. I don’t usually RP myself but I do know quite a few people that do/have in the guilds I have run.
---
What classes are you recruiting?  
---
We are currently recruiting all classes.
---
Who are you Wobble?
---
I am a US Navy military veteran of 8 years and I am medically retired due to in service sustained injuries. I have been playing MMORPG’s since around 1997 with the launch of Ultima Online. Ever since then I have fell in love with the genre. I filled every type of role in a guild/clan from the lowliest recruit to the guild leader. My most recent endeavor as a leader came from leading a Free Company in FFXIV until a health problem forced me to take my leave from the game 2 years ago. I have a very extensive experience with Vanilla WoW and its raiding content. I was a member of a hardcore raiding guild during Vanilla on the Rexxar server with a guild called Oracle. We opened the Gates of AQ on our server and cleared C’Thun. We downed about 7 bosses in Nax before our guild leader took everything we had saved in the guild bank, and server transferred just before BC came out without informing us that they were going to do so. From then on I promised myself that I would run a guild the right way and never do something like that to anyone. With all of that said I am truly ready to lead this guild and provide an amazing place for people to log in every day and play WoW Classic.
---
If you are interested in joining please visit our website at https://www.reguild.org and follow the instructions there for how to apply. The process is a bit in depth, but we only do this to ensure we have a good group of like minded folks. Thank you for your time and I hope to be hearing from some of you soon. Keep your feet on the ground.
---
Very Respectfully,
---
Wobblecogg Sprockett
---
PS If you would like to get in contact with me with any questions you can reply to this post, contact me on discord via hobbit#1603,on my blizzard account hypno44#1447, or via the message system on the guild website.
---
They drop like 12-13s each, if I remember correctly. Difficult to say what it will be in Classic, though. But yeah, the gold is decent, you can just make more g/h in other ways :-) Unless you're lucky enough to have the Crusader formula drop.
---
Wouldn't the warlock get feared as well though? It's an AOE fear and afaik they don't have anything that grants them immunity to fear. I still don't understand why you don't just 2 man tank the boss, so incase the MT fucks up with stance dancing the off tank can taunt. If the information online is correct, taunting would put the off tank at the same threat level as the MT. Feel free to correct me. But even if taunting wouldn't raise his threat level - the fear lasts 4 seconds and taunt lasts 3 seconds. I think that one second of difference would cost only 1 dps their lives at max, and that's only when Nefarian one-shots that unlucky dps in that second. I think the odds of him actually wiping the raid with a breath-attack at that exact moment are fairly slim, and even if it happens, it's reeeally bad luck.
---
lol same
---
i am waiting so desperately for any hint of a release date now its crazy
---
Except I wouldn't care if you called me dumb for watching Asmongold :)
---
That is interesting, our server very rarely strayed into politics, if ever. 
---
Did the same; still contemplating between Mage and Warrior... leaning Mage though
---
It's not that different dude. You'll be fine.
---
Regarding resistance:
---
Those raids in the giant volcano? Need fire resistance. Periodic non lethal fire damage will tick for too much and make your healers oom before the boss is dead, or you might get 1 shot when the tank decides he wants razorgore to breathe fire on the whole raid, or you'll die before you can react and get out of the fire against Onyxia, etc. Typical stuff. TBC was not a huge departure from classic. You need the resistance though
---
Except if I can get my hands on Sulfuras, or I have gold to waste and want to mess around with Nightfall, there's no way I'd play enhance, Ele/resto on the other hand sounds like a well-rounded pvp spec. They look very strong in BGs and quite decent in wpvp/1v1, can even 1vX if you can burst one quickly enough. Sounds like the kind of build that has a shot at beating anyone, although it would probably be difficult against melee trains or good lock/mages, but you have tools to win. Also great scaling with gear although you could say the same about all my other choices, except maybe rogue. 
---
Thanks for your input, although that just makes me want to play all 4 even more :(
---
:(
---
Good for you champ. :)
---
no he doesnt...but back then when i first saw him i had no idea...:)
---
anyway I think for good gathering u need epic mount first which is a problem
---
the other is skinning if u got good sustained dps but dont bet on devilsaurs
---
I wonder if fishing is enough
---
They had to double the health of raid bosses because they die too easily. The math is all wrong. Tanks don't even have to max out defense. It's not worth it to play end game but it's nice to refresh yourself with a class
---
yes
---
&gt; I don't really want to "hybrid" in BGs.
---
hotw is mostly feral
---
"443 gold" ah back when inflation hadn't destroyed the economy of wow
---

---
I'm game, TBC was my favorite expansion

If you’re interested in maximizing faction reputation as a quest completionist, I’ve been working on a comprehensive Questing Guide for Alliance Rogues on my site, although the route would still apply for other classes too. It’s currently complete through level 27.

Dude literally only mentioned drops, and a few pieces of itemization. Read the post. Also, there's nothing wrong with rogues and locks.

Hi, /u/meekerdeekers
---
Its all about not having dubbed TV content after age ~7. At least in denmark, everything on TV is the original voice, with subtitles in danish. 
---
Same with games. Almost no games are translated to danish, so we have to play games in primarily english.
---
This improves massively on the "need" to learn english.

Now worries man, just dont forget to have fun and drink plenty of water! :D
---
Running the first raids into MC was a magical kind of organized chaos. Garr assignments, accidentally (or purposefully) bombing people on Geddon, listening to the raid leader have a breakdown over the inability of 40 people to form a circle for Shazzrah, etc. Amazing to compare the pain those relatively simple mechanics caused vs the mythic mechanics my Legion guild could handle after just a few tries.
---
I have no opinion on this, I'll play the game with a friendly guild, no pugging.
---
However I find this "kids these days, with their fast paced FPS-s" line of thought hilarious. :) Have you played Quake (1996) or Doom (1993) multiplayer?
---
People always liked what they liked. People like different things. Some like fast paced games, some like slow paced games. Some like both. There is no "retail community" hivemind, just a lot of people. Some will like Classic, some don't.
---
Every class can easily grind minimum 40-50 Gold/Hour, so 20 hours of playing for most. Not that  bad
---
This is in fact how new player should play the game to figure out what they like!
---
Same. I'm only dabbling in them to help memorize the first few hours. Might be helpful to be knowledgeable of how to run around for exp instead of waiting forever to complete the quests. I've heard of people getting to level 5 within an hour by just running. 
---
I'm terrible at drinking water. I've been trying to get in the groove for my health + the classic release haha. Been ATTEMPTING to get at least 64 oz plain old water in a day. Never really kept track until now :). Harder than I thought. 
---
WAAAAAAYYY back in the day, in early patches when WoW was still buggy(er), I had a pet raptor with 4 times movement speed.  I could use eyes of the beast, run him off, and then attack other people who wouldn’t be able to target and attack him back because I was so far away I wasn’t rendering to them.  Apparently if you couldn’t see the player, you couldn’t attack their pet.  
---
Damn I miss that raptor.  
---
I’m playing classic servers to play the alliance side. Family is all coming back and we are Horde 100% of the way but I wanted to experience Hogger, Loch Modan, Redridge, Duskwood and Wetlands. I came into WoW at the end of BC and focused pretty much on the Horde side and right when I wanted to experience the alliance leveling, Cata hit. So I’m enjoying myself playing alliance and not spoiling the Horde side of things when it launches.
---
Naw, you learn a lot through dying.  :)  :)  :)
---
Don't know why you're being downvoted. You can kill mobs faster at high levels, but the xp per mob and quest exp relative to your level get infinitely worse as you level up. How many same level mobs does grinding 10-11 take? Maybe 100? It's in the thousands in your 50s...
---
I wouldn’t stress about it. I’m expecting the majority of players to have either not raided very far in vanilla or never played vanilla at all. 40 person raids are very hard to get going, and so every guild but the most hardcore need to be very accommodating to players of all experience levels. You will have officers for each class in your guild that will make sure you’re aware of the fights, resistances needed, specs, any consumables, etc. 
---
I'm super happy I didn't wait and played a lot on private servers. I knew literally nothing about vanilla going into private servers and was a giant noob. Worked my way up to topping meters in raids on both a warlock and fury dps.
---
I would hate the thought of going into actual classic being that big of a noob when it really matters. Feels really good to know exactly what I want to do and plan to do.
---
Think of private servers as practice! You'll be able to jump straight into the game when it launches without having to spend hours getting used to the game and remembering where all the quests are.
---
I guarantee you the first 10 people who hit 60 worldwide will be private server players.
---
For sure, I feel like I’ve done the vanilla 1-20 experience an innumerable amount of times. 
---
Difference is, one of them has thorough documentation and the most complete code library. Even if incomplete, Bliz will be starting far better off than any private server has.
---
At least, that's the expectation.
---
That is different from fighting skills, though. But let’s give them +5 for tippy building.
---
Well choosing alliance is a mistake in the first place.
---
I still think undead should be able to skin humanoids, but that's just me.
---
People will downvote if they see a comment that’s already been downvoted, it’s just nature I guess. Level 10 you get 95x a mob and need 7600xp so it takes 80 level 10 mobs to level up, but at 59 you get 340xp per same level mob and need 209,800xp to level up so you need about 617 level 59 mobs to level.

Crul'shoruk, Edge of Chaos (Nefarian)
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19363/crulshorukh-edge-of-chaos?bonus
---
Nah you guys are BC Kids. We are the Wrathbabies. Idk what cata+ players were called. 
---
I would have put Eye's of the Beast for hunter over track beasts. It was purely a fuck around ability and really fun for cheesing the map.
---
Resist gear did play a big role in vanilla, most notably for tanks.
---
Some bosses had tanks aim for 315(max) of a certain resist while the rest of the raid could sit at 0.  Some fights like princess huhuran(?) and sappharon(?) required the whole raid to have a certain amount(I’m thinking 200 buffed min).
---
Paladins and druids are just as easy as Hunters and arguably easier than Warlocks.  
---
To be fair, most Hunters and Warlocks will also be idiots from level 1-59.
---
Its 3 months out at the earliest.  I don't think they will announce more than 8 weeks out.  I'm sure they are still working out quite a bit of stuff.  I doubt they are just sitting ona completed game and waiting until mid August to drop it.
---
Don't overthink it. Vanilla isn't that much different than TBC. Save any boe items with +resistance (like rings) while leveling. Have fun and focus on leveling and getting your regular pre bis first.
---
I'm still going for a solid july 16 release
---
Enslave Demon.
---
Fetuses.
---
It’s a crime to not be an undead warlock.
---
&gt;certain things were not accurately implemented
---
That was what I was referencing. I should have made it more clear.
---
Why would they be bitching? They'll just go back to play the current retail game. 
---
&gt;Also gets the goodies out of Arms for PvP.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;0/3 Improved Hamstring
---
Something doesn't add up here.
---
I know I want to play Warrior, since in Vanilla a prot warrior is in very high demand for tanking, and I've never really played the class much up to this point. What I don't know yet is if I want to relive my old Horde nostalgia, or play Alliance and see the other side of the game for the first time.
---
Well, first-ish, I played an Ally mage until about 20 as an alt, and dabbled in being Alliance during WotLK when I did a faction change to escape a drastically low Horde-side server population. But most of the actual leveling and Vanilla questing and storylines, I've never seen the Alliance side of it. So that's kind of tempting.
---
Dat nostalgia tho. I'd love to see Mulgore for the "first time" again.
---
I remember on my server in Vanilla, almost *no one* rolled warlock. DoT damage was boring to people. A lot of the mechanics seemed sort of slow and uninteresting, etc. It’s one of the reasons I rolled a lock, try see if there was a gimmick there that could be fun. It wasn’t until late game that people realized how good they could be in PvP (especially after death coil was introduced). By that point, so many people were invested in their classes and weren’t about to start all over. And if they did, TBC was already on its way, etc.
---
I think this time around, now that we’ve had years and years of theorycrafting and play, you’re going to see a lot more warlocks from the start. And far fewer paladin. It’ll be interesting actually. 
---
That definitely would have made tauren a lot more appealing to play. 
---
Finally, someone with a decent UI layout! :3
---
#blizzguimasterrace
---
Dwarf master race
---
Yeah I'll second frost mage,
---
Also, any healer
---
Private servers don't have the staff, financial resources, and historical data Blizzard has.  It's not an apt comparison.
---
Most likely people will say stuff is "different" because they don't remember nuances in a game from 12 years ago.
---
&gt; Is it too blasphemous to ask that this gun be tweaked / buffed to be the bridge gear it’s intended to be? Would that help the hunter move from bottom tier DPS to more in line with the rest of the roster at T3 End Game? 
---
He's asking for a buff to hunters. They do not scale and improve as well as other classes do as raid Tiers increase in vanilla. Raid drops being improved directly correlate to a class being buffed. Read the comment. 
---
I'll be a Human Warlock.
---
What class will you play?
---
I feel you man the dots, fears, pet, suicide hellfire you kn0w the usual!
---
Hotw druid with cat focus so I can raid heal/pvp/ and farm with armor swap. 
---
or Holy reckoning pala to again heal and still have a chance to defend myself. 
---
“When the tank decides he wants razorgore to breath fire on the whole raid” made me lol
---
Want a lot, can't have everything.
---
...dropping infernals in xroads, summoning victims to the bottom of the ocean, summoning doomguards...
---
https://i.imgur.com/2VzmC.gif
---
Probably the best advice.
---
Personally I won't play on a private server at all, cause it's just a massive waste of time when I know I'll be doing it down the way on a legitimate server.
---
I was never one of the 'fresh chasers' so I was just happy to play, but the second Classic got announced I lost that straight away.
---
Hi!  I raided as both daggers and swords with mostly maxed out gear going in to AQ.  I was a MS dagger rogue for the reason you stated above - so many sword rogues!  But I still went swords pre-raid.
---
Pre-raid swords are definitely stronger, for a number of reason.  I don't have exact damage values but i'd say its in the ballpark of ~3-5% more damage.  The main reason most people run swords pre-raid is availability of entry-level swords, **human racial** if you're Alliance **Windfury scaling** if you're Horde.  You can do great damage with a number of different setups that are very easy to obtain:
---
* Dal'rends
---
* Dal'rend MH / Mirah's OH
---
* Sword of Zeal MH / Mirah's OH
---
* Krol Blade MH / Mirah's OH
---
* Thrash Blade MH / Mirah's OH
---
If you're rushing 60 and wanting to get pre-raid ASAP, DM not being available until phase 2 amplifies this (even moreso on Alliance!).  For daggers, your only competitive pre-raid setups are:
---
* Glacial/Electrified Blade MH/Distracting Dagger OH
---
* Glacial/Electrified Blade MH/Bonescraper OH + Mugger's Belt
---
* 2x Felstriker + Mugger's Belt - not something I would recommend. Strong but EXTREMELY rare.
---
Both Distracting Dagger and Mugger's are located in DM, which are absolutely crucial for daggers pre-raid, and won't be available.  Your MH is locked behind PvP rep which takes a little while and, for some people, they won't want to do it.  Felstriker is pretty obvious - it's not reasonable to farm 2x 1% drops from an UBRS boss.
---
The only dagger setup that outright beats Dal'rends is the 2x Felstriker setup and that just isn't reasonable to obtain.  If you're dead-set on going daggers pre-raid, your options are limited.  I would recommend saving your time, getting a decent sword setup for pre-raid, and swapping to daggers once you get a Perdition's Blade.
---
Damn you pulled that really far out of your ass didn't you?
---
Gnomes make great mages/warlocks, and the escape artist racial is nice for PvP when you're squishy. 
---
Warriors are overpowered in vanilla and are a good option for pretty much any content. You can go gnome or dwarf, but the gnome escape artist racial would be good to prevent being kited in PvP. 
---
This. So much truth in this. 
---
Most people dont know this but the critters (squirls/rabbits/frogs) give you a lot of experience, it just doesn't show up on the screen
---
Probably should remove the line since you don't get the goodies out of Arms for PvP.
---
The problem then because grind spots being over-saturated, which will cause the time to skyrocket
---
I caused a raid ending wipe by attacking a critter.
---
While it wasn't in Vanilla WoW it was TBC, we were in SSC and the raid wiped on a trash pull long into the dungeon, I was Holy Priest and fortunately Soul  Stoned so once the trash reset I popped up and  started to drink for mana to rez, the mobs had started to spawn behind us so we were all happy that we were able to continue, if it was a pure wipe we'd probably shut down for the night rather than re-clear trash.
---
Once I got my mana I rezzed 2 other rezzers, while waiting for them to drink and my mana to top up, I stupidly decided to wand a Yellow Critter.  Not realizing it was a yellow elite critter.   I proceeded to kill me in seconds, and took out the other two before we could rez more.    So... we ended for the day, and I was mocked mercilessly for months. lol
---
Not gonna lie, I thought joining a private server would scratch my itch so a few buddies and I joined one. All the fun we're having has only made us more excited for the official Classic release.
---
There's a Dev on the Countdown to Classic podcast that goes over why they did it. It had something to do with it being too hard to balance IIRC, so they just went with mana until they could figure out what to do with it.
---
I've mained human warlock in vanilla and I'll be human warlock in classic. #nochanges
---
Just so you know, that demand for warriors tanking is mostly just in five man dungeons and you really don't need to or want to be speccing into the prot tree to do it.
---
Believe in the pax east leak, they will announce this weekend starting today. I hope.....God I hope.
---
The dev that worked on it said they didn't want mages to contend with rogues for being the quintessential stealth class. It's talked about on the countdown to classic podcast. It's long, but it's super cool to listen to the guys rationale for why they held off on some spells and included others.
---
No he's complaining about class itemization, not the abilities of the class, or the way the class operates, or it's rotation, or anything about  the class other than the dps of one intermediate weapon. It's fair to complain about itemization, your precious classic experience won't be ruined if you find out the dps of one gun changed slightly. So many things are already so drastically different from vanilla, why would this even bother you.
---
Stealth, Engineering, explosive sheep, opposite faction start area.
---
You don’t understand what I’m saying. Go and learn about the time value of money. 
---
offensively dispelling, the enemy flag carrier especially, is your best tool and you wouldn't be my best friend in wsg if you didn't prio that over healing
---
And I'll gladly take the loss in dps in exchange for being able to delete everyone in pvp with one aimed+auto+multi as soon as I get full T1. With that combo and the hunter's tool kit, they would be disgustingly OP if they continued to scale well through naxx... people say skill ceiling is one of the highest for a reason.
---
Hobbies, a wife-to-be, a social life, and a full time job definitely makes me realize how careful I'll have to be with planning around classic.  It'll be interesting to be in classic and not be 13 this time.
---
The standard fc spec for druids does well in wpvp/flag carrying and pve, just make sure you use consumables for everything
---
I keep telling myself I'll stop playing pservers and just wait, but then it calls to me like a siren, I can't help myself. I rationalize it by playing a class and faction that I wont play on classic, but deep down I know I'm just a junkie.
---
I played 2 chars to level 5 on a private server last month to solidify my class choices...it didn't help.  I'm still unsure--BUT--I didn't want to ruin the internal hype!  I don't want to see any old versions of towns or cities...I don't want to ruin it!  I CANT WAIT AHHHH
---
I mean Orcs are the second coolest looking warlocks, but it's a distant second. 
---
I just don't understand seeing as they are doing plenty of dmg still it's not like they are a ret paladin or ele shamans dmg. They are doing decent dmg and ppl are acting as if they are useless
---
As a paladin leveling, your primary melee stat should be **STR**.    
---
If you decide to heal at any point you should stack **INT**.
---
This sub is massively skewed towards more hardcore raiders. Some of the replies in that thread are ridiculous. 3-4 raids in a night? MC + BWL in an hour? a 50-minute MC clear is "average at best"?
---
umh, haven't you gotten everything around backwards now? All classes with a tank spec can reliably tank 5 man dungeons whilst leveling up, its when you reach the raids where warrior tanks is all you'll ever need, and to some extent druids can tank some bosses as well but warriors are reliable for every single raid boss.
---
I mean 100 dps is a lot, but hunters do have some appealing features. By that point in raiding most guilds have made their lineups very efficient, so even though they aren't that bad, the usual dps classes are just too appealing to stack a raid with.
---
The real funny thing is that the video in the OP shows retail players socializing. The only clip that shows what the OP is saying is the one where Nixxiom runs a dungeon. 90% of the time otherwise, the supposedly "rude" retail players are casually chatting to one another or doing their own thing before the video maker barges in, and tries to take over the conversation.
---
If someone is trying to have a conversation with someone else, on what world is it acceptable to butt into that conversation and try to make chit-chat? Especially if you have a horde of trolls right behind you making a ruckus? It'd be rude irl, and it's rude in WoW.
---
Beyond that, Nixxiom isn't even really trying to make conversation for most of the video. All the clips of him in the dungeon consist of him spitting out redundant non-sequiters that'd annoy just about anyone, retail player or else. 
---
Yet, the retail players, who are literally just trying to play the game, are supposedly the bad people here for telling him to fluff off. Many Classic fans have a hilariously distorted view of what retail and its players are actually like. 
---
Troll is great in PVE and Orc for PVP 
---
Easy there, Veruca
---
Exact same situation.  I want to see the Alliance side of zones, but I also keep envisioning how awesome it would be to be back in a Horde that I care about and like.
---
I think my desire to see something new is gonna win out, at least at first. But I'll definitely make a Horde character as well.  No way I'm joining a classic server and not visiting the Gallow's End Tavern or jumping around on the Org bank. 
---
I like the way you think!
---
#nochanges
---
I didn’t say they were. I am saying building skills are not comparable to fighting skills 
---
Yeah, use the world spots during off-peak hours if possible, instance runs like Mara during peak hours, generally speaking. 
---
My main was a priest, and who knows for what reason, i thought that the "fade" ability reduced the range from which  mobs could aggro me... 
---
So when I needed to get past a group, and was relatively close, i would "fade" and try to go on... aggroing them eventually :\\
---
At Cathedral, a friend of mine who also had a priest explained me exactly what fade was meant for...
---
In all honesty if blizzard keeps 2.5k-3k server pop cap people will be hard pressed to even fill a roster of attendence compliant raiders unless you are already a long time guild. I'm sure lots of Hunter will get spot not like on pservers where there's just 3 of them
---
you can compare them here  [http://classicdb.ch/?itemsets#0-2-1](http://classicdb.ch/?itemsets#0-2-1) :)
---
my friends and I are playing horde rn because we never play them
---
Typical raid is 2-3 hunters and you can only get 1 aura, most hunters will use a cookie cutter build that has that built in assuming new players play classic long enough to raid. Beastial wrath is still good on brokentooth if they decide to nerf Lupos. They might even normalize hunter pets though which would cause me to not play hunter!
---
I gave in and rolled on retro wow. Instant level 60 and the best gear in the game all in vendors. I just PvP all day but it's gotten me even more excited for classic in PvE content.
---
I think we won’t see it released until late summer since they probably wouldn’t want to step over the retail patches 
---
Makes sense for power-levelers. For me, running around and finding random quests *is* the experience I'm there for, so I wouldn't want to spoil the fun! 
---
PVP DR for crowd control abilities was added in patch 1.4.
---
Lol this is me for sure.  I keep thinking... "gnome lock"... free first mount, strong in pvp, fun in raids... then i stop and think... "Tanks and healers get faster groups though.. maybe I'll do a druid or paladin instead..." ... then the cycle continues on.
---
only pigs because he eat all the food 
---
nice armor and damage balance 
---
Omg dude im glad you typed all this out to reply to a tongue in cheek post. Grats you win the argument. I didn't even bother reading it.
---
Nope. It's a "horror" effect, not fear.
---
My motivation in the 40s is the dungeons I know are coming up.  I love ZF, so I bust my ass to get to ZF as quick as I can.   Then when you're out of there, you have BRD to look forward to at lvl 52...which you really wont' be done with until post 60.
---
Undead rogues are 100% viable like I said. Keep in mind the entire time you are dueling that shadow priest. He has dots on you and every time one tics. You have a chance to get stunned. WoTf and Hardiness are about the same quality. What makes Orcs optimal over the undead viable is the second racial. Bloodfury it gives 25% base attack bonus. 
---
In classic wow 25% bonus base attack means you get a 25% bonus to attack generated by agility. Point is it is a metric shit ton of attack. This bonus makes you the best PVE option for a rogue. In one on one you can also use it in pvp while your enemy is stunned. The ability is the stone nuts.
---
As I said though. If you want to be undead or just prefer them. Undead rogues are 100% viable. Keep in mind though, I am a very bad rogue. The advice isn't mine it's that of one of the best rogues in the game. Tips interviewed in a video.
---
I don't remember the vanilla prices, but the 3 different vanilla PTs I've been on, the price was around that spot.
---
Nice.  I farmed here forever and never got anything beyond the greys and a couple greens.  I was farming the larva in Epl to help my healer friends when I got my stockades.  Was great.
---
No BRD love in the 50s?
---
Also looking at the raids, Nef is kind of the last "important" boss that fears, most of the AQ and Naxx bosses dont fear, and I don't think the ZG bosses fear
---
I couldn’t figure out how to buy the gear. What do you do for gold?
---
Since pvp progression is not discussed by blizz do you think they will include it at launch? 
---
I was planning on doing speedleveling, but when I think about it, I'll just take it at my own tempo.
---
I’ve raided at a high level as a dwarf hunter since MC but I’m going to go mage or warlock for classic. I strongly prefer the aesthetics and feel of undead/orc to human/gnome, but I feel the overwhelming majority of competitive guilds will be alliance due to pally buffs. Am I putting too much weight on the importance of paladins in classic? 
---
Was there any reason to skip these bosses? Did hakkar have a different loot table if you did? Or was this purely for a challenge run, of sorts? 
---
That's exactly the point why i'm waiting for the official one to drop. I played since vanilla, 10-16h a day for a long time. 
---
To me, the vanilla experience is exploration, community, (online) friends. I don't care about hitting 60, or endgame raiding. I care about going on a journey, meeting strangers. Getting to 60 is far from my main focal point.
---
Not going human and I doubt I will be lucky enough for dalrends
---
I think that some younger people will really enjoy Classic, but I think that the majority of that age group will just not be into it because it is so 'slow' compared to modern games and requires more 'work' than modern MMOs.  That being said, I don't care--retail WoW is horse shit and I'm extremely excited for Classic.
---
That’s funny because as a Warrior he can legitimately kill them to build rage in between mobs.
---
deviate fish and oily blackmouth sold well (14 years ago) to make a few gold a day.  I also remember selling swiftness potions pretty well, and briarthorn.  Man I can't wait for gold to matter again, it's like a separate game - making gold.  Lots of people don't have the stomach for it, but it can be quite rewarding to see your whole mailbox full of sold auctions.  
---
We could keep up a threat on which we could decide for a server we all jump on at launch? I'm in for a higher pop too since I want massive and I mean massive wars for wpvp.
---
I don’t remember it in game either. I do remember seeing these images though. I also remember super skinny blood elf males. I thought that was cool; too bad they changed that. 
---
Fuck it, at this point I'mma just troll people and kill them while they are trying to level to help even it out.
---
Hes saying that the tank "need" is only for 5 mans and related it to his chosen class. Raids need 2 tanks tops. No shortage for raiding.
---
Get on the gold/consumable grind early and stockpile for months and months, that shit usually increase in value 5 or 10 fold later on when the economy stabilizes.
---
I almost want to jump on a private server just to mess around with classes until I find which one I want to main. I want to be whatever the funnest griefing class is, that isn’t a Rogue. Currently, I can’t decide between Hunter, Warlock, or Shadow Priest.
---
no, you cant cast any spells when you mc other players.
---
It's the total number of tanks I'm talking about, not necessarily the fact that the tank is a warrior. In dungeons 1/5 of the players are tanks. In raids it is at most 1/10, and it's a spot usually taken up by people who plan to do it with a guild from the start since it's the one raid slot that can't easily be substituted for. 
---
If it happens to be an Alliance guild in a PvP server let me know. That sounds amazing!
---
For alliance warlock ,what do you guys reckon? Human or Gnome?
---
Also, alchemy or engineering? 
---
Yeah I can see your point.  My point of view was a bit different because the majority of the pvp I did on my priest was on the same spec as I used for raid healing so mostly disc/holy and no shadow.  Also pretty much exclusively baby sat our overgeared OTs who were mortal strike so the healing debuff wouldn't have mattered much.  All I had to do was stay alive until they killed everyone.
---
So in perspective if you are focused on PvP and not just PvP on the side of raiding, troll has more possibilities.  That being said ... lumber mill MCing off enemy priests was always hilarious because they would try to do it to you ... 
---
I can't tell if you still think I'm lying about that one time in BWL or you believe me and feel like I shouldn't be a braggart. Either way, I get that you want to present yourself as someone who is just trying to help me, but I don't believe that's the truth. I don't think that if you were really motivated to help me you would try to shame me - fat shaming, as you put it, doesn't work, it's not helpful, it's just a nice way to excuse yourself for being cruel to someone. When you say "I have done my best" and this is what demonstrates your best, well, I just don't believe that to be true at all, it reads more like you're trying to make up excuses for your behavior. I'm sure that - if you're a human being and not a bot - your best (when you are **actually** trying to help people in your life) looks infinitely better than this.
---
However, I would like to commend you for trying to communicate in a way that is civil. I don't think you managed to communicate anything concrete or useful, I also don't believe you're honest with yourself, but at the very least I think it's great that you managed to turn your portion of the conversation into something civil, so full marks for that. Good luck out there.
---
Trust me, if you go Night Elf or Human priest, you aren't going to be very unique :).

I have a friend that likes to tell the story of how him and his friend went exploring into Elwynn forest as dwarfs, I believe at the island north east of the logging camp. His friend had to log off leaving him all alone. He freaked out like a lost child because he had no clue how to get back to town. For one reason or another he deleted his hearthstone. He was distraught and lost for hours because he had no clue there was a map in the game...
---
He's also a lurker so maybe he'll run across this. 
---
Rogue and warlock are roughly equal in wpvp and 1vX. They both have cc to be able to take on multiple people. And are very strong 1v1. They both have their roles in organized bgs. Rogues are more of a defender though, and warlock are in the teamfights. I can't say for sure about warlock but rogue in t1/t2 is really strong in pvp. MC daggers are great if u wanna dagger rogue, and the sword from bwl are good too. People claim that warlock t1/t2 gear is a bit lackluster though. Although gearing warlock will be incredibly easy. Especially compared to rogue. As a side note there was a small private server 1v1 tournament a few days ago. And they banned sl lock spec. Just to give you an idea of how broken sl lock is. 
---
Shaman is okay in pvp. Theres usually a spot for them in organized bgs as resto. 1v1 (ele) is doable but not nearly as strong as rogue or warlock. And 1vX will be really hard unless youre using engi. Also ele gear in MC/BWL is kinda lackluster. T1/t2 inst great for ele. But once you get aq gear its really strong.
---
Warrior is crazy strong for pvp IF you have a healer. You can win duels and 1v1 wpvp but you're super gear reliant. Caster generally can do way more with less gear. And rogues have a ton of utility to make up for a lack of gear. The good plate gear from raiding is going to be really hard to attain since there will be a ton of warriors competing for it. And the tier gear isn't used for pvp at all except for a couple pieces (until AQ t2.5 then you can use it all). 
---
I would say warlock is overall the strongest choice. Easiest to gear, amazing in wpvp and 1v1 and 1vX. Strong in bgs. Then the rest would be rogue (pretty close 2nd), shaman, and warrior in that order.
---
Also epic mount increases profit from mining and herb by a ton
---
Implying all mmos aren't brainless on some level
---
many Streamers are popular but no pro gamers. the reason many getting bored while watching. me included.
---
100g is about 2 hours of play give or take
---
Yes but demand for tanks for raids is always low because you only need 2 for the vast majority of content. They go from 1/5 of players needed to 2/40 Versus if you look at healers they keep their 1/5 group pve ratio.
---
That's only on the shitty private servers like VG where bosses have no armour and half their abilities are missing. 
---
Game experience &gt; Making money.
---
Making gold isn't the reason I play WoW.
---
I perfectly understand what you are saying, but frankly I don't really care, we obviously have different perspectives on what WoW is, and that's fine. To each their own! So by all means, go ahead and become a classic money making machine, but I sure won't! I'll be doing what I like.
---
You can quest for gold. But I was lazy and just paid cash. You "donate" and they give you DP tokens, which can buy 100k gold, etc.
---
I don’t think I’ve seen anyone mention this. Raids drop so few items per boss, split between 40 ppl sometimes you end up with 1 piece every 1-2 weeks, and I think that’s generous.  ZG and AQ might be catch up raids, but they can still be used to augment the slots you haven’t gotten drops for yet. 
---
Did u have problems solo farming with daggers? Frontstab wont work
---
Did u do pickpocket runs or even solo brd bosses? Did it work without subtlety talents? Stealth impsap and prep for 2 vanishes
---
It only affects your group not the entire raid.
---
Didn't know how auto attack worked so I spammed right click on mobs thinking I would attack faster (I think we've all been there)
---
Didn't understand what buff meant until about level 30
---
K E Y B O A R D  T U R N I N G
---
Didn't even know there were NPCs, I thought everyone was a player. Many minutes were wasted trying to haggle with the general goods vendor
---
From your link : "Nefarian casts an AOE fear ROUGHLY every 30 seconds."
---
At least on the private server I play on, this is a little bit less than 30 seconds. You can stance dance MOST of the fears. But not all of them. 
---
I can't say for certain if that is a private server issue or legitimately blizz like. 
---
I would vote mage. world pvp and 1v1 is pretty tied between the two. With rogue pulling slightly ahead. But mage scales way better with aq and naxx gear. Casters in general really take off later in the game. Plus mage has way more options for gold farming than rogue. And if youre planning to hardcore raid consumes is a huge deal.
---
Wouldn't Bonebiter be better than Mograine's Might? (Assuming ret with SoC) Slower weapon with bigger damage, better DPS after accounting for strength bonus, and it's a SM quest reward instead of boss drop chance.
---
My semi-related question: how beneficial is leveling alongside engineering versus acquiring it late? I think I want to mining/tailoring on the first clothie I level, and save up the ore to level Engineering later. Having access to bags and gear early I think would be really helpful, plus the epic patterns at 60. 
---
I plan to alt a Shaman and could continue him as an ore farmer after dropping mining, or alternatively herb/Alch. Though I want to PvP as 30/0/21 and would likely need engineering on him too! 
---
It's a little annoying how powerful and necessary engineering is.
---
I think prebis is bullshit. You can spend 6 months farming it, you may never have it if someone roll higher than you or the item just never drop for you.
---
Do you think the PGM that will raid MC in the second week of launch will be prebis ?
---
Not sure if I fully understand the question but could a Paladin tank the adds? Yes but without defensive cooldowns like Last Stand and Shield Wall this would be incredibly far more difficult and if the Paladin bubbles then it will cause all of the adds to attack other players.  
---
The problem is if you're trying to drag them out then it's going to be complicated if a Warrior is trying to do it with taunt and is most likely slowed down by Magma Shackles and the DPS will probably not be able to stop themselves before blowing up the adds. 
---
yeah I was a kid in vanilla too and managed to level a warrior no problem to 60.
---
I guess when the hardest class to level is your reference it doesnt seem too bad
---
Purely a challenge. AFAIK Elitist Jerks or some top tier guild managed to get Hakkar to sub-5% in mostly T3 gear before they wiped with all priests up. 
---
Or if you pre-order WC3 Reforged you can download the original. 
---
They said in the latest Dev talk that they wouldn't do that as it's not classic
---
I took these screenshots when my guild leader at the time (Ts) got his Scarab mount and title.
---
Ts and Cide were the ones to create CTRaid, CTMod, and those addons that most used around the time.

then you'd have to calculate the XP needed for each level, sum it up, divide by 2, and look where you would be with that amount of XP.

That would be the mathematical half.

More mp5 means more chain pulling trash with no drinking, though.

I remember someone accidentally gifting one of my alts 100g. This is how I got my first epic mount. I tried to message the guy, I added him to my friend list and I gave him a week. I never saw him online so I kept it figuring a gold seller must have misspelled their intended recipient, then deleted their gold mule. I swear I tried to the honorable thing at the time. 
---
IT'S HAPPENING
---
I actually tried to solo the elite spider in Stonetalon using this spell. I would dps as much as I could, then sleep him before I was about to die, wait for mana, etc. I can't remember if I actually succeeded or not, but I thought it was super cool
---
Neat, gonna recreate the spellbatching effect. You posted this super fast op btw
---
Because people feel special and knowledgeable when they go around repeating this stuff. And they do it for every class, but it's all bullshit.
---
YES YES YES FUCK FUCK FUCK
---
HYPE LEVEL: MAXIMUM 
---
Honestly this attitude just doesn't hold up in Vanilla. If a mage refuses to go fire for AQ40 because "this isnt a fooking job", well we will just get a new mage.  If a priest wants to use his meme talent spec instead of going PI, we will get another priest. As a human/night elf priest, you are easily replaceable :).   
---
Vanilla isn't the place to have a selfish attitude. Your guild/raid leader wants you to spec a certain way for a reason and that reason is progression. You get loot when the guild progresses, If you don't want to contribute to that, then go run PuGs with your shitty talent spec.   
---
Now, that is not my attitude towards humans/night elves in general. We have plenty of human priests in our raids. They are good players and nice people and we aren't just going to boot them for a dwarf. But we do try to always have at least 1 dwarf. Its not like I think night elves and humans are ass holes who don't care about contributing to the raid. However, if someone had an attitude like yours, it would be a different story.   
---
All I said is if you want to maximize your contribution, go dwarf. This is a simple fact. You don't have to do it. 
---
Wtf Blizzard, I’m running out of things to complain about 
---
Jeesus that sounds brutal. Do you know what the buffs are that the priests give him doing it this way? 
---
They just keep knocking it out of the park. Super impressed with this!
---
Truth. 
---
I had a buddy who put his MBA to good use.  At one point he had 1/3 of the posts in the Horde auction house on Lothar.  lolz.  Hell, he had 10s of thousands in gold...   in vanilla.

Shaman is kinda slow on the leveling but really fun to experiment with. Raiding with a shaman is always interesting because of totems and how situational they are. You can also absorb cloth leather and mail gear so you have tons of options depending on the spec.
---
For races you can't really go wrong, but orc for stun resist and bloodfury is great in PVP. I would take troll next -- berserking is also pretty good.
---
In the end play what you want for shaman. I don't think race choice is as big a deal for them as it is for priests, where dwarf is a *clear* winner.
---
I think they're bigger than D, and they don't look natural. 
---
Part of Tauren culture is "the great hunt" so maybe that has something to do with it.
---
A russkie here, will joining one of Eu servers at launch, simply because I can't imagine that many russians will join wow classic the hype is just not there imo. Gotta stay with the community
---
r/accidentaloldcountryfornomen
---
Same.  I want it to be as fresh as possible.  Don't want to spoil it.  And I'm not going to rush to endgame.  It will still be there when I get there.
---
NO CHANGES
---
Gnomes are objectively better due to the 5% boost to intellect. You would also get a +15 to engineering, making it much easier to train. 
---
The only really beneficial racials human warlocks get are 5% spirit and a stealth detection boost. 
---
Professions are a personal choice. Alchemy can make more money, but you can make very useful equipment for yourself as an engineer. 
---
Theres a bunch for solo “quests”. I suggest killing dews to start off. They are the best gold/dmg dealt quest. Or you Can do RFC runs (5man) for 800g + a flask per run. Groups Can farm Core Hounds or do Cursed Island, tho the latter requires some gear to be efficient. 
---
I’d however strongly encourage you to get attuned to Azharah Crater (50 of each PvE and PvP tokens) and farm scourge tokens for shoulder enchants, they go for 3-4k/enchant. 
---
Or you could just PvP and turn in tokens and marks for gold. Or farm consumeables or mats for proffessions, or proffessions i general. Alchs make a good load of money with the right recipes. 
---
I mean, theres a plethora of ways to go about it! 
---
If you have questions or want some guidance, I’d be happy to answer. IGN: Magrethe 
---
But your argument was that my gold would be swallowed fast. Why make that point if you are now moving the goal posts to talking about fun? Fun was never the talking point here
---
Wait, is that netherweb spider silk icon?
---
Not as big of a deal as some of the other things they’ve been working on keeping pairity for but I’m not mad at this.  Kudos to blizz again for keeping things authentic.
---
It’s not that uncommon nor that simple. Mindset and mentality is a complex system and it’s entirely possible for it to take overhand, even on something as “simple” as gaming. That’s what I’ve gathered from studying psychology and experiences with friends anyhow.
---
Very helpful.  Love this community.  Thank you.  
---
this is actually huge, because this is one of those things that Blizzard absolutely didn't have to do. i fully expected them to leave it as modern combat goes, but here they are fulfilling the wishes of the community.
---
if they will implement this change, and the loot-trading change, what *won't* they do? this says a lot about their internal decision-making process with respect to the community feedback.
---
Damn... they're really on point lately, huh?
---
Fuck yeah! Classic team is killing it. Every update exceeds my expectations. 
---
I'm so hyped I dunno how I'll manage waiting until release :( ^beta ^when?

This guys spec is terrible for quite a lot of reasons, but hamstring is barely useful for pvp man, it's a waste of 3 talent points. More concerning is the lack of iron will in prot. You should probably delete your account and all of your posts since you don't get the idea behind playing warrior.
---
My faith in Team Classic's resolve to give us an authentic Classic experience is ever growing. I'm thinking Ythisens knew some of this, allowing him to say on stream that the "no changes" community was going to win much more than they thought they would.

these blue posts making me hard

Holy shit this is great news thank you so much for posting 
---
I wouldn't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see. One other thing I'd like to ask: Why is nobody ever talking about taunting? Patch 1.1.0 had this line: Taunt: Now gives the target just enough threat to attack you. Cooldown added. (find it here: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Taunt_(warrior_ability))
---
So when you have 2 tanks swap before every fear, alternating their use of beserker rage, things should be fine, no? 
---
This is absolutely fantastic news!
---
hunter with track hidden or Aspect of the Cheetah
---
These Classic developers are doing God’s work. Seems like they are enjoying the ride too.
---
MC is going to be on farm pretty fast I guess due to the 16 slot debuff cap that comes with launch and 1.12, instead of the 8 slot debuff cap back in the day. That, with the allround much better knowledge of the game (experience, databases, guides, etc.) will result in overall more AND better geared players when the next patch releases, so the next raids will be faster on farm too, and so on and so on... AQ40 and Nax will be something else, but overall there are will be more players with T3 then back in the day. I'm gonna be one of them (-:
---
"Blizzard is going to ruin classic they never listen to us".  - Naysayers 
---
Underrated  I think.  
---
Get ganked into melee,  warstomp, run, scattershot, run more,  concussion shot....
---
Can confirm. I was a dumb little kid at WoW launch and I got along just fine. There’s nothing about classic that’s really impossible, it just takes a little work. But there are definitely people on this sub who think for some reason that a video game that appealed to younger masses 10+ years ago would suddenly be out of the difficulty range of kids today. I’d be on the opposite side of that argument - I think kids today are wayyyyy better than we were back then. With the ability to watch pro streamers, read up on strategies/talent progressions, etc.  I’m sure classic could pull in young players that would get deep into the game, but the marketing aspect needs to be there to get on their radar. 
---
This is the one. All other will be removed.
---
I think that happened to me once...   maybe twice.  ;-)
---
Thank you for the tips :)
---
Vanilla raids are somewhere in between today's Normala nd Heroic raids, in terms of difficulty.
---
But vanilla had more options of preparation - world buffs, consumables, enchants, etc. That makes time investment directly affect your performance. You could spend ages farming consumables, and that would actually matter in progression.
---
On retail, I'd run out of content on daily basics, because I'm already locked on the raids.
---
Spells in classic could get a lil funky. The article has a good example. In classic, If we’re both mages and we both cat polymorph on each other at the same time, more often than not it would result in us both being polymorphed. In modern wow, the time frame is smaller for this chance to happen so only one would be poly’d. It’s just about staying true to the roots of classic, even if it seems odd or buggy. That’s just how spells were. 
---
You make me wanna be a priest or shaman. It is fun being the "nice guy" and just helping people. It is harder to do that as a hunter. Doesn't have the same "omg I am glad he showed up/in my group."
---
You can accomplish the same thing by one tick of magewater.
---
Alexensual just dumped his new girlfriend in preperation for WoW Classic with this latest update
---
Ahh ok got it, thank you!
---
When MCing people off the Great Lift, make sure your character name is "Thefastlift"
---
Fucking amazing update. Thank you.
---
Please address Sharding &amp; Automated Squelch from Right Click Report and we're all set.
---
Hell yes! Classic team delivering again!
---
Classic team is on point
---
This is a change I would have been 100% happy with. I don't need the broken performance for the game to feel authentic and good. His example isn't "fun" it's broken and frustrating and the warrior probably just went and uninstalled the game because of it.
---
I think I’m gonna roll warrior (orc). I’m playing as a human paladin right now on a private server. My thinking is that as a warrior tank, playing casually shouldn’t be a problem since tanks are always in need. So, assuming you’re good at tanking, you shouldn’t have a hard time finding a group to run dungeons with if you so choose.  
---
Im a casual player by the way. 
---
I think the best way is not show him any classes that are available. 
---
What I mean by that is, ask him what he envisions himself playing, or what role he likes. Has he consistently chosen one role over another (support, dps, tank)?  Does he prefer melee or range?  Caster or bow wielder?  This could, at least, help narrow down the choices.
---
Ask stuff like that and he could have his class picked before even looking at the game.
---
Is there any other major issue still left unresolved? This felt like that last big unknown
---
It was never hard, it took a while, but that's not actually hard.
---
Taunt does not work on many bosses. Taunt certainly does not work on Nefarian or Onyxia. So you need to actually stay behind these tanks in threat. 
---
Onyxia also does a wing buffet that knocks threat off the main tank. If your tank doesn't have enough of a threat lead, she will turn to the person second in threat. So it is valuable to have either a very geared tank that stays way ahead in threat, or an off tank going second threat on this fight. Again, the fear is not 100% immunable because she casts it a bit more often than 30 seconds. So yea fear ward is helpful for this fight too. 
---
Someone post the text! I can't access the site at work.
---
Be happy for authenticity or sad because spell batching is aids, a real toss up. 
---
My erection grows
---
If you just want to be in the PUG World I would recommend you to play a Healer or Tank. 
---
I am still deciding between Paladin or Warlock, but right now I am more on the side of the Paladin.
---
Pallys are not "made for" raid tanking, but in most dungeons they will be fine, healing for them (as much as I know) is doable in any spec until level 55+ and we can fight about the ret dps pally dream, but there are enough subreddits for that! 
---
If you are not into min maxing you should just pick what feels right to you, you just have to remember that in classic you bring the class not the spec, which could lead to some problems if your top 2 picks are ret pally and enh shaman, I don't judge you, I just want to let you know that these days the "meta game" is very strong in peoples mind. Sure maybe you will find a guild which let you play as a ret pally, no argument about that! 
---
There will be plenty of casual guilds who will take anybody they can get, it just may get frustrating always being last on dps meters, but if you can life with that, feel free to do so!
---
If I decide to play a pally, I will be a Healer for 99,99%. For me it gets very dull to be always last on dps while putting so much effort into it, but thats just me.
---
Breaking combat so it's more authentic.
---
Saying Improved Hamstring isn't useful for PvP is already enough for me not to take you seriously. The rest of your comment is just pure toxicity.
---
A hope? A chance.
---
sharding i guess, they didnt really give us a definitive answer on that yet.
---
Holy cow I did not expect this at all, good show.
---
Generally, you are right tho. If a boss is not immune to taunt, threat is generally not an issue. Unless its like something like Berserker in ZG that constantly drops aggro on you so you need to chain taunt or push tons of threat.
---
That's super cool !
---
**Now give me a release date, I need to reserve my holidays**
---
I remember slowfalling off hyjal over darkshore across the ocean, if you had an epic mount you could literally hit the wall and be stuck in it instead of hitting the ocean infront of it. No memory of a blue wall.
---
the time passes on the server in discrete slots, called batches. think about a mage casting polymorph on another mage casting polymorph -- *at the same time*. 
---
here's how it might look. "|   |" means a batch that contains no spells.
---
|   |   |   |polymorph1 &amp; polymorph2|  |  |   |   |   |
---
so you can see both polymorph casts are in the same "batch", and since neither mage is polymorphed *before* the batch that contains the cast, both polymorphs will succeed -- the mages sheep eachother. 
---
this can happen for lots of strange interaction, like vanishing death coil.
---
More like "blizzard is losing any chance of mass appeal and is fine with catering to 20k uber nerds" which is fine, I can't complain about that, but this isn't a good thing for the long term success lol.
---
In Vanilla it was possible to have two spells or abilities go off at the same time, the charging example is a classic one I'd see all the time in BGs. I'd charge at the same time as another Warrior, you'd see the charge go off but you'd end up stunned at your starting point rather than where the charge was supposed end. I seem to remember being able to charge after being polymorphed too, like the polymorph would hit the same time the charge would go off. 
---
Fixed it, that was actually an oversight by me and not due to the BIS list. But it looks even worse now :-(
---
@Abeneezer
---
It only has 4 rows because DPS Warrior gear seems to have incredible longevity (according to the BIS list, check it out). Like, the helm alone appears to be BIS for entire Vanilla, and then there are the legs and boots (visual key pieces) that last a long time. 
---
I have to say though that no other spec had so many alternative options listed in the weapon section. Your race seems to matter a lot (human, orc, other) and then there seems to be some kind of dual wield vs. 2 hand argument, but I don't know anything about the details.
---
isn't lionheart helm only available in AQ40 patch?
---
Spell batching was broken and frustrating back then, and it will be now. Artificially adding in the flaws of the game is dumb.
---
Have fun being a shitter and spreading around terrible advice to noobs.
---
I am super hyped. We are getting the authentic and strategic pvp experience that we've grown to love.
---
Honestly they just keep knocking it out of the park
---
MC would be steamrolled even with 0 debuff slots for any decent guild with experienced players. The casual guilds will probably still wipe a bit.
---
The warlock that we assign to chase threat avoids the fear by max ranging it. The fear has a 30 yard range, so if you keep an eye on the bigwigs timer for the fear, they just step back out of cast range. Typically we just have all the OT’s slap on nightfall/annihilator/2 1hers to dps after p1 ends. You only really need 1 or two to peel off and put on a shield when all the skeletons spawn when Nef drops to 20-25%. Taunt does have a threat-matching mechanic as far as I understand. The two tank method is viable, it’s just slightly less dps (as it’s one less nightfall increasing caster dps) although it’s a safer strategy. 
---
The problem is that the fears don’t come out on a specific timer - it’s a timer for a chance for nefarian to cast fear. As such, it can be pretty tricky to time a taunt to land right before the fear goes out. A warlock stepping out for 10-15 seconds is a bit easier to coordinate (rather than coordinating which tank is breaking which fear/etc.) - but that just comes down to guild/personal preference.
---
Difficult as it is, I'm waiting. 
---
I have a piece of paper beside me where I write down notes about things I'll want to keep track of, though..so far it just has information on my main and their professions, and my alt with their professions. 
---
Playing on a private server is the opposite of why I'm interested in Classic: time well spent; a character I worked on being 'wiped' goes against this for me. To each their own, though.
---
dont be this daft. im not saying you said dw tanking benefits more from windfury. read the sentence you wrote. its not hard
---
"anyone not being a mega pleb is dual wield tanking, making wf even better"
---
explain to me how windfury itself - something that only augments the main hand and has zero interaction with the offhand - is "made better" by dual wielding. absolutely nothing changes about its mechanics, how frequently it happens, or the subsequent minor threat generation increase
---
and no, you dont. if youre in a guild where you actually have to heal and youre spamming both totems, youre switching them like every few seconds. you cannot cast chain heal while dropping the new totem. you cannot cast chain heal while switching back to the past totem. these gcds lean into the amount of time youre spending healing pretty heavily
---
please dont play a shaman when the time comes
---
or warrior
---
Since we first announced World of Warcraft Classic, we’ve seen questions about spell batching. While we never really eliminated spell batching in WoW, we did change how (and how often) we process batches of actions coming from players, so you’re less likely to notice that processing in today’s game. We’ve been working to ensure that in WoW Classic, the gameplay of activating spells and effects will not differ from the experience of playing original WoW.
---
It was relatively common in the original game to see a warrior Pummel a mage who simultaneously and successfully Polymorphed the warrior. The mage suffered Pummel damage but no spell-school lock, because the mage didn’t get interrupted. This could seem paradoxical, but it could happen because the Pummel and Polymorph were both in the same batch, and were both valid actions at the start of the batch. For the most part, things like that don’t happen in modern WoW, but they still can. We’ve made improvements to batch frequency, and the game is much more responsive than it used to be. Still, if you manage to get both a Pummel and a Polymorph into a tiny processing window in modern WoW, you’ll experience the same behavior as in original WoW.
---
As with many other areas of WoW Classic, authenticity is our primary concern. It used to be the norm that combat flow and PvP balance were defined and tuned in a game where spell messages were resolved less frequently. There was a single game loop that processed all messages sent and received every server tick. Nowadays, the game processes multiple loops for messages of differing priorities. Spell casts are high priority, and have been for a long time.
---
For WoW Classic, we’re moving spell casts to a low-priority loop that will cause them to be processed at the frequency that best fits how the game actually played in version 1.12. Two mages will be able to Polymorph each other somewhat reliably, resulting in two sheep nervously pacing around at range. Two warriors will be able to Charge one another, and the end result will be both warriors standing stunned in each other’s original location.
---
We think it’ll be fun to see those sorts of things happening again.
---
well technically they are affecting classic without being in classic.
---
we know that classic is paid with the retail subscription - so you can buy game time with gold from your retail account
---
Wow, didn't expect this at all.  
---
I ran 21/0/30 ret paladin in vanilla and did pretty good healing or dpsing when i wanted.  I wanted to try something similar with an enh shaman this time and thought about a 0/30/21.  My rational is I can still heal in dungeons and even raid with a healing set of gear.  Just toss me with melee/tank and let me totemtwist and chainheal IF I raid.  But in pvp I can be a little bursty and toss out a heal or lighting with NS.  Back up plan is ele/resto 30/0/21 if I don't like enh.
---
Still no release date jeez they slacking
---
Get my life together or lose it another decade of WoW... everyday the answer becomes more obvious
---
The examples they gave are about as layman as you can get, but I'll try. Spells 'go off' (are registered by the server) on certain 'ticks.' Modern WoW has updated this so the 'ticks' are more frequent, and certain spells have priority to get noticed by a 'tick' faster. They are moving it back to what it was in Vanilla, with the original 'tick' rate, and all spells and abilities with be processed the same, no priority.
---
Can the naysayers please STFU now? Clearly money is not the primary motivation here, or they wouldn't do something so small for the passionate fan base.
---
Awwww hell yeah!!! I won’t need to set foot in retail ever again. Soo want a release date 👊🏻👊🏻
---
&gt; Same goes for chinese in pservers
---
And retail. But, they’re honestly half as bad as your average no-life neckbeard elitist. 
---
Agreed, this is the second decision to go with as Ion put it "objectively bad" game play by choice they have made, and in both cases I'm disappointed.
---
Prepare for the onslaught of YouTube videos for this blue post. I hope MadSeason puts out one today. I've been binging his videos the past two weeks, love that guy and his music selection.
---
Which two?  Same class?
---
Thank you!
---
from all things i did not expect that to happen
---
I know I'm a bit of an outlier here, but I'm enjoying retail and I've had a lot of fun with BFA. This is the first time in a while my guild has been active and between mythic dungeons, raiding, and arena I've had plenty to occupy my time across several alts. 
---
That being said, I'm looking forward to classic! As much as I like heirlooms and flying and all that convenient stuff in retail, having none of that made leveling back in the day feel like an adventure. I plan on taking my time and enjoying the nostalgia trip. I really miss a lot of the Pre-Cata zones- what they did to Thousand Needles is a travesty.
---
 I don't understand the naysayers who want Classic/Retail to fail. If both succeed Blizzard will want to keep supporting each, right? 
---
For the folks stuck at work that can't access the blue post:
---
&gt; Since we first announced World of Warcraft Classic, we’ve seen questions about spell batching. While we never really eliminated spell batching in WoW, we did change how (and how often) we process batches of actions coming from players, so you’re less likely to notice that processing in today’s game. We’ve been working to ensure that in WoW Classic, the gameplay of activating spells and effects will not differ from the experience of playing original WoW.
---
&gt; It was relatively common in the original game to see a warrior Pummel a mage who simultaneously and successfully Polymorphed the warrior. The mage suffered Pummel damage but no spell-school lock, because the mage didn’t get interrupted. This could seem paradoxical, but it could happen because the Pummel and Polymorph were both in the same batch, and were both valid actions at the start of the batch. For the most part, things like that don’t happen in modern WoW, but they still can. We’ve made improvements to batch frequency, and the game is much more responsive than it used to be. Still, if you manage to get both a Pummel and a Polymorph into a tiny processing window in modern WoW, you’ll experience the same behavior as in original WoW.
---
&gt; As with many other areas of WoW Classic, authenticity is our primary concern. It used to be the norm that combat flow and PvP balance were defined and tuned in a game where spell messages were resolved less frequently. There was a single game loop that processed all messages sent and received every server tick. Nowadays, the game processes multiple loops for messages of differing priorities. Spell casts are high priority, and have been for a long time.
---
&gt; For WoW Classic, we’re moving spell casts to a low-priority loop that will cause them to be processed at the frequency that best fits how the game actually played in version 1.12. Two mages will be able to Polymorph each other somewhat reliably, resulting in two sheep nervously pacing around at range. Two warriors will be able to Charge one another, and the end result will be both warriors standing stunned in each other’s original location.
---
&gt; We think it’ll be fun to see those sorts of things happening again.
---
Ah yasss the double charge thing was so true
---
How the fck can we have a classic summer if it launches at the end of summer.....it needs to come out right now!
---
Sharding, server pop cap, when ranking comes out, RP-PvP, uhh, I'm running out of things!
---
No one knows.  Blizzard hasn't discussed any plans regarding after classic, even if there will be an after classic.  My point regarding druids, was more in the event it ever is announced, but for now we don't know if there ever will be anything else.  I'd guess it would depend largely on the success of classic.
---
The madlads they actually did it
---
Imagine being so inept that you'd hope others aren't allowed to use addons/mods because you are too clueless to use them yourself.. Yikes.
---
I don’t think Blizzard Activision cares about our prayers too much XD hope they release for early June though 👌🏿
---
So we'll be able to jump dodge warrior charges again?
---
Lel
---
good blue post! 
---
now if we could only get a hint as to a release date \^\^
---
Thought 16th of July was confirmed?
---
Doesn't matter.  It eliminates the problem of needing to respec or hybridize.
---
You could just always not play Classic and go play retail where every spell interaction is crisp and responsive.
---
But you knew this and decided to complain anyway.
---
I did, could post proof but I get auto delete anyways? lets see first
---
Yes you're correct, more top end and higher DPS.  I got my factions mixed up when going through it.  Unless you're like, super into pally tanking and want to take the 1h sword instead but for pure 'getting to 60 as quick as possible' yeah take Bonebiter.  
---
Ah okay that does make sense (and things more complicated unfortunately), thanks for explaining. So is it difficult for an off tank to be second in threat (with reduced rage)? Because if I remember correctly, when the MT gets feared, Nefarian/Ony attack the second highest person, which would be fine if it was the off tank who used berserker rage. So you would still alternate use of berserker rage, and the boss would tank swap naturally, am I understand this correctly? Is that what you meant when you said the raid has to watch their threat (i.e. reduce dps), because they need to stay behind the second tank? 
---
Don't worry, team #nochanges will be in here soon telling everyone about how they expect all of the bugged resource nodes hidden in terrain to still be there or they won't play.
---
You're welcomed with us at /r/wow. Plenty to complain about over here.
---
If I polymorph faster than another mage, I want him to get polyd, not both of us. Even if I'm just a fraction faster I'm still faster. Not sure how to feel about this. 
---
It's like Blizzard are actually reading what we're saying, crazy right?!
---
Well done Blizzard, well done. Now all we need is a clarification on server sharding and I think that's all the issues that I can recall sorted. I'm genuinely impressed Blizzard, keep up the good work!

I think this is a screenshot from actual vanilla.  (It could be from a later patch, I guess.  But I wouldn't have been sporting a [Flawless Arcanite Rifle.](https://www.wowhead.com/item=16007/flawless-arcanite-rifle))  I have a crap ton screenshots I took over the years.  No notes associated with them.  lolz
---
2 sheeps, 1 batch... nervously pacing around at range.
---
It's one of those spells which was poorly placed; imo it should have gone to Shamans.  Additionally I think warlocks, the masters of curses, should have had remove curse over mages, with mages getting a self-dispell (perhaps with a short cool-down).
---
Loot trading - check. Spell batching - check.
---
Now, all I can hope for is 1.5 AV.
---
I'm actually surprised more than anything else. Blizzard's goal of authenticity is terrific for Classic WoW. Great job Blizzard! 
---
right-click report!
---
I have fond memories of dueling other warriors and this happening. Charge each other, then intercept each other, and then the slow walk towards each other haha.
---
Lol what? Night Elves actually become uncrushable the easiest because of the dodge.
---
Imagine trying to mock someone and instead showing everyone you have no idea what you are talking about. Yikes.
---
T3 is significantly better for most classes. 
---
The pvp gear is better for classes like shadow priest, arms warrior, enhance shaman because their T3 sets are for healers and tanks. 
---
I really feel that Classic is in good hands, we are gonna get an authentic vanilla experience.
---
This exact discussion has been going on over on the Classic WoW forums for a few days. If any of you are looking for reading material, there's about 450 responses in there to read through.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/8-10k-servers-please

Does this mean we'll have the original energy/mana tick rates?
---
Me looking at a rogue’s toolbar: “Huh, why’d that guy hotkey Deep Wounds?”
---
I distinctly remember seeing warriors charge mages all the time just for them to stun the mage, and turn into a sheep right as the mage got the cast off although theoretically the charge stun should have interrupted the polymorph.
---
First thing I'm going to do is test if we can "dodge" charge by jumping. That I believe was also a side effect of spell batching.
---
Fucking home run after home run.  What's next, a collector edition with replicas of the old CE?  This was the last thing that really concerned most of the community and they handled it perfectly.
---
At the rate they're going we're bound to see posts on those soon enough! I can't wait to read what their stances are, but judging by their past record, things are looking good!
---
Since fewer spells are being processed each server tick, wouldn't that mean in theory that large scale battles will be less lag prone than in the retail client? I know in retail that if you get any more than 50 people in an area fighting in open world pvp, the delay is very noticeable and unplayable at times. 
---
My dick is so hard, hey guys remember when I said they remade broodwar with it's insanely ludicrous mechanics perfectly??
---
There are exceptions because of some of the set bonus and pvp flavor items but for the most part yes, late aq and naxx gear is better for most builds
---
Umm I do not think so tbh, if ur on an empty server sure but please do tell me how a priest can reliably grind 50g/h on an atleast decently populated server?
---
Yep, there will probably be flood of people from retail to try it out.  Initial numbers could very well spike as high as 8 million or so.  Many of those will quit in the first month because leveling is too slow.  Many more will quit at level 60 because you have to be a competent player and find groups to run instances for gear.  I think by the 6-month mark, 3/4 of the players from release will have quit or gone back to retail, and we'll be left with a mostly mature community that likes to be social and doesn't mind putting in the effort to pull their own weight and earn their rewards.  I'd guess it will level off at around 1-2 million.  It's going to be great, IMO.  We'll have our game, and the people who just want to queue up and zerg their way to easy loot will have theirs.
---
i've gone out to the edge of the world twice, once because of a sever crash and another because of horrible internet. 
---
the first time was while i was playing on the mop beta, the server crashed but it hadn't kicked me from the game yet so i just kept swimming and it looked [like this](https://imgur.com/a/6sHm3ek)
---
don't have a picture of the second, but that was during legion and my internet was notoriously awful and i had been clearly disconnected but wasn't booted from the game, so i just kept swimming out of curiosity. never got past the ocean, it was just an endless sea with the edge of it blocked off by an invisible wall.
---
the great blue wall is really interesting! i've never ever seen or heard of it until now so whether or not it was in vanilla it was fun to see!
---
Can't you use it, destroying it, and then re-equip a better-statted OH?
---
Simply incorrect.

Thank you for making my day! :)
---
Classic is slower than more recent games but for an MMORPG it was quite fast and easy even for its time.
---
We've still got more things that need adressing, but things are definitely looking great.
---
I really want this to turn out well. Come on Classic team, you can do this. 
---
&gt;  Two mages will be able to Polymorph each other somewhat reliably, resulting in two sheep nervously pacing around at range
---
That image is just outstanding.
---
So basically what the rest of the gaming community calls ticks/tickrate? You both cast during the same "tick" and it counts? 
---
I'll be repping boomkins in classic. The way I see it, hybrid classes don't shine in their DPS but more through their versatility. I can support other raid members with spell crit, off heal when my healers are lagging,even offtank when our tank dies. I can buff, contribute decent burst damage, and when I'm open I can shapeshift and continue DPS in cat form.
---
People have narrowed their minds over the years. People will play their class thinking they can only fulfill the role of their spec, as opposed to fulfilling the many roles of their class. So to all the boomkins, nelf priests, retadins, enh shamans, I salute you &lt;3
---
Ugh. No they cant. Their cd is too long to immune every fear. Why are all you scrubs pretending to know what you are talking about?
---
Hype detector: it's over 9000!
---
You don't even believe in your own statement. You're caving in and now saying "hmm maybe 1 point is fine". Next time are you gonna say 2 is fine haha?
---
Also the vast majority of PvP talent builds use Improved Hamstring which backs up the fact that the talent is indeed worth it. 
---
The level you realise you've specced balance and are killing stuff as cat

The issue was bypassing the launcher. Why would I have the launcher pinned?

People want true vanilla experience, and blizzard are listening. We really cant complain about that. But I both agree and disagree with you.
---
Was it Shazzrah who had the AoE that looked like Warlock's Rain of Fire? Once we had that on farm I always like to fuck with people by casting Rain of Fire on them to watch them scramble away.
---
Thank you!! My work filter literally blocks nothing but blizzard. You rock
---
TBC raiding was far more difficult. Don’t worry too much about vanilla raiding. It’s far easier than you think. 
---
&gt; what won't they do?
---
Remove sharding
---
^^Pls ^^no ^^downvote ^^it's ^^a ^^joke
---
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
---
I cannot believe they are listening THIS closely. Are we being trolled by Blizzard? This almost seems too good to be true
---
Tyr’s Hand is too grindy and inconsistent. Back then it made sense but nowadays there’s better and more optimal spots. 
---
10/10
---
Seal of Command doesn't use any of the charges, but it still gets the benefit of the extra spell damage.
---
The armor reduction makes your weapon hit harder making seal of command hit harder. It actually worked pretty well back then. It was mainly a dueling trinket.
---
Why would I not want to spec into the tanking tree to tank? Serious question, as I said I don't know Warrior.
---
Five mans is what I'm mostly thinking of, though. I have many memories from Vanilla of spending a god damn hour in Orgrimmar hollering in Trade and LFG to find a tank so I can get a dungeon run going. 
---
Maybe my memories are skewed, but I recall tanks in Vanilla being at a very high premium in terms of rarity, even more so than now.
---
The fuck? I've played on private servers for many years now and I've never even known about this. I love the idea of two mages polymorphing eachother simultaneously! 
---
I do know about charge dodging, I wonder if that is related?
---
Tyrs hand is decent, you can farm crusader recipe and it has black lotus spawns + chests if ur a rogue.
---
I’m getting it 5 minutes after I hit 60. 
---
Yeah I am actually stunned. I thought it was a fucking stretch to think they would mess with spell batching, especially since they are using modern engines. That is amazing. Are they just tuning into Easfands stream or something? I know he brought it up a lot 
---
Being Off Tank is its own challenge, and can honestly be more challenging than being main tank. For instance, you might have to tank all the adds while the MT tanks the boss (because he has more mitigation), you have to constantly be aware of patrolsor adds, you need to watch the MT health. Being OT is still really fun and rewarding, and in my experience MT and OT are often the closest people in the guild (other than RL friends).
---
Oh my
---
You mean Activision is going to ruin classic...good thing blizzard is doing it
---
So does this mean that when a mage finishes their frostbolt cast, a rogue can vanish while the frostbolt is traveling and it won't hit?
---
yep. when i swim out to that part of the ocean where the sea floor suddenly drops down into the abyss my stomach drops
---
But they *will* remove sharding: after the initial rush is done.
---
ok, yeah. you got me there.
---
i'm still really worried about activision pushing them to use sharding to save server costs as much as possible.
---
I honestly don't understand how any of these are "major issues" to anyone. Personally, I'd be fine if they fixed the broken frustrating things like spell batching that were only there due to technical limitations. I'm pretty sure we'll have people complaining that the game runs on too good of hardware and at too high of resolutions and demand they make it not. But w/e makes the circle jerk.
---
WE FUCKING DID IT
---
Sorry for the late comment.
---
Shaman tanks are viable: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2x4k1/devners_guide_to_the_shaman_tank_textimg/

There is also what I like to call "semi-viable", where you can take a decent portion of the raid bosses out there: mages, priest, warlocks and rogue fall into this category.
---
I am in the classic discord https://discord.gg/classicwow voice channel if you want to chat and learn more about it.

That was Gehennas, and holy shit I'm kicking myself for not thinking of that lmao

That's just it... they're so close that the server can't tell who was faster. So you both get polymorphed.

I too have no memory of a blue wall. I recall an invisible wall tho
---
you mean the video whereby he complained about the lack of community - yet refused to participate in any form of content whereby actual interaction with the community would be completely normal - that video?
---
as for the question. retail won't care much and there will be tourists during retail content droughts. that's all there is to it
---
Yeah, exactly like that
---
Yeah, I thought so! But I also thought a racial would fit the definition here. .. shrug
---
This is surprising. This was one of the things I assumed would be too small for them to worry about.
---
It was never a big deal to me so I'm not that interested in the announcement itself. However, it's a sign that they're taking authenticity very seriously and that's great.
---
Not exactly sure when they "nerfed" them, but you can see them in all of their massive glory in this video. https://youtu.be/Ibh4SO5W4OU
---
this is pretty great... im amazed they are spending the time on things like this, this may turn out to be a rebirth of wow
---
&gt; Being able to ~~discover~~ glitch to places that wasn’t meant to be explored
---
So you would still alternate use of berserker rage, and the boss would tank swap naturally, am I understand this correctly? Is that what you meant when you said the raid has to watch their threat (i.e. reduce dps), because they need to stay behind the second tank?
---
Yes that is precisely what I mean. And yes, without incoming damage from the boss, you have WAY less rage than the main tank and your threat is a major struggle. Also, the fear timing is a bit unpredictable, so you need to eat some fears that you probably could immune as off tank, just to make sure you have immune ready when you need it. This further limits the threat you can generate as an off tank.
---
Lately, if our dwarf priest dies, we have the off tank walk up to the MT position and eat shadowflame damage so that he gets more rage to push threat with. This does help a lot but it's a bit sketchy if your healing is not well geared.
---
For me, I like the lore of the Taurens.   Taurens losing their war with the evil centaurs, saved by the Orcs, then pledged allegiance to Thrall.   "Walk with the Earth Mother..."  
---
As far as hunter, that class fit better with my loner/solo personality.   Just me and my pet going out into the world looking for adventure.
---
Well yes, but they are not the actual server ticks. Executing spell interaction was not done on every single server tick, instead they were "batched" into (i believe) 200 ms batches which then all executed simultaneously. 
---
So functionally spell batching can be thought of as server ticks but they are distinct from the actual server ticks.
---
&gt; people want true vanilla experience, and blizzard are listening. We really cant complain about that.
---
I mean, people can complain when they change something but no one's allowed to complain when they don't? People have different opinions but only 1 is allowed be expressed on this sub. Kinda creates a misleading echo chamber for blizzard to be basing things off of imo.
---
I think what he meant is every guild will already have a MT (and offspec OT is fine until AQ). So unless you are willing to put in a serious amount of hours being port is kind of pointless
---
Not actually someone who gave a shit about this tbh but fair play to Blizz for sticking to the way it used to be
---
Queue the 50 different but same youtube vids.
---
I fear that Classic economy will be a mess. Private servers nerf the crap out of every farm zone in the game and still the economy is iffy and inflated. Classic most likely won’t nerf any farming and this will be impact the economy greatly. I have a feeling that 1k gold for your epic mount won’t be all that much money in Classic. 
---
The Classic Team is single-handedly restoring my faith in Blizzard. Well done guys, well done.
---
But you were right, I specifically said "don't need engineering" and then came with an example using engineering... pretty retarded imo haha.
---
CHANGES?!?! NO CHANGES OMG YOU HEATHEN HOW DARE YOU FILTHY FREAKIN SCUM THE WORST PERSON EVER!!!

Guys stop I'm trying not to just replay a warlock in classic and you're not helping
---
If you want to tank in a guild, you better make sure that on raid days, you have 100% raid attendance or very close to it. A tank that doesn't show up on raid days isn't worth anything. If you can't guarantee that you'll show up on specific days, then I suggest speccing Fury and off-tanking when needed, or, as you say yourself, play a mage or rogue.
---
Bro am I in love with WoW again? And Arthas isn’t involved? #WowdiedafterWrath

Orc hunters glitching into the walls in AV and spamming multishot. No.
---
I'm wondering if this change will also help reduce lag in large scale engagements? 
---
It's confirmed for summer '19, July 16th specifically was pretty much just a theory from a name featured in the Classic wow panel last blizzcon. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/
---
That will probably be true for many.  But some young players will try to stick it out, and along the way they will make friends while grouping, and they'll get a taste of the rewards of being social and becoming a competent player, and then they'll be hooked.  And afterward they'll look back and wonder how they ever enjoyed retail.
---
Next bluepost will be official release date. Then we can all blow our loads.
---
give up lol
---
The pally portraits seem to overvalue +spell crit over +healing/mp5/int.
---
Removing certain limitations in the engine just to add wall jumping can open potential routes for cheaters to get through the system and that's not a problem they want to create just so people can glitch around (even though I find it funny myself aswell).
---

I respect blizzards choice in this matter as it is the most authentic. This is one change I would have really liked to see, but I understand why blizzard has made this choice and I cant be mad about it.

Warriors can and do often use staves leveling up.   I just wish there were any viable endgame melee staves :P

Being able to wall jump in Warsong/Arathi is dangerous. I did it and it's totally not fair.

yeah, you're being ridiculous. there will be good raiding guilds for both factions.

Spider silk and netherweb spider silk share the same icon.
---
Yes warriors in general have very dynamic gearing. Race matters, for your own character as well as the others in your raid (gear availability). The thing about 2H vs DW is that you need very little hit for 2H and a lot of hit for DW. So your gear setup will change a lot. On top of that you have items that give weapon skills that are bis in a certain setup. And finally your BIS gear also depends on your buffs. If you have world buffs you can drop some stats (I think dropping crit is the most common) in favour of other items that wouldn't otherwise be BIS.
---
Here's another mage pvp video from beta.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxlX6YM2ZUI
---
I'm also going casual. Focus on doing 5 mans, only doing raids sporadically and very casually, if at all. I don't like PvP at the best of times, so not having the endgame gear for that isn't really an issue for me. Becoming a humble trader of raw materials, bags and/or performance enhancing drugs(alchemy) also speaks to me. 
---
Originally I was gonna go warlock or mage, but I got it into my head that I want to be a healer this time around. So now I'm stuck deciding between priest ,paladin and druid. I'm trying to figure out which one would more easily allow some kind of hybrid spec that allows me to heal 5mans, without  being absolute garbage when I'm fighting mobs and gathering mats/gold on my own outside of dungeons. 
---
This is crazy territory. Spell batching is ..... Its so small on the scale of things that matter. None of the vanilla private servers ever got spell batching working properly. Think about that.... And yet Blizzard is putting it in. 
---
There goes the idea that the game won't be able to hold up in large raids..... current hardware plus the slower batch loops means raids should hold up much better than they did in vanilla man.
---
Only Hunters and Warlocks can have a spec that is both optimal in pve and pvp.
---
Like you said Warlocks with their sm/ruin which does very good in pve and pvp. And Hunters with the MM/Survival spec which also excels in both pve and pvp. 
---
Other classes have to respec every time they want to pvp while warlocks and Hunters can always go back and forth between pve and pvp all they desire. 
---
Is there a good guide to read about spell batching? What's the pros and cons of it? 
---
“We think it’ll be fun to see those sorts of things happening again.”
---
This is honestly the part that makes me most excited because it really seems like they get what going back to classic is all about.
---
No kidding? I figured it was already in there. TIL!
---
I don't see the problem with sharding as long as the shards are contained per server so you don't encounter people from different servers.
---
&gt; the idea that you should be passing major upgrades because someone else is new/bad/unlucky, is not "normal".
---
It just makes you not an asshole.  Versus the retail version of the game, where nobody else you interact with matters.
---
You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. 3/3 imp hamstring is a must have. 
---
Okay, i want to know which exec is looking after Classic, Because they're listening, changing and iterating in an agile fashion. And they're not trying to Dirty the waters or ram fucking microtransactions down our throats with Classic. 
---
So far so good, it's like someone with huge pull at the company is making sure classic is classic, and I'm grateful. But still cautious. 
---
After competing with overcrowded zones on private servers, I wouldn't mind if they sharded the first couple zones at least for a few months. 
---
RP PvP :( help us 
---
Nice nice
---
**THEY KEEP DELIVERING**
---
find treasure!
---
I really wish to believe that, but I am 50/50 and it's almost april, we still dont have a date for beta.
---
Which means they have to anounce a release date say in the next couple of weeks, then we should get a date for beta. But thats just my thoughts, on the flip side, blue posts are more and more frequent and I am confident that we will get a releae date soon.
---
Can someone ELI5 why this is a good thing? I honestly have no idea what this means or why people want this. This is not meant to be negative, I'm not a native speaker and I just want to understand what this implies.
---
You mean like they will after giving us a launch we actually can play?
---
Man blizzard does indeed do everything right with classic!
---
Will this help with large scale PvP? Large scale PvP is basically unplayable in retail and I think the batching has a lot to do with that. If it behaves the same way on Classic as in retail now, I don't know how the hell we'll be able to fight over world bosses.
---
using a headpiece with 30min cd?
---
I dont see how this is an issue of people with different opinions. This is how combat functioned in Vanilla, without it it pvp would feel different. Cant get anymore black and white than that. 
---
Pally buffs? Where you read that?
---
You’re overcranking the difficult of vanilla classes. Everyone will be able to play their class effectively and most people will be surprised how easy vanilla really is. 
---
That is not my experience.. I resubbed a week ago and i see people phasing in and out around me all the time
---
the economy in general should be fine as long as the population isnt too high

Why would anyone ACTUALLY want this?

This community is retarded sometimes. 
---
"MUH BLIZZLIKE!"
---
I seen a vod of people raiding Naxx a few months ago. Lots of people already in T3 by the looks of it. They wiped on Patchwerk 4 times 
---
This is huge, I world have 100% expected to be disappointed on this, and I would have 100% understood why it was not reasonable to expect spell batching to work the same as it used to.  But really, this was a significant factor in vanilla PVP both practically and from a flavor standpoint.  Many many 1v1 matchups were changed because of this- the most critical one was probably rogue vs mage- if you were a rogue and you managed to gouge the blink, it was one of your few weapons against frost. 
---
I see. If all of this is correct, I can only agree with you, FW does make this fight a hell of a lot easier and faster. Altough that last part of your comment would have been the exact thing I would have thought about - I mean, the off tank doesn't need to be brought up quickly with Flash Heal, but a renew and lower rank or max rank heal should probably suffice in that moment. Bring him up slowly to 100%, let him eat shadowflame again to generate threat, rinse and repeat. I'm actually excited that this fight requires that level of thinking - but unfortunately I can see how some read leaders will just look for 1-2 dwarfs instead. 
---
Well I think the good news is that after 1-2 dwarfs, there should be equal chances for all races!
---
The Classic WoW team has hit it out of the park over and over and over again.
---
This gives great hope for the extremely small list of remaining community requests.
---
Please, Classic WoW team, release at least one RPPvP server at launch, which was one of the server types available for Vanilla 1.12!
---
Other than that... is there really much left? I guess a special edition box would be neat?
---
So much nostalgia, ughhh I can't even take it
---
&gt; Uldaman in Badlands  
---
What?  
---
&gt; I think this is a screenshot from actual vanilla.  
---
* active experience bar at level 60.
---
Yeah, that looks like a very modern, not classic list.
---
&gt; Did these all in a day on Daggerspines in Hillsbrad right next to Southshore along the coast. Huge spawn, very fast respawn rate, easy mobs to kill. Purgation isle (island in the very far Southwest water area of Hillsbrad) also a nice secluded place you can grind on undead.
---
Go to Purgation isle at level 30.  I dare you.
---
Right-click reporting is not even an issue. It's not an issue in retail and won't be in classic. 
---
Private servers didn't put it in out of a design decision, they just can't really implement it properly because only Blizzard actually knows how it works.
---
It's easier for Blizzard since they understand it fully on a technical level.
---
Got ***THE*** biggest boner right now.
---
I'm feeling so vindicated right now. I got talked down to as if I were reading too much into that fired CM's message that "no changes people would win more than they think" or whatever he said. Including by a certain popular podcaster here. And yet, with every update, it's holding true.
---
Is this true for Rogue as well or will the t3 set be better for that as well?
---
Now to get them to change their minds about 1.12 AV
---
what is that blue buff icon?
---
Patch 1.12 please.
---
On private realms everyone and their mother is flasked to the teeths because dynamic respawn herbs and every world buff. You won't see nearly as much fully flasked and buffed raids in Classic because it's way to expensive and world buffs have actually a cooldown in real Classic.
---
Alleria storytime.
---
Two top tier alliance raiding guilds could not amicably decide who should get the title/mount (Risen/Failure &amp; Surreal/Rokaz)
---
Failure approached Rokaz with his collection of badges hoping to convince him that alliance should pool resources to assure someone from their own faction get the title/mount, more specifically, Failure.
---
Rokaz disagreed and convinced his guild &amp; other Risen hating alliance to funnel badges to Ts, GM of Blighted and horde hunter known for CTmod, along w/ Cide.
---
The amount of drama between Risen &amp; Surreal fueled the raiding competition so much on Alleria, but this was always my favorite story of pettiness.
---
Since I doubt Activision will give the green light to buy dedicated servers to host Classic Wow (instead of the cloud based crap they have now, or so I've heard), I would imagine it's going to be a constant and ongoing issue. They'll say they won't use sharding in anything but the starting zones and during launch, but then some people will discover they're using them for far more and longer than they said and a controversy will erupt, etc, etc, etc.
---
This will go on and on with the Classic team profusely apologizing and explaining their need to use sharding because of lack of resources and then if Classic does well enough, we might see them get some dedicated funding for servers. Maybe.
---
You do know the un responsiveness of Vanilla was likely also due to internet connections. I don't know what you had, but I played on dial up at the time. Never saw my ping drop below 160. 
---
Ain’t gonna happen. Tweaking just one item in the game will open the floodgates and everyone’s gonna ask for small “tweaks”. 
---
I'm a newer player when it comes to classic (i statted in MoP but played my fair shsre of WotLK servers) and I'm going to be joining my friends when classic officially drops again.  I'm currently torn between Fury/Arms Warrior and Enhance Shaman on what to main as because I have a huge thing for two-handed weapons in games.  Shaman sounds very fun but at the same time I've been told that shamans are pretty worthless everywhere aside from Resto but Enhancement just looks soooo cool.  Then when it comes to warrior I'm torn because apparently they're super OP in vanilla and it's looking to be the most used class so that kinda turns me off cause I want to be kind of unique (weird I know).
---
So I guess my question here is: Which one of these specs would be best for smashing face with a Two-Hander while also being viable somewhere?  I mostly just wanna have fun but I know that I have to also consider how I'm going to be getting gear to begin with to enhance said fun.  I'm interested heavily in both pvp and pve and I'd probably go Orc (for sure going Horde).
---
Wall jumping will be possible to some extend but not the same way it was in classic. I don't think there's any way to recreate that, and I don't think it's a good thing either.
---
Moonwalking sure.
---
I’d say taking Anticipation over Toughness is another mistake. Unless you have no tank gear at all, you should take Toughness. 
---
Dual boxing is with two characters, not three.
---
No word at all from Blizzard regarding release date, other than "summer 2019".
---
Really proud of the classic team. Thank you for listening to the community, and for making the right decisions. We seriously love you. Cannot wait to relive the greatest game Ive ever played.
---
This is a really interesting decision. Obviously for Classic we can make the argument that it's just authentic, but Blizzard aren't just saying that - they're pointing out the advantages and the fun of this seemingly inferior system. They're not just implementing it, they're understanding it.
---
Live lags a lot. Live has a lot of sharding. As Blizzard points out, this system actually reduces strain on the server significantly, making for a more consistent experience that doesn't feel like its lagging, at the cost of responsiveness. Warcraft 2, 3, and Starcraft had this system, too, for the same reasons. 
---
I think this is a way to deal with a large concentration of players that Blizzard just kinda forgot about? Maybe it could be dynamically applied on live when the amount of players get very large.
---
Anyway, I'm just happy that they're implementing classic like classic. But somehow I'm even happier that they're digging up their old reasoning and arguments. They seem to be starting to understand World of Warcraft again. This can only be a good thing.
---
Anyone wanna bet the next expansion will be great because of what they learned making classic? xD
---
I remember levelling a warlock just before 7.3.5.
---
I just put corruption on every single mob I saw as I ran between quests, they mostly died before reaching me.
---
Imagining someone try this is classic is too funny 
---
Deep down, I'm hoping this awakens people to how satisfying the game can be without everything being handed to you.   
---
Big communities means more a-holes, but I'm not a fan of hoping they don't exist just because the player-base is small. 
---
Unlike the other recent poll this is class only. Doesn't include races etc
---
Because this is a recreation of Vanilla WoW. That is how combat worked in vanilla WoW.
---
My guild will be that guild you are speaking of. First line of our recruitment post reads like this:
---
*Are you from Norway or Sweden? 25 or older? Busy life? Family? Children? Work? Then this guild will be the perfect choice for you. A serious guild for grownups without any obligations.*
---
I thought you were planning on doing PvE. 
---
Man I get it. Hunter’s ability to delete people in PvP was one of the reasons I picked it up in Vanilla. Few things as satisfying as getting Ashjre’thul, full T1, and seeing a full rotation of crits leave an arrow ridden corpse in 3-4 seconds. 
---
It’s more of a keeping up with the joneses thing. It’s a good feeling to be excited about raiding and gear improvements. Running AQ40 is exciting for other physical DPS because of those shiny new weapons. For hunters it’s more of a “welp, this new Mh/Oh combo is cool, but man am I tired of seeing this same bow.”
---
But if you got HotW bear, you can tank raids too. 
---
Actually my brother in law was able to make it work in Wrath. Boiled down to the usual suspects. A slow hard hitting weapon, stacking haste/ap/armor pen, and timing shocks so they didn’t make your auto attack reset at the wrong time. He was able to do reasonably well DPS wise in ICC with it. 
---
Whether or not I’m able to get the same results in Vanilla will be both interesting and a good challenge. Though there is a possibility that it might just be to broken that early in the game. Like how Outlaw Rogue was just poorly designed in Legion. But I’d rather see if it’s a gearing issue vs a design issue first hand than assume it’s just garbage. 
---
I was thinking they could design it in a way we’re certain placed could be explored without making it a way to cheat. Except for the mentioned batteground exploit, I do not see other ways this was possible to cheat, more just wasting time :-)
---
woop woop
---
holy shit yes
---
lets make moonwalking the next big complaint.
---
come on, reddit. complaining is what we're good at. lets make moonwalking great again.
---
Vanilla raiding is far easier than you think. Raids like MC, Ony and even BWL are a complete joke. On private servers guilds speedrun these raids in sub 20 minutes. 
---
Raiding 12 hours a week will be nonexistent. The hardcore guilds will raid 4 hours a week and the casual guilds 7-8 hours a week. 
---
Fair point! Itemization is a knife edge. 
---
T3 is best for the class’ primary role.
---
Many people's most recent experiences come from overcrowded pservers where Tyr's Hand isn't viable because of the high population.
---
Friendship ended with Blizzard, now Blizzard is my best friend
---
Our lord who art in RP - PvP, hallowed be thy name. Thy realmdom come. Thy ICC be done, in game as it is in discord. Give us this day our weekly blue post, and forgive us our complaining, as we forgive those who argue changes with us, and lead us not into regular PvP realms, but deliver us from perma-OCC. 
---
Blizz Pls. 
---
Warrior.  Enhance is fun for some huge burst thanks to windfury RNG but its very poor in pve.  
---
No rational person wants no sharding on launch. It's an absolute clusterfuck disaster and is not fun for 99% of players.
---
I used to raid ZG, AQ20 and Molten Core with five Warlocks on a PTR four years ago. I even had to banish most adds on Garr, and keep them banished throughout the fight. Was extremely easy. I also did an insane amount of damage with Improved Shadow Bolt
---
Multiboxing has come a long way. And if the person behind them is decent, it's usually worth it
---
It is absolutely not confirmed
---
Oh yeah definitely know how that goes man. Outlaw Rogue and Survival Hunter in Legion are great examples of poor design that you just couldn’t overcome with gear and game play. 
---
I'd say the biggest unknown now is whether or not they'll implement cross-realm BGs. I know a few players who've said that could be a deal breaker.
---
I think you read it wrong.  Palidan isnt receiving buffs.  They have string buffs they can put on the raid.
---
You can play and enjoy the game as a tank. With your schedule and availability you will not be main tanking any raids realistically. Maybe you could be a 4 or 5 tank who grabs an extra add on trash packs. You can tank all the dungeons though!
---
Doesn't quite seem representative with Warlocks being so popular and Hunter one of the less popular.
---
Yay we get to go back to random unpredictable spell results.
---
that demon area was always filled with gold farmers
---
it was fun to go out there and corpse camp them
---
Nobody is demanding an empty server. He says he preferred a server with around 3k players.
---
This HAS to happen, because epic world pvp battles are a staple of Vanilla. They need to be able to support up to 200 players in an area without sharding or excessive lag.
---
I probably did interpret it wrong lol.
---
1.8 AV! Or just any Patch not 1.12
---
At this point thats the only thing left I can think of that is a shitter
---
The reason is that for late game tier lists, paladin = healer 
---
Pretty interesting that warlocks have more votes than mages and rogues.
---
Reppin shaman though
---
I mean, how they are handling modern WoW and how they completely ignore feedback from players, it's not that surprising for people to assume that
---
Yes, Rogue T3 is vastly better than the rogue pvp gear. The difference is really colossal. 
---
There will be two types of players in Classic. Players like myself who played Classic and eager to relive those old glory days and experience that community feel again. The second being players who didn't play Classic heard all those old war stories from the Vanilla guys and want to check it out. Once this second type of player realizes that leveling is a real experience, something that won't be done in a day or two by the average retail player. They'll get frustrated and move back to retail. TL;DR like any WoW xpac 30-60 day mark we'll see a decline in player base.
---
How
---
The no changes group is adamantly against it. I don't think they trust Activision/Blizzard to remove it once it's in place, or they think it'll leak into other areas like world boss locatinos citing a "slippery slope". From the last few blue posts we've received I think we can trust they have our best interest at heart though.
---
Damn, she pulls it off though! Unfortunately her black clothing against the black monitor means it's a little difficult to see what her waist and hips are doing during some parts of the choreography. Or maybe intentional to lessen the "hurr you have a butt" comments? 
---
I really wouldn't be too surprised if we didn't get a beta. I'm sure they'll have one of some sort, but it might be under NDA. We'll see! I think even if I got in a beta I might not play it and just wait for the real release
---
did you really reach all the way to the hyphen button to interrupt SMH. cool post tho #vanillahypegang
---
The dedication to authenticity is astounding!  Even if you don’t care about this (I don’t), it bodes well for everything else. 
---
And with dynamic respawns the same as on one pserver would happen. People would go to a cave (higher respawns), sit there with 50 characters (a guild who wants one guy to hit 60 within 2days will camp there) and spawn 40 harpies every 15seconds. 
---
Sharding really is the best measure.
---
The amount of players demanding changes seems to be increasing. Are the Retail players getting on the Classic hype train?
---
My faith is being restored with every Blue Post. Have a feeling they will work with the community on every issue now. 
---
They would save server costs because a shitload of people would stop playing then and there, decreasing the amount of servers you'd need.
---
Great explanation.
---
I should also point out that most commands in WoW take WAY less information to communicate to clients than a TCP/IP packet can contain, even at minimum. Batching this way means you can put more commands in each packet, reducing the amount of packets you need to send, which in turn massively improves the performance of the server, allowing more players to be in combat without causing lag.
---
So in addition to all the weird and fun spell interactions, we just got the massively in MMORPG back in WoW.
---
This is very exciting stuff.
---
Everyone thinks itll destroy their current guilds.
---
Half the guild will go alliance and the other half horde...
---
People will stop showing up to raid nights...
---
Lots of "sky is falling!" Shit
---
Why would it bother me? Well, all you have to do is read my first comment. It would pave way for more itemization changes. Why the hell would Blizz \*\*only\*\* touch Hunter raid gear to improve it slightly? Either a large-scale overhaul or nothing at all. People would be upset about them improving Hunters and leaving out other Classes that could use a boost in stats (Druids, let's say - as they're not the best healers in the game by a long shot.)
---
It's a funny oxymoron. We have people asking for changes to "enhance" their precious classic experience (as you worded it) instead of biting the rag and playing the game that everyone's been requesting for years. And no, they haven't been asking for Vanilla with improved Hunter gear just for the record, neither should Blizzard ever waste any useless development time looking into changing specific itemization.
---
You are right that it would be a major change to have. 5k cap. Even a Medium pop Vanilla server was very far from being a lonely experience, though.
---
Mate, you can believe whatever you want, and you can tell people whatever you want. But if you had even 1/4 of a brain and took the time to look at a talent calculator or understood the very basics of organized pvp you would see why you're wrong and incredibly dense. You're so vastly better served by taking 1 value point in imp hstring, then dropping the other 2 in almost anything.
---
Even improved charge, so you can instantly make contact -&gt; auto attack -&gt; sweeping strikes -&gt; zerker stance -&gt; whirlwind against groups of enemies like clustered healers, fc and his support, etc, the list goes on forever. 
---
Just blow your brains out already I'm tired of seeing my inbox icon light up.
---
1. If I had to go to solo PvE content I would usually throw on a sword. Once I got Perds and Vis'kag I just used Vis'kag outside of raids. Before I got Vis'kag i just kept the Perds equipped.
---
2. BRD pickpocketing was nerfed on the servers I played on, never tried it. I only solo farmed Mara for NR gear and that was cake with combat talents. Most of my gold came from Black Lotus and Live Strat farms with my guild.
---
3. This might change in Classic but for the pvt servers i played on it was only worth it to go for 310 for most specs. There was no real need for 315 skill because of pretty strong diminishing returns from 311-315. For dagger rogues though, it's not a big deal since it's so easy to get 315. Pre-raid, Muggers + Distracting vs. Muggers + Bonescraper is so small, I would just use Muggers + Distracting in case 311-315 is worth it in classic. I think the first time you might see a noticeable difference is when you're wearing Perd's/CHT vs. Perds/Distracting with Mugger's or ACLG equipped for both setups. Before that, it's not something to really worry about imo.
---
My understanding is that it is primarily an edge for the the very top of the pvp crowd who can use it to gain an edge in battles. I'm talking like the top dozen or so players on a server. The rest of us it will just provide some lulz like the double sheep example when it happens by accident. It also earns blizzard some brownie points with the no changes crowd.
---
I could copy/paste them from the wiki but I'm pretty sure [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ5kag-gTcM) is more accurate. It shows up in the first 10 seconds of the video.
---
It's an attempt from &lt;Elitist Jerks&gt; at killing Hakkar on the last reset before the TBC pre-patch. They've got ridiculous gear: most of them have full T3 and there is even an Atiesh in the Shaman POV's group. Fun fact also, the POV is Ion Hazzikostas'.
---
Bear in mind this poll will be floating around the communities that are prepping for Classic and know how great warlocks are / how not great hunters eventually are. The actual class distribution on servers probably won't look like this. 
---
I'm going literally insane waiting for this game
---
Correct. Again, having more dwarfs than 2 lets you fear ward rogues and stuff but its fairly minor compared to the benefits of it on the tank. 
---
But yea we really only strive to have at least 1 for BWL. But the issue is, there are tons of Nelf/humans. Our guild isn't super hardcore, and so we don't have as much allure to attract the hardcore dwarf priests I suppose. But still, it seems like ALOT of people roll human thinking someone else is going to be dwarf to make up for it. All of our human priests regret their race choice and will roll dwarf in Classic. That's all I can say. People say " pick your race for flavor and you won't regret it ". I have always agreed with this mentality. But frankly, these guys picked human for flavor, and they DO regret it. 
---
Crusader doesn’t even drop at tyres.  A common misconception.
---
Guess I’ll have to grind to respec. Pretty cancerous, but I don’t settle for sub-optimal play. Making the same change PServers do in regards to this would be incredible, but no changes spergs will make sure this doesn’t happen. 
---
Surely I'm going to wake up any moment from this beautiful dream.
---
i'm the same way man. falling through endless voids in video games has the same feeling as well for me. both have happened a lot when i dick around in the WoW alpha clients, i have to immediately alt+f4 whenever it happens. the empty surroundings paired with the ambience is so unnerving.
---
They are shouting sharding and right click reporting for the time being.
---
In a sense that is true yeah :)
---
It is my belief that most people who remain on classic will adapt to the norms of classic, regarsless if they have played it before.
---
"If this video is too long for your tastes, please check the timestamps in the description down below."  
---
MY GOD THIS MAN IS A GIFT
---
Right? Theyre actively asking for limited mechanics. This was a waste of resources to implement.
---
Thank you Blizzard!! Hype over 9000!!!!
---
You mean "because they have the source code."
---
So how would these two sets fair as a ret/prot hybrid that does BGs and Tanks?
---
Meanwhile every good idea to make the game better gets drowned out by people that want a clunkier game.
---
First time i played (bc)
---
first char, Undead Mage... boring at level 40
---
second char, Blood Elf rogue (got bored at 52 but finished after other alts made) 
---
third char, Blood Elf Hunter (45)
---
fourth char, Blood Elf Priest (33)
---
Finished Rogue finally. 
---
So yeah, it took me forever to get frickin 70. Wasn't even worth it because the world in outlands was dead from flying mounts.
---
I realized I loved the leveling experience in Kalimdor but not in Outlands... 
---
Seriously wtf
---
You could just play classic and get off the forums, but you knew this and decided to complain anyway.
---
What? I played on darksorrow, everyone spoke english there
---
Tight! Correct me if I’m wrong, but this was what allowed mages in BC to get both a frostbolt and icelance crit on frozen enemy’s, right?
---
This is great and all... but I just want a release date :(
---
At low levels you have no bags and almost no spells the quiver quest you get as horde at least is right in the beginning, so you'd end up replacing it fast anywho once you get your spells
---
There will be those rare few who have a light bulb moment and realize the difficulty, the grind, and the community is exactly what they always needed and didn't realize it.  They will be like neo waking up in the goo pod.
---
Not going to lie, I knew my computer wasn't going to be able to handle Silithus when we opened the gates (Arthas US) so just noped out of going entirely and it's one of my bigger regrets, like, ever. 4 other guildies and I went around to the crystals that spawned killing the boss elites and what have you and I can't wait to actually experience the gates opening. 
---
I agree completely, in fact we are creating a guild that caters just to this playstyle. Our firm belief is that we can clear ALL PVE content by just raiding twice a week, around 3 hrs each. We already have a bunch of committed people but are still open for more. We offer experienced raid leading (people cleared up to four horsemen in vanilla). This is for PVP server EU BTW, so hope you are in europe... : )
---
Pls join our discord [https://discord.gg/92V5CCD](https://discord.gg/92V5CCD) Guild name is Glamorama
---
I also find that raiding is really something that can give you so much in classic, cause people make time for it. I remember just wasting like 1.5hours waiting for an UBRS key, we could be halfway to Nefarion in that time. In short, if you are short on time in classic, raid instead of just play super causal
---
Does anyone know if this will help with large scale Wpvp lag that we see in BFA if the servers are hosted the same as retail wow? Thanks. 
---
A game the rewards you for being resourceful and coordinating alongside others?
---
I don't think will workout for the General Nihilist culture of today's young gamers.
---
This will definitely weed out the men from the boys.
---
Lol the no changers threw enough of a tantrum that we are returning to actively bad mechanics just for the nostalgia. Congrats.
---
I don't consider pservers to be Classic, and I wasn't complaining. Low effort.
---
Ive never seen esfand and kaivax in the same room, coincidence or something more?
---
To each our own, I actually like his face to face interactions and presentation. 
---
I'm not gonna combat that there's a lot of blind following towards wanting blizzlike things.  There's some merit to it, but spell batching was actually a pretty legitimate concern.  Spells and mechanics in Vanilla were balanced with the original spell batching system in mind.  If we had newer spell batching, it's not to say that it would be outright/objectively worse than what we had in vanilla, but it would certainly be non-authentic and much more unpredictable.  It could lead to unforeseen balancing problems.  This is *mostly* a PvP thing.
---
What characters are you going to pick? 
---
Uh, yes? One thing that comes to mind is Dragonslayer buff. The more alts a guild has, the more Ony/Nef heads you'll be able to pop for progression raids.
---
I think those who are too attached to their character will stay and try to salvage a dying game because they think "I worked so hard on all my max characters, I shouldn't just leave them now!" Which is why they still play the game because there is no other reason to play a boring game.
---
Those who are smart and decide to abandon all their worthless work will join us in a fun game that forces community interaction and theres very little that promotes simply grinding alone or raiding alone (like you do in modern wow, you raid alone, with pugs)
---
Turks speak English, but there definitely were a lot of them on darksorrow back in the day
---
Yeah I feel like people are over estimating how big of an issue that will be. 
---
it actually is in retail, a lot of people have been banned due to abuse of this
---
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX BUY GOLD ON WOW-GOLD.ME XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX CHEAPEST PRICES

What an affordable epic mount!
---
full blue pvp set is fine for both healing and ret. provided you have the appropriate stuff for other peices of gear and a good 2hander, Unstoppable force sounds like the best youll get if you just want to 5man
---
what is spell batching? i've heard it a lot but no one ever explained to me what it was
---
Tinfoil hat: its in family friends beta right now, which is why we are getting the pvp tweaks
---
Same thing
---
Elitists will make the game un-fun for any off specs. Thats how i feel about obsessive players like that.. 
---
And I want to be obsessive, I want to ring the gong on my warrior, I want to progressively raid and push my character to the strongest, but I really don't want to encourage others to maximize their dps and stuff when the game isn't even that hard till naxx.... 
---
Ah well, I don't know if theres anything that can be done about maximizing your specs. Kind of just have to if you want to raid.
---
Slightly off topic maybe, would I be better off grinding for gold and buying the T3 pieces from the AH or applying to serious raiding guilds and hoping to somehow get in? 
---
O one more thing! So the MT gets feared right and starts running in a random direction. OT picks up boss but he still has way less threat than the MT.So as soon as the MT fear breaks, Nefarian will turn towards the main tank. 
---
So what can happen, is the MT gets feared and runs into the raid group. Fear breaks and nefarian turns to MT and shadowflames the raid group. Wipe.
---
The raid group can duck for cover if the MT starts running towards them but this can happen very fast. 
---
Its just best if the MT never gets feared :).
---
Confirmed: https://twitter.com/CadenHouse/status/1111312259517550592
---
April 1st comes and its all been an elaborate april fools
---
I think blizzard realized that they have one foot in dog house right now. Between the poor reception of bfa and the diablo mobile announcement, blizzard knows they cannot mess up classic or it will serious mess with their bottom line.
---
What are you talking about? I started playing in September of 2005... I'm not sure when he started.
---
Doubt there will be a beta
---
I always figured the perceived "requirement" of consumables was very overblown (except maybe Elixir of the Mongoose), but even back then I heard it was especially bad for Naxxramas.
---
What is it in Naxxramas that makes people seem to think they're actually required instead of just nice to have like in the previous raids?  I can understand Greater Shadow Protection Potion for Loatheb and maybe Greater Frost Protection Potion for Sapphiron (though I figure the Frost Resistance gear would be enough), but what else is there that actually matters?
---
The only consumables I recall actually being serious were Major Health/Mana Potion, Elixir of the Mongoose, and Greater Fire/Shadow/Nature Protection Potion.  Heavy Runecloth Bandage and Major Healthstone are a given.  Flasks were big too, of course, but I hardly count them because they were almost completely unreasonable to have in Classic for anyone but maybe a couple tanks, healers, and Mage, and even then, all that was only for a few, select difficult fights.
---
nah, I had alternate keybinds for all the cool stuff.
---
like shift-r run, shift-w kick, alt-v vanish, etc.
---
Gonna be worth it for that stylin' Druid hat
---
Doubt it. Remember the population was like 2-3k? On pservers it is about 5x that and you still have enough places to grind.
---
Also there are still *tons* of things you can do to grind very good gold/hour that I haven't seen in a single guide or grinding list so far. Most of them are profession based but still.
---
&gt;well beyond the range of most basic shots to spot rogues before you can actually attack them
---
you are bad and think everyone is bad as you
---
people don't from the front
---
This was a huge thing back in Vanilla when new servers released and everyone would start over and race to 60 and try to get MC and BWL server firsts. Absolutely loved it. Always had a hard time with the raiding part since it was such a snooze and ended up just rerolling once new servers were back up again.

---
Potentially stupid question here, apologies...
---
If I stocked up on mats, like Leathers, would I see a decent amount of gold once economy stabilizes. Same for cloth, if I just horde thousands of Rune Cloth would I get a decent chunk back, or are you more referring to finished consumables like Elixirs and Potions opposed to mats.
---
I'm also assuming it's pointless to horde the lower level mats like Linen or Wool cloth?
---
YES, thats SO great!!
---
holy sht.
---
super excited :)
---
i'm so sick of all these stupid videos literally made for views, didn't know this guy would start to do them
---
His target is literally named Redxx lol
---
I'm so happy they are showing such high level of dedication and commitment! (also unarmored mounts please :) )
---
Why the hell would they not update right click reporting?
---
Stuff like UI or graphic *options* (like higher resolutions or view distance) are not part of "the game", they are simply there to match the capabilities of our machines.
---
Note that this is separate from the models etc who I can understand people want to keep unchanged. I like my cute triangular squirrels too.
---
Training was like 580 or something like that. I just barely squeaked that out and then the actual mount cost was like 100g wasn't it?
---
For those of you who don't understand, this will make the skillcap in PvP higher. Skilled and experienced players can now for example vanish your rockethelm, use skull of impending doom the same second a CC hits you, druids and warriors can charge eachothers charge to switch places (this would benefit the druid more) etc. It makes those split second decisions actually matter. Very nice! 
---
Things I never thought i'd hear blizzard say.... "We think it’ll be fun to see those sorts of things happening again."
---
Is there any reason why you think there wont be a beta? Legit question. Just want to know what people think.
---
they will level to 20 and quit
---
With "easily" you mean "barely". I would say you get around half of that on average depending on class/gear etc. If you count gold/hour you have to consider everything. The flight/travel, going back, selling stuff, putting things on the AH etc.
---
 If a warlock opens on a warrior with a raw seduce and he trinkets he deserves to lose 10/10
---
Yea sure, don't see the problem of being unable to gank the fucker that killed your twink because he's on another shard.
---
They already confirmed that cross server shards WONT exist if they decide to use them at all.
---
So tanking gear for paladins is weird. You kind of want to out-gear whatever instance you're tanking just so you'll be able to generate enough threat. Don't worry about stacking defense, 5 and 10 mans are doable with very little to no defense. You'll want to pick up plate (obviously) with high stamina, some intellect, and spell damage. Unfortunately this isn't a thing until T0.5 and T2. For a weapon, get a Sageblade crafted, run ZG for Bloodcaller, or hope a guild will give you a Mageblade from MC (probably not before the locks and mages get theirs), and enchant with +30 sp. You'll also want a few shields depending on the situation, a high I-lvl one for max mitigation, and either Crest of Retribution or Force Reactive Disk for better initial threat on the pull, and put shield spikes on them. Use grenades/dynamite (or even better the consumable Crystal Charge, no cast time) on cooldown for ranged pulling or just extra threat. Use Oil of Immolation for extra burst threat and always keep a wizard oil on your weapon. Have a warlock and/or druid in your party if you can, the extra reflect damage from Fire Shield and Thorns is great and I think they stack.
---
I dont agree, the pvp the system in classic is nothing like the modern one. Imagine grinding that r14 spot, and you get spamreported and cant rank for some time, this will not cost you the r14 spot, even if you are only banned for a small time.
---
Been waiting all week for this now weekly update.  I am not disappointed.
---
Nice.
---
I do think classic WoW struck a good balance between modern WoW and classic Everquest, though. 
---
Yep. I know people who will play classic *just* to play old school AV.
---
I know it has a shitton of problems, but fuck it. Give it to us.
---
Private severs may not be a good example due to dynamic respawns in herb nodes, but pre-DM, doing herb laps in felwood was averaging me 30-50g/hr (and that’s playing the minority faction where I was being killed a fair bit)
---
 TFW you realise you need to be Naxx-geared to look somewhat decent as a Shaman.
---
Nah
---
Definitely true, it's just that I am the dedicated healer of my friend group and I really dislike tanking so I can invest the point in cat damage 
---
did u need subtlety talents? did pp fail often?
---
Classic devs out here flexing on BFA devs
---
Simplest way I can think of is probably using a Dungeons &amp; Dragons, pen and paper analogy.  
---
In both WoW and D&amp;D you have players. In D&amp;D you have a Dungeon Master (DM) or Game Master, WoW equivalent would be their servers.
---
**D&amp;D pen and paper:** In a game of D&amp;D, the DM would ask you what you would like to do. You and another player in the game might both yell "CAST POLYMORPH". The DM has to decide who he heard first or if he heard both at the same time. A DM that is really paying attention might be able to distinguish which player said it first. A DM that might not have the same attention span probably just heard both at the same time.  
---
**WoW:** Blizzard servers are kinda like this DM. They're listening for you and other players. They process what they "hear" in batches (information in small segments). The modern servers listen intently and can "hear" many more batches a lot more frequently, the old servers were not as attentive so they only "heard" these batches every so often. This happens so fast it may seem real-time. Except it's not real-time. Since it's not in real-time, the Blizzard server (virtual DM here) has to decide what it does when it hears both players cast polymorph at the same time. It does this through priorities. It was explained to us that Classic will have spells as "low-priority" to simulate the way things were in Vanilla. That way, whenever the server hears "POLYMORPH" at the same time, they have the same priority so it goes ahead and says "Okay, you are both sheep now".
---
I hope this analogy helps.
---
Bro that den is BRUTAL, and gl trying to solo it
---
#justiceforkorrak
---
If abuse happens in a raid it's on the leaders of that raid.  And they are either A) idiots and people shouldnt go to their raids or B) scumbags and people shouldn't go to their raids
---
Perfect for me starting college
---
C’Thun’s really.
---
Well that's the point, that they'd be B, scumbags. But yeah, I think it's a minor issue overall and will self-correct.
---
hmm yeah I guess swaping weapons should be fine even on a dagger spec just for solo farm
---
Undead. The easiest race choice for me. (I’m making 3 toons, 1 a mage) I like the looks and animations of undead better AND they have the better pvp racial, and I care about pvp. It’s worth noting that wotf isn’t useless in raids either. I care about looks and pvp differences. PvE differences are so minor I don’t prioritize them at all.
---
Right click reporting plus no game masters means a battleground group can all right click report the enemy healer and get them instabanned and ruin the enemy group. It allows raid groups competing with each other for a world boss to instaban the opposing raid leader. 
---
For multiboxing?
---
True, though they have "addressed" sharding, we don't know the (potentially extremely disappointing) specifics. Server pop cap is another one that would only be a surprise if they make it massive. I think we all would wager Blizzard to make 2-4k pop caps atm. RP-PvP was addressed, but it seems undecided. 
---
I had a lot of trouble getting gold for mine originally so I ended up gift wrapping dozens of pick axes and sending them to a bunch of people COD mail for a few gold each. Most people were curious enough to pay the small fee and open it. I got banned a few weeks later. :(
---
Bans should never be automatic. That is different from automatically reporting. Focusing on the UI is the wrong way to do things.
---
Esfand confirmed Horcrux.
---
Because some of us want to play Vanilla again. This was part of vanilla. If you want to play WoW with modern spell batching you are free to do it in retail. It's not like you are forced to play games which gameplay mechanics you don't like.
---
Actually Eyes of the Beast is very useful if you're soloing instances as a hunter. You can run in as the pet, activate Dash and go deep inside the dungeon before dying, giving your hunter plenty of time to run further inside past where the packs stood without any fear of dying.
---
Sharding as described isn't a major issue as most people want it (temporary and restricted to starting zones)
---
This is definitely something that should be addressed, I saw a video of BFA (since I don't play it) where players were mass reporting opponents in BG's to get them disconnected via automated reviews of reports.
---
The AV Wolves were also faster than an epic mount for a while, my brother used to race people for gold. 
---
YAS same here!
---
Eating them is better.
---
And tastier.
---
When I was farming for my epic mount back then. I completed a whole bunch of Quests in Silithus and turned them in as soon as the Patch hit the live Servers, which changed the amount of Gold you got for Quest-XP. 
---
I made tons of Gold with that.
---
I think this was even Patch 1.10, if I remember correctly.
---
I think you needed axesmith for nightfall, but the sulfuron wasn't bound to a specialty
---
Not really
---
Found the undercover Russian. :P
---
About right click reporting.
---
In the current game if enough people right-click report you, you get squelched and cannot communicate until a game master checks out the situation. In retail this isn't such a huge problem because nobody communicated, but in vanilla it shuts you out of dungeons and group content completely.
---
Just a FYI on my understanding of the situation.
---
And the best part is every server has a story like this but it doesn't diminish at all, they are all such awesome stories. I can't wait for those again 
---
Happy cake day!
---
The blue wall didn't exist in vanilla. If you were clever enough to survive the fatigue damage you would eventually meet the edge of the map which your character would get stuck to if you touched it.
---
There was an exploration video back in vanilla of a troll shaman water walking out to the edge of the map from the hidden islands south of Tanaris however I can't find the video of it.
---
Never forget November 2018 when Asmongold told me I was crazy and this would never happen
---
https://twitter.com/og_haptix/status/1064924528671932416?s=21
---
I have pretty much one last thing im afraid, having the sharding.
---
If they come out and say, that they wont use sharding, I have absolutely nothing to complain about anymore.
---
"team #nochanges". So you mean just those of us who want to play the game known as vanilla wow? Right okay. 
---
Seems kind of silly to have 1.12 parity worldwide except for AV imo
---
Just want to mention that you don't need that many consumables for naxx or aq40. Its just private servers that want to be as efficient as possible. You can clear all of it without having raids that has every buff under the sun.
---
Yeah they should keep DHK so people can’t camp NPCs like quest turn ins or flight masters. 
---
Tyr's Hand has been mentioned quite a few times in the past two weeks.
---
Well someone downvoted my comment lol. It had the potential to be abused so bad. 
---
&gt; especially since they are using modern engines
---
The way they explained it makes it sound that the modern engine is able to support spell batching (low priority process) and they're basically just turning it on by making spells low priority processes.
---
...which is not something I expected. I would think that the way calculations are done is at the very core of the engine. I guess that just affirms that you can't make guesses about the code unless you've seen the code.
---
Except blizz has come out and said that isn't how it works. If that were the case nobody would be safe in retail. 
---
Tiered pieces aren't boe, even if they were would the raid lead give them to someone who would sell instead of use them?
---
I'd say the same for every language. It's enjoyable to know someone who tries their best to speak English and get along, even if they aren't the best at it.   
---
They've monitored how private servers play out for ages
---
Was it in 1.12? It should be in classic.
---
I like it, I think it's true to the spirit of vanilla - you have a choice, and that choice has consequences. Wanna be an **honorable** combatant and rank up? Don't kill civvies. Wanna be **dishonorable** and kill civvis? You're not gonna get far in the faction's military. Some folks want the best of all worlds and that's not vanilla in my eyes.
---
From the point of view of the end user there is ZERO difference between a dedicated and cloud server.
---
This right here is *exactly* what I am talking about. You went 4 comments deep in a chain that starts with someone having a different opinion just to say that people aren't allowed to have an opinion. 
---
Trolls are just so damn cool! But I do like the UD racials...
---
It kinda is tho. Blizzard doesn't have some magical technical knowledge (whoever wrote that code is definitely gone), they have source code. 
---
Maybe you had better gear (I was in some rank 7 gear + pig stick), but I remember getting stomped as Ret in Vanilla BGs.
---
I think most who are interested in it will have some idea of what to expect. I think these will like it and stay.
---
Retailers who are not interested don’t care and will just continue to play Retail.
---
I had the same exact experience as you back then, and I'm more or less in the same boat as you where I don't think I want to dedicate nearly as much time, nor do I expect I should have to.
---
And I don't say that with any sense of entitlement, just saying, you know, Classic wasn't really that hard, but the players made it hard back then.
---
Why not make them unkillable/untargetable?
---
warstomp doesn't cost rage, watt?
---
Screw Chinese farmers but I love the little economic nuances like these
---
No subtely needed, rarely failed and if it happened the mobs are low lv enough so you can burst them down or just vanish.
---
Herbalism gives a couple of extra gold but is not required. Most of the money will come from picketpocking.
---
If you like to PvP, you should definitely go Undead.
---
If you don't like to PvP, you should probably still go Undead.
---
I don't know how else to put it.
---
Ouch. That sounds painful
---
&gt; I sure do hope they are gonna play WoW on a PC from 2004 with a 640x480 resolution.
---
Look at this pleb over here, can't even 1024x768
---
\#nochanges
---
Right click reporting NEVER results in an instant ban on live realms. At worst you get squelched from public channels like /1 or /2, but you'd be able to play and talk in party chat. 
---
Mm, I'm pretty sure I remember rolling around in tanks in Wrath. 
---
Again though when you are in a raid and someone kills a civilian everyone gets that dhk.
---
Don't think this actually existed in vanilla, and if it did, it's so, so far down my list of priorities about what made vanilla great, I really don't mind if they get around to this or not. :p
---
But I do remember them.
---
It squelches you from the public channels. You can talk in guild chat or party chat. 
---
Oh come on, they always said they didn't have it! 
---
Can someone explain to me WHY this is important?   
---
I get that this shows their commitment to making Classic truly authentic. But why is the old spell batching important to the community? What's the importance of double polymorph or charge/poly going off at the same time? Why not have it where it can detect what happened "first"? I've seen good arguments on Loot-Trading and debuff caps, but I would like to know the significance of this particular change outside of nostalgia or authentic recreation. Please and thank you!
---
so the feature isn't a problem, exploiting the problem gets you banned.
---
link/source? rppvp was added in 1.8, no?
---
Speaking on the behalf of both Alliance and Horde players: Do not create anymore gnomes.
---
Stop making me feel so safe blizzard!
---
&gt;  or just vanish.
---
probably only 1 time per run
---
I was watching a video and this guy got resisted 3 times the same run lol
---
can't gank in lowbie zones anyways.
---
&gt; 10+ years after classic, we have a generation that are so consumed and content with the current way of games it makes me wonder how they will react to classic Wow and if they will have a negative impact on the community. 
---
I'm not going to sit in a glass house throwing rocks, when this sub has been very toxic for the past couple of weeks.
---
Dont soul shards disappear when you logout for like 24 hours or something?
---
Ok now thats just god damn funny, now to wait 10 years to use it and fumble and fuck it up...
---
Sounds pretty neat! Is it ok if I pm you some questions regarding the guild? Oh btw, most important - are u glorious Alliance or hut-dwellers??
---
Either way you are probably correct in that casual 60 PUGing is probably more of a timesink THAN raiding. Never really thought of it like that tho
---
It doesn't? Shit it did when I played on Nostalrius, but it definitely could've been changed since then. Does it still reset your swing timer - I know this is something that private servers have been going back and forth on as well, since some code offensive spell casts as resetting swing timer, and some don't. 
---
Then they would have to cherrypick all the NPCs it was easier from a development standpoint to blanket it as a negative thing. 
---
Seeing those Quel Serrars always makes me want to play warrior again on release. I have to keep saying no because there will be more than enough. Also because I want to try out Warlock.
---
But damn the nostalgia around that damn weapon.
---
I suppose it would get unwieldy, as other classes would want the break down too, but I always wonder how many of the warrior voters are intending to tank, and how many are planning to dps. They’re often top or near top on these polls, yet their roles could be vastly different.
---
THE MADMEN THEY ACTUALLY DID IT 
---
It matters for hardcode pvpers. It changes the dynamic of 1v1 fights and good players can plan with batching in mind (I don't know the details)
---
So basically, we will all look like dorks.
---
Beautiful.
---
Another added benefit is this will make PvE content slightly harder too.
---
Clearly you don’t remember everything perfectly or you’d remember why it was introduced in the first place. What part of killing low level NPCs, quest givers and others, do you consider **Player vs Player**? 
---
Blizzard added it to discourage intentional griefing.
---
Blame the asshats that forced blizzard to make that decision.
---
Deep Feral druid. One of least represented class but is also viable in both PVE raiding and PVP if your really good and know what your doing.
---
As a rogue. I like to play Seal Fate build. It offers good play ability in pvp and pve. It's also hella fun.
---
&gt; I believe that dishonorable kills should be removed from classic WoW, because it was the the inevitable death of World PvP 
---
This is just not true. DHKs have a self-correcting mechanism built-in. Is someone killing Civilians? They'll get kicked and never invited back. And in any case, if you're joining pug PvP raids inside enemy faction hubs, you're taking a risc. Just only join PvP groups/raids that have people who are careful not to kill Civilians.
---
Simply just changing the game to avoid something inconvenient which can be remedied by playing smart is *Quality of Life.*
---
No it doesn't. What is this fear-mongering bullshit?
---
Not everyone will be grinding PvP gear, and some people will reach their goal and not care. 
---
On top of that, even if they do care, they can join SS vs TM outside of a group and simply stay away from the towns. 
---
There's plenty of ways around it, even if it's still not worth risking if you're going for rank 10+.
---
I havnt seen complaints since November, now it's back to safe little art projects and cosplay with comments about everything but the DD titties popping out of "Armor".               
---
Cant wait for Classic when everyones tripping over themselves to flirt with a 300lb sea cow with a hot voice.
---
Not gonna wait 3-4 months for my epic mount.
---
I expected to click the link and see "We REALLY wanted to implement this but it was just too much work."
---
Classic team is actually incredible wtf
---
&gt; magical technical knowledge
---
No, they have the source code. PTR only have some of it.
---
Either if the person that wrote that code is gone, they can *easily* understand it
---
Then don't watch them.
---
Some people like idle white noise about a game we enjoy, and these are fine for that.
---
Can thank the "warlocks are le best" post from yesterday
---
I've been playing old school RuneScape for most of it's duration, and it has a lot of comparisons to wow classic.
---
At first the numbers were low, but as the main game got shittier, osrs got bigger to the point where it has 3-4 times more people than the main game, despite being more challenging.
---
I'd expect most players will try out classic since it doesn't cost anything more. Some will stick, some will bounce between both when either gets new content, and some won't like it. 
---
For the sake of authenticity and anyone who PvPs regularly. Good players can make use of it, average ones might get a lucky timing here and there. A casual example would be a paladin trying to interrupt a warlocks fear with hammer of justice as they have no class kick ability. If he uses HoJ too late on the cast, the warlock will be stunned but his fear will still go through and render the paladins stun useless if he has no counter to it, because the fear usually lasts longer than the stun. We are really talking about milliseconds here, though.
---
Wait, this doesn't happen as much in live? I interrupt NPC spells all the time that still go off.
---
I haven't been on them recently, but apparently the mods delete anything that's even slightly controversial. 
---
There is no part of killing civilians that is PvP. That’s not what I was arguing for. But I like to world pvp and while in a raid ANYONE that kills a civilian gives 40 people a dhk for that regardless of wether you are fighting npcs or not.
---
that last one is actually cute lol!
---
I'm honestly scared. If anyone was around when old school runescape was spoken about and going live. They also said that it would be the true experience, ship it how it was. Only a little afterwards people started asking for content like GWD which was a few months after the time OSRS was supposed to be in. After that we got little updates, just fixing some bugs. Then came quality of life updates. Finally the started adding CUSTOM content that wasn't in the original game. All of this because of the players got bored. But I guess it was all fine because the devs had the players vote for it. But you could bet your ass on it that the majority of the updates went through because the people who want the game in its purest, original form, are the minority.
---
Wonder if it's gonna be the same with Vanilla.
---
How do you explain these clips? 
---
https://youtu.be/9SbjASLwA34?t=222
---
(The overall video is hyperbole but the point stands that if this isn't properly implemented it will be abusable). 
---
Dishonorable Kills were released at the same time as Battlegrounds.
---
It makes more sense that BGs killed World PvP than DHKs.
---
No it wouldn’t civilians are all classified as just that. It would be VERY easy to make them unkillable.
---
I honestly couldn't care less about spell batching. But I guess it's nice for authenticity, but somewhat dangerous as they can start re-introducing actual bugs that were not good for the game.
---
But anyway, thumbs up for Blizzard.
---
By about 66.6% (repeating of course) I'd say.
---
Undead would know
---
I enjoy uniqueness.
---
Totalhalibut was a Troll Mage RIP so I'd roll troll in his honor.
---
Troll obviously, they have the coolest accent and the best mount.
---
&gt; There is no part of killing civilians that is PvP. 
---
It's to discourage **griefing**
---
It’s so hard to believe this is the same company responsible for modern wow. 
---
Somethings... not quite right. But also so right at the same time. 
---
I really wish they’d do the same for modern wow and massively improve it. 
---
But wouldn't hardcore PvPers prefer the "true-er" experience that flows better? One that responds better to their inputs? I'm not sure how this old way is better than the old way. With debuff caps I understand how bosses and raids are affected. With loot trading I understand how that would affect group dynamics. All of these deviating from a core ideology of Classic. This one I just can't seem to fit.
---
A White Knight AND a simpleton. GG
---
The Goblins in STV are amazing to grind as a meele.
---
Very low armor. Got my first epic there.
---
Ooh. They must be having a lot of fun figuring out how to "break" systems.
---
Yea I just cracked out a build and came to 30/16/5. Trying to maximize crit and over all damage w/ backstab is what I did back in vanilla and I was always in the top 5 (usually at 1 or 2) of the damage meters in PvE (up to Princess H in AQ40) and typically was among the top kills for BG's (I did have an admittedly high death rate tho, rogues were squishy and if my vanish was on CD I didn't have a preparation to fall back on, was basically dead in the water). 
---
A change that happened after the honor system was introduced, to help complaining players. aka quality of life for the people that made the most noise.
---
Incredible, they're addressing our biggest concerns one by one. Just need the final word on sharding and server load next. 
---
&gt; No rational person wants no sharding on launch.
---
I want sharding on launch. Don't go around making global claims. 
---
You can play the game without BiS. As for tanking endgame, the issue is more about your class kit than gear.
---
Other posters are likely more knowledgeable about actual paladin tank gearing, but from what I recall, it's a battle between having mana and being crit. Seems like a pain to me, but if you're dedicated then you'll find a way (at least casually.)
---
They're softening us up to tell us they haven't changed their minds about sharding for the first couple weeks.  
---
Thats not how TM vs. SS worked though, everyone always pushed the other towns. Hence TM vs SS. not field vs field.
---
To be fair, everything looks badass with benediction. We all have wet dreams to that bad boy.
---
Thanks for your time btw., I appreciate the effort. I'll definitely think hard about what I'll actually do in a few months. Best of luck to you! 
---
I can’t really say or recall to be honest, all I remember was that we concluded that we never managed to kill 4H because of gear requirements (specifically healing output and tanks). I also have good memory of usually barely scraping by on most bosses in naxx even though we had mostly AQ40/BWL gear
---
I played on classic private servers. Community seemed to be there again. Don’t worry too much about it. The ones that want to be a part of a community will play classic. The modern wow attracts a different demographic. 
---
Considering most dungeon groups while leveling are made through trade chat?  I can see being squelched having a pretty big impact on play.
---
Depends on what your focus will be. If you plan to PVP engineering is pretty much a no-brainer.  So so so much PVP utility from engi items. Mining is a common profession taken up to directly support engi.
---
If you plan on focusing PVE at endgame, I would suggest herbalism and alchemy. No matter what spec you are in PVE you (and others) will always need consumables, so the two professions can save (and make) you a lot of gold.
---
These are endgame specs, mind you. For leveling regardless of class I would recommend skinning and \[pick one\] enchant (for disenchant ONLY)/herb/mining for moneymaking purposes before endgame content.
---
The entire point of this video is to help people, why does that anger you?  
---
Just out of curiosity, are you getting out your old monitors and downgrading your internet connection too?
---
It was NOT released at the same time as the PvP system. 
---
Or, and this is a crazy concept but bear with me, there are gameplay &amp; other mechanics he doesn't like in retail wow and thus doesn't play that game.
---
So you're telling him to force himself to play a game with gameplay mechanics he doesn't like in order to experience a mechanic that he does like.
---
Great idea.
---
In theory, it should. Should help to reduce all the packet being sent to the server and back. Hopefully it makes SS/Tarren Mill great again
---
What is a lowbie zone for you? I think every Zone after lvl 15-20 is contested.
---
Do You consider redridge a lowbie zone?
---
If you're serious about retaining your rank, you're not gonna be in a raid full of people who are killing civilians. People are well aware of how the system works and can easily avoid it.
---
Oh, wasn't aware of that. If whispers arent squelched then I don't see that big of a problem with it.
---
The modern community has been conditioned to think that they have "been there, done that" and they feel entitled to receive all the conveniences of modern WoW. The modern game does not promote grouping or community unless there is almost no effort put forth to do so.
---
Classic will be too much for 99% of Cata/Mop/WoD/Legion/BfA babies. The ones who stick around for more than a day will have to realize the different type of game they are now playing. I forget the exact words of that NPC shoveling dirt piles in Thunder Bluff - something about if you "pack the gear to serve in my beloved Horde" or something reminiscent of the Full Metal Jacket quote.
---
It being such a small thing is why this feels so good, and it actually shows the classic team is really taking the task serious and has restored a lot of confidence in Blizzard, at least for me.
---
Wow just wow
---
How hard is it to mine in Vanilla? Is it difficult to keep up with your level? 
---
I’ve said it many times. As a hunter I embrace the existence of huntards because they make me look good just for not fucking up :D
---
Good thing happens -&gt; "blizzard good"
---
Bad thing happens -&gt; "activision bad"

As is tradition
---
Itemization, as I understand they will only remove items that were added with 1.10 but not nerf the items that got patched with 1.10
---
Doesnt make it less true, if a better game exists but requires a lot of dedication but feels more rewarding why waste time with that once a night raid log in? So you can upgrade your ilvl a tiny bit or get the Azerorite trait you need to do 3% more DPS?               
---
               
---
I dont think Classic will kill retail WoW but to think there wont be a massive impact is way more naive than people screaming doomsday
---
He's not saying the opinion can't be had, he's trying to convey why it makes sense. This is a discussion forum to have discussions. Differing opinions are more than allowed. It sounds like you want an echo chamber of your own to validate your own opinions.
---
Right thats what I said, people avoided world pvp entirely to a system that was added later in vanilla. A big part of vanilla was World PvP and you are saying just avoid it. 
---
Seconding this, hook our redditor brothas up!
---
The two are not mutually exclusive.
---
I doubt raids will be upset if you dont have mana tide for farm raids. I plan on being full resto on progression, and once on farm stick with the ele/resto.
---
Thank god. I had been arguing this since the blizzcon demo and it did not even seem to be a popular argument. Many people were celebrating the modern latency system as if it was an objective improvement from the archaic vanilla system. And while it is true that the modern latency makes the game more responsive, it would have significantly changed how pvp works which defeats the purpose of replicating vanilla.
---
Small suggestion I’d make a table for alliance and one for horde - using like a pivot table or something. Just forget the key legend that you have. Tho I like the E and the K, but the A and H are just not pleasing to look at. Other than that thanks for this site if you made. It hit my gaming g spot if you feel me. 
---
From a cesspool guild to raiding max naxx
---
Godspeed to you sir
---
For a few MONTHS?? Damn. I was thinking a couple days at most, and even then I'm not supportive of it.
---
Something I'm seeing mentioned here is that actual crafting professions like Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, Tailoring will actually have a use and potential profitability early on. Gear can be hard to come by especially in raids, 2-3 items per boss for a 40 man raid. So crafting gear will have more of an opportunity to flourish then say retail version or its past xpacs. Tankings will need Fire Resist gear for Rag, most dps Warriors will hunt Blacksmiths down for LionHeart Helm &amp; Titanic Leggings. Same goes for Leathworking with several cloaks and Tailors for bags, chest slot items.
---
This may actually reduce lag in large scale battles. Isn't that a good thing?
---
Yeah I also get a strong feeling that those things aren’t representative of how it will be for most guilds in Classic
---
This isn’t retail 
---
Do you have problems understanding what you read? I literally said he is not forced to play game he don't like. That works for both retail and Classic. Don't play games you don't like. Simple as that.
---
Idk, I'm on the fence about this kind of stuff. Dont we want to see processing improvements that actually make the gameplay smoother and less frustrating?
---
Full understanding on a technical level is by definition even better than having the source code.
---
Yeah, but that was possible before as well. The difference now is that there's even a tiny time window where you can vanish the frostbolt even though it technically landed on you already. We'll see if it's going to be consistent. I think whatever cast goes off later in the batch, wins. Just like vanish blind but also blind vanish exists.
---
If your a casual wanting to tank as a paladin your in for a bad time just because most groups would rather wait for a warrior. Now that’s not to say you can’t tank but good luck finding a group that will take you. 
---
I've watched just about all of Asmongold's videos on the subject of Guilds and there is a lot of stuff I should of been implementing before. But truthfully, I'd like to just make my toon raid worthy and see how it's done. 
---
I’d blame locks having an all around fun bag of tools and are a pet class for leveling.  No idea what thread your referencing.  
---
Are you for re-creating Classic or not?
---
I have a feeling that all those clips are put together in such a way to avoid showing the reason they were banned. It's not as simple as a robot seeing 10 people report someone and they get instabanned
---
Blue wall was wrath-mop I think. Wod-&gt;current has sticky invisible walls. Which are basically invisible bounding boxes instead of walls.
---
Now they need to make sure player hit boxes are their original size. 
---
Bring back client side strafing (remember being able to reset a boss through the gait?)
---
Bring back forced mob hit box overlap retreat etc
---
10/10, for the first time im actually 100% happy with their decision.
---
Personally I'll never understand why a lack of precision in a PVP setting is a good thing. I want the player with the better reaction time to be rewarded. Would much rather see accurate event timing first with game mechanics being added after that to produce a high skill cap.
---
More SW:D, less phantom pummeling.
---
But you'll never be removed from a group like the OP thinks. Your whole dungeon group could right click report you as a joke and youd be fine to use party or instance chat. 
---
RPvP is the big one for me. I get it's a minority issue, but it's a big deal within that minority, and I think there are a lot more of us than the folks at Blizzard realize.
---
That said, the fact they're listening and reacting so well to community feedback on other issues gives me hope they'll reverse course on that one. I'm just going to keep (respectfully) trying to make my voice heard and upvoting others doing the same in the interim.
---
What if this makes it so large scale PvP battles are more stable? Less packets being sent can make a big difference. I'm not 100% sure if it will help, but I hope it does.   
---
I personally want it to be like what it was back then, warts and all. I really enjoyed the game back then and it gradually got less fun for me as time and expansions went on. I don't know why you get so upset about this. If they said they were going with modern batching, I'd shrug my shoulders and move on.
---
That's true
---
Re-read it you goober lol

Same, love the Druid versatility. Had a Field Marshall level Druid back in the original WoW PvP days. 
---
On PvE side, bear tanked and feral DPS’d many dungeons and healed on occasion.
---
No. And I absolutely don't think it'll be sharded.
---
Fine. I don't expect anything above 10 to be sharded.
---
Yes because in this case your opinion is not needed. The purpose of this project is to deliver an authentic vanilla experience. You can give your opinion that you want transmog, but Blizzard and the community don’t care.
---
Absolutely. But I really liked the world and community and how everyone interacted a lot more in the pre 1.5., which kind of killed max level interaction in the overworld.
---
No you told him to go back to retail, which is the lamest comeback on this sub.
---
The perfect game doesn't exist. You're gatekeeping him telling him he shouldn't play vanilla because he disagrees with a single aspect of it. Maybe he likes the rest of vanilla quite a lot and can't get that experience from another game? It's not "simple."
---
It's fucking 15 dollars a month. What are you doing so much that you can't play *or* afford the sub?
---
Avoiding the #nochanges joke, I think $15 is very fair. It costs more to go out to a movie for an hour and a half.
---
I'm in the same vein. I want the RPvP servers at launch- but again, I'm just wondering what are the big issues that haven't been mentioned at all yet-
---
My opinion... who cares about PvE racials? Berserking isn't really going to make a big difference. Vanilla content is pretty easy. Bring some extra consumables or something. Undead for life. Or just play whatever you like the look of.
---
Did you not see the presentation where they talk about where they actually ended up finding a cold-storage back-up copy?
---
it looks tempting to move 1% sword to finish off dirtydeeds
---
Well, here we go - back to MoP arena time with all kinds of batching related exploits, Fire blast kicks and almost 100% offensive spell vanishes.
---
Join or form a guild comprising of mostly level 60 players who are interested in raiding. Sure, take social people too if you want but create a seperate teir of member called raider. Learn about MC and other teir 1 raids via videos and reading. Perhaps some of your guild will know the fights. Figure out the needed composition and form a raid. And go see what you can kill. You won't be able to walk into Naxx and get gear. You will have to progress through the lower raids and gear up your 40+ raiders. MC/ZG/AQ20/Onyxia - BWL - AQ40 - Naxx. 
---
I hope they haven't. I don't want a dead server after the tourists leave.
---
I keep going back and forth. 
---
I've nailed it down to priest or shaman, I look forward to healing in the end game and slowly progressing my gear. But deciding between the two is tough. I'm also not even sure what faction I want, so the decision is partially based on that, but if I go horde I'm not sure whether I'll go shaman or priest even.
---
Any help is appreciated. :)
---
Two things I see/interpret in this post.
---
1. No one is going to ding 60 and two minutes later get a raid invite for naxx40.  The whole thing is a progressive climb.  If the server/guild/whoever is progressed enough, you **might** be able to start in BWL. You still need to build the gear from BWL/AQ40 before you should ever step foot inside.
---
2. Naxx40 is a hell of a commitment. You need a good roster, people willing to wipe over and over to learn the fights and not get discouraged.  You need a consistent roster, people that have learned the fights as well as getting those people the gear they need to progress appropriately.  Consumables, Consumables, Consumables, Consumables, Consumables...
---
Actually some of the respawns are pretty high on pservers.
---
So does that mean /sit reckoning macros will work?
---
Pretty much. I am cool with dying though. Normally I would play a warrior as personality wise they fit me like a glove. Being a 6'3 wild eyed Irishman is my real life. Moving it into the game is fun as hell. That being said I already feel like I have mastered warrior as I have a shit ton of experience. So I wanna try something new. Something I am god awful at.
---
Well for me thats Rogue. Going from playing a Orc warrior named Gorebelly who refers to himself in the third person. To a sneaky rogue will prove interesting for me. Being the first bro in screaming with wild abandon as I hack my foes to pieces is my bread and butter. Not sure how I am going to handle patience lol. My brother thinks not well lol.
---
Theyre talking about sit critting triggering things it shouldnt in classic.  Sit critting was always a thing, it triggering things it shouldn’t was patched out.
---
Even better, they have documentation.
---
I'll believe it when I see it. Or after clarification from Blizzard for that matter, since they've been purposefully vague about the subject.
---
Do you lie all of the time or just today?
---
Alternatively are you misinformed?
---
&gt; It was NOT released at the same time as the PvP system.
---
That's not what I said, is it?
---
The PvP Honor system was released with patch 1.4. Battlegrounds and DHKs were released 2 months later with patch 1.5.
---
DHKs remained in the game until TBC, meaning that DHKs were part of the game during 90% of the time there was an honor system.
---
15$ a month hahahaha 
---
$15/mo... I suppose the regular discounts for 6 month subs or whatever.
---
These days, a movie costs $15ish for 2 hours of entertainment. Is 5-7 hours of WoW unfair somehow? Frankly I can afford it better now with my regular career l, despite the added living costs, than I could 15 years ago. $15 is a bit less beer, or not ordering the fancy meal when I’m out, or something of that nature.
---
1/99
---
With magnificent scaling
---
&gt;5-7 hours a week, which is not enough time to justify the full cost sub.
---
That's 25 hours a month, or $0.60 per hour. That's cheap AF.
---
By definition, the term *elitist* describes a minority. Not to say that that in itself is enough to dismiss the argument, but I have a lot of doubt that it is going to be an issue, especially for people leveling up. 
---
Nice! Can you explain to me why spell batching is important to the Classic community? I'm having a hard time figuring this one out. Is it just for nostalgia reasons?
---
This is one of those big things that people don't bring up all that much. I love that they went for authenticity here. Bring on the double  fears, stuns, and polys.
---
Play the lock it’s got a further if you ever decide to be not casual. As for myself I’m going troll warrior. Leveling arms/fury going deep prot at 60. I plan to do herbalism and skinning while leveling. Eventually the character will have alchemy and engineering but that will be later after farming for an epic mount. 
---
I believe it's from this item: https://classicdb.ch/?item=9492
---
Obviously not necessary, I've seen plenty of videos of druids farming this stuff.
---
Druids can also solo any melee elite even a few levels above them with Entangling Roots spam + Balance spells.
---
Totally agreed. DHKs were a terrible decision honestly. 
---
Alright ill drop the sarcasm and tell you 3 helpful things.
---
1. After watching the latest allcraft that featured preach i cant respect asmongolds decisions on making a good guild given how loot hungry he is and id take everything he said with a MASSIVE grain of salt. No disrespect if hes your favourite wow personailty.
---
2. Raiding naxx takes A LOT of pre raid preparation. Aka. Time. if you dont have time you will be hard pressed to clear naxx, you simply need consumables. Loatheb is 1 fight alone and its 50g in protection potions PER PULL not including your regular consumes.
---
3. Being a GM in vanilla is such logistical nightmare. I wouldnt wish it on anyone, its like herding feral cats. I would say join a guild. Dont make one.
---
I would guess that the lack of this optimization was massively compensated by the increase of connectivity quality and the server's performance.
---
Which part of "if you want" or "you are free to" in my post seemed that i told him to go back to retail? Still having problems understanding? Giving an option != Forcing someone to do it.
---
Until it drifted off topic that is. Anyways, not to be rude, but I really could not be bothered to talk more about it. If you say you know what you're doing in terms of gold management, then I'm sure you do!
---
People don’t avoid PvP.  They avoid ransacking towns with strangers.  
---
You will also have to do a lot of convincing trying to tank as a pally in 5 mans. The meme specs are certainly going to be in for a bad time just because of public perception. 
---
Think about how long it took them to make Classic and how there isn't even a Beta yet, classic servers have had a decade and have definitely made huge strides. I don't think Blizzard will get everything right, and believe me I want everything to be right. 
---
It's kind of bizarre considering the fact that during Burning Crusade (I think, it might've been WOTLK?) he ran a guild called "Arcanist's Belt" where they leveled to 60 and stayed there, gearing in vanilla dungeons and such to run vanilla raids. He was a part of the very first and earliest classic movements. 
---
Troll.
---
Easy
---
the same applies to loot trading, no?
---
Not sure where you're getting at with this argument.  You can't just blindly push a feature without acknowledging that it can be exploited.  That's like product design 101.
---
Look, I hope to God that this is the case. I'm just trying to be realistic with Blizzard's track record. 
---
I've heard about spell batching in my time here but I had no idea what it was until reading this post. I doubt it would have had much impact on my experience in-game regardless, but it's encouraging to see Blizz continuing to listen and react positively to community feedback like this.
---
Now if we can just get a course correction on RPvP servers I'll be happy as a pig in... "mud."
---
April 1st comes and its ~~all been an elaborate april fools
---
~~ only on mobile
---
Nope, that is how it worked. Enough reports within a certain time frame and you are automatically kicked from the server.

Fully agreed!
---
Anticipation is a very expensive talent per point. For example Deflection (Parry) give you about 8-9 times higher avoidance per point than Anticipation.
---
Toughness give you something less than 2% mitigation per point. It scales with gear even. I wonder what a good rule of thumb is to estimate the value here. I assume it is closer to 2% than to 1% per point.
---
yea but he is correct in you can't help collateral damage. T
---
hey could have just made these things immune to damage
---
You mentioned in another comment about a solution I thought was pretty good, unkillable NPCs, but I believe there is 0% chance they will ever add anything like that into classic.
---
They use sharding so we can get a good experience in the start. It's not a bad thing, just people missunderstand it. I hope you realize that without sharding the average guy will get 1 mob per 20 mins, i made calculation regaridng this (assuming you are in trials of valley on a 5k pop server), if its 2.5k server then its 10 mins etc. But 10 mins per kill even if we count that, lvl 1 is 400 exp and u get 50 per mob. That's 8 kills. So that's 80 mins from level 1&gt;2. At that point u need to explore to get exp. Also this isn't counting some classes wouldnt be able to get aggro while others can (like rogue, has instant, vs warrior not, so rogue gets way more tags)
---
Sharding IS NEEDED since we do not have dynamic respawn like private servers has. It's not a 7 sec respawn time like private servers had, it's a 5 min respawn.
---
Sharding they said WILL ONLY BE USED IN STARTING ZONES FOR A LIMITED TIME and that makes completely sense when u consider these facts. 
---
if you want something else other then sharding (like dynamic respawn, small servers that gets merged etc. Feel free to talk about that)
---
But really, even if u dont mind spending 12-36 hours(depending on server size) instead of 3-6  to get level 12, other people that try the game again/retail players etc does mind. It's a bad first impression and that is not something blizzard wanna give which is oboius why. 
---
So ask yourself the question again, is sharding really that terrible if they keep their promises of only having it in the starting zones for a limited time?
---
I think you mean team #nochangesfrommyfavoriteprivateserver and team #blizzardiswrongvanillaisactuallylikemyfavoriteprivateserver
---
Training was 1000g and mount cost was 100g for epic riding/mount.
---
From the way it's worded, it's less a rollback to 1.12, and more of a conscious decision to make the spells low-priority to the server's hierarchy and thus have the server process them all at once at predetermined intervals. Doesn't seem likely that would introduce and old bugs, if any at all.
---
Thanks! I expect the gear competition to be pretty high for warlocks too tbh, horde side at least.
---
Actually it seems like the easiest to gear from pve for pvp would be the ele shaman, in stage 1 you will be able to get your best T2 pieces (helm and legs), mixed with some T1, MC loot and maybe Hand of Edward the Odd you could have a pretty good ele gear before BWL is out. Then in BWL and ZG you get sick trinkets and the ZG set is decent too. Then T2.5 is BiS for both ele pvp and resto pve. 
---
30/0/21 is good in BGs and pretty good in 1v1 too I think. You need engineering for sure, a simple grenade stun can be devastating with your burst. You can also potentially raid with this spec. They scale well and become burst monster with AQ gear, you can also grab good spellpower mail from Naxx trash I believe. So you have things to look forward to and your only competition for most of your gear is other shamans. I'm not sure how populated shamans really are but they seem to be in high demands so easier to find a good guild, and overall people like to group with shamans. Raid healing as a shaman looks like a pretty good experience too, engaging but not too much. 
---
Downsides include hybrid tax, enhance being a suboptimal spec at 60, plenty of hybrid builds look fun on paper but it's hard to hit cap for spell and melee and 30/0/21 works really well so you could keep that build forever. Pretty poor gold farming capabilities I believe. Competition from casters for most of your off-pieces...
---
Warlocks on paper are probably the best and I'm not too sure why it's not my top pick, they are op after they get BWL gear. They also have at least 3 viable builds in pvp, pretty good gold farming, can potentially raid and pvp with same spec, good leveler with free mount, good class quests... I think they still feel a bit slow and clunky, are boring in raid, not so fan of their aesthetics except in T3 or r13 gear, and soul shards can be a pain.
---
I have a lot of experience with rogues and gnome rogue was my first character so there's the nostalgia, plus they're awesome with engineering. A bit worried about their gear competition, need to constantly respec for pvp, their problems in battlegrounds... And it also seems like rogues don't scale as well as shaman/lock/warrior, when people are in AQ gear you need all your cooldowns to kill someone, every class has a spec to beat rogues, etc. 
---
If you want to play dress up I hear The Sims calling. Keep your noobieness away from my guild and PuG 5 mans. Its ok for you to gimp yourself, but to ruin other peoples game time cuse u want to wear sub optimal gear to "look cool" in a video game world is pretty selfish. Mayhaps you should go outside?
---
Well going to movies pays about the same and it is only like 2 hours long. So yea getting 5-7 hours entertainment per week seems reasonable for me.
---
That's a terrible false equivalent, stop being a damn retard ffs.
---
All we care about is having the authentic vanilla game design philosophies in place, not playing on 14 year old hardware.  
---
Tame a cat and train fishing. When you are out in the wilds and run out of meat, just fish. Your cat will patiently wait for your first catch on your side. Or hunt some wolves and bears for free meat.
---
I see, so would this work with instant cast spells as well if the rogue anticipates correctly?
---
100% agree, it's so annoying that people think it is. If u look at stats it makes sense. People have played so much private server launches with 7 seconds respawn on each mob that they think it's a bad thing to have sharding. The thing is it won't be 7 sec respawn per mob, instead 300 seconds...
---
I never remember it being frustrating because I don’t have a separate reference point. I quit at the end of WOTLK so I’m not sure when they made batching adjustments but I never minded the vanilla batching. 
---
So many raid leaders I knew back on the day on Tichondrius outright refused to join pvp raids they could not risk getting a single DK while they where competing against others for HKs.

Not compared to any other game on the market.

Copy pasted a comment i made on sharding a few mins ago in this post, to show u why sharding might not be as a big of a problem as u might think.

"They use sharding so we can get a good experience in the start. It's not a bad thing, just people missunderstand it.

Hey guys, hope you enjoy this chat with one of the OGs of classic WoW on YouTube, HamsterWheel! I really enjoyed streaming this with him last night and thought you might like to watch it too - you definitely seemed to enjoy the previous episode, so here's hoping this one can live up to that :)

It was in my  original post man. Feel like most didnt read it in this thread. Why do you believe there is a 0% chance of them adding that?

Best believe Im gonna be having my rogue in Silithus 24/7 for this content release. Boy have I missed natural Wpvp
---
Damn this was gonna be my spot from 51-53. Hope my server doesn't crowd it
---
Yes
---
I completely agree with having sharding at 1-5 levels, maybe even up to level 10. But the thing is, the current game STRUGGLES with even 30-40 players in same area, it starts to lag pretty bad and I fear they see the sharding as a fix to it.
---
Im starting to develope trust into the classic team, since all the blue posts so far have been positive. If they get rid off the sharding after 1-2 weeks and never touch it again, I have no problem with it, but you have to undestand why im skeptical. Permanent sharding is the only thing anymore, that would make me quit the game.
---
I mean...warrior will win in every side-by-side comparison of the two, but if you want to play enhance, do it. Play what you want. I'm in a semi-hardcore raiding guild (40mans 2x per week, stacking 20mans 2x per week) and we run with 1-2 enhance shamans usually. You won't get shut out by everybody.
---
Hopefully we will get some info on sit proc too

Thanks! Originally I tried clicking on that video through the twitter link you provided but it just loaded indefinitely. The timestamped link you provided did the same but I just loaded it on my cell phone this time and it worked. Thanks for the explanation. Basically, PVPers won't be able to perform old Vanilla tricks like they used to. Tricks that required perfect timing. Understood.

I actually had a 1920x1440 screen in late Vanilla. It wasn’t a flat screen, though, but a giant monstrosity. The view from Thunder Bluff made it worth it.
---
Great question. 
---
Unfortunately, I don't have a good answer. I mained druid before, so due to that maybe a slight lean toward nature/spiritual. Hmm, Yeah maybe a slight lean towards shaman due to that. I'm going to consider that anyways, thanks!  
---
It doesn't ban, but can automatically kick a player if enough reports are received.

---
I'm not against the feature but it needs to be implemented properly. 
---
The private server community surely knows this, and warlocks are still quite unpopular.
---
And warlocks aren't that great at the start of a server anyways.
---
&gt; yea but he is correct in you can't help collateral damage.
---
It's only "collateral damage" if the reason you're doing world pvp is just to farm honor for gear. You can do that just fine with no collateral damage in BGs.
---
But if you do world pvp because you want to wreck shit, then there is no such thing as collateral damage.
---
It doesn't ban, but can automatically kick a player if enough reports are received.
---
I'm not against the feature but it needs to be implemented properly.
---
that is my plan too!
---
"We think it'll be fun to see those sort of things again" that put a big smile on my face
---
There isn't really proof there. Four forum posts total. I don't see how a streamer could even play wow if that was the system. Or any controversial name. 
---
Another thing. The easiest way to "apply" to a hardcore guild is hit 60 in less then 2 weeks. Its how i went from zero to hero knowing nothing about vanilla. A certain pserver launched i soent 18 hours a day leveling and they grabbed the first 40 people who were 60 and gave them a raid spot
---
No prob. And yeah that’s it in a nutshell
---
inb4 banned for self promotion
---
&gt; Is 5-7 hours of WoW unfair somehow?
---
It's not 5-7 hours for $15. It's 5-7 hours 4-5 times for $15.
---
That 5-7 hours costs $3.50.
---
True, but how many will play outside the people outside of the classic community?  I'm not sure myself, but I really think warlocks will be more highly represented than vanilla regardless. 
---
Because all the examples they listed are nostalgia triggers that just arent available in the current game. Sometimes there is perfection in imperfection my friend.
---
They’d be adding something in direct conflict with how vanilla worked.
---
With their recent slew of blue posts, they seem to be adamantly trying to recreate/emulate the true experience.
---
Private servers have the source code... to their private servers. Its a reverse engineer of the entire process.
---
Spell Batching is not complicated. Its rudimentary game server networking. Tick rate, prediction, interpolation and priority are basics... although the exact parameters would not be available to private server developers... it isn't high on a technical level.
---
Paladins and Shamans in the same raid? Impossible!
---
Id pay $60 for a 3 day headstart. That would be insane. Due to this, I think the public would revolt and say pay-2-win.
---
I mean, I played pretty casually, we always had plenty of hunters, and pretty much never totally filled a 40 man. The nax raids that did run were much pickier
---
\&gt; So ask yourself the question again, is sharding really that terrible if  they keep their promises of only having it in the starting zones for a  limited time?   
---
Yes. I have explained my view on this before so I wont go in-depth, but I would much rather get one mob every 20 minutes than deal with sharding. Sharding is by far the worst thing ever implemented into WoW and has NO place in any MMO.  
---
I dont misunderstand it, I just dont like it.
---
You're right they can't get out of every fear. 
---
Working as intended.
---
elf overpopulation in retail made me empathize with garithos
---
I only included the shaman so I wasnt an Alliance elitist :) Dont want that horde hate
---
Those are the top four forum posts I found from googling "wow report abuse rbg". There are literally dozens if not hundreds of these threads. Would you like me to link more or would you just like to link me to where Blizzard has said this isn't how the system works? 
---
I always loved killing the shit out of the bots... Kill them till you know their gear is broken so they'll farm slower. That was always my objective. There was this one elemental fire farm spot on TBC there would always be 2-3 obvious bot hunters farming on my server. I made that my main farming spot just to kill those boots as much as possible.
---
Then why is this even an issue? Shouldn't they be able to replicate the original experience 100% if they are comparable? All I know is what other people theorize about and it's frustrating. Basically they say that the cloud servers aren't able to handle the original game as it was in vanilla, because of inherent differences.
---
This seems to be corroborated by their desire to keep sharding a part of Classic.
---
Alright just remove DHKs then like it was for half of vanilla. 
---
&gt;Mayhaps you should go outside?
---
Pssst.  Your ignorance and hypocrisy is showing. Also, literally noone says mayhaps these days. What is this hipster bullshit, reviving dead terminology to look cool? Also, on behalf of the rest of humanity, please don't procreate.  I beg you.  The gene pool can't take that kind of a hit.
---
Also, I never said wear whites to a raid.  But if you want to rock a full Tier Set instead of a hodge-podge of gear that may or may not include your tier set because you like the looks better, not many people are going to complain.  (Other than you and wulgpwns of course, who apparently have a little tea party where you hate on other people for playing a game the way that they like it.)
---
You two are funny, you should create a guild together, with the rest of the reddit social rejects who take this shit WAY too seriously.  Enjoy!
---
Life will be there after classic. Classic release however is a once in a lifetime deal. Priorities first mr. !
---
Wow classic is actually for mobile only.
---
Wait, where is the sharding?? We can't have wow without sharding!
---
Actually Omar Gonzales has been in the WoW engineering team since vanilla so they do have some of the same guys who wrote the original code still around.
---
Why have PvP servers then? 
---
Style &gt; BiS. 
---
Depends on what games you're talking about. Some games are $60 and you get 30 hours of play out of it to finish the game, that's $2 an hour.  
---
Some games are $60 + $60 for an "annual" pass. So if you play longer than a year and want to have content updates, that's still $60 a year. $120 / 12 months = $10 a month. With the 6 month sub of WoW, you get access to two games for $13 a month. With regular content updates on one of them and the other being a classic version of the game. So technically, thats $6.50 a month for each game if you play them both. You literally get to play the game without having to purchase it. You could play it for 3 months and still be less expensive than a regular AAA game.  
---
If you think about inflation, the price of $15 a month not going up from 2004 until now is actually pretty good.   
---
 [http://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2004?amount=15](http://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2004?amount=15)   
---
According to that website, $15 now is the equivalent of $20 in 2004 when classic came out. So, it's actually cheaper than it was back then. $15 a month is pretty cheap. You can go to the movies once with that and only get 3 hours of enjoyment out of it. Seems worth it to me.
---
For every prayer that the Classic Blizzard team answers, Activision increase the subscription price by £5.
---
Nah seriously though, I'm happy to see the team are seriously committed to their mission statement of making Classic authentic.
---
I agree with you completely. 
---
I think a lot of the "legendary status" of Naxx came from being an extremely tough dungeon in terms of mechanics for back in the day along with the gear checks for multiple different classes. On top of that it was released 6 months before TBC was released and a lot of guilds already said "Screw it, TBC Is coming out, so we'll just take a break from raiding."  
---
I personally think people are giving Naxx too much credit when it comes to killing it. I believe the wow devs said that Classic will be playable as long as blizzard is supporting retail wow.. Correct? You give people enough time and there will be pugs, GDKP runs, and alt runs going through naxx with zero problem at all. 
---
Don't worry OP, I couldn't care less about honor ranks and I'm going to kill every civilian in sight. 
---
That’s a great news. After BfA, which I have found very disappointing, it’s nice to see good news coming out of blizzard. 
---
Well, what you are saying when u say u dont mind waiting 20 minutes for each mob, is your enjoyment is more important then the majority. Because most people won't enjot it (TBF, i wouldn't mind, i just look at what actually makes sense in terms of the game)
---
U need to remember that all retail players that try the game, all people that didn't play it for 10 years+ might not enjoy sitting stuck in starting zone spending 1 hour to kill a few mobs. They would start getting frustrated and mad and some of these old school players/retail player might quit, not because the game is not for them. But because of a bad first impression.
---
Wow very neat
---
Should be up to level 20, Barrens and Westfall will be unplayable on launch. Past level 20 you have more zones to choose from, and most people will probably quit at that point. 
---
Pacing will weed out the unworthy. People are dicks because they dont have to work with other people to get what they need - there will still be the elitists but they'll need a deeper bench of friends and players to seperate themselves, which isn't going to be easy
---
Why is it a terrible false equivalent? Calling names is pretty weak.
---
Why do you draw the line there? If you want an authentic experience, and you include things like graphics, why not screen resolution too? Or internet connection? 
---
because its random topics over 10 mins to make money off hype
---
They dont. Only the classic team has proved to be listening. And even then they not actual blizzard employees. They are spys, their mission is to sabotage activision from the un site.
---
\*puts down Windfury totem\* That's fair man I \*puts down Strength of Earth totem\* I didn't mean to \*puts down Mana spring totem\* fuck what was I talking about?
---
Yeah, but this is why i commented it my friend. U seem to understand where i'm comming from. I understand people wanna critize what they think is wrong and i undderstnad why people are very skeptical. But they promised ONLY LIMITED TIME IN STARTING ZONES.
---
Considering this, it will most likely be starting zones (like durotar, elwynn etc) that will be sharded and rest unsharded (we dont know how much will be sharded yet tbf tho)
---
I rolled paladin cause my friend told me i get a free horse at 40. 
---
but in reality it was usually 900 and 90 or 810 and 81 because it was very easy to get 10% discount and fairly easy to get 2x 10% discount
---
Don't you get fatigue when flying? Also can you really fly between EK and kalimdor? Thought maybe they were not I'm the same physical space.
---
Damn. Great news. Blizzard keeps exceeding expectations 
---
Fair? 15$ a month is a no brainer for me. Hell I'm 30 now. I payed 16$ for some drinks today and didn't even think about it.
---
Agreed, but in 2004 I was playing at 1600x1200.
---
I guess I was wrong about them saying it but I think that video is just scare tactics from a guy who had a legitimate ban. How could top end guilds even raid if it only took 5 reports to get them banned? 
---
Or halfway to 100 being 98 ( PoE :P )
---
I agree here. My biggest complaint so far is the no RP-PvP server.
---
Are you tired of winning yet?
---
Make a troll look at your feet. Then kill yourself. This is the same way every undead is born. They all start as trolls who looked at their feet. After you do that you realize suicide is the only option. 
---
Then why not just reset the server every 3 months? Because I guarantee you even with sharding you will see more people in the first month of launch than you will at any point after that without sharding. 
---
There’s still a lot of questions we need answers too
---
I really hope for new classic content. OSRS has done it with wild success to the tune of OSRS vastly surpassing the playerbase of their primary game. 
---
This issue isn't an "instaban" it's a having a player kicked from the server during a crucial moment. Imagine a 10v10 premade WSG and your FC just gets massed reported and kicked so the flag drops. Sure he could just log back in and continue but the kick has totally fucked up your BG. Or imagine two guilds in classic competing for a world boss and the main tank or raid lead gets kicked during the pull. In current retail wow, the only place it has any real effects are RBGs which aren't exactly a huge thing anymore. 
---
Blizzard added it for a very specific reason.  To stop griefing by intentionally killing NPCs without penalty.  It’s the same as if a high level player followed someone and killed all the mobs before low lvl player had a chance to tag/kill it. It simply ruins the game from an unfair advantage.
---
Blizzard doesn’t want low lvl players quiting the game (and losing money, they are a business) because some dickhead thought it was funny to keep you from leveling and enjoying the rest of the game.
---
You’d have an extremely tough time, if not impossible, trying to convince them otherwise.
---
*hides*
---
Wow wtf didnt even notice. Thats awesome. 
---
I'd be really disappointed if blizzard comes out with a replica of a P server man
---
There are two types of people who object to #nochanges:  
---
1) People who want to alter/rebalance the game  
---
2) People who just hate the autistic screeching doomsday prediction circle-jerk to shut down discussion of everything #nochanges people deem impure
---
1. be a disenchanter.
---
2. run lower level dungeons that you can solo, and get  small and large radiant shards from the bosses. these usually sell between 5 and 10g on most servers since they are still needed at lvl 60 and the supply is low.
---
3.  optional: go together with another lvl 60 buddy, you can then kill much higher lvl bosses for high lvl shards.  Your gold / hour will be higher but of course, you have to divide it by 2.  Still might be better option.   
---
This method works on any population, because you will always have your own dungeon instance.    However if too many people do this, the market gets flooded and the prices will be too low.  I have never played much on pservers with crazy high population, for me it always worked very fine on low-medium populated servers 
---
They're two entirely different games for two entirely different types of player. That's not to say I don't want current retail players to give Classic a go, I just don't expect many to have an interest when their primary goals seem to be collecting cosmetics and completing achievements.
---
Same. I’m just going to bring it up from now until launch all the time lol. 
---
Ion Hazzikostas if i get the hierarchy right?
---
Wow. Classic is gonna be good isn't it.
---
Good Job Blizzard!
---
resto/balance hopefully. 24/0/27
---
Yeah why would you want to group up with a bunch of strangers to raid a town in an MMOr?
---
Thanks for your answer. I still don't get why you would want that to happen though. If I interrupt someone in time I want the spell to be interrupted or not? To me this seems like they make the game less consitent on purpose. I doubt that this was a design decision back in the day and more of a hardware limitation. I can see why people like this in terms of how the game felt back then, but as a game mechanic it's kind of weird to be excited about this.
---
cringe
---
But griefing will be done by people who dont care for DHKs, so it defeats the purpose.
---
A raid on x roads setting up  camp is not griefing, it's wPvP. Killing guard thomas for 9hours straight is griefing.
---
Hi, /u/pwannebo
---
Exactly my point if it’s a once in a lifetime release I want to be able to enjoy it by scheduling time off to enjoy it properly. 
---
Must be a relatively old poll this, because when I clicked it told me I had already voted. No idea when it went up. 
---
City raids are not PvP? Trying to kill the city leader which give HONOR is not part of the PvP system?
---
What about early vanilla when most of a server would participate in endgame which was just mass scale PvP that everyone participated in (and MC).  The concept that got many including myself to keep paying and playing to get to 60. Why not a very simple compromise and make the already categorized civilians and make them passive. There are a ton of solutions and middle ground to work with that avoids griefing and keeping the world pvp alive.
---
oh i see, i might be wrong
---
I brought shame to my family. 
---
Gosh , can't wait for this summer , and still I don't know what class I'll pick this time !
---
LOL rich.
---
you are doing gods work.
---
Is this it captain?
---
How are they not great at the start of a server? 
---
Everybody and their mom want to retain rank6 though to keep having access to really cheap potions for everday encounters. 
---
Even r6 is heavily impacted deranking you easily if you participate in city raids.
---
Your criteria is subjective. SS vs TM was a large-scale battle, and did NOT always involve raiding the other town. Sometimes? Yes. Always? No.  
---
I'm actually bothered by your "my opinion is fact" argument. "
---
&gt; Hence TM vs SS. not field vs field. 
---
This is a supremely narrow-minded way of putting it. The field inbetween mattered immensely, and your insistence on belittling it makes me think you never actually experienced it yourself. 
---
There could be a number of factors, but the best I would say is it depends on the guild, raid loot distribution, raid composition, specs, etc.
---
AQ set prices also required certain reputation levels to acquire the actual gear, regardless if you had the mats to turn them in.
---
I am pro temp sharding at this point. No one came up with a better solution since Blizzcon. 
---
Everything between 1.0 and 1.12. should be fair game to discuss. x realm BGs, DHKs, 1.4 unarmored mounts should all be on the table for discussion.
---
Even if we have phones
---
Funniest part for me from the picture is the lone Orc who flagged themselves for pvp. Apparently he is ready to start some shit.
---
Question:  Why would anyone want this?  I guess I don’t understand the desire for any of this, tbh.
---
epic intro
---
Well personally, I hope they do quit.  Think about it.  You don't want to play alongside of some impatient little shit trying to clean the dungeon out in less than 5mins.  They will try to leeroy shit and wipe the group.  
---
Once we get them weeded out, we'll be left with mostly players that appreciate Classic for what it is... time/patience/dedication to earn what you get. 
---
Speaking of rp servers, are we getting a couple of those?  Idk if we had those in classic or not, started in bc.
---
Seconded. People condescended to “rose tinted glasses” mentality, and now the groups fractured into another group that condescends to people who want to remain as close to the original philosophy as possible.
---
Of course we want modern internet and hardware. We buck against sharding because it fractures one of the best features of vanilla - the community. 
---
I was just about to type that....crazy how low hunters are on the polls I've seen.
---
I think you're getting it confused, Warlocks weren't good in early vanilla due to bad itemization and talents
---
Warlocks are bad early on for two reasons. In raiding you have no hit on your spec tree for your destro spells. This means you will miss a lot more then a mage. As for things like SL in pvp. At low gear score they simply don't have the HP to make it work. Warlocks are bad early on but will pick up in power as the expac moves on.
---
You clearly have never PVPed in an actual city / town / quest hub.  You don't even have to be PVPing to get a DK.  There are quest people scattered around the world, and if you AOE your way through some stuff and happen to hit an other-faction aligned NPC, you get a DK.
---
Two words:
---
PvE servers.
---
Best will be gauging anyways. Gauge in the same batch as the mage blinking and the mage blinks and lands with the gauge intact. Makes for nasty surprises in duels.
---
Not enough spell hit, no agro reduction, no burst cooldowns. Also very squishy in pvp. Takes content releases and gear for them to shine.
---
My raid and dungeon teams are all just Ralph Wiggums. 
---
Shaman squad! Can't decide what race tho...
---
Reee mac bad Linux good windows suck 
---
Something like this perhaps if I am able to be Enhancement in raids
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/AZAEw80z3QI88Q
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
RIP warriors...
---
I’d argue that classic isn’t based on what happened pre-1.12.  
---
It’s what got us to 1.12, sure. But thats not what they are recreating, IMO.
---
This is such a dumb slippery slope argument. There is clearly a difference between game mechanics that can impact how the game is played and hardware which is completely unrelated to the actual game engine itself
---
Yes!  Thank you.  Imma be farming for that Gigaflux Reactivator for a while.  Lol
---
Because people want to grief other people.
---
Do we have a spy at Blizzard or something? It is unsettling how they nail everything. 
---
Undeads looked like homeless people until T3 though. :( Nobody wears the tier sets and bloodvine with its ripped undead look is just soooo bad.
---
You and me too buddy. Loved that tank. 
---
Not enough to prevent the dps and healers from sitting LFTank for 2+ hours every time they try to form a group.
---
Playing retail and pservers it can be quite frustrating on the receiving end of a batch
---
I feel attacked.
---
Scare beast for hunters or turn evil for paladins
---
I think you misread my comment. 
---
I still use ct mod and ct raid on private servers. They still work great. Cheers to them. 
---
You can still raid small towns with strangers.  Just don’t join their raid if you don’t want the DK because some rogue felt like sneaking off and having his way with Ol’ Emma.  
---
I think they value the hype and anticipation. They don’t want people en masse to be able to experience the original game until the launch. A lot of people havn’t seen the old sounds and world for 9 years.
---
Because the people complaining are the people that want a nostalgia trip and not a more skill intensive game.
---
&gt; Just ice
---
Nothing is cooler than justice - Ret gang
---
&gt;We buck against sharding because it fractures one of the best features of vanilla - the community. 
---
What is this imaginary idea that Durotar is where you forge friendships for eternity? Most people you encounter in the beginning will quit by level 20.
---
Also, even with sharding, you will encounter more players in the first month from launch than you will at any point after that without sharding.
---
\[SERVER\] Crash in 5 minutes
---
Spellbatching was something done to address that, not a result of it. Connections have improved fourfold since those days, there is no reason we shouldn't have a tighter batching window. It's just going to feel laggy.
---
Do it with a trusted raid, or don’t group up while doing it.  Or just take the DK hit.  
---
I would recommend joining a raiding guild rather than starting your own. Having experience with pvp and running a leveling guild is valuable, so that should help you find a guild.
---
Also, no one starts out with naxx. You pretty much need to be able to consistently farm BWL before you begin naxx.
---
Atiesh
---
You're dumb.
---
Remember shamans are faction specific so you can essentially double the % number. Shamans will be top three most played classes in Vanilla Horde. Probably right behind warrior
---
Mkayy so this is for you and the commentator below you. I see your point and if that's true then you have made an argument for why END-Game warlock is bad, and by both your admissions why only the first phase end-game warlock is "bad". Consider for a moment that only a very tiny % of people will actually make it to 60 warlock and raid in the first month(s). A VAST majority of players are casual and won't even make it to 60 within the first 2 months. With that in mind, I'd pose the thought that Warlock is better on a fresh server due to their ability to solo pve content and lvling
---
Hi, /u/blad786
---
What about if you only got a dk if you tagged that target? So let's say you are in a raid of 40, but 3 people tagged the civilian then those 3 get the dhk? You'd still have to keep an eye on aoe, but that keeps people from not only griefing quests and low levels, but also that 1/40 raid member that joins and kills a ton of civilians.
---
Personally, unless I need the crit cap for some reason, I’ll aleays take Toughness over Anticipation. 
---
Firstly if you plan on playing with high ping. Consider melee, warriors especially a no go. The enemy will constantly be slightly askew from where they should be. Moving on for that. I would go with a class that relies on raw power over trickery.
---
The two best class choices in my mind to play at high ping are Warlock, and Priest. They both rely heavily on being bulky in pvp. Shadow priests especially play extremely well in pvp. Very straight forward and extremely powerful.
---
You can pretty much reach crit cap in MC with every world buff and consumable, do theoretically SF Daggers is always viable if your guild is good enough and your guild is dedicated enough. Optimally though, swords will always do more DPS in every raid tier. 
---
Having an epic mount was the universal status symbol, at least early on.
---
personally, I'm way too old to keep playing video games, I just want a hobby
---
classic wow seams more like a long term hobby
---
Warlock suddenly pulls aggro off the boss, it bee-lines towards him.   All that's heard on raid comms is "I'm in danger"
---
If bgs are even out before dire maul
---
Huuurrrr.... Yeaaargghh....
---
Glad to see people rolling mayonnaise more and more.
---
Misleading comparison, if they wanted to search BFA they'd just search "trash"
---
I think you're underestimating how different the community is in classic. There will be people who abuse this and it will cause issues.
---
That's a pretty good question, I haven't thought about it. Since it sounds like they're launching without a 'modern' honor system, I dont really have a clue what they want to do with DR. Removing it seems like added work without much benefit.
---
Teebu's Blazing Longsword
---
Which won't be out at launch
---
As a mage some variant of winter's chill but with improved counterspell and coldsnap maybe? 
---
Sharding is just cancerous in an MMORPG as it damages immersion within your server community. It leaves a bitter taste from the get go. If they do it, then they can get away with excuses at large scale events such as AQ gates. "Hey guys we used sharding at launch, so let's use sharding again at X event to address stability issues".
---
The problem is, sharding isn't being implemented to address mob/resource competition. It's being implemented for server stability issues present in their current servers that can't handle loads of players in one place:
---
https://youtu.be/hQ8lsMZOu_E?t=120
---
The clouding tech is already there since they down ported from the modern client. They'd rather go down that route instead of addressing server stability issues. It costs less. It's a terrible solution for a game like Classic however.
---
Dynamic respawns is a much better solution overall imo.
---
Wut..
---
Even in PvE raids atleast one guy in not super hardcore guilds will not get close to the surgers, not root the pincer guards in AQ20, not sheep the axe throwers in ZG.
---
In a city raid 200 vs 200 you just can't bank on all people doing the right thing. 
---
The great thing about vanilla is inclusion, noobs and super hardcore neckbeards can do stuff together and its fun. 
---
Not grouping up is bad for a lot of synergy of classes and it's frankly less fun, because of less cohesion. Who does not like opening the raid tap seeing 40 well synergized group members.
---
Take the DHK hit or what rather happens no city raids.
---
&gt; fear juggle one of them with weakness/recklessness
---
Fear? Which 5-man has enough space to allow for use of fears except in the most desperate situations?
---
Or am I misunderstanding what you mean by fear juggling?
---
Hell yeah
---
Orb of Deception?  If I remember correctly it was BoE and really only served as a status symbol.  It being BoE meant you could buy it unlike say Dartol's rod, so it was a bit of a "I have enough money to spare on this" status symbol.
---
Im not gonna tryhard for all agi buffs
---
Toughen up. I am not going to  state "no offense, well in my opinion I believe this" everytime I have something to say. It weakens and dilutes your point and is bad writing and bad conversation. Of course what I say is opinion almost everything people say is opinion. Its funny because I "belittled" what you said as wrong, but you are using  an ad hominem that has no relevence to the topic.
---
That said I have been apart of many many TM vs SS battles and it is a great because of the close proximity and the draw of the zone itself. The flow back and forth is a staple of the battle and that is largely in part to reinforcements called by lower level players.  I have never seen a TM vs SS peter out in the field. They always end when pushing against a large number of guards in a town and the remained players. 
---
That change came in 2.0.1.
---
You’re a towel.
---
How do you think a hunter would fare? It’s the class I’m leaning towards, but not being able to FD/ trap consistently might kind of suck
---
Alterac mount is 640g total. Assuming riding is cheap and mount is expensive. 
---
&gt; END-Game warlock is bad
---
I would like it known in no way did I say a warlock is bad endgame. They are absolutely amazing. The point I was making is that unlike a mage with is op from level 1-60 then is op at 60 with no help. A warlock will have to work for what they have. It will take some time but, the payout is their. A well geared warlock is a monster.
---
A warlock is not less popular then a mage because it's a worse class. Rather the mage is more popular then the warlock because it's quality of life is off the charts high. You don't deal in soul shards. You get your first 5 hit for free. Frost spec gives you all the crit you need for free. They farm super easy. They have ports and the biggest life complaint they have. Is that other people will ask for a little bit of their free shit with water and food. That is why mages are more popular. It's not a knock on locks. Mages are just silk slipper wearing ass holes is all.
---
orc warlock looks so wrong
---
Just use an ad blocker.
---
It's more of a guaranteed buff that makes up for shit play and players no matter what since stat increase is objectively always better regardless of skill. When you have 40 people, that does add up.
---
What is spell batching
---
People thought raids wouldn’t hold up with the modern batching because it would’ve made them too easy? 
---
For rogues it's depressing how much better the T3 is than the R13 set - using the agility equivalence formula, the T3 is more than twice as good than R13 ([981AEP vs 441AEP](https://shadowpanther.net/armor-sets.htm)).
---
I was convinced I'd play a rogue as that was my main from TBC to MOP, but as I'd be limited to the R10 set (343AEP) and no raid content other than the occasional pug, I'll be playing a shadow priest. In a way it feels more authentic, since that was my first lvl60 in Vanilla.
---
yeah but he was refering to transmog which obviously wasnt in vanilla
---
Lightforge plus skull flame shield, plus sword from baron, is soooooo strong. Spell dmg plus healing is so gud
---
I think there are more known grind spots than back then when everyone thought Tyrs Hand was like the only place to grind.
---
Yeah they are. People on private servers I think for the most part didn't raid endgame vanilla wow. Some did of course but i doubt the majority did. So they have this idea that it is just so hard and so difficult that all the consumables are mandatory. Its like a group of people patting themselves on the back saying wow this is so hard only true hardcore people can clear it. Or something along those lines. This is not everyone of course, the guild im in now is not like that but previous guilds I've been in has had this mindset a lot of times. 
---
still stand by deleting that fugly teal dress from the space/time continuum 
---
Jesus this is amazing. The intro, the machinima, the humor, the information.
---
This is what all content creators, Classic WoW or otherwise, should aspire to create.
---
You are right that the focus is on 1.12 but with progressive itemization and content stages they are at least thinking and implementing pre 1.12 ideas. Thats what got me and many others into WoW these early concepts and ideas for a world that felt just like a world. 
---
I guess to keep in line with the old classic experience. The spell batch system is an interesting one, has both positives and negatives. One thing I can think of, is if you are trying to interrupt something, you have to know the window you have to do it in, and people can still cancel their cast
---
Undead look great to me. That being said I do accept Undead is a niche. You either want to be a decaying monster with no lower jaw and a floppy tongue or you don't. Not a lot of middle ground there lol.
---
I am aboard the hype train!
---
Thank you for doing this, I'm one of those stuck at work lol
---
Fear it, if it starts running to another pack drop reckless so it runs back to you, then weakness again and it will run away.
---
My man!
---
Agree, I think sharding is the lesser evil if done right, e.g. starting zones at launch and maybe Silithus when AQ opens. Both of these phases were problematic in vanilla. 
---
* Clusterfuck startup with tagging, crashes, and latency issues? No thanks.
---
* Server size limited in order to accommodate the startup? I guess if we could get a gradual increase, but most likely you would need more servers initially, which would then suffer from low pops as was the case in vanilla.
---
* Dynamic respawn fucking with economy and escort quests? Getting swarmed by hostile respawns? Idk. 
---
If you do basically any amount of pvp at all, Undead. The benefits of undead in pvp far outweigh the benefits of troll in pve.
---
I wouldn't CARE if they raised the price. I'm going to be happy to shell out the money. I am going to be playing for the experience again. The community made the game what it was. The content is okay, the mechanics are brutal which is fun. But feeling like you are part of a community, not just player_controlled_npc_#1337 is going to be awesome.
---
Alright so give us an option have PvP servers and PvE servers where you can avoid being directly griefed.
---
They gave it to the frakkin' hunter's pets!
---
Because the experience we all crave comes from the game design itself, not the hardware that it ran on back in 2004. There's nothing fun about waiting 12 hours for you game to install, there's nothing fun about not being able to raid 80% of the bosses in MC because your PC would just crash out or freeze on 1fps for the entire fight and nor is there any fun in having to fuck my eyes up by staring at a tiny screen for prolonged ours. 
---
Swift Zulian Tiger. For sure.
---
A non-PVP example I've seen people use is that in the old batching system, keeping tanks in higher health was more important. This was because a huge crushing blow from a boss could fall into the same batch as your Greater Heal, and if your tank was low they may die even though your heal technically resolved in the same batch. For the people making this case, the modern system was seen to make things easier.       
---
         
---
I'll admit, I never saw this phenomenon first hand...or if I did, I didn't attribute it to batching. I just assumed I cast something a little too late, which I guess is still technically true but not in the exact way I thought.         
---
        
---
This was one of those things that wouldn't have been a deal-breaker for me, but I am super glad is making it into the game for the authentic, smooth groove.
---
Walking around with Teebu's Blazing Longsword unsheathed 
---
I was a NE male hunter for tbc-wotlk and this was perfect.  Instantly heard it in my head.
---
Era of Legends is basically this. Not a bad game, a little easy though.
---
that last 5 seconds was pretty great too
---
This is another good solution. 
---
&gt; Sharding they said WILL ONLY BE USED IN STARTING ZONES FOR A LIMITED TIME and that makes completely sense when u consider these facts.
---
I completely agree with this. The starting zones need it, especially for the first week as it's going to spike hard.
---
I played on nost when it re-launched, there were literally hundreds of people fighting for the handful of mobs. I literally quit, and came back a month later so I could actually level efficiently.
---
Here's another post that does a good job explaining it. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/906mr1/aq40_loot_council/
---
That sounds like it eats a whole lot of GCDs for little benefit. Guess it might be worth it if Heal is the bottleneck instead of DPS.
---
Lol ofcourse im saying that, its my opinion afterall. I dont care if every retail player quits.. so what? I just want the game to be fun for me, thats all.
---
I can only speculate, but at times I feel like it was to even out the ping differences and make the game more fair. Basically giving you the chance to react to certain events instead of preemptively having to use abilities like in retail wow. Blizzard even say themselves:
---
&gt; It used to be the norm that combat flow and PvP balance were defined and tuned in a game where spell messages were resolved less frequently.
---
So I think it was a design choice and the PvP balance was built on top of that. It's still unclear to me what exact version of spell batching or spell delaying we'll get, but the whole system is far more complex than described in the bluepost.
---
That one I agree with you. Undeads with a jaw are travesty!
---
Again, I'm not presenting an argument, I'm just poking to see exactly where the line is drawn for the hardcore #nochanges people, so that I better understand your position.
---
Just to be clear, so long as the mechanics are the same you're happy, so for instance if the graphics and animations remained the same as Legion you would've been happy?
---
If you wanna see your old friend again, they still exist! Unless they were removed in 8.1.5. I haven't visited one since 8.1 (maybe late 8.0). Some areas use "sticky walls" which prevent you from moving at all (I hit one at the edge of the map in BC Hellfire Penninsula exploration in 8.0). Some areas just use one way walls you can break past using some tricky methods. Some areas use multiple invisible walls in a row that get you stuck, but not like the sticky walls, there's one in the Arathi Warfront to the west of the Thoridan's Wall. Then there's two way invisible walls, which one can be found in Siege of Orgrimmar after Galakras, you can get past one, then can't get back, I was just there yesterday. Then there's the invisible wall type i've only seen in Eye of Azshara that DCs you pretty hard if you get past it, likey due to the terrain beyond being fake and using some kind of special blizzard voodoo magic.
---
Undead mages look homeless but rogues look nice 
---
Not particularly.  I don’t give 2 hooves about spell batching.  I want to know if castspellbyname is going to be unprotected, or if castsequence is getting axed.  
---
Awesome thank you for this, very interesting! 
---
Here's one: Sharding.
---
maybe theres some gopnik DNA left from my russian ex-girlfriend?
---
Many likely won’t make it to 60, or will just stop playing shortly thereafter if they don’t enjoy the game. 
---
That being said, I think there is a very large portion of the retail player base, like me, that wishes retail retained more MMO-like features in the vein of Vanilla, but enjoy the graphics and smoothness of gameplay of the current game. 
---
I’m likely going to be bouncing back and forth between the games. 
---
Again, another thing I wasn't extremely invested in but I'm ecstatic about the outcome. Keep 'em coming Blizz, this is great! 
---
P.S. please include RP-PvP. **Please**. 
---
Why would they quit?
---
Anything + Paladin.
---
I'm actually torn and I want to play both Druid and Shaman. Shaman is my original class that I picked up in retail vanilla wow back in the day so this is a coming home type thing for me, but I've fallen in love with the Druid and after reading the newer theorycrafting about Feral Druid tanking and dps being pretty viable (and on some fights optimal in regards to tanking) I've been wanting to try it. Right now I'm thinking about just leveling both a Shaman and Druid at the same time and just switching between the two when I get bored of leveling one. 
---
What do you guys think? Is this stupid or has anyone else done it? I also really want to make the Druid a Night Elf because cow Druids are so ugly, but having both toons on the same server+faction is so useful. 
---
oh so guilds only bring 3 or 4 because locks aren't that strong? I thought it was a scarcity issue.
---
Counterpoint: Felheart shoulders on an Orc are hilarious.
---
Kind of want to name my priest Gravity
---
There is a single Archmage that drops it
---
I appreciate you taking the time, but you don't seem to be in the #nochanges crowd, as what you've said contradicts those who are against initial phasing and wish for people to wait in queues / wait 20 minutes for mob respawns on Launch.
---
I'm trying to see where the line is for those who are #nochanges.
---
Don't forget the teabagging. Classic WoW stuff. 
---
Nope. The soul shards last forever. The things you make from the soul shards disappear after you've logged off for a while.
---
Imo sharding is the remaining big one. If they decide to remove sharding completely, it will be perfect for me.
---
R14 Set, Epic mount before the majority of our the server got to 60, AQ Mount, Teebu’s Blazing Sword, full T3 w/ring, Thunderfury. 
---
"Sharding destroys community"
---
"Fuck the community, all I care about is me"
---
Yeah of course, buffs are popped to maximize chances of success, but I'd say they are more of a crutch than anything. You're never gonna learn the heigan dance if you can just live through it because of protection potions. Healers won't learn how to avoid overhealing a crapton if they stack up on Mana consumables so Mana becomes less of an issue etc. Feels like it's more brute forcing the fights because you outgear them all due to the consumables. 
---
Its funny how this has changed, people using consumables were considered low skilled and try hards on my server back in vanilla. You weren't truly a good raiding guild if you had to buff the entire raid and stuff. Now it's the opposite.
---
But my biggest pet peeves are when people claim the consumable whoring is mandatory and that you will never clear stuff without it because it's ridiculously false. Guilds did it in vanilla with worse specs, PC's, internet connections and mechanical skill.
---
meh right now all i care about is the release date, ive heard enough about other things.
---
some hardcore raiding guilds on private servers are bringing along enh shamans to totem twist in the tank group with improved totems to improve the tank TPS. Apparently now the meta is evolving to the point where the bottleneck is tps rather than dps so any means to increase tank tps will increase overall raid dps output.   
---
Take that how you will, but you should be able to find a role as an enh shaman in raiding. It isn't a great pvp spec despite various highlight videos that have been made popular. On the contrary, a hybrid elemental/resto spec is optimal where you can be an offensive healer and damage dealer. Shaman overall is a great and flexible class, and you can play all three specs in some shape or form. 
---
Buying T3?.... Lmao
---
I personally think the TBC server Netherwing got it somewhat right, but i do want to see blizzard's own version of it :D
---
Same with me, I always open my map to fullscreen when I fly over the void in Outlands, it just freaks me out... I love to explore in WoW but it is legitimately scary, which is kinda funny.
---
I think the odds of us being stuck with sharding are less with spell batching. The old system seems to be more simplistic and with slower tick rate, both should make performance better than retail (not to mention simpler abilities / less procs). The better their servers perform, the less reason they have to break us off into shards.
---
That's good to hear.  I really like the vanilla shaman a lot cause it just seems so cool but as far as I've been told they are pretty much shunned from existence when it comes to pve and that makes me sad.  I've also heard that they generally will always get last pick at everything when it comes to gear and that pushes me off but it looks just soooooo cool.  But Warrior has always been my favorite class.  My biggest fear is running enhancement and then getting neglected hardcore and not being able to progress.
---
The best prot wars wear some dps and spec some into fury. It's all about rage generation and keeping threat
---
If everyone's leveling at once, you'd have a good chance of working with others.
---
I'm leveling an Affliction warlock on a private server right now and I just don't play well with others.  Everyone else is in too much of a hurry.  Give it 24 seconds and it'll be taken care of.
---
Absolutely! It just makes more sense to do Northrend as the next expansion since it follows naturally from the scourge invasion and Naxx.
---
Oops my bad didnt read that right. Yea BGs where definitely a big part of it. But many people avoided world pvp because they couldnt risk getting that DHK. Why not give it a chance? 
---
Yes DHKs existed for a long time during the honor system, but world pvp didnt.
---
only to have the needed curses
---
4 mobs on a tank in a vanilla 5 man is a definite bottleneck on heals.  This gets one out of there while you deal with the others.  And you should have dots ticking on those, so you're still contributing dps.
---
Oliks from TI? If so, long time no see :)
---
Isnt there dynamic spawning in a lot of pservers to account for higher pops?
---
I asked the same thing earlier in this thread. Somebody explained to me that it had to do with old PvP tricks that were only possible with this system. Tricks that required perfect timing. I was told that these tricks would no longer be possible if spell batching were not a thing anymore and it would change the true Vanilla PvP experience.
---
Sounds like he DCed but the game didn't kick him, meaning he couldn't dismount and wouldn't get fatigue or drown or anything, but can't do anything besides move. And those are separate entire worlds yes, you cannot fly between them, which it looks like he found out on that day!
---
My opinion on hunter. Is simply this if you aren't a living god at kiting. Don't play one. In pvp you will be little more then food for the crows. The minimum skill cap on a pvp hunter is crazy high.
---
Other then that they are the best solo class in the game and a good raid support class. As long as you accept you are a support and not a DPS in raid and will there fore get gear last. The class is great.
---
Thank you.
---
yep pservers numbers still have them as the most unpopular after druids
---
Gnome warrior. What are you gonna do, stab my ankles?
---
Nobody's complaining because everyone stopped playing.
---
Bug Family in AQ.
---
Same!!! Played a pally from TBC&gt; but just couldn't level one in vanilla
---
Ele Shaman
---
This is a super common spot for people leveling 51-60 though. Even on retail Vanilla where I was the highest level alliance priest on the server I remember there being competition for these camps when leveling. Same when I was leveling a Warlock sometime around 1.10.
---
"My mouth tastes like burning!"

"Goddamn it, get out of the Lava Bomb!"

---
Still waiting to see any proof of this happening ever.
---
Orb of Deception, or maybe one of those rarer pets (Black Whelpling, Disgusting Oozling).
---
Agreed, definitely no blue wall in Vanilla. Fun fact: fatigue used to be very easy to circumvent. At some point in beta you could simply swim and once fatigue came close, you jump. This momentarily takes you out of the water and fatigue bar would vanish. Fun times.
---
Maybe they could change the AI and health bars of civilian NPCs in a way that makes it obvious? For example make them reset combat after they were sheeped/feared/trapped or whatever, or make them run away instead of fight you after they are tagged.
---
I think one of the main problems is that it's easy to accidentally tag them and it's hard to get rid of them without killing them, even if you're not AoEing much or anything like that. At least that's how I remember it.
---
Fair enough.
---
Dude adds 5 minutes of lore to each video and has timestamps to skip. Would you rather the subreddit have no content. 
---
ye but some specs are just impossible to pvp with, like prot war or some shit
---
Twink? They only plan on doing sharding first few weeks at launch. By the time you have a high level and a twink, it'll be long gone.
---
As we get closer and closer to launch, I get more and more nervous and excited. Their resolve to keep it “original” is very fresh in this day. My problem is as the hype increases so does activision’s eyes. I’m worried a cash shop will come soon. Character boosts and new pets will flood because of the popularity with activism seeing another cash cow to squeeze cash out of
---
This is blatantly false...
---
Not sure why this is being downvoted. Although you can (I think?) see blue walls with eagle eye, only if he eagle eyes right near the edge of the world so the camera is close to it.
---
Also, blue walls are caused by a block with no ADT? That explains why blue walls appear when the game is still downloading. Very cool to know!
---
Preach it!
---
The only *good* shaman spec
---
We want the shit show! 
---
Because the game as a whole isn't as good as people on here would have you think, and the parts that are good don't appeal to everyone.
---
I only played a little bit since TBC came out, and it was during Warlords of Drenor launch month or two. Coming back to WoW I tried a few PUG dungeons. I remember being up on that dungeon which is a big tall tower with birds. And the members in my group were just harassing me to hurry up, go faster, no downtime. Not a fun way to play. 
---
Because if there's any constant of video game forums, it's people bitching about everything and anything.
---
They will definitely be there, considering they are still there in Retail.
---
Up until just a few months ago, we had no reason to believe otherwise. They weren't talking to us.
---
What will be fate of wall jumpping then? Could it make comeback?
---
Enjoy only ever raiding mc and barely clearing it every week dude. If that's your goal then great. You will be the minority and most players will see you as a troll.
---
Skilled warlocks were truly the kings of CC in vanilla. Fear, Banish, Seduce, Enslave, off tanking with pets... 
---
Mages get all the hype because of sheep, but that's just because it's easy.
---
F
---
Ah, gotcha. I had a lock as my alt in vanilla. Needless to say, that was a looooooong time ago. Thinking about maining a lock for classic
---
"This doesn't come up every day, stop being so dramatic clown." Said the idiot who said these don't show up daily.
---
Hunter main with a rogue 19 twink. Classic noob combo baby. 
---
Is this a thing on retail? 
---
No I didn't. 
---
Having the source code (Blizzard) versus *not* having the source code (PTR) is a HUGE deal
---
Mana Tide is honestly overrated, it only breaks down to be like 18 mana per 5 assumed its used once or something kinda shit. 
---
If you are good with mana potions/dark runes, its fine to heal without it, especially if you're thrown in a melee dps group.
---
It matters more if you're thrown in for a mage dps group or a healer group.
---
Bank alts with crazy interesting, rare, and expensive gear.  I never got into pimping my banker until TBC but I'd imagine Classic will be a Broom with +55 healing or something cool.
---
It's strangely something I want to fund, even more so than a twink.
---
Yeah, that’s true too.  Blizzard has to make some tough choices, and I think they will go with whatever makes for the best experience overall, even if that limits other things.
---
C’est la vie.
---
Horde.
---
You can buy tier on retail? 
---
no content is better than uncreative content designed to milk hype and make money honestly
---
They did hotfix their health bars to be a different color, yellow or green iirc, and their popup would show a green Civilian indentifier. Yea they where hard to get rid of. Would seem to be the easiest solution to just make them passive and unkillable. 
---
Despite downvotes, this is true. Unless it was changed in 8.1.5
---
Hi, /u/torbtorb1
---
I'll throw this out there in response to a lot of the questions why Warlocks are very popular.
---
The video MadSeason linked this poll under was his class picking guide. The first class he covers is Warlock, and he spoke favorably of them (he does of all classes), mentioning they are one of his favorites. The video is almost an hour long and the first 10 mins are about the Warlock. Food for thought. 
---
You can also carry more than one spellstone. You can carry one of each rank. I had a macro in vanilla that would swap out my spellstone for the next rank after I used it. So I had a new self-dispel and mini-shield every 30 seconds if I needed it.
---
As of when? I had blue walls during downloading in BFA.
---
&gt; They need to be able to support up to 200 players in an area without sharding or excessive lag
---
Vanilla would've been soul-crushingly laggy at 200 players in one area too, let's not move the goalpost too much here just because certain private servers have 5x higher population than any real realm.
---
Retail's atrocious performance at a mere 40 players is unacceptable though.
---
I'm truly undecided yet. Eight years of Warrior main in retail, its what my gut tells me to roll as but I'll be playing mostly solo and with limited time to spend so its going to a grueling levelling and gearing up process to say the least if I pick the master class again.      
---
I'm so torn.
---

---
Healer: Paladin, priest or druid?
---
I never played healer in Vanilla, but want to do it this time around. I think i will use my time mainly on raids and pvp. So far i gathered the following pros and cons:
---
Priest: Good in raids, shadow could be fun in PVP, a bit squishy in pvp. Able to AOE farm with holy nova.
---
Paladin: Good in PVP, Good as MT healer in raids, I'm not sure if retri can be useful in PVP, will wear cloth most of the time, because it is hard to get healing plate gear.
---
Druid: Bad in Raids, good in PVP because of the utility, not sure if Feral will work in PVP/PVE.  
---
So far I'm leaning towards priest, did i miss anything?
---
I don't think people want it for AQ events because at that point u have established communties on the realm, only being able to see half your guild cause the other raid group in your guild is in another shard or your nemesis guild on the other faction etc. This kinda sucks.
---
Meanwhile starting zones doesn't have any "community" problems other then delaying for the first 10-ish levels, which isn't a big deal since no one knows anyone (and u can most likely still join your friends shard)
---
I used to play at a minimum of 350ms latency with disconnects every few hours and will be modifying my connection settings to mimic that.
---
nochanges
---
Probs... QQ the one button macros and decursive
---
Love your guides! What do you plan on covering next?
---
&gt;C’est la vie
---
Yup thats what im worried about. I dont think they would allow griefing of quest givers purely for the fact that it will just add a bunch of tickets to their customer service time that they seem to want to have to a minimal.
---
This is exactly what I keep telling people. I will continue to play Retail for the collecting, which I enjoy. But i'll also play Classic, because I enjoy and want to play a real MMORPG.
---
I laughed but it hurt a little
---
Yeah but if unofficial pservers hosted in eastern europe can make playable gameplay with 200 people in wpvp, then Blizzard should be able to do AT LEAST that well with official server hardware and all players in the same region
---
Especially the no-bridle/harness night elf sabers before they added it, replacing the original epic ones. It was kind of early on, so if you didn't have the money soonish, you were stuck with the new ones.
---
Read again lmao. I said Blizzard doesn't have magic, they have code. 
---
Baron mount
---
Was rather annoying how many Paladins I saw being played in TBC who didn't know how to use Judgement.
---
There aren't any other good arguments against sharding
---
So please stop pretending tank stance dancing can replace fear ward. Its misinformation that alot of people on this sub believe.
---

&gt; As for things like SL in pvp. At low gear score they simply don't have the HP to make it work. Warlocks are bad early on but will pick up in power as the expac moves on.
---
myep needs tier gear
---
They've become what they hate the most... toxic
---
Then again, thats just a symptom of being on Reddit
---
I think you were talking about the water totem story
---
Gnome anything tbh. Just don't like feeling so tiny.
---
Fight the good fight friend, I support you!
---
I agree and disagree with some of what you say.
---
IF sharding is used ONLY because of ressource problems it can be a big problem in the future.
---
The thing is it's not a problem in the starting zones, since community isn't build up yet. All it does is delay "the whole community" for the first lvl's. However it is a problem at AQ events (server is established and all guild should be able to see all guilds at this point). If they like u say decide to shard it will become a problem, but this is all theoritical. They said they will only use it in the start and aslong as they keep up that word it's not a problem like u say.
---
Also dynamic respawn is worse in my opnion. Even tho i grew to like dynamic respawn (because of private servers) we all know it's so far from classic like. U litterly can't do some escort quests, u die in caves cause of respawns, u die all the time cause of respawns when no one is near you, u can farm gold/ores/herb/items to eaisly.

well we have phones, don't we?
---
If you're scared of DKS then world pvp (and Tichondrius) are not for you.
---
Even if sharding completely ruins everyone early experience, then that just adds to authenticity, so everyone is satisifed.
---
Vanilla at launch was also an unplayable piece of shit.
---
Gonna be twinking in vanilla? Also you be playing on any of the current PServers?
---
I feel like this is what happens when devs get to set their own agenda instead of marketing/sales doing it for them.
---
This is nice.
---
&gt; I've watched just about all of Asmongold's videos
---
I'm sorry.
---
 Not viewable by the someone looking at your character, but I used to flex on my guild and the private server I was on for being first person to have all 18 slot bags
---
Play modern WoW, then. There is skill in understanding slow spell batching and playing accordingly.
---
There's a reason Brood War still has a massive playerbase despite its many technical flaws. 
---
You can buy tier 3 on the blackmarket AH sometimes. Might be the stem of his confusion.
---
Feral druids.   Any race.
---
Just never liked the playstyle at all
---
You stated "that's NOT how it worked." I don't care how you think it would dilute your point, because you said something you didn't mean because you felt like 'making your point seem strong.'  
---
This is furthered by you telling me to 'toughen up.' All you've done is make your opinion not matter to me, because you say things to sound better rather than state the truth.   
---
Am I using ad hominem? Or am I calling you out on being wrong? I know being called narrow-minded seems like an insult, but your post proves it: you'd prefer to make your point 'sound strong' than state the truth of the matter.  Your entire argument was based on it, so I'm well within my parameters of the argument to call you out. 
---
I'm not continuing this with you. Bye.
---
WTB release date
---
Night Elf with any class, period
---
I hate elfs. 
---
Dwarf master race. 
---
These announcements say more than the just the feature they discuss. It shows intent and a sneak insight into the depths they’re going. 
---
Fully on board, they have my complete trust again and I might be getting giddy, but it feels like they’re having fun again too. 
---
Yeah, there were definitely tanks in the 40m WotLK battleground. It was called something funny like wintersmess or something like that...
---
&gt; additionally reduce the work needed to be put into content by Blizzard.
---
I don't think you realize just how much time and effort it would take to implement your "fun little idea"
---
Not scared for myself, worried that most wont want to participate in organized PvP removing my favorite feature.
---
I'll be twinking fo sure, but it's not my main priority, that will be endgame. I have some characters on Light's Hope, but they're on the dead realm so atm im test leveling a hunter on the other one preparing for Classic :) But i'm doing so very casually as not to tire b4 launch. 
---
You hype for Classic? What'll you be playing?
---
I have plans for every class, except paladin.
---
I cant just auto-attack my way to 60. 
---
I believe they will make a forum post about sharding soon.   
---
They have already given us a lot of good info.   
---
So it  should probably come soon . Everything will be good in the end : )
---
&gt;on OUR new systems
---
Canine hunter pets are lousy in Horde raids. The darn pet keeps running off with some undead's leg in its mouth.
---
/u/Esfand is gonna look like the Ancient Aliens guy by launch with all these bombshells coming down in blue text. Dude looks more shocked every time he posts.
---
Exactly, tried that once, it felt so bad. We all started to leave the server, because we never saw a horde.
---
Oh hell yeah. Hotw Druid all the way. 
---
But I wants them, my precious.
---
The only raid I would love to see, besides the existing ones, is kara.
---
Pretty bad poll with a "joke" answer and an undecided option.
---
I couldn't even dream of it. Thanks Blizzard.
---
Actually you can still talk in party chat too, as long as it is a manually-created party. You are only squelched from LFG/LFR groups in retail. personal parties are considered a "private channel"
---
Alliance. 
---
Are they really that bad in raids later in the expansion? I see many mixed responses. I am kind of leaning towards hunter (haven't played them before/rotation looks fun/seem to have a lot of depth), but every time I settle on them as a choice I see them getting bashed. Other options I'm considering are Warlock (boring pve rotation), Rogue(slowish levelling, rotation doesn't look as fun as hunter), Warrior(slow levelling, bad at farming/soloing) and I know that all three perform better in raids than hunters will. I want to play what I will enjoy but at the same time don't want to have a really hard time finding groups because of my class. Another thing I was considering is starting with a Hunter then turning him into a pvp focused char by the end of the expansion when my alt reaches 60, although that depends on timing and if I can be bothered since I haven't played vanilla before.
---
i would rather see dynamic spawn like Nostralius had, in the "beginning" 
---
Glitching up the wall in 19s bracket with a twink pally with the horde flag in warsong. It was such a dick thing to do but man it felt great at the time. 
---
comment got removed cause i mentioned server name
---
so repost: 
---
 I'll be twinking fo sure, but it's not my main priority, that will be  endgame. I have some characters on the *Hopeful Light server* but they're on the dead  realm so atm im test leveling a hunter on the other one preparing for  Classic :) But i'm doing so very casually as not to tire b4 launch. You  hype for Classic? What'll you be playing? 
---
Git gud i guess
---
same here, how do I conquer the hump?
---
City raids are another topic, and I can see where those people come from. 
---
Personally, I never had issues with DKs, and city raids were rare enough to not worry about it. I do think it'd make sense to not have them throughout the entire game, but if they are there it won't be the end of world PvP. I'm ok whether they do or do not add them. 
---
All this said, there are gankers who literally won't care for DKs, so it's not necessarily an anti-griefing mechanic either like some say...
---
Absolutely based 
---
Ok, my erection has been lasting since this post is it time to call the doctor?
---
I can’t play any Gnome. Can’t stand being so small. It’s a shame because Gnome racials are so strong in Vanilla. 
---
Quick someone tell tipsout to make an uneccisarily long video which can suffer through until esfand covers it.
---
Hunters suck tbh, dont play them. I recommend rolling lock
---
What Eredun basically said. Everything around me was frozen, and I met the wall off the coast of Kalimdor.
---
Ya man. 
---
No. Modern WoW is a shit game, please stop gatekeeping.
---
Just take my fukin money already!
---
There are pieces of the T1 set that can be bought on the auction house. They are normally pretty cheap after guilds start farming MC. In order to buy T3 you would need to pay a high end guild to take you on a raid and it would be insanely expensive.
---
Do you have any ideas on your mind that you could stock up during the beginning and sell off later at 60 for more profit? example: maybe leather raises in prices 500% after the leveling phase. good thing i was able to buy stacks of heavy leather for 1g and can now sell them for 5g   
---
That has to be a alliance char using orb of deception right? Since he is yellow and the char taking the screen shot is horde. 
---
Not saying your wrong because the skin is an orc.  
---
Don't worry, once BGs come out mass scale world pvp will die down again. So if the honor system and BGs release at the same time then SS vs TM will probably only be a thing for a couple weeks for nostalgia then people will do full time bgs for honor ranks. Me? Bitter about BGs? Naaaah
---
The source code was never lost.
---
Game data was where the problem was. And they recovered a snapshot of that from an old back-up.
---
Definitely Teebu’s. But that’s more like a Patek Philippe. 
---
While that's possible, it is also possible that single-threaded server performance has not increased as much as parallelization and energy efficiency, leading to the modern WoW struggles with large groups of players.
---
When they added sharding, it took some of the pressure off...and priorities changed.
---
my bank alt always ends up more pimped than my main character if I spend an extended time on a server. I also let him or her stay at lvl 1 by default.  and use that character as my main one to socialize with the usual crowed in Iron Forge. My lvl 60 is more a servant for my lvl 1 that raids and brings in extra cash.  
---
Eventually the lvl 1  will have every rare pet that is tradable,  100g rings from Booty Bay, some fancy weapon enchants and enchants on every armor item that is enchantable at lvl 1 (feet, wrist, chest)  Actually I don;t know if those Librams (head, feet) can be put on lvl 1 white items, but that is next to  try.  
---
The only thing I won't do that is technically possible, is to get 2x Arena Grandmaster trinkets. that's too much work and my lvl 1 is all about letting others do the work....
---
For MC, definitely not. That place is piss easy, even BWL is pretty easy. What people don't actually realize is the hardest part of raiding is making it to naxx. There is a lot of dead time on hardcore guilds cause they clear shit really fast so you kinda just have to level an alt or make some gold. 
---
Anyone who was hardcore on a private server always tryhards the hardest at beginning. Like those guys, if they work jobs, take off time at work because it's that big of a deal. The hardest part of vanilla is literal burnout, it's just a constant day in and day out if you want to get into naxx.
---
It's not necessarily demanding mechanically or whatever people define as "skill", it's more like going to work and half assing on autopilot but you have to do it nearly everyday on vanilla if you want T3.... Or just have good connections.
---
Hi, /u/Magus5311
---
Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros
---
Bring the memories of the research you did if the fights you expect to see, appropriate consumables, a good attitude, and patience. Herding 40 people takes a surprising amount of time. 
---
Not in this case. Removing people’s investments keeps them from staying attached. It’s why a lot of us never played private servers. 
---
Da, comrade!
---
Sick leave it is than.
---
There are a few quests that give bags for a reward. You can also grind for DMF tickets so you can purchase the 14-slot storage box which is pretty good if you get it early. Crafting offers some options, too.
---
Ironforge Airstrip should still be possible, just more difficult. Hyjal maybe not, I think it teleported you out in late vanilla? Maybe they'll forget to add the teleport in Classic? Under Stormwind will definitely still be possible unless they make terrain changes, as it was not related to the engine, just a derpy bit of wall being walkthrough, which still happens nowadays (cough cough Tomb of Sargeras, that was a funny one).
---
Nowadays, most of my exploration involves the everlasting mount-bug (alt F4ing at the last split second of a mount cast, logging back in and jumping through the wall) and a toy that lets you sit in a seat. The toy won't be in Classic, but there's not as many invisible walls so it won't matter, just gotta find new routes to stuff.
---
I'm pretty sure virtually every mob in the game has a small chance of dropping a bag. The higher the level the bigger the bag. You shouldn't have too much of an issue gathering them as you level. Worst case scenario if you have terrible luck you can buy them from the AH pretty cheaply.
---
The undesirables won't make it to 60. Problem solved. 
---
Just stop with these posts already
---
Yes, from the archmages
---
I hope that in some way they preserve the ability to explore, and / or that people find new ways to do so in the old map with the modern engine.  Exploration was always my favorite thing, and while everything's been found by now and is posted on youtube, it'd be nice to be able to visit things in person again, or for the first time.
---
Princess Huhuran is one fight I am not looking forward to. Nearly broke the guild due to the enrage, nature gear farm and that run back was horrible since not everyone had aq mounts.
---
black battletank &gt; everything else
---
hmm, I deleted Data to recover disk space somewhere in Legion, then started playing again, and had no blue walls - just missing buildings, walls, textures, etc - and invisible walls
---
Nothing that I've said contradicts the no changes argument, you're seeing lines where there aren't any. 
---
Huh, maybe it only shows in latter stages of downloading?
---
Yelling 'did you even read my comments' after I told you to re-read the post is not a response. Gear=/=class. We get it, #nochanges, you must have played a warrior, rogue, mage, or priest on your pserver, but for 100% of vanilla people were complaining about how useless some class/specs were.
---
Why should half of the class/specs be pointless? We can totally do some classic style tweaks, and have something other than a warrior/rogue blender.
---
There's a reason that Dwarves are noted for being heavy drinkers. That reason being female dwarves and that beer goggles work.
---
Martin Fury. The old one.
---
Other way around is much more fun. 
---
No, city raids and world dragon raids. People claimed the servers wouldnt be able to handle them. That was always nonsense, but this put it to bed for good. The current servers are running muuch higher tick rates causing significantly more stress on the servers when lots of people gather in one spot.
---
I'd say a player stress test of "world boss" type situation. 300+ people in one small area.  Any kind of test showing the servers aren't going to grind to a halt when a 40v40+ would be great like on retail.  I guess this might have more to do with particle effects now vs back then.
---
Man you got me cracking up during the gear skit you did. That shit WOULD be so loud! 
---
undead is the completely obvious choice; wotf is still very important in pve as well.
---
plus, cannibalize is BiS teabag
---
If you read the post it says modern WoW still uses spell batching, just at a much faster frequency so literally all they have to do is turn down that frequency to that of Vanilla's. Simultaneously vanilla like spell batching AND less load on servers since they have to perform exponentially less spell calculations per game tick.
---
I don't think it's that so much as they are paranoid that blizz will keep it in/expand it everywhere just to punish them personally.
---
Pay a tailor 50 silver to craft bags with your materials, it's just cloth and thread. 
---
Sent you a chat message instead:P props easier.
---
All props to u/platinum_monkey
---
Wearing a full Tier two set was the Rolex of WoW. People forget that back in the day very few people were able to reliably raid BWL due to skill/party size restrictions.
---
People saying “legendaries” are wrong. Having Atiesh or the Scarab mount is like wearing a rare Patek Phillipe. Rolex’s, like Tier two sets, are hard to get, but people can still afford them.
---
Warrior is the best class in vanilla. 
---
I didn't see the post from yesterday till I read your comments, but also that post didn't provide any solutions. This one does.
---
I don't think you'll run into any issues playing a hunter. Their DPS might not compare to a warrior or mage in the harder raids, but they're still viable and you need at least a few for Tranq. Shot. I love hunters and think they're the most fun class for pvp or if you're leveling solo. The only reason I'm not going to main a hunter is because I did that last time around.
---
SCARAB LORD 
---
&gt;then there is no such thing as collateral damage
---
"Acceptable casualties" 
---
;)
---
These links must be the shittiest "proof" I've ever seen. First off the bottom 3 literally don't even have screenshots. Its just some dude claiming "Bro I disconnected and it was definitely because of mass report!"
---
The first one has screenshots of random Twitch clips. Like "He was hovering his mouse over my name, that proves he was considering a report!" 
---
Real proof would be somebody getting disconnected, logging back in, and showing that they are indeed squelched. Not one of those show that. A disconnect is always bundled with a squelch, yet none of these demonstrate that. 
---
Seriously... a million armchair quarter backs are what fucked up wow in the first place.
---
Go horde. Nihilum back in vanilla days were the top guild and they were horde. 
---
I'm just confused. 
---
Should there NOT be a penalty for griefing by killing quest NPCs? Is that what you're arguing?
---
that stupid slime pet which sold for what was it? 8000g?
---
I'm all for lots of warlocks. Give me those health stones, SS's, and summons! They're so convenient to have one in the party. 
---
Rohk‘delar.
---
My bets for a Thursday. I remember WotLK being released on a Thursday and it gives me a reason to be "sick" on Friday and not have to work. 
---
DMF won't be in the first phase.
---
I bet a lot plan on tanking 5 mans, but very few plan on being a MT, or even an OT. I want to tank while leveling and getting pre-raid BiS, but don't have the time commitment to be a MT.
---
Eh, You'd always be able to find someone in your group that hasn't turned in the head yet without having to use alts for the buff with raid turn over. And not everyone wanted/needed the items from the head turn in.
---
ikr
---
my friends list will be full of tanks
---
I will look for addons to extend the list past 50
---
So post your solution in that thread, or the one from the day before. 
---
There's like a million of them already, just pick your favorite.
---
Yes!!! They are really doing a lot of things right, I feel thrilled. 
---
The bags in Vanilla are nothing like they are on private servers. You're lucky to get one or two by the time your 20 sometimes. On private servers, I had 4 bags before I was level 7.  
---
The best way it probably to tailor them yourself if you go tailoring. Otherwise, hopefully a friend or guildy can make them for you.
---
Go troll, you'll be a vanity.
---
One other reason this is super notable is because they even mentioned, its a BIG change from how retail works. Retail has multiple threads, all checking different things at different times. For Classic, they've done the work to convert this back to Vanilla's single massive loop. Thats a legitimately large code change, and it shows they aren't shying away from big code changes. 
---
&gt;I went on record saying it wouldn't happen and it looks like I'm completely wrong
---

---
horde still play like that
---
BRING IT IN FOR A HUG BUDDY
---
Tailors craft TONS of those things early on.  It’s a reliable way to get good money out of your cloth drops.  I wouldn’t worry about them appearing on the AH unless you’re planning on being one of the first to 60, and even then you’ll probably be ok.  
---
Many won't go past level 10/12, some will quit after first dungeon since you need to play and can't AOE everything down, if not they will quit when grinding for their mount , etc .
---
Can confirm
---
&gt;I didn't see the post from yesterday till I read your comments
---
Oh, yeah that is normal. However what we meant is that modern day Barrens on pservers is 24/7 politics, religion, anti-gay stuff, etc... 
---
It was bad before, and its bad now, but its a different kind of "bad"
---
I was being sarcastic about people who say no changes.
---
Theyre literally answering things I had no idea existed and I am super pumped. 
---
I hardly see any young people playing wow in general. I've been in my guild for around 2 years now and we've had a decent amount of people come and go but the ones I've talked to in discord are usually late 20's or 30+. 
---
A priest and I would solo Strat Live for rightous orbs and sell them in the AH. Each run would net 3-5 orbs, or 60-100g. Plus all the cloth and shards/dust we'd get from greens and blues. We'd split upwards of 200g a run. 
---
External force has been applied to the data that creates a systematic bias.

This is really a thing people remember from vanilla?
---
They are asking me to log into my wow account...they also gave me 3 hour of game time to let me do that.
---
it's a scam delete it
---
Disgusting Oozeling was actually the first vanity pet i got. Bought it heavily underpriced from AH (like under 50g) during vanilla. Didnt even know its real value until WotLK.
---
Its not lmao
---
Eh? 1200p LCD screens were already pretty common in 2004 not to mention towards the end of vanilla, I played most of Vanilla on the Dell 2405 a 24” 1920x1200 monitor.
---
If only there was a way to delete posts...
---
&gt; resulting in two sheep nervously pacing around at range 
---
This made me laugh.
---
When did I say the former exactly? I do think it destroys the community feel tho, but I dont care about the game being this huge thing for millions to enjoy, I just want the game to be good for me, how is that weird lol? I want to play a game I think is good, and if I dont think it is I wont pay or play, simple as that, no hard feelings lmao
---
For starters: if you have the blue PvP set or T0.5 you can tank any 5m dungeon you want as long as you learn the class. You'll want to get spellpower items for your ring, neck, and weapon slots.
---
Also: The blue PvP set is still hard to get if you can't spend a lot of time playing and neither of these sets will be out when the game launches. You'll need to make due with Lightforge/Deathbone until those sets are released. Tanking is still doable, but you won't make as much threat without a spellpower set.
---
Either way: You're going to need to run a lot of dungeons as a healer or DPS to build your prot set before you can tank.
---
I had a paladin tank back in 2006 and it was fun to tank 5m dungeons on it, but you do have to deal with some wonky itemization.
---
The thing is when you play classic you need to play different. Even just talking and grouping up.
---
You aren't popping cooldowns and dropping that elite alone. If you group up with people and are a dick, you're gonna end up on ignore lists since there's an actual community.
---
People might expect and try to play the game differently but your aren't going to get very far. 
---
I don't think it's gonna be a problem long. Might be different in BFA with the classic hate but in classic I don't think it's gonna matter past lv 20ish.  Once you put that much time in you're gonna be a different player
---
Here is the solution:  PVP servers don't get DKs, PVE servers do.  
---
Copying code and understanding code is definitely not the same thing
---
Love murdering some chickens/rabbits before a pull with 2-3 mobs.
---
You mean being prepared just in case there are more than expected is a bad look? Imagine if they don’t have enough and people are stuck in q’s.
---
I remember that. I think. I at least recall that he once made a vid where he went on describing how gamers think or what they want, and that some developers don't get the concept of dungeons or such, while he was in AQ40. Maybe his opinion about Vanilla was more nuanced, or maybe he changed his mind. In either case I'm sure he would've done a Let's Play of Classic and review the experience. It's sad that can't anymore.
---
I had a bunch of 6 slotters dropping back when I first played in Vanilla.  Had good luck in the cave in Valley of Trials.  
---
u/Silverlight42 you remember the alleria recruitment video?  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l07tc2jafa4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l07tc2jafa4) 
---
I was in Toca's guild.  (Tendrils of Mannoroth)  Unfortunately I didn't make it in the video as I joined them after the video.  I think I ended up not being able to participate in the AQ opening because my computer was such a piece of garbage that it locked up if I get anywhere near the gates.  
---
Yeah I plan on having both a Hunter and a Rogue at 60 and at 19 as well, but want to start with a 60 hunter for the gold grinding, and once I have Pre-bis I'll work on leveling a rogue to 60. And once o fully twink my rogue I'll start working on a twink hunter as well. 
---
Hype hype hype hype hype 
---
I was just disappointed he didn't keep Alex Jones voice for the chicken, I almost pissed myself laughing at the last video ! :D

I'm not a fan of sharding, but I'm even less a fan of elongating a 2 hr leveling process from 1-10 into a 5 hour see-who-can-tag-first bonanza. Outside of starter zones there should be no sharding.
---
thanks for the help!! I'll be sure to just repost it when a similar one didn't happen recently.

I don't watch twitch so I don't have links for you. Hundreds of threads have been made on the wow forums discussing this issue. 
---
yeah its a tough question for their sys admins or whoever!  with queues you get unhappy gamers but kinda good press and a sense of exclusivity and hype... with empty servers people feel like the game isnt worth investing time into but at least they can play
---
Naxx on K1, it was very fun
---
Personally I'm down with disabling world buffs in raids and buffing boss armor (to balance dps specs) but it probably won't happen

tailors will do it for free with ur mats.. for skill ups
---
Some people just like to watch the world burn.
---
I remember farming it forever, never dropped during vanilla, got it in a later expansion but it just wasn't the same anymore ;(
---
I also remember that there was a use for that pet, can't remember what it was good for tho...
---
I was a Ralph Wiggums, and my guild leaders were Super Nintendo Chalmerses. 
---
The players will come to a world where they see people doing things with other people. Cooperating. Talking. Interacting in ways they have not for years on retail.
---
Some players have never encountered a world like this.
---
Yeah the pace is gonna be slow and nobody is gonna give you a free epic just for showing up, but nothing will ever replace that player to player interaction. 
---
This is what will hook people. 
---
the 6slotters have a broken drop rate
---
but the others seem normal to me
---
You probably should have played the lottery!
---
True, invisibility potions are a thing.
---
Thanks, that gave me a good chuckle...mostly because it hits really close to home.
---
That's a SSSick intro
---
Raids in vanilla need warm bodies more than anything. There's no such thing as *more raid slots for x class" unless you're progression raiding, which 99% of players don't do 
---
Again, that video doesn't show anything. It shows a dude disconnecting.

Any non-warrior with Ironfoe if you really want to put people on tilt

Anything not human paladin.
---
In Vanilla, you could usually get 4 by the time you leave the starting zone. If not, you can buy 6 slot bags cheaply enough. Later on, just pay a tailor to make them.

I thought I recall PvP kills not affecting armor durability...
---
Prot Warrior. I cant kill you but you can't kill me and I'm super annoying! Checkmate!
---
Here is a weekly update from my world:
---
Started playing a private server a few weeks ago with my friends. I can confirm: It is fun as hell. I don't care that all our progress will be wiped in a few months when Classic launches. The game legitimately is THAT fun.
---
do you run with any Spriests? thats what im looking to roll
---
I think its more that people don't trust Blizzard to restrict its uses to the start of the game.  That's what I tend to see more of.  
---
I feel they'll figure out a way to restrict to the starting zones, and make our gate openings and WPvP work without it.  They've come thru on so much, to botch that would be a cardinal sin, and I don't see them doing that.  
---
We really need a rule to stop people from posting these post naxx threads lol
---
I'm not saying it's a bad thing at all, I think the pic is awesome :D but knowing how big of a deal BRE is on private servers, I imagine those folks' heads are spinning. That's all!

---
Listening to feedback is how retail got to where it is, anyways. They understand the different market each game targets. 
---
See those things floating the background? Those are shards. Sharding at event confirmed.
---
Something i learned later (read; past year, also correct me if im wrong):if you spamsummoned the pet with a macro, you could override some debuffs from your character with the pet debuff - like the c'thun stomach debuff.
---
Orb of Deception is like...20g on the AH.
---
But for the noobs who click target you're slippery af and can hide in big bushes. Plus Escape Artist is arguably the best warrior pvp racial.
---
Right! It's not even an issue, it's honestly a huge plus. If the game were to release without starting zone sharding I'd be really reluctant to start leveling at launch. FWIW, even with fast respawns on private servers, I *still* remember new realm launches being a madhouse of people trying to tag mobs. I can't even begin to imagine what that would be like with proper mob respawns without sharding.
---
Mind vision. I use it so often to figure out where the hell my raiders are.
---
Curse of Recklessness
---
I dunno if it's my favorite, but I have very fond memories of leveling in areas with mobs that would flee when they got to low health, and CoR to stop them from pulling others felt soo satisfying and warlocky.
---
Come, let the bloodlust take you and willing meet your death head on! 
---
Yeah, but they're usually super cheap on the AH...at least on the pserv stuff I've done recently they are.
---
I think they look cool at level 60 with some raid gear. Before that they're lanky looking nerds
---
Is finding a tank that hard on PServers? I played vanilla but can't remember how easy or hard finding a tank was. 
---
It's the unknown...I don't know what is at the bottom much less how far down it goes.
---
In early vanilla before the warrior talent rework, both DPS and tank warriors were Arms. Because Fury and Protection were both garbage.
---
Except that's not a current issue for Blizzard to resolve (they've quite clearly explained how they intent to use sharding).
---
Blizzard can't fix people complaining about something they already said isn't going to happen...
---
Well either way Blizzard is making adjustments thanks to the autistic screaming, so I don’t mind it.
---
I won't play hunter, because that's what I played in vanilla. However, I was only like 9 at the time and didn't really know what I was doing. I loved the class though because of the pet loyalty system. It really made choosing a pet worthwhile because you stuck with it, trained it, fed it, and in return it helped you kill everything. 
---
I never raided though, but every class I've considered this far are also being bashed. Here's where I'm at: I'm going to think about the different games I've played like Skyrim, DotA, Killing Floor. What type of classes do I play, melee or ranged? Once I narrow that down, do I like physical damage or magic damage? And so on and so on until I figure it out. I only got to 42 on my hunter because I kept seeing awesome people in cities and making alts when I saw what they looked like. This time, I wanna hit max level more than anything. 
---
You'd think they'd just keep commenting on the original thread that started it all
---
make it a guild at that point
---
Hilarious. I don't get why they banned you.
---
I joined during pitch 1.9.  Every world pvp group I was ever in ended when some jagoff killed some civvy and drew a DK.
---
Winterspring Saber for sure
---
I want to look like that paladin. Bad ass
---
The voicechat is talking about mass reporting a player on the other team, then that player disconnects. Do you really think this is just a coincidence? That all of threads when that pop up when you google "wow report abuse rbg" are all fake/coincidence? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/an0dxc/blizzard_has_dropped_the_ball_on_the_new_report/

Why is nobody calling out OP for lying in this /r/wow thread? 
---
You must be high OP.. I wouldn't pay a **DIME** for WoW in any way, shape or form!
---
Gnome
---
Hunter has so many weaknesses and very limited practicality at endgame. There's a reason it's dropped. 
---
With modern theorycrafting, we know hunter is a high skill, low reward class that only really excels at leveling. It can hold its own in PvP, but it's not amazing by any means. 
---
Warrior really isn't the right class to play if you want to be casual.
---
Graphics like what ? Increased foliage and better shadow/lightning? Sure I like that. New models ? No. New animations ? No.
---
Orc for Ench, Troll for Resto, Tauren for the memes. 
---
"tampering with the economy" was the reason.
---
No, Wow.exe
---
Have that pinned.
---
That sub was shit since cata was released
---
You could farm the harvester rare in westfall for early good bags. (I think they are 10 or 12 slots)
---
I farmed 4 in the demo for lulz xD
---
As I suspected, bunch of stupid videos as soon as the update comes. The post perfectly describes what it is.
---
I can't wait for your pvp guide!

A paladin with Bonereaver's Edge... /wrists

If you play correctly (i. e. taking the Scatter Shot talent in any lategame scenario) it’ll be exceedingly difficult for anyone to stick on you

I think we are underestimating just how many people will quit by mid level 30

Moonwalking.

Alright Neo take it easy
---
Well I didn’t even know spell batching is a thing. 
---
This
---
Historically, I recall it being 100-300g on my Vanilla server. Times have changed, I guess.
---
hwly shit dude me too! Surely Blizz already has a date set.... please just give it to us! I need to tell work when im not comming! 
---
I have a feeling by the time it's released, they will have one or two of them. The conversation has been real.
---
The best tanks, great DPS, and monsters in PvP. Can’t go wrong. 
---
How about.. Just make the NPCs unkillable?
---
2-3 nights a week and weekends is actually a fairly substantial amount of time, for what it's worth. Most people aren't raiding 7 days a week.
---
I recall it being around 2-300 too. 
---
Having one dedicated RP PVP server will most likely be the most populated server filled with the biggest wPVP. They need it 
---
&gt; Every world pvp group I was ever in ended when some jagoff killed some civvy and drew a DK.
---
What was the goal of the world pvp group?
---
LFM deadmines 
---
I’ll take that into account. Thanks. 
---
And from Blizzard's side, it's an insanely easy thing to add. It really just comes down to enough visible support to make the infrastructure dedication for a few RP-PVP servers worth it.
---
The Venture Co. Miners?
---
If my memory is correct, I remember watching a video of someone with a very low level alt in all spirit gear, swimming in fatigue just fine
---
They might be able to pre-pair servers from the start, so they wouldn't let anyone on server A and server B have the same name. And then they could merge those two servers at a later date if needed. The downside would obviously be that the pairing and merging wouldn't be an intelligently done as it would if you did it after the fact, but it seems like it could help.
---
Charge &gt; Battle Shout is a combo used to down every critter. 
---
Someone else mentioned they would have to cherry pick which to make invulnerable and such.
---
Serious question: Do you believe blizzard would spend time doing that?
---
This is glorious. I remember playing in vanilla and tbc and enjoying the flow of combat, but later wrath/cata, the combat changed, the pace was different. My skills didn't respond as i had learnt and enjoyed, it just felt wrong. I could never quite put my finger on what it was, and it was frustrating.
---
Fast forward to 2018, and talks about "spell batching". I was (am) a hardcore vanilla enthusiast, and had never heard the term. After reading/listening and understanding what this was, the mystery of combat flow being changed (worsened, in my eyes) was solved. That itself was quite the satisfaction, to have an 8 year old mystery solved.
---
Imagine now, my utter and complete satisfaction at the fact that combat will flow as it did back then. This is huge. This is legendary.
---
&lt;3 classic team. You guys rock.
---
Thank you
---
The only forms of PvP in classic WoW are Battlegrounds and duels. "World PvP" doesn't actually exist. The terms people should be using instead of "World PvP" is ganking, trolling, and griefing. Absolutely keep DK's in the game. If you want to PvP, head to the front gates of your city or step into a BG. If you want to troll and grief, you can already do that pretty much anywhere in the world. DK's are one of the only protections against the open world griefers and they should not be removed.
---
Yup. Blind being one of them. You can blind a Vanish, or flip it and Vanish the Blind. 
---
Vanishing death coils (and instant with a fast travel time) ability is also common. 
---
Mage mage mage!!! Mfin wizard Harry.
---
Undead for sure, I love their casting animations and i'd rather have a pvp racial over pve.
---
&gt;What about not seeing your friends and guildmates ingame while in the same zone?
---
Grouping always put you in the same shard
---
&gt;What about killing a rare and then you phase out into a new shard and lose the kill? 
---
Why would this happen? Also rares in vanilla were actually rare, so the odds of this happening with hundreds of players per zone are negligable
---
&gt;What about shard-jumping in PvP?
---
What PvP? You think some level 15 player from another faction will make the run to your starting zone just to fight people?
---
&gt;Herbs and ores phasing out as you are about to get them etc. 
---
That's phasing, not sharding, and even if it happened 1/10 times, you at least get to play the game.
---
Yea it happened that I got unlucky sometimes but it's a hell of a lot safer than picketpocket running BRD. 
---
If you get resisted there you're much more likley to die plus there's a long run back. The upside is that you can net higher running BRD though so it's risk&lt;reward.
---
The boots are wrong, Chromatic Boots are BiS and match the pink aesthetic. Orc BWL BiS is Deathbringer + Crul'Shorukh. Non-Orc AQ BiS is EITHER CTS or AQR MH, but still with Maladath OH.
---
Whats the drop rate on those bad boys?
---
I'm sure the tryhard neckbeards will gravitate towards their own guilds and become each others problems.
---
I wonder if these different experiences have to do with the classes each of us played. 
---
That priest one certainly applied to me in TBC. Appearance and vanity is important for a belf priest!
---
In vanilla, my undead priest is going to look like shit no matter what. Benediction will be the only thing to improve his appearance. 
---
The prophecies are coming true!
---
ANYONE KNOW THE ESTIMATED SPELL BATCH TIME? LIKE HOW MANY MILLISECONDS ABOUT?
---
If you don't care about anything but yourself then sharding is not a problem. It will make leveling 1000% better.
---
Depends on what you think classic wow is. If you think it is just a tribute to what wow used to be then yea sure the graphics dont matter. But to people who want to go back and play and faithful a recreation as Blizz can make (the #nochange crowd) then it absolutely matters that everything stays as close to the source material as possible.
---
Blizzard seems to be echoing these ideas as they are going out of their way to make all these small mechanics exactly like they used to be.
---
As long as you speak English, the more the merrier
---
Underrated comment here
---
Yeah but that's not what anyone says. Also this is an even more disliked thing i'm pretty sure. It's like trading 1 problem to a new problem. Only reason "we" like dynamic respawn is because of private servers, but it actually destorys the game way more then sharding (like escort quests, cave u die at etc)
---
Lets actually compile a list for each class to get a good overview.
---
**Druid**
---
Druids have it good when it comes to PvP/PvE hybrid specs.
---
The typical PvP Swiftmend spec (8/11/31 +1) is optimal for WSG flag carrying, dueling/defending in AB and can yield decent results for PvE healing, allthough a bit weaker than a deep resto Swiftmend spec in that regard.
---
Standard Feral (14/32/5) for off-tanking, cat DPS and situational main-tanking in raids can also be powerful for PvP. It trades the survivability of a Swiftmend spec for more damage and zerging power.
---
The HotW hybrid tank/heal spec (0/30/21) is a nice tradeoff between the two above, for both PvE raiding and PvP. This is the only true hybrid spec for Druids and should be taken for flexibility rather than efficiency.
---
The Moonglow healing spec (24/0/27) combines high healing efficiency with decent offensive caster abilities. It is both a good raiding and PvP spec.
---
**Hunter**
---
The two Marksman raiding specs (0/31/18 +2) and (20/31/0) are decent for PvP allthough suboptimal since they can't aquire either Intimidation or Counterattack, which are both top tier PvP talents compared to Trueshot Aura. But Hunters have no problem grinding respeccing costs, especially since they are already light on raid consumables compared to most classes.
---
The optimal PvP specs are BM (31/14/0 + 6), Intimidation + Scatter (21/21/9) and Scatter + SV (0/21/30).
---
**Mage**
---
Like Hunters they don't suffer too much from raiding specs in PvP because they are "good enough" allthough suboptimal. Even though their raid consumables are on the more expensive side, they are probably the fastest money makers in the whole game, so I won't even go much into detail here. As a Mage you'll be basically farming less than half of the time to respec compared to other classes.
---
For raiding they have Arcane/Frost (31/0/20) Fire (17/31/3) and Deep Frost with Winter's Chill (18/0/33).
---
For PvP they have POM/Pyro (21/30/0), Elemental (0/24/27) and Deep Frost (17/0/34).
---
**Paladin**
---
Paladins have it very easy. Their best raiding spec is also their best PvP spec with minor modifications/differences. Play around with (31/11/0 +9). They are probably the best choice for anyone who wants to have a great raiding and PvP class w/o ever having to respec.
---
I skip further discussion here because they are the class I know least about.
---
**Priest**
---
Priests, like Paladins also have it very good in this regard. Their most sought out raiding specs are Disc (healing) for Power Infusion (31/20/0) and Holy (21/30/0).
---
Shadow Priests are also brought to raids for their Shadow Weaving debuff (20/0/31) and if you sneak in Improved Manaburn over taking all 5 points in Mental Agility. There you go, you have a raiding spec and PvP spec in one.
---
There are also very strong hybrid specs like (17/13/21) which gets all the PvP goodies. But It won't be viable in a raid enviroment.
---
**Rogue**
---
I have to mostly skip this one as I know them just as much as Paladins. Their optimal PvP spec with Cold Blood &amp; Preparation fits their BG/PvP roles best as they are often on their own defending flags in WSG/AB or backcap or hunt down respawns. But most combat Rogues do just fine.
---
**Shaman**
---
Unlike Priests, Druids and Paladins their optimal PvP specs differ a lot from their optimal PvE specs.
---
The ele/resto spec that is commonly used by PvPers just doesn't have the the crucial healing talents of a raiding deep resto. And unlike Druids they are not trading healing power for something for raid role flexibility except you can find a way to make elemental dps work for raiding with ZG/AQ gear.
---
Even though Enhance is at least decent for raiding (still suboptimal) if you actually spec into all your totem improvements, it is really just a meme spec for PvP. Yes, they provide strong totems and can Purge as well, but they don't have the on-demand ranged burst damage from ele/resto and entirely rely on RNG. Their upside is ease of itemisation, because their dungeon and PvP gear sets suit them nicely.
---
**Warlock**
---
SM/Ruin, probably the most common WL spec, is a nice middleground between raiding efficiency and PvP. If you really want to min-max you'll spec into DS/Ruin for raids, since it scales better with gear and into SL or Destruction for PvP.
---
**Warrior**
---
Warriors have it the hardest. Somehow Blizzard managed to make a very well designed class and then gimp it with a talent tree that is highly specialized for either PvP, PvE DPS or PvE tanking.
---
Maybe some Warriors will make a prot build work for PvP, if they can sneak in points into Improved Revenge and Improved Shield bash, both of which are strong PvP talents.
---
But overall I would say this is the class that really *must* respec if they want to be competitive in both areas.
---
Must be playing a female warrior
---
I did not make it sadly. Just found it 
---
Sharding f.e., I'm just sure they gonna screw it up, the company is on a downhill slope totally disconnect from the fanbase for years now. I'm a fan of Wow Vanilla not Blizzard / Activision. Probably adding microtransactions to Classic.
---
Night Elf Male Priest, I once got wrecked hardcore by one in an AB back in the day, and I've held a special hatred for that combination since. He had that stupid face with the pouty lips too.
---
They will either love it or act as if it’s beneath them as if wq/warfront bs is good gameplay somehow. 
---
Invisible walls are a cardinal sin in video games.
---
Unsurprisingly, BfA dungeons are littered with them. IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO SOMEWHERE PUT SOMETHING IN THE WAY DAMNIT
---
&gt; I think we're going to see an extreme number of Warlocks this time around, seems like everyone is leaning that direction
---
I used to think that but empirical evidence suggests no. 
---
It doesn't matter how strong warlocks are, they are going to be one of the least played. Happens no matter the pserver or how broken they are in PvP or PvE.
---
I prefer keeping one button decursing out of it. Everyone thinking classic raids were easy (and to an extent, yes, they were) don't really see just how much was made automated / much, much easier than intended via scripts etc.  
---
I would like to be able to have multi-shift macros (i.e, druid having 1 button for travel form or aquatic form, being able to quick swap from bear -&gt; cat, etc). 
---
I think we can believe them if they are doing all these changes. Sharding will be needed at launch to make it as smooth as possible.
---
Sharding will not be around forever, or may not be in at all.
---
I worked IT at the time, and managed to stop them throwing out a 21" flat viewsonic crt that was used in the photography department. 
---
It was glorius
---
Humans should be allowed to take the faces off undead and wear them!
---
I'll be rolling human, because lets be honest, the REAL end game is rep grinding. You're only going to be raiding a couple days out of the week, the rest of your time will be spent making money and rep grinding.
---
Not to mention I would imagine the RP servers would have a lesser fall-off of players. Wonder what the stats are for servers like that- they mentioned 70%? of players never got past lv 30. Is that the same average for PvE, PvP, RPPvE and RPPvP?
---
Wait - so you first responded to me defending OP's idea by claiming that it's a mere itemization tweak and nothing more, but now you're straight up saying that Blizzard should be tweaking all the specs to make them viable?
---
I don't want to be a dick to you or anything, but you're just contradicting your own point. ONLY if you're a hardcore P.S raider, most of the specs are useless. However, there's nothing stopping a Druid from going Balance in PvP, or a Shaman going Elemental for the same thing. I can safely say that not a single spec in Classic is useless. It's just not optimized to do every role in every content of the game. This is with the exception of Arcane Mages, but the only reason why they're deemed useless is because Frost Mages are vastly superior to them, especially in early raid content and PvP.
---
Want to raid? Sure. Pay the toll and switch to a role where you're needed in a core. It's an RPG game. RPG games utilize strategy. This is where the word "Specialization" gets its meaning. Classes have specializations to do specific things.
---
Do you want to play a spec that can do anything, has every kind of utility and is perfectly in balance with every other spec of its role in the game? Do you want to play a game where you can voice your opinion about the gameplay and perhaps cause the developers to change it to a structure better suited to you in the next patch? Then Retail's probably a better choice, because Vanilla is Vanilla, and it's called **Classic WoW,** not Classic 2.0
---
I’ll be happy when they stop playing coy and give up the release date already it’s getting ridiculous 
---
I was a healer in surreal! I miss rokaz :) does anyone know what happened to him?
---
I think it's 40-50 ish. But actually getting to kill the spawn all the time is not that easy. I left my character at the spot for like 3 days and logged in during off hours when nobody would hunt it. It was constantly taken during the day.
---
Plus I think there is a quest that also gives you a 10 slotter there.
---
Anyway, if getting world first 60 is not a priority for you then it's worth taking the time to stock up with 10 slotters fully early on.
---
&gt;Why is nobody calling out OP for lying in this [/r/wow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow) thread?
---
You're wondering why nobody is defending Blizzard on a forum that notoriously hates Blizzard, during a time where the hate was particularly high? 
---
&gt; The voicechat is talking about mass reporting a player on the other  team, then that player disconnects. Do you really think this is just a  coincidence? That all of threads when that pop up when you google "wow  report abuse rbg" are all fake/coincidence? 
---
All I'm saying is that this shit is like bigfoot. All of these videos and claims that for some reason NEVER show that squelch at the end after a disconnect. That is all I want to see. 
---
Just out of curiosity, would all it take to make an RP-PVP server just be a regular PVP server with a different label? Or does having them create other problems, such as maybe more intensive moderation from GM's?
---
Exactly what I think will happen. It’s just been so long since that experience was possible on retail. When I play retail it’s jarring as hell to see the absence of what made wow great.
---
What's happening mommy? I'm scared.
---
I'm a fan of #nochanges till things settle and the games been going for a while. That said, things like the Furbolg Stronghold in Azshara, Kara in Deadwind, and Mt Hyjal are all things that would be really awesome to at least *entertain* the idea of.
---
Depending on your guild and what system they use to determine who gets what loot it won't take you long to get loot if you are consistently going to raids and helping people out. If you are in a guild that only wants to min max they probably won't last long.
---
nightfall is for the ret paladins
---
Chaining Far sights was awesome. Mind controlling NPCs to see if they have broken spells.
---
another reason why you should not play  a galagagagnoommme
---
Simpsons memes? Yes please
---
You've never felt the dopamine rush of 6 consecutive flips, I see
---
I have never, in the decade plus I played wow, ever found such welcoming and exciting communities as I did on RP-PVP servers. I neither RP nor PVP, but I will go for RP-PVP servers every time, just for the quality of people.
---
&gt;AQ set prices also required certain reputation levels to acquire the actual gear, regardless if you had the mats to turn them in.
---
Should not be an issue since you can farm to neutral on trash in a day with a full raid, and turn in artifacts/insignia to get exalted after two full clears.
---
Classic came out at the same time everyone loved Legolas from Lord of the Rings and rolled a Hunter to be like him. I can see the hunter cultural draw is much weaker today than back then. I guess anti heroes is more cool today.
---
Veterans also probably can go from Hunter to Warlock because of several factors like #1 DPS rotation being much simpler for Warlock #2 Warlock having higher DPS #3 Warlock being conceived as crazy OP in PvP 1v1 #4 Feeding pet and arrows being higher level of annoying than farming soul shards.
---
I can totally see a drastic change in interest on these 2 classes
---
I predict TipsOut will read this very Reddit comment in a 10+ minute YouTube video.
---
AFAIK the only differences are social ones, like enforcement of naming conventions. Blizzard has apparently gotten pretty lax with enforcing the rules on retail RP servers.
---
Theresa May WoW Classic meme is peak 2019 for me. Brilliant :D
---
Yea, Orcs and Gnomes hold god-tier for warriors in PvP
---
I'm having the same debate about my alt. In vanilla, I twinked a druid for a while and then leveled him to 60 just before TBC and I only played a shammy a little and never to 60. I can't decide between them. 
---
Feral can definitely tank and do reasonable DPS in dungeons, but if you want to raid I think you're going to be stuck healing for quite a while. But from what I read, a shaman will be resto in raids, too. Some of that depends on your guild and how hardcore they are. Also it depends on raid progression. 
---
I loved Feral in BGs, but I hear enhance shammies were really bursty and fun.
---
&gt; cow Druids are so ugly
---
You take that back right now!
---
Thank you!!! 
---
How did you get pala and shaman on the same grp... Witchcraft
---
Training and Mount costs were switched at some point?
---
&gt; Periodic non lethal fire damage will tick for too much and make your healers oom before the boss is dead, or you might get 1 shot when the tank decides he wants razorgore to breathe fire on the whole raid, or you'll die before you can react and get out of the fire against Onyxia, etc.
---
Nobody wears FR gear in MC or BWL except the tanks on some fights. A few Greater Fire Protection Potions as needed + not being stupid and you'll be fine.
---
In AQ, however, there are some fights that require everyone to have Nature Resistance gear + Greater Nature Protection Potion. In Naxxramas everyone needs Frost Resistance gear for Sapphiron, + Greater Fire/Shadow/Nature/Frost Protection Potions for various fights.
---
Complex macros trivialize the game. A simple API without any conditionals would be best. No one-click decursive. No one-click warrior dps rotations. No one-click raidewide healing scripts. These macros really do simplify things as much as any of the meta improvements that have been made. 
---
Private servers never managed to implement spell batching. The game plays just as fast as Nu-WoW. Pserver players have another thing coming.
---
&gt;Not sure what changed in the past few months
---
They're getting closer to finishing up the project and have something that's actually worth communicating to us?
---
Oh yes, the mages are going to fuel gold/mats to my rogue main who is going to be absolutely BiS for any possible BoEs and consumables.
---
Not worth it for warrior with sunder armor?
---
oh, so thats why its called CT, for Cide and Ts? 
---
You are delusional. You're demanding proof for something that occurs extremely rarely in retail wow (because besides RBGs, there's literally nowhere else it matters). If this shit isn't fixed by classic release you'll see TONS of clips from this happening in premades and world pvp. 
---
Holy fuck. This is probably one of the more trivial peices of news we will get in this avalanche of info in spring, but it’s the most uplifting. They care about the smaller intricacies of how the game operated, and that is great news.
---
My biggest concern atm is server stability and it’s relationship with sharding. I doubt most modern servers could handle a classic community at points without crashing, so maybe they have looked into that issue as well. So this news makes me hopeful that they aren’t just ignoring the issue of the current cloud-tech not being as compatible with Classic.  
---
Freeze*
---
He's saying thatt the modern wow babies looking for easy game / instant gratification are far more likely to quit early if they pick Warrior. It's far more likely that they make it to endgame if they play a pet class.
---
I'm a what??
---
Since shamans are faction specific, does that mean we’re supposed to double the %? Or is that not how math works? 
---
If we double the percentage, they jump to being the most played class in the game. That can’t possibly be right 
---
Yep, also id like no new servers, raids, expansions until at least one or better two years after naxx.
---
The wast majority of fights do not have the fear mechanism. The human racial is like having an extra epic item in all fights.
---
So it's not Vanilla if it doesn't feel laggy as balls?
---
Blizzlike people are nuts
---
It's up to the guild how they want to prioritize this. However regardless of what you decide, Tanks should ALWAYS get their 2.5 pieces first just.
---
OP is asking for an itemization tweak. I don't mind classic style balance tweaks. You writing is only semi-related to the point most of the time, and your reading comprehension is seriously lacking. I've made my point several times, and pretty clearly. Goodbye.
---
All of the hunters in our raids were specced Stand-in-the-Fire.
---
It would feel much more responsive, that's it. 
---
this is like, WoW Guild Lore
---
It’s funny he says this when this is by all accounts not a particularly long video. If you skip the lore and the outro it’s like a 5 minute video.
---
probably farm cloth
---
both for xp and to give it to a tailor to craft the bags

So what? This project was NEVER going to be an EXACT 1 for 1 creation, and this stupid "FEATURE" only serves to make the game feel laggier and unresponsive. 
---
Blizzlike fanatics are retarded
---
I'm demanding proof of something that people claims happens daily, for the past 10+ years. I don't think its unreasonable. 
---
I eagerly await those clips, and if they provide that proof then I have legitimately 0 reservations in admitting I'm wrong, because I would agree that is a broken system. 
---
Well when the video began the pacing and speaking was already starting to bore me so I sped it up to 1.5x... only to hear that wondrous gem.
---
&gt; Classic came out at the same time everyone loved Legolas from Lord of the Rings and rolled a Hunter to be like him. I can see the hunter cultural draw is much weaker today than back then.
---
Fair point.
---
&gt; Feeding pet and arrows being higher level of annoying than farming soul shards.
---
Lol @ "A higher level of annoying"
---
so only one person got the mount ?
---
&gt;So what?  
---
You asked why anyone would want this. I gave you a reason.  
---
&gt;This project was NEVER going to be an EXACT 1 for 1 creation  
---
Yet, that is the intention.
---
Sharding and right click reporting are kind of on a different scale than spell batching, imo. I was never one to care *much* about batching, but I am pleasantly surprised with today’s news.
---
However, I think it’s good that the community continues to yell about sharding and auto report/squelches, since Blizzard is obviously reacting to feedback. I’m sure both will be in the game in marginal ways. However, it’s important that the community expresses its worries, so that the extent of those features is lessened.
---
whelps and cat mobs in any area are good for warrior to kill like stv and swamp
---
Bruh that's like a freshman asking how he prepares to present his PhD thesis. You learn as you go, by the time you're with any group of people that have any chance of doing naxx you'll know what to do at that point
---

you mean gain more happiness with WoW 😁
---
Gnome warrior. Waste of warrior
---
Nah you don't, not without buying then. Pserver drop rates were way way way too high
---
that's flat out wrong, but using critters for mobility and rage is always good
---
As a mage, you basically want to go with a Winter's Chill bitch build for MC/BWL. The optimal build is 31/0/20, but that build is absolutely atrocious in PvP and you can't really fix that. You can modify a Winter's Chill build to be good in PvP pretty easily though, like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ofLV0ofoZZVAMoobtV) (swap PoM for Ice Barrier if you prefer). All you miss out on compared to the optimal Winter's Chill bitch build is 6% damage. I can't really recall how big of a deal Frost Channeling is, the mana can be resolved with consumables but threat may be a small issue. If you want you can swap out 1pt Permafrost and 2p Arctic Reach for Piercing Ice. You don't miss out on any damage then, but at that level of content I don't think 6% damage is worth massive PvP utility losses.
---
For AQ/Naxx you can go for [21/27/3](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0ibofoZxgRzbcub0h). Again, you miss out 6% damage, but that's all. Combustion isn't a notable loss, and there's always someone else with Improved Scorch anyway. The main problem is just that 6% damage at that content level is actually quite notable (primarily Naxx).
---
Basically the story of mage PvE-PvP hybrid builds is 6% damage loss + some unimportant stuff.
---
&gt; I'm demanding proof of something that people claims happens daily, for the past 10+ years. I don't think its unreasonable.
---
Really? The squelch report system was released in 2016. RBGs are the only place it really matters unless you piss off some random multiboxer. 
---
Shamans are pretty dope. The offclass ele heals are really clutch for leveling and so are the totems. Resto shaman is also one of the best healing classes for end game content and elemental shamans decently strong as well
---
Actually you can run these specs and be formidable in both PvE and PvP:

---
The biggest difference in raid healing and PvP healing comes mostly from itemization. You want to focus on survivability rather than efficiency. Allthough Holy Specialization and Inspiration are good for raiding, you can easily skip them for personal defense w/o losing too much as a raider IMO.
---
incorrect, it was the gnome passive. only a gnomes mind is strong enough too best itself #gnomemasterrace
---
Fits together.
---
Vanilla wow was the wild west of gaming. These crazy and seemingly ‘wrong’ instances of infrequently unpredictable casting are what gave the game that wild flavor... vanilla.
---
And I thought my CRT was massive. It was a 19" with a max res of 1600x1200 but I usually ran it at 1024x768 or 1280x1024.
---
It's not that they're complaining about the option being there, it's more that if you get right click reported by a certain number of people you get automatically silenced without gm notice. 
---
I'm trying to make sense of this. By Rend's arena I assume you're talking about Blackrock Stadium. But I'm trying to understand what would be the problem with this as the imp would almost certainly be phase shifted and not cause any problems. It's been about 13 years since the last time I did UBRS, so I might not be remembering/picturing the situation properly.
---
&gt; Thats a legitimately large code change, and it shows they aren't shying away from big code changes.
---
It may be, but based on Blizzard's wording, it sounds like they're really just leveraging the modern system which processes multiple event loops of different priorities by moving spells to a lower priority loop that mimics vanilla. That's pretty cool.
---
I'll cut off your empty eye sockets and torn out jawbone!
---
But u/tervahauta brings up a good point. Firstly, it wasn’t a promise, Blizzard was very careful with their wording to not corner themselves into one decision, or public backlash for lying.
---
It’s not unreasonable to be worried that, for example, 10-20 zones will be unstable, given the track record servers have gotten in the past few expansions. I’m pretty sure an event with 80 people caused the server to crash in BFA, because the game just isn’t built for that kind of load, as it’s not that kind of mmo anymore.
---
But today’s news makes me hopeful that they are aware of their technologies pitfalls. But what I mean is, they probably have to put in *considerable* effort to replicate Classic server freedom from sharding, without replicating Vanilla’s crashes. And I think they *are* putting in that effort from this piece of news.
---
That’s one of my bigger questions too, it’s not a deal breaker for me, but I was a late comer to vanilla and a good chunk of my pvp was with xrealm and it made the queues a lot better.
---
Realm pop is the other really biggie.
---
I'd like to give a shout out to my boys in Gnomeregan. Keeping it real Big-T, Snoop-Pup and Little Dees. Y'all are short, but you're real, baby!
---
I can't give you a comparison, but I can tell you that I **loved** my priest in vanilla and it will be my main in classic. Healers will always get a group easily for dungeons and any half-decent priest will be invited along to raids. As long as you keep up a good wand, you can level with very little downtime (wand to allow mana regen). 
---
I can't comment much on Shadow in PvP because it was never really my thing, but healing in PvP is so very much fun. Especially world PvP - as long as you weren't solo. Heals in the middle of a Hillsbrad throwdown turns the tide. 
---
Feral druids in PvP are a lot of fun and they can tank / do decent DPS in dungeons. You'll have a harder time going feral in raids, but if you're really good and take the time to farm some unusual gear (like the Manual Crowd Pummeler) you can hold your own. 
---
Yeah there are some half-decent hybrid specs but I'm just saying full raid spec in PvP is seriously not a fun time. 
---
No. It will make leveling EASIER, not better. I wish they would increase exp needed to 60 a little too, because imo it takes too little time in 1.12.
---
No macros allowed.
---
I saw a thread from 2011 where somebody claimed this happened, I can link it if you would like. 
---
who cares? Wows classic player base will become 10x bigger than their current base I can guarantee it. Myself and soo many more old timers that haven't touched the game in years are planning on coming back and I gotta feeling alotta people who still play retail are going to switch. Vanilla wow is just a way better game. Is actually challenging and there is literally endless amounts of stuff to do. I am also very excited in dungeons actually being difficult and actually needing to journey out to them after getting a group. So many things that retail wow simplified and made dull are going to be brought back too life.
---
I've never seen anyone have this 
---
... the main reason as to why I farmed rank 10 with my priest was to get an epic mount because I really couldn't get it the normal way. 
---
I love priests, ever since the beta my main has always been of that class (and yes, when going back to classic my new main there will probably still be a priest, even though I'm really tempted to go hunter) but grinding in vanilla as a priest was masochistic at best.
---
Please do. Also take a look at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skWzi3o4oGI
---
&gt;Blizzard's communication is dramatically improving
---
Not a sentence I ever expected to see.
---
That said, it's not like there are trailers or screenshots to share like other game releases. We already know *everything* that's going to be in it so it's understandable that there's not been a lot of blue post.
---
The only issue with cats is their attack speed and movement speed makes them get more hits while kiting.

It could go both ways. He did say 
---
&gt; We’ve been working to ensure that in WoW Classic, the gameplay of  activating spells and effects will not differ from the experience of  playing original WoW. 
---
Saying it will be 100% the same.
---
Lmao btfo
---
Perhaps Blizzard doesn’t want to bank on Classic until it proves it has high sub numbers. It’s a better way to carry out business. Back in 04 they didn’t even fathom the numbers they would hit in just months, and I think that’s a trend that will resurface in 2019. 
---
And if there’s enough of a subscriber count to justify adding more servers, I’d believe that RP PVP for each region would be the first to come.
---
Damn it, I just compared Paladin's Judgement set with the non-set BIS (same tier, Nefarian's), and the difference is really severe. Just looking at 5 visible equipment slots that define your look:
---
**Judgement**   -  **Proposed BIS**
---
99 Stamina  -  69 Stamina
---
105 Int        -  87 Int
---
28 Spirit      -  43 Spirit
---
64 Strength  -  0 Strength
---
113 + 47 (SetBonus) - 169 Spellpower
---
14 MP5                -  6 MP5
---
0% Crit                  -  6% Crit
---
As someone who didn't play Vanilla, it seems this isn't just about being content with worse or useless stats on the sets. This is about a completely different gearing path, at least in case of Holy Paladin. Losing 6 % crit on 5 pieces seems massive, considering you get your mana refunded on every critical heal.

Casual raiding in wow wont be a thing. It doesn't really exist. To progress on any of the content youll need to put in actual time commitments with the same group of players somewhat regularly
---
"If they keep their promises" is the key point here.
---
I dont trust them to do that. The classic team has been good so far, but they still have the rest of the company behind them, and that company has had 10+ years of terrible decisions to destroy any faith in it.
---
Better to not have the precedent, in the case of an untrustworthy company.
---
Male Night Elf. The majority of bad players I ran into in vanilla were male Night Elves, the bias is baked into my blood. Sorry.
---
I'm astonished how people still don't understand this fact when it comes to these polls...
---
I agree with this. Love pvping, cant no life to get a high enough rank to compete. 
---
Raids will gear me and I’ll destroy the civilians to protest dhks.  
---
The pserver community is still =/= to the community of people who watch classic WoW videos and content creators who constantly post videos deliberating on the best classes for PVE / PVP / leveling etc. I think Warlocks will definitely be a less common choice, but amongst the type of players who want to play the best pwnage class and watch videos about that subject, I would slot them after Warrs / Rogues / Mages in terms of expected popularity. 
---
If Blizz was really #NoChanges they'd bring my dad back.
---
The issue I've heard with modern servers is that they require sharding for stability. Since sharding won't be in vanilla, they have to either use a different kind of server or constantly crash.
---
Grouping is supposed to always put you in the same shard, but I have had it not do that multiple times in retail, perhaps its just bugged but it still happens to this day in BFA so its still a problem.  
---
\&gt; Why would this happen? Also rares in vanilla were actually rare, so the  odds of this happening with hundreds of players per zone are negligable
---
Even if the chance is small id rather not deal with it at all..  
---
\&gt; What PvP? You think some level 15 player from another faction will make the run to your starting zone just to fight people?   
---
What if they do? Not saying its going to happen often, but it CAN happen. What if I organize a large scale 40v40 battle in Westfall, but it cant be done because stupid sharding keeps fucking it up? This shit happens in retail, it is an issue.  
---
\&gt; That's phasing, not sharding, and even if it happened 1/10 times, you at least get to play the game.   
---
No, it is part of sharding. Just because I used the word phasing doesnt mean its not sharding. If I am in one shard going about my day, and my friend hops on and invites me as I am about to mine a node, I accept and I phase into his shard.. the ore will phase out from my view. That is sharding.
---
What is VC?
---
Fair enough, I just believe that no matter what class you play, if you're not willing to embrace vanilla you're not gonna make it, *especially* those hot from BFA.
---
It may very well have been back then, and it may very well be again in actual classic.  I'm just saying it's between around 20-30g every time I've looked it up on one of the current popular pservs....i think i saw it around 50 as a high and around 15 as a low.
---
I MT'd all the way through MC at roughly 15 FPS on average.  I was so used to it, I didn't even realize how bad it was until I got into BWL and it would dip down to like 5 FPS in some fights or even freeze up, which is when I finally bought a new computer.  Looking back, I can't believe I was even able to play on such toaster, yet I was able to get the job done most of the time.  And there were lots of people in the raid who I know had even crappier rigs or connections.  I think modern equipment will make a difference.
---
Undead purely for flavor. Yeah, not having berserking might cost me a few dps, but at least I'm not a goofy tusked rhasta.
---
Only the most disciplined player can survive the grind of the 30's and 40's without rolling an alt. 
---
Hopefully we get a blue post soon, regarding the server tech they are using. Whether it’s the same exact cloud-based system, or if it’s modified, or if they are straight up using server blades which is unlikely.
---
Already confirmed
---
Warlocks and Hunters are the "easiest" to level quickly because they have the least downtime. It doesn't mean they're actually easier to play. For instance (strictly hypothetical), if a mage sheeps one mob and nukes the other before it closes the gap by merely casting fireball and then does the same to the second - that's pretty easy. But then he has to sit and drink. A warlock could hypothetically kill the two in slightly more time with more difficulty, but not need to drink or eat when he's done and then move onto the next. Not necessarily easier, but quicker.
---
That being said hunters can pretty much go afk and level.
---
Even before that you can just auto attack it for a little extra rage.
---
It makes juking kicks a billion times stronger
---
Low level bag drop rates are broken on private servers but you still shouldn't have any problem getting a full set of decent bags by the time you're 60 without going too far out of your way.
---
Wow .... this happened 
---
Nothings changed their only priority is still taking your money. 
---
Where’s the release date? Am I supposed to be impressed they are doing what they should be doing ?? It’s a multimillion dollar company they need to hurry it up. Shit should have been out months ago it’s pathetic.
---
Yeah but even in terms of contested places, you'll find enough of them with a 5x higher pop than on a Blizzard Server.
---
Guides and grinding lists are nice to give you Ideas but they are all very incomplete. There are usually *alot* of things you can do to get a decent amount of gold/hour especially if you have a crafting profession that improves your margin.
---
For example as an alchemist/herbalist you can craft high end consumables and materials for both raiding and PvP, so you basically always have a paying job, regardless of the server maturity.
---
So you check the AH regularly for stuff that sells, keep an eye on the world chat for flasks/black lotus prices etc.
---
Then you can make rounds to gather herbs and kill mobs that drop crafting materials. If an area seems to be contested you can just switch to the next, because you are not following a specific guide and have deep knowledge of what you can aquire and what sells on the AH you are flexible.
---
Also you can just literally stand next to the AH and buy up herbs/materials and craft consumables/refined materials and sell them for profit, usually you get something between 120-150%. If an inexperienced crafter/gatherer is crushing the prices you just buy them out, put the stuff into your bank and don't farm that stuff for a while, while you slowly put a stack or two on the AH.
---
That was just one example of how you can make good money in a short amount of time, combining your knowledge of the game, the server, the times where stuff is cheap/expensive and the margins you gain as a crafter. There are many more options though.
---
Hmm leans toward tauren now :-)
---
Thanks for the charge at the sheep moment. Forgot about that. Yes that can happen and it resulted in the mage being stunned and the warrior being sheeped midway. If I remember correctly, the sheep also walked back to the point where the warrior was standing before the charge.
---
I think they will bring rpvp when they know the real size of the playerbase. They don’t want to bank on making enough servers to hold 500k when they don’t know if it will pass 200k. 
---
But I’d give it a couple months and I expect we will see them.
---
If you want to be a carebear roll a PvE server. Never understood why people who hate open world pvp would ever roll on a PvP server. 
---
As a mage I'm a bit concerned that there'll be many more whorelocks rolling for my loot this time around. 
---
This is a surprisingly popular opinion.  
---
Killing all the mobs you need for a quest is meant to be a puzzle where you have to figure out how to pull them one by one and kill them without accidentally getting more than one on you because of patrols or proximity aggro. If there are two or more people camping every spawn point there is no difficulty in the overworld at all, it turns vanilla WoW into a shitty PvP game about stealing spawns before other people get them.
---
Dont the horses in sfk have a good chance at dropping a 14 slot bag? 
---
What is the best profession duo in your experience ?
---
Have you ever watched asmongold's videos about guilds? They are super informative. 
---
The vast majority of groups are formed through trade or world chat. Not being able to use those features would be devastating to someone that chains dungeon runs. 
---
Yep, I saw someone say they didn’t give a damn about spell batching they just wanted their specific question answered.  I feel this kind of answer on this kind of topic bodes very well indeed for everything else.
---
I want spell batching and wasn’t expecting to get it.
---
Because they should be killable. It's dishonorable to kill them, but that's part of the game, no? If you want to go kill and camp an entire Horde village as alliance, you should be able to do it, that's the openness factor that's great, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be downsides either. There's probably a better solution, but I think these types of tweaks are better to look at after launch and seeing how things play out.
---
Lol I don’t miss maxing skills
---
Which is what world PVP is. Ransacking towns with strangers is like 50% of what people talk about when they are talking about vanilla nostalgia and vanilla w-pvp. 
---
Was this a pain in the butt when it was happening to you, yes. Did it lead to all the buzzwords people use (emergent gameplay, organic PVP, etc etc)... yes also. Bottom line is a bunch of orcs grouping up and pillaging a human down, or vice versa, is like the core of what the warcraft universe was supposed to feel like since the 90s. 
---
I am in agreement that they should do DKs because that's how shit was in 1.12 -- but I think OP is right that there is a clear loss here to a type of gameplay that felt like a big part of the classic experience. 
---
You fuck up the simplest of memes and call *me* a simpleton, haha. Takes one to know one.
---
focus
---
This analogy works if you've never played D&amp;D, sure.
---
The welpling pets were particularly rare during early vanilla
---
Found Sylvanas.
---
With 2.5k max population, chaining dungeon runs is not so much a thing.
---
For simplicity sake. I'm sure you understand 
---
the more pedantic you make this, the more he is going to freak out about resistance needlessly.
---
Ahh must have been off hand with a 1hs I had. God I loved warlock pvp in vanilla
---
Well that might be true, i unsubbed back in October and even though I was stoked for Zandalari Druid, there is no way I'm going back until the week of Classic dropping
---
Yea. There are macros that just make things so trivial it sort of breaks the game imo. Especially in pvp.
---
Yeah, this is all good points. The best part of world PVP for me as a non-hardcore, non-geared player was a chance to roll with the big bois, and even at 5 fps, still feel like I was also raiding and pillaging. The whole point was that it's supposed to be chaotic, like real warfare, and not a precise, controlled raid like PVE. 
---
Whether it was a raid on a capital or a town, it felt like everyone could get inducted into the mess. 
---
Clever girl. What's your farm strategy for 5 mages? Just do DM farming but faster? 
---
I agree. Recently they posted once a week. That's awesome and just what I wanted. Not a lot of things, but some things, may be not very important (I don't really care about spell batching, for instance) but it's still very nice to read about it.
---
Conversely, getting rekt by a gnome warrior feels horribly  embarrasing. 
---
My guild has a shit load of people signed up for shaman. Second only to warrior. I don't know why either. 
---
It’s big but no one expected to get it.  I think if we realistically thought we would get it more would have been said, or if more people were aware of it.
---
yep
---
10 slot bag from wailing caverns quest.
---
moonwalking
---
You realise that if you have a retail active subscription then you have one for classic right? Why can I not say trade a token on retail for gold in classic then? Alot of people that play only classic and cant afford subscription would go for that.
---
No. They don't need to hurry up. They need to take their time and polish the product as long as needed. It's ready when it's ready. If it's 2022, I'll be OK with that. They already put tight milestone, that was absolutely not needed.
---
&gt;Grouping is supposed to always put you in the same shard, but I have had it not do that multiple times in retail, perhaps its just bugged but it still happens to this day in BFA so its still a problem. 
---
This is a problem because of phasing, not sharding.
---
&gt;Even if the chance is small id rather not deal with it at all.. 
---
Once again its negligible in the grand picture. Are people gonna quit the game because they didn't get a green item at level 10? No. They might quit because they have 1000ms and after hours of trying they still can't complete a single quest.
---
&gt;What if they do? Not saying its going to happen often, but it CAN happen. What if I organize a large scale 40v40 battle in Westfall, but it cant be done because stupid sharding keeps fucking it up? This shit happens in retail, it is an issue. 
---
Do it in Duskwood, problem fixed. 
---
&gt;No, it is part of sharding. Just because I used the word phasing doesnt mean its not sharding. If I am in one shard going about my day, and my friend hops on and invites me as I am about to mine a node, I accept and I phase into his shard.. the ore will phase out from my view. That is sharding.
---
If you are so worried about missing out on a node, then just wait with the party invite till you are finished with it. Even so, if you lose half of the nodes you find this way, you will still get more than you would without sharding.
---
That last sentence got me! lol... But you're right... Mage life is way easier than most.
---
I never got to see this. How did it work on PvP servers? Was it a bloodbath or did the factions have an unofficial cease fire? 
---
&gt;Why do you think all the warriors are orcs and humans?
---
I hope this was satire because you're only proving my point. I *only* play warrior, and they are either Dwarf, Gnome, or Undead. 
---
I have never had a Human or Orc warrior, exactly for the reasons you said. 
---
Same. It all holds up and while nostalgia helps, its not what drives me or entertains me in the end. Its the top quality gameplay of a proper mmoRPG with an alive world.
---
ONLY thing that bothers me with private servers is that I cant get over the fact that it isnt legit so I cant feel comfortable and 100% happy with progress since Ive been on corrupting servers and disappearing ones too much.
---
So Im holding out for the ultimate experience now. Its basically nofap  challenge but with WoW :$
---
Then just wait until they remove it? Its only for the initial surge, you wait it out you can play without sharding.

Imho herbalism and alchemy.  Herbs always well well, and your consumables are in high demand.
---
&gt; you will be just fine leveling as ret or ret reckoning
---
does the ret-reckoning spec use a 2h, or 1h and shield with the appropriate talents?
---
Correction : Blizzard's Classic team communication is dramatically improving.
---
Hope : Will spread to the entire Blizzard.
---
LONG SHOT : Will led to Blizzard removing Activision shackles in the future.
---
Don't base too many of your choices on the competitive aspect of PvE. Most of the WoW PvE content will be an absolute joke. Especially the MC / BWL content, which will be the only available endgame for quite some time. It honestly won't matter what class / race you are. If you level fast you will be guaranteed to be in the top raiding guild on your faction. 
---
I feel like it narrows the gap between people
---
with different latencies in PvP.
---
As a melee, if you have 75-150ms
---
more lag than your opponent you can find yourself "out of range" even when you're standing directly on top of your opponent.
---
On the 1.12 client it's more likely that you will get a swing and an ability on a mage before they have a chance to frost nova and step out of range if they have a better ping.
---
Internet speed won't be as much of an issue on Classic compared to the international mash-up of pservers, but I have to admit that vanilla
---
spell batching has a very unique "flow" that I personally love.
---
50 years? Lmao 
---
Honestly I'd rather they used their resources on issues less trivial than this. 
---
How good is rushing to 60 and trying to be the first to churn out certain things? 
---
Doesnt work like that at all though. If they had a 100% confident date they could hit theyd announce it. They wanna keep themselves covered by not announcing anything prematurely and doing the next best thing by keeping us updated on the process. 
---
Id rather have a month or so later known date than a date to plan around etc that gets postponed. Its volatile for them aswell. 
---
It also shouldnt "have been out months ago"... thats you basing it on absolutly nothing but youre want to play :P Theres a fuckton of work and polishing that goes into it mate. 
---
???? The vast majority of warriors are human on alliance side and the vast majority are orc on horde side. The world "all" here is a hyperbole. I don't literally think noone ever makes a non human alliance warrior. Hell, I play a non human alliance warrior lol. I am saying that a vast majority of players seem to pick the optimal race for this class, not just 1% of them. That is all.
---
&gt; Its so small on the scale of things that matter
---
It really isn't. 
---
That is so much my plan. No time for rank. So after hitting r3, I'll collect as much dk as I can to protest. 
---
Get them low enough and let the mobs finish them off? Not sure if that works but that is what I would do.
---
"part of leveling a Warrior is grinding in order to skip quests that are too high level"
---
Is this an Alliance thing? I never had issues finding level appropriate quests on my forsaken warrior back in the day.
---
This!  Felwood was the spot as an herbalist!
---
Maybe I'm out of the loop but how was this a major issue? It seemed like the optimizations implemented over the years was improvements and not the other way around. Not trying to be a dick, genuinely curious. 
---
Just gotta steer clear of where ever the fuck asmongold and his followers go.
---
That sucks. It's not like you were promising them anything.
---
And elitist blowhards that write paragraphs to defend a meta like above can remain in your little echo-chambers, climbing excel sheets to your next BIS, all cuts of the same flank of steak, with nothing unique about each MT of your guild except the level of gearing he's gotten to, and the sound of his voice on comms.
---
This, sir, is not fun, and would get the fastest /gquit you'd ever seen outta me. 
---
Exactly, and I think this won't even be two distinct groups of people. I think a lot of people will traverse between the two -- for example, with WoW releases now, they pretty much follow the tv / seasonal media / annual media model. You play through the latest expansion, you see all the content, you see what's up with the lore and the game, and then after seeing all the content, most players don't REALLY feel the need to stick and grind out the mythic gear and progression and all that -- I mean, they've seen all the content, and like a TV show, you'll check it out again when there's something new to watch. 
---
But then when you actually want your meat and potatoes MMORPG gameplay and you want to spend a sunday slowly plumbing the depths of BRD, you have vanilla. When you want that slower, higher stakes gameplay where you actually have to pay attention and use your less polished abilities and utilities to their full extent, and work for ANY experience you want to have... you have classic. 
---
But I personally don't have the work ethic for classic all the time -- I just can't do it, I can't justify farming rep or resistance gear or pots for all of my weekend when I have a family. So when I'm in the mood to do some raiding or PVP, I will honestly probably just play retail still. 
---
You can switch between the two; they are very different games. 
---
The Murloc camp at Stone Cairn Lake, the Agamand Mills, and the Night Elf Barrow Dens are gonna all be hot spots for death.
---
Danish too hard to understand? lol
---
I mean...not to mention that Naxx wont be out for a significant amount of time...theyre probably going to have to go through all the other raids as they come out, keep building up gear for the group, etc.
---
the high ping is not the problem. i've played vanilla with 250-300 and it was okiesh with melee. you can google videos with oceanic guilds that were playing on US server with a *steady* 300 ping and doing fine.
---
your problem is [jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter). that fluctuation makes it impossible to get used to. all the interacting with the game commands is based on [muscle memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory) that develops over time. the fact that you cant get used to it becomes incredibly annoying.
---
range, over all, is better when you have a shitty internet connection. still annoying though especially if you pvp. 
---
consider that you can make a free/trial account on retail and test your connection to wherever you want to play. the technology will stay the same as in retail.
---
Phew I'm going to need my wotf with all these locks running around!
---
PFUI is an addon inspired by ElvUI, but a complete ground up re-write rather than a fork.  With ElvUI confirming they are porting to classic, that's your pfUI solution:  You get to use the real deal.
---
Itz ya Boi! 
---
Good riddance. 
---
I almost exclusively play Horde. Often, you’ll be the “correct level” for a quest you can’t solo on a Warrior, packs of mobs, escort quests, etc. Usually, you want to do those quests a level or two after everyone else. One quests that comes to mind is the Grimtotem quests in 1kn. They are unsoloable for a Warrior (this isn’t an issue on private server because it has 5x the blizzlike server population). I’ll grind Kolkata to skip that line. 
---
Girl?  Awkward lawl.  I’m a 23 yr old dude.  I plan to solo stratholme/BRD trash to level from 50-60 on them and as far as what I can accomplish @60, I still need to research.  I see some vids of mages soloing tribute runs with ease and aoe farming everything they can find for gold
---
Ty!
---
Classic will be like a virus for young players.
---
Many of them will simply get hooked by the community and communication between players. It doesn't matter if they are used with current placid games.
---
Humans are social animals.We can't escape our nature.
---
Classic will provide the young players with a social Universe that is going to be very appealing to them.
---
I can’t actually remember how Phase Shift interacted with body aggro now that you mention it, but I ran into a couple 60s in the first year that honestly didn’t know you could toggle it to auto cast. Usually the ones that also had to be reminded to not have their VW out in a dungeon.
---
Just go with whatever you like more, it's hard to say whats "better" but i'm just saying taurens should definitely not be slept on, they are just as good if not better. That 300 extra hp at 60 is very good too. My friends tauren hunter stacked alot of stamina and he had 6.4k hp. 
---
There is a middle ground somewhere.. my hype train only has so much fuel. I do want a polished product but they really shouldnt be taking as long as it takes to develop an entirely new game with modern graphics... as of right now they're taking just as long as I'd like if classic is released in summer. 
---
Hunters are usually one of the most popular classes on Vanilla private servers, and Warlocks one of the least popular. So it wasn't just back then. 
---
Good find then!! Might remake in the format I just discussed 😈
---
They had rp-pvp servers in classic....
---
This is one of the largest issues- aside from a potential server-wide sharding that seems out of the question by now. Spell Batching was an effect of the archaic coding of WoW, they implemented faster server-side connectivity so that input were registered quicker. However, this isn't a "update the game" project, it's a "time capsule" project. We are wanting Classic WoW to be as close to memory as possible, and spell batching is a major factor in that. Entire strategy's and reaction times become swayed with/without spell batching. You can let a cast go a little longer before kicking it, or you may have to actually prepare to kick sooner, etc.
---
While it is an optimization for the server, it isn't optimized for what Classic WoW intends to be- a reiteration of the past experience. 
---
The Blue Post sums it up perfectly. You have situations where you can blink from a warrior's stun pre-emptively, or you can charge it as a warrior, or you can vanish a spell cast, gouge a blink, etc etc. 
---
Changing any of that changes how certain classes line up, and we just haven't gotten to that point yet. We aren't looking at any rebalancing idealogies just yet, we just want the client as close to true.
---
This build is very efficient for both raiding and PvP. Your special perks are being able to cast Entangling Roots w/o pushback, high mana efficiency and super high consistent healing with HT/Regrowth.
---
As for gear you'll still favor good healing gear over average spell damage/healing gear though as you won't be using Starfire a ton, and your main focus will still be healing. Unless you put 5 points into Improved Starfire but then we're already talking about a spec that is suboptimal for PvE.
---
pls mods tag this NSFL those two-toed uglies needa get sleeved up in some slippers ffs
---
Depends on the stage of the server.  At the start there will be lots of tanks gearing up, and lots of fury wars and pallies and druids willing to tank to make dungeon runs happen while they are getting pre-raid BiS.  Once those get geared fewer tanks get rolled as alts because there aren't raid spots for them and they dont make good pvp alts.  So as the server progresses there are fewer and fewer tanks willing to run 5 mans.  However, it is not uncommon to see geared tanks selling their services to run dungeons, or reserving certain BoEs etc for income while running people through for gear.
---
eh, to be fair he also tried talking in dungeons, where he was promptly told to shut the fuck up 
---
Jesus chirst I fucking know that. I was being sarcastic. 
---
If you played on any pserver, Barrens Chat is literally just ironic weebs spouting edgy alt right shit nowadays. Everyone knows how to do all the infamous quests now (Mankrik's Wife, Samophlange, Raptor Silver, all of those elite orc lady's hunting quests where nothing drops e tc.) so it's gonna be people forcing the "culture" and its going to look cringe as fuck.
---
You sounded very personal defending OP's request because you delved into class balance and why we need it. I carried the discussion there. Not sure why you're closing it all off and saying goodbye to me, but who am I to force you - bye.
---
Oh yeah, focus is gone.  That’s a big one,
---
Hey man I played spriest in later expansions but never in vanilla (I was a rogue and mage player).
---
Is shadow worth a damn later on? Or should I just steer clear? I've heard they can't get raid spots due to debuff limit.
---
I know that this is authentic and great that they are staying true to the game, but outside of preservation, I just don’t understand what’s fun about watching two characters sit CC’ed and waste 40 seconds.
---
Thing is, modern WoW struggles with many players in one spot even more than the vanilla one did, but what you say is also true.
---
It's probably a combination of both.
---
&gt; only issue with cats is their attack speed and movement speed makes them get more hits while kiting.  
---
&gt;R
---
they do not get more hits they get 1 and it does peanut damage, they also generally have lower armor and health, i specifically said cats because of this
---
I laughed too hard..thanks
---
Van cleef ?
---
I use this for mining/herbing as a druid a lot actually!  It’s weaker than mind soothe because it has a cast time, but it’s very useful in the world where usually beasts surround nodes.
---
I think I pretty well proved with an absurd amount of runs this mount didn't exist when I played. the only people who had it clearly had it spawned by a GM. 
---
So you enjoyed the steam 
---
Damn that’s pretty good! Proper tank! Thanks for input
---
the best kind
---
It’s a 12 year old game that is supposed to be brought back in the state it was left. We don’t want them to polish it. It has been done for 12 years.
---
Snookie want smush smush!
---
Hunters are phenomenal wtf are you talking about. Excellent mobility, fast leveling, can solo tons of shit, great gold farmers, absolutely overpowered in Wpvp when you know what you're doing, and if you know how to properly kite and Tranq Shot  you are indispensable in your raids. DPS isnt everything in Vanilla
---
My rock hard rager no longer needs more rage
---
the chad
---
Just avoid Enhance after you hit 60.
---
Actually full Holy Paladin is the spec that is optimal for both raiding and PvP. For Hunters you want to respec though. MM isn't bad for PvP but just not as good as BM, Survival or Intimadion+Scatter. But that isn't a huge issue since you'll be farming that gold really fast as a Hunter.
---
but do you even RP or are you just another person rolling to grind out R13-14?
---
Yeah I remember those. Kind of hairy for warrior, definitely. 
---
There are so many zones for questing in though. Maybe my memory is faded but I really don't recall having to grind at all with my warrior. 
---
Uhh you got me there, this is pretty min-maxy - If this isn't your cup of tea, definitely go for whatever is fun for you! :)
---
Atleast the nostalrius community was like classic, tbc
---
I respectfully disagree. I can see how that's your prefered way of playing but I don't believe blizzard intended it to be that way. I for one much prefer running into people and pvping while I level and hunt for mobs and mats. And the "shitty PvP" game comment is just silly honestly, PvP is a huge part of the game and a ton of fun for a ton of people. Just because you obviously prefer PvE and puzzles doesn't mean everyone else has to.
---
Jurassic Park reference. Thanks for the tips tho, sweet pea. 
---
I think retail, independent of classic, needs to do some serious soul searching and figure out what "WoW 3" is going to look like. I interpret the first iteration of WoW as vanilla, TBC, and WotLK as a end of that product line, and "WoW 2" as the post Cata era. I think we are reaching the end of what's capable with the "WoW 2" style, and a dramatic re-imagination of the game is required. Retail players know it, and that's why there's so much bitching and negativity -- the progression systems aren't motivating, the leveling is completely unimmersive and dull and simpleton-y, and the class fantasy / class identity is super homogenized and pruned. 
---
Classic existing or not existing is not going to change this at all. Retail has the problems retail has regardless of classic, and it's not like retail players haven't been bitching and whining about all of this stuff for the last 6 years. 
---
Retail has to soul search and redefine itself -- whereas classic already knows exactly what it needs to be. Retail has superiority to classic in 1000+ ways -- but classic has just 1 or 2 things that retail can't offer. But that shouldn't threaten retail -- because retail's biggest threat is it's own self
---
I imagine most of the work being done early on was just porting the whole damn thing into the new environment. That's a lot of tedious grunt work going on. Now that most of those tasks are being wrapped up... actual game design choices are being decided on.
---
The subscription is irrelevant, items and gold will not trade over to classic, it would totally break the game. Tokens were introduced long, *long* after gold was essentially meaningless in WoW. In vanilla gold was incredibly valuable, people farmed gold just to be able to raid at a high level consistently. Buying gold within the TOS would shatter the classic experience and Blizz are very much aware of that. 
---
It ain't happening.
---
At least 5 years worth of decisions like this. Even then that's only half the amount of years of bad faith they are working against
---
Not 8 but definitely 16 is viable just be prepared to to shadow weave back up,
---
With most memespecs you just have to be a very very dedicated player in order to make the cut
---
Ie. Maximum consumes. Any amount of tiny min maxing you can do to keep yourself from healing,
---
Worst case scenario your a utility spec priest 31/0/20 and you just heal and spam rank 1 swp on the mobs
---
&gt; Not enough to prevent the dps and healers from sitting LFTank for 2+ hours every time they try to form a group.
---
This is why you need to look for non-traditional tanks like Druids, Paladins, Hunters, Shaman, and Warlocks.
---
That’s nowhere near correct from what I can remember.
---
Sunder isn't efficient in the short fights vs nonelite mobs.  You will add some damage, but you're better off saving rage for the real treats like mortal strike, bloodthirst, whirlwind, or cleave as that converts rage into damage at a much higher rate. 
---
Sunder is really for holding aggro or maybe if you're in a duo soloing an elite to help your partner do a lot more DPS.  In a soloing, short fight like most nonelite fights are (literally 4 or 5 weapon hits with a good 2h) you won't see much return from sunder. 
---
got that druid with a gunshot lmao
---
I don't think I could stand being a Dwarf priest. Clothie classes don't suit them imo unless you play female but then again who the fuck plays female dwarf
---
I've noticed that yes, if the mob is one hit away from death and approaching me (outside of melee range) you can just sit still and you will autoattack the mob first before it gets you. 
---
Yes. That was sarcasm.
---
depends on the patch
---
Please stop trying to change the game. :)
---
Just a heads up, itemization is going to be 1.12.1. its just that items will not be fully released at launch.
---
No one in the entire game has it easier then the mage. As a class it's over tuned as compared to anything else. It's the only class who's back up plan was given back up plans for it's back up plans lol. All while having to work half as hard as everyone else for it. 
---
My brother played a mage. One thing that will always make me laugh is something he said. He said this without any irony btw. "Do you know what sucks about playing a mage man? I mean I made all this fucking gold and have all this extra time but, I don't have shit to do with it. I'm just sitting on 15k gold and I have nothing to buy. Unlike you I mean this isn't fair how come you can buy epics for your guy?"
---
This fucking ass hole was sitting on 15k gold and had nothing to spend it on. BEcause not only is farming easy as hell for mage. The number of things you "need" to buy is non existent. This piece of human garbage was whining to a warrior that it wasn't fair he didn't need thousands in gold to make his class works. I'm 5k in debt to him while he's whining about sitting on 15k acting like he has real problems. Fuck mages man. Fuck mages.
---
Are you talking about retail vanilla or private servers? It's not unusual for a private server to remove extremely rare drops from their drop tables but then have it on the cash shop *cough Feenix*
---
There should be no penalty, because actual griefers do not get deterred from griefing and city raiders who do open world content do get punished. In my opinion raiding and controlling an enemy city for half a day is not griefing but playerdriven content and this should be made possible and not discouraged by DHK. 
---
If you will DHKs were the flying mounts of vanilla. The very first step to shit over world PvP and world cohesion.
---
https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/ You can check ND and K3 prices here
---
Saying one was more of an issue than the other is moot. Both BGs and DHKs severely lowered the frequency of WPvP. Nobody would mind if DHKs didn't exist though.
---
Yeah even as a gnome lock I was slippery as hell, dodging in a way someone didn't expect especially in groups of people.  Would do it the most in AV- find some dwarves or humans to run within and the guy would lose you easily between all the spell effects and general chaos. 
---
See you on the battlefield, when you get WTF'd by some off-spec Prot warrior pvping with 3/3 Improved Disarm. 
---
Heard that! I'm pretty caught between shaman mage or lock. Analysis paralysis and all that. Thanks a lot for your insight :-)
---
Casual or no, I'll see you in the BG's there little human man, and you better have your pocket "fear ward" priest with ya.  /s  :)
---
Soon as I hit Rank 12 (not bother / can't get a higher rank with RL) I'm killing every civvy I see for those sweet sweet red number.
---
Ganna go for a high score.  Just to proove a point that DHK's don't do anything to protect questing NPCs
---
Draenai anything. I absolutely loathe what they did with the Draenai, and one of the biggest draws about classic for me is that they, (and the godawful lore that crashed their spaceship into Azeroth after it was highjacked by space pirate paladin bloodelves who have nothing to do with Kael’Thas) are not in the game. 
---
Exactly, people rag on the attention span of kids. But who do you think spends 800 hours making shit in minecraft without getting bored? These vanilla kids, many of them grew into hardcore WotLK raiders. Now we have this stereotype that gen Z needs constant stimulation and only has a 30 minute session length max, and so on and so forth. They only like BRs, etc. 
---
Uh, yeah, remember who the ADD generation was? That was my generation, and we played the shit out of classic. Kids will play classic because it's hard. 
---
For example, my friend who's a HS teacher always says that kids don't hate schoolwork or homework because it's hard. They hate it because it's boring -- and it's boring because it's easy. Kids have a zero tolerance for boredom, and never dipping below 90% health while pulling the entire dungeon and AOEing it down is easy, and easy is boring. If you want to make kids interested in school, challenge them and make it hard, and give them resources to figure shit out. Likewise, if you want to make kids stick with your video game, make it a challenge, make it hard, and give kids the tools to figure shit out. 
---
there are two 14slot bags you can get from quests on your way to 60.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=11324 from Cortello's Riddle starts in STV (letter on the boat).
---
and one which is harder to do, the uldaman dungeon chain  https://classicdb.ch/?item=9587 
---
They were going to avoid world pvp anyways since BG's were significantly more efficient for everyone
---
Female Orc, female Tauren, female Troll, Alliance 
---
Actually "griefing" was basically a non-issue perpetuated by whiners who regret rolling on a PvP server. It was and still is rare.
---
And now that is an important piece of information.
---
As you see these items on the AH, you purchase them.
---
As they drop in the world / groups -- if they are your main gear -- you roll need on them.
---
And if they are not -- you sell them to members of your guild for less than going rate so that *they* can purchase them for forward movement.
---
Hi, /u/bam969
---
Common, read the OP before commenting.
---
Except, they don't stop greifing NPC's and for those not looking to actively rank up actually give a benefit and a neat point system now.
---
Good point. I started a little later in Vanilla, around the introduction of the AQ event. 
---
But, since Classic is built to mimic 1.12 the quests shouldn't be a big problem.
---
&gt; Have you ever watched asmongold
---
No
---
That's what worries me. Having sharding present for so long in retail WoW could mean the game client is dependent on it and uses it as a crutch - there's never a need to render 100+ people on screen. BFA seems to have really low draw distance on NPCs in certain areas as well. There's some weirdness there.
---
Yes, many people would lag with large crowds on screen back in the day, but that was because of shitty user PCs/internet connections, not the servers (usually). I had a pretty powerful gaming PC during Vanilla, and solid broadband part of the time and was usually just fine while my guildies were essentially frozen by lag in raids/cities. 
---
Old school!  :)
---

---
Combustion fire, the damage output is absolutely retarded and if you roll with a healer or warlock it's gg
---
I suppose I could get up to the 8 slot bags pretty easily that way. 
---
You get the first pieces at rank 12 and the final pieces at rank 13. You won't get that set unless you're hardcore. It's only 3 ranks off from the first set, but those 3 ranks take a lot more time than the ranks before them.
---
I agree that the Dungeon 2 sets are some of the nicest looking sets in the game, and stats-wise they're not *that* much different from the Rank 10 set. You probably won't notice much difference on a Shaman if you wear the Dungeon set instead of the PvP set. But for Druids in particular, the 4-piece set bonus on the Rank 10 gear (15% increased movement speed in all forms) is insane. I would aim for the PvP set if I wanted to play a Druid at a high level.
---
Yeah, that is just not how it works. PvP and especially WPvP is very fast paced and often chaotic. Anyone who was part of it knows this isn't possible. Even if you have a full raid premade you can't really avoid killing civilians entirely and the penalty of even killing *one* is massive.
---
They're in it for those sweet rare mount drops
---
https://youtu.be/NplVIpaInQI
---
The most comprehensive video on guild interaction and management I've ever watched. No one likes a contrarian. 
---
Many retail players believe Classic is taking away resources from retail.
---
No amount of telling them Classic has a separate dev team and doesn't need much resources since they don't need to develop anything new is convincing them their beloved retail is safe, no so far at least.
---
That's why some of them can be so "aggressive" towards Classic and its players.
---
I'm not justifying their behavior, just trying to explain.
---
I think more people will be in social raiding guilds (aka in that semi space of casual and hardcore) than in straight up hardcore guilds. And in social raiding guilds, there is literally no reason to bully your offspec players into playing the desired spec, because as long as those players put in a modicum of effort, you will still be able to clear everything but late AQ40 / Naxx. 
---
Vanilla basically said "do you want to see Naxx / AQ40? OK, then you have to be in a hardcore raiding guild and do all the hardcore shit slog." If you can compromise and say "No, I don't want to see Naxx / AQ40", then you can happily play your offspec and be valued by your guild and just not really ever encounter too much pain points with the "vanilla class balance".

This is prob the best guide ive ever found that breaks down hit and crit in vanilla

Wow, nice try at trolling you almost got me.

OCC or OOC?
---
YES JUST FKING YEEESSSS!!!!! ♥️♥️♥️
---
I rolled pvp since shortly after launch. I leveled during the days of STV-nam and TM vs SS. The world pvp you seem so intent on loving was not fun for the VAST MAJORITY. It rendered certain zones as completely unplayable. People don't hate the gank, the few people skimirish, or tuesday raid entrance battle. It is the complete shut down of areas that people don't like especially when some areas can be done by a solo level 60. 
---
It wasn't DHKs that ended world pvp. It was the fact that honor now gave something and battlegrounds were superior honor.
---
Vanilla. I tried so many times but just never got lucky.
---
They didn't confirm anything besides "we plan to use sharding in the early zones", and they dont have the trust for us to accept them putting in sharding (and thereby setting a precedent) quietly. They gave us no firm details. Not which zones, nor for how long, nor even a firm "we won't use it anywhere else".
---
Casual guilds - you can do whatever, just don't stand in fire.
---
Hardcore guilds - your only option is to heal
---
Personally not a big fan of this decision, but it won't stop me from enjoying the game and I would have played it either way
---
&gt;Warrior with Edgemaster's Handguards
---
I remember Edgemaster on live retail vanilla servers being considered meme-tier. Is this just a private server thing? After all, weapon skill coding is server side and these private servers are using incorrect formula's and so it's *all wrong.*
---
My brother was already for a while, so i had a input about class, i had fun until 40 due to the fact they had a great versitality with spell and the wolf
---
I just remember them being a pain to get in vanilla. I'm not sure I had full bag slots at 20. 
---
Blizzard give us a release date and start taking my money
---
Flourishing in 04 is different than flourishing today. If it just drives people away so that you can gave max nostalgia from waiting 3 hours to log in and kill one mob it's not worth it imo
---
Good to know thank you!
---
I see a boomkin!
---
Hey BfA devs, look how the actual communication between the devs and community. Looks nice, right?
---
&gt; But wouldn't hardcore PvPers prefer the "true-er" experience that flows better?
---
From what I've seen most of them would rather have a snapshot from the past even though they recognise that one is more accurate
---
Don't you mean weapon chain...?
---
I dont get the attitude that they're trying to pull a bait and switch, it's not like it's to their advantage to shard everything and they've explicitly said they're only considering in in starting zones.
---
Pretty sick sick leave exists for this reason alone XD
---
Mayhaps thou shouldst not be so aggressive to strangers on the internet. The enjoyment of a womans embrace might stay the rage in your heart.
---
Play like a suboptimal noob all you want, just dont expect invites over people who care enough about their guildies and fellow players to spec/gear correctly for efficiency. You are a selfish pig. Unlike you I have better things to do then raid MC for 6 hours. Dress up is for The Sims go play that so u can be stylish. 
---
NPCs can still be griefed on PvE realms, just FYI.
---
They are quality supports and healers at 60. You need to be fairy well geared (BWL / ZG / AQ20) to begin not dragging a bloody corpse behind you in PvE as DPS (elemental, ENH is always lacking). 
---
In 1-59, they can do most all roles, DPS and Healing fine, and tanking to some extent when needed though a different class is preferred most the time. 
---
In PvE, they have 3 valid specs but Elem is going to be the "best" in terms of DPS, they will have better mana management, able to utilize their spells more fully, and not reliant on RNG like enh w/ windfury is.
---
That said, a geared Elem shaman can do some insane WF crits even with a 1h + shield, and you'll be destroying melee classes quite easily.
---
A significant portion of Vanilla's lag with large numbers of players was client-based though. People had shitty PCs and shitty internet connections. Obviously the servers went down a lot but not necessarily due to crowds. 
---
During Vanilla I happened to have a brand new gaming PC and solid broadband, and had decently smooth gameplay even in big world PvP battles, AV, raids, etc. 
---
Yeah making early promises is just a recipe for disaster in development. Imagine if they said "Okay we will do spell batching" 3 months ago and then realized its not feasible. 
---
Warlocks are fucking baller, if I weren't dedicated to the memeret dream, it would be my second choice. It's the class for powergamers and tryhards. You start weak with endless utility, and scale into the best ranged dps, still with god tier utility. Hell, it might end up as my main anyway. 
---
A good lock in PvP and dungeons has so much control its hardly even funny. You're so tanky, you offer so much good support, your debuffs are great, your CC is great. There are a lot of really good things about warlock. If not for Soul Shards, the class would probably be more popular than mage in the current 2019 classic meta. 
---
These are just my work clothes - not my "strutting around IF looking cool" clothes. 
---
You really think they implemented spell batching, AV, content &amp; loot release plans, and removed loot trading... all in two weeks? After having done nothing for the past two years?
---
Blizzard is a business, and they want to save up the hype for when the product is actually getting closer to being done. It's also not entirely unlikely they were told to dial it back for a while after Classic got more attention than BfA at Blizzcon 2017.
---
I’m going to not kill them to prove it works, then.
---
Now that is nostalgic... spending hours in SS v's TM rumbles... even when I am meant to be leveling... just trying to do my part to protect the civilians.
---
Prot warrior PvP is pretty fun! Never tried a dedicated prot PvP spec before but looks good. 
---
To get some alliance to come out and contest us.  It was to set off local defense warnings and generate some world pvp.
---
I see 2 boomkins!
---
Honestly what games is their communication poor in? Overwatch is pretty much industry gold-standard, Hearthstone was decent back when I last played it (3 years ago). Diablo and Starcraft really don't need all that much communication. The WoW devs seem to communicate frequently, even though people often don't like what they have to say. 
---
We also had a Druid tank Rag successfully :P
---
The one named Uziga in the pic.
---
Thing is, there is nothing like Classic WoW on the market today.
---
A lot of the new technologies go back to Malcolm's comment in Jurassic Park:  "people kept trying to figure out if they could, they never stopped to ask if they should."  If a company were to make a new MMO today, there would be tons of "features" and "technologies" they'd throw in because they're "industry standard", which would push players away.
---
A game without all of those is going to be a huge player draw.
---
Retail is basically a TV show. Check in every year for the latest happenings in Azeroth, play through the latest content, try out some new class mechanics, hit the end point where there's nothing to do but grind to play the same content over on a harder and harder difficulty, and then kinda dick around collecting shit like you said. 2-3 months, you've seen and done it all, there's no reason to keep playing if you're not motivated to do hardcore raiding or PVP. 
---
Classic WoW is a MMORPG where you have to really work for any experience you want to have - it's more like a hobby, like rock climbing, where if you like it, you don't just "get done rock climbing and need new rock climbing content". Now, I might rock climb once a month, and watch TV a couple weeks. But rock climbing is something I can revisit month after month, year after year, with new people and old friends, and keep getting something out of it. 
---
With the TV model, you need new everything, new characters, new seasons, new this, new that etc to keep my attention. With the rock climbing model, it's on ME to keep pushing myself to train for new things and go get peak experiences with friends to help me. I might take a month off because I just don't have the time or effort to go do it. 
---
There are pros and cons to both; retail and classic WoW are just so different that I honestly believe a lot of players could happily get value out of both, and enjoy both as stellar entertainment -- if they keep an open mind. 
---
Yep DK is a pretty crappy system - many characters don't care about them at all so it doesn't really solve the griefing of flight masters/quester givers but it can be so catastrophically bad for many others that they just avoid any world pvp in general
---
Yeah, for Classic it's great and I'm glad for it. But as someone who's still subbed to retail, their communication is probably the worst it's ever been now for BfA. So I don't really feel their old self sadly, yet.
---
You made one small mistake for techbots brain you need to get the starter quest from one of the priests in the Cathedral District in Stormwind [http://classicdb.ch/?quest=2923](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=2923) which then sends you over to Ironforge to get the quest Save Techbots Brain  [http://classicdb.ch/?quest=2922](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=2922).
---
If you don't get the quest from Stormwind you won't be able to pick up the quest otherwise.
---
But you will die to my Dark Edge of Insanity while you swing some Crap weapon since you won't make it to AQ40 in any guild with your attitude :)
---
You can play any meme build you want for dungeons they are easy. For raids you will be expected to play heals since shamans are fantastic healers. You want at least 1 for each group in a raid because totems are amazing. 
---
I personally love shaman because there are a ton of different specs you can play and lots of theorycrafting to be had. I've seen an elemental shaman do decent in raids by downranking lightning bolt and using the dagger from Mauradon that restores mana on spellcast.
---
Personally when classic comes out I want to try a hybrid enhance/ele build that uses elemental devastation and spams rank 1 frost shock since it gets a crit bonus from the frost mage buff winters chill.
---
Warriors cant generate enough threat to let warlocks go all out, and there isn't enough spellpower gear in the game for their itemization to be any good early. As Warriors get Thunderfury and gear to the point where they can duel wield instead of sword and board, lock gets stronger. Both things holding lock back deminish over Classic's lifespan. 
---
The weird pserv batching is actually very noticeable for me
---
It doesn't drop off every mob, only the mages.
---
Rank 11 is mount
---
pala too can aoe farm
---
feral works in pvp, pve its quite tryhard. it also scales poorly lategame.
---
pala pvp wears tier plates
---
Current retail WoW has lots of shiny toys, but the core of the game has been utterly broken since CATA. 
---
Gently nudging strangers towards working with each other isn't a feature of the game. That *IS* the game. When you get down to it WoW was a highly efficient engine for bringing people together. All the monsters and magic were just window dressing.
---
Everything they've done since Cata has been specifically tuned to break that engine as much as possible.
---
100%
---
Ythisens was totally right. Dude knew what he was talking about.
---
&gt; such as maybe more intensive moderation from GM's
---
Thats pretty much the only difference. You can be reported if you make you name like "hxgdwhs" and they need to dedicate resources to that.
---
But they're planning normal RP servers, so I really don't see that as a blocker. 
---
It's not about it being a bait and switch.
---
All they've said is "we are considering it for starting zones". We have no firm details on which zones, how long, and if they will ever add sharding back again.
---
Having it in from the start sets a bad precedent. "Hmm, AQ launch looks like itll be really flooded, lets shard to deal with it" is something I can EASILY see them doing if they've already added sharding once. They could also easily go "hmm, leveling is fine until Barrens, it's too crowded, let's put sharding", then go "hmm, STV is not fitting in with the rest of the leveling experience so far, let's fix that with sharding", etc.
---
Spot on. The superiority complex is so baffling, because there’s tons of people who don’t fit the narrative OP and the bandwagoners are trying to present. 
---
I quit retail long ago, but there’s a lot of things that I loved in WoW that weren’t present in vanilla. I’m *hyped* for the shared subscription giving me options because there are things I like in Classic that aren’t present in retail, and vice versa. I’m not suddenly a braindead idiot because monks are my favorite class, for example. 
---
I suspect Classic will attract a ton of similarly lapsed players who like a lot of things that aren’t in vanilla but also don’t find the current state of retail worth it by itself. I for one am going to love WoW again, not just because of Classic on its own but because I have choices. 
---
Oh blizzcon didn’t give you this hint?  I’m sorry it takes you that long :(
---
That makes sense I guess 
---
Look, I want a very classic/blizzlike experience as much as the next guy. But why is this spell batching desired? It just makes the world/character/spells feel detached/laggy/sluggish. 
---
When you have escape artist its not
---
TBH the reputation for "Easy R14 on RP servers" is going to make them the most brutal PvP servers. 
---
It makes it feel like it did in vanilla.
---
During 1-59 content shamans, paladins, warriors, and druids can tank most dungeon content.  As far as I know shamans also had really good threat in lower level dungeons.  But once you hit 60 the most you're going to tank is 10 man raids or trash unless you're a warrior.
---
I like to think every class brings something unique to the table and can dps pre MC.  Starting at places like strathholm i could see alot of specs being left behind like balance druid.  Once you're geared up with epics you hands down cant beat some classes at dps like warrior mage and rogue.
---
There are some solo specs in raids to bring certain buffs however, like having 1 feral druid.
---
And most healers ran a hybrid spec anyway because spending gold on respecing for every raid was too costly and dual spec wasnt a thing yet.  I've seen people run hybrid pvp/pve, dps/heals heals/tank, any combo works.  Most healers take some offensive talents for leveling and what not. 
---
Ashbringer is for PvP actually, the only weapon that could work (but still don't) would be MoM, but tbh the BRE armor penetration is just too great for any other 2H in the game to ever be replaced.
---
However, it is NOT better than the MH/OH combos in AQ and Naxx. 
---
BRE is definetly the best choice until you've gotten a hold of the AQ and/or Naxx MH/OH combo though.
---
This got me thinking lock is a much better-made class than people realized on launch, and Hunter much worse.
---
Trolls get fucking raptors. That should be all you need to know.
---
Fair play to Asmon. Goes from “waste of time to even discuss it” to 
---
“I’m completely wrong”
---
It's about the reliving the experience, which has proven to be incredibly replayable and great. I personally disagree with this decision and would rather not have it but I understand that position and it's not a big deal for me tbh
---
Thanks, I'll give it a watch tonight. 
---
You mean that Blizzcon where they gave us Diablo Immortal? That one? Or the previous one where they announced BfA, claimed to want to "partner with the community", and then went on to release one of the worst expansions to date while not saying a single word on classic for a full year?
---
If there's a "hint" in there, it's to stay the fuck away.
---
“Hey guys, Tips here and today were going to be going on a deep dive inside the original female troll. Awesome.”
---
Well I can at least fill you in on (somewhat) of what changed!!
---
Blizzard's TERRIBLE PR folks absolutely ruined BlizzCon with everything about Diablo Immortal.
---
They fired over 50% of their customer-facing employees. 
---
Presumably, Kaivax was then promoted.
---
Kaivax seems to actually think he has a real job that includes communicating whats happening with the players to the developers, and vice versa. 
---
While I appreciated Ythiesen, I'll never understand how someone could possibly be paid ANY quantity of money to be a "community manager" who manages to make like one post every other week, almost exclusively bragging about his sick tmog or raid accomplishments.  
---
This new guy seems to be taking his role very seriously and I for one tremendously appreciate it. Its the little things like being able to confirm within hours that UBRS wouldn't be counting as a "raid" for loot trading purposes that show me that at least one person at Blizzard is ACTUALLY serious about improving communication.
---
now, unfortunately BFA is just not a game I find fun at all, but I'll enjoy the communications about Classic!
---
Thanks for your answer. 
---
&gt; Because people are quite like sheep. A majority of players say Druids CAN'T tank in vanilla, at fucking all. While they're actually (just like Paladins) great at tanking the 5man content, a druid could also without issues main tank MC and ZG.
---
Druids and Paladins have tanked every raid boss in the game. They are not optimal tanks, but they are viable.
---
Real weirdos will tank on Shaman, Hunters, and Warlocks.
---
Yeah, but a lot of people don't realize just how many 200 players is. It's five full raids. Most servers would've never had that many people around the same area at the same time outside of maybe AQ event. In fact, most servers struggle to get just five active raiding guilds period across both factions.
---
Teebu's
---
Do you know if there is any %hit on caster gear while levelling?
---
This. However I love pvp. The community tends to be nicer and more welcoming/forgiving. Generally just a more adult atmosphere. 
---
This is a quote from Ion himself during Blizzcon where they talked about their plans for sharding. Note the bolded part where he makes very clear this is a very temporary solution to a unique, one time, short-lived problem. Furthermore absolutely nobody is questioning the fact that Blizzard has said they're going to use it for a short time in the starting zones, they're worried that they're blatantly being lied to which is a completely different topic, this one was about confirmed issues we know about (4 content phases and retail spell batching systems)
---
&gt; That is where we are looking at using sharding **in a very limited way**.
---
&gt; We understand, and I understand completely, that sharding is antithetical to a cohesive Classic community.
---
&gt; We are competing over limited resources. When Lord Kazzak is up, and guilds are racing to defeat him, there needs to be only one Lord Kazzak. You're trying to get, you know, if you're trying to lock down the thorium vein spawn in limited sections of the world, you should be competing over limited resources.
---
&gt; That said, when everybody is packed into Valley of Trials, when everybody is packed into Elwynn, we think we can use sharding there in a limited, **time limited way**, to solve the initial launch day load problems, while making sure in the long run, that as server communities solidify, there's a healthy population as single worlds for everyone to live in."
---
Horde have no racials for people with lives... bah gawd... they knew all along.
---
I think a lot of it is them realizing Classic may be more popular than anybody ever thought. A 6-phase content plan may not be feasible for 100,000 subs. But a 6-phase plan with loot restrictions is totally feasible for 500,000 subs. Same deal goes for loot trading, 500,000 subs means hiring more mods isn't a problem. 
---
That’s part of the issue.  They feel BFA is empty and with classic being worked on its resources and time that should be spent making retail better than it is.
---
The most obvious examples of this I’ve seen have been on GameFAQs wow message board.  I don’t play retail so I don’t frequent a lot of retail boards, but I read the posts there in a classic discussion and that was some of the vibe from the hostile players.
---
Can't wait to melt your face with skill and macros! And an off-spec you never saw coming!
---
Wait is there not going to be RPPVP? 
---
I played on Thunderhoof (If I remember right. Have not played WoW since Vanilla). 
---
Great video 
---
Hunter is a great class, it just does low DPS in later raids, making it less desirable to the people lurking classic forums gearing up to play. People just wanting to check out classic will still roll hunter regardless, and that's great! 
---
Shhh, it’s a secret 🤫
---
I plan to invite feral druids and ret paladins to the 5m dungeons I tank on my hunter.
---
In the words of my generation: "Haters gonna hate".
---
How expensive really is life at 60 for a warrior? I know for dps, a lot of what they need are expensive BoEs but who big of a jump is that compared to not having them? essentially, how hard is it to get by without a farming alt?
---
It'll be tough sloggin' on both sides of the fence. Retail players won't be used to helping people out and grouping up for regular quests. After the herd thins you'll start to see more natural cooperation like flipping buffs on the way by or helping someone in a tough spot for no xp gain
---
how did u farm gold with ur priests? they spend a lot on flask and mana pots, farm runes. sucks.
---
Thanks for the feedback. I knew I’d get something wrong because there is just so much to cover!
---
Offset raid epics for hybrid specs and offspecs are your best bet, but you can build it how you want. It really depends on the class, you roll druid the set bonus for the pvp gear is so insanely op you would take that over tier gear. But for warlocks youd keep the 5 set of t2 for pvp because it's that good.
---
I'm not even going to pretend that I know anything about game development or how blizzard does their business, all I know is we're getting closer to release date and they feel ready to share some more info with us. 
---
But feel free to continue with your conspiracy theories.
---
People are just clicking shit tbh lol it's one thing to choose now but it will be different when you're actually playing, a lot of people will reroll before level 40.
---
No wonder it was so hard to find you Reddit account!
---
Uses Disarm, immune. Uses Last Stand. Okay bye I am going to go kill your healer since you hit like a wet noodle!
---
It is Alex Jones! It’s just his “demon” voice
---
Can someone TL;DR me about why is spell batching is such big deal in the community? I didn't follow the whole controversy.
---
6 slot bags for sale for 4 silver at a vendor
---
Thanks for post my video! I’m glad everyone is enjoying it :)
---
For people who have troubles visualizing what was mentioned in the blue post, here's an example of two warriors charging and stunning each other. Video is obviously from retail vanilla.
---
https://youtu.be/cyGOAFV0SkE?t=455
---
7:35
---
Pally with rag makes me wanna cry 
---
"Very limited way" doesn't mean anything. There's no details of exactly what zones, how long, and most important of all, an explicit "we will not use it ever again"
---
As a old Vanilla wow player... who has not played since vanilla wow and is only planning on coming back if Classic is REALLY Classic... please bring RpPvp servers! 
---
Manually removing a curse that hits every person in a 40 man raid multiple times per fight isn't engaging gameplay. It's just tedious and induces carpal tunnel. Anyone advocating against decursive-like functionality should be forced to raid paladin and suffer the consequences.
---
haha nice one.
---
&gt; Negatively, because the people who still stick with retail, despite the state it's been in for more than half a year now, won't see the appeal of Vanilla.
---
Let's not kid ourselves. The rot started to creep in back in 2010. It's been bad for almost a decade.
---
Still rep mine on retail (at least when I played). Though I got mine by farming ZG with a friend in wotlk.
---
Too bad it's indistinguishable from one which was 'earned' in Vanilla or bought on the BMAH
---
You might find 1% to hit from somewhere. That being said I don't remember. The point being is before you get into some real raid content. You will have almost no hit rating on a warlock. You will miss a metric shit ton because of this. Mages got a talent to off set this weakness but, honestly... Fuck them. Silk slipper ass wearing shit muppets.
---
This isn't like copy/pasting the folders to a new hard-drive.
---
They *do* need to polish it if you don't want the port to introduce even more/worse bugs than the original had.
---
You are certainly most welcome, But you did do a great job covering it there is a lot to cover and all the editing you did no one could blame you for forgetting a thing or two.
---
Yeah I should probably just have an official one for my yt channel
---
This is the reason you were able to do all sorts of cool moves in PvP, such as blinding another rogue's vanish, or vanishing the blind. Or predicting the blind and blinding at the same time to waste the other's, etc. It enables a lot of skillful plays that were only possible because of the batching. It's not just for things like double sheeping.
---
That's the big one that remains. Players should not have the ability to punish other players with administrative systems. Never. If people are given the ability to mute people in a game that requires as much typing with strangers as Classic then it's a fundamental conflict of design principles between the old and the new. 
---
Well some of us _do_ know a thing or two about game development. And all of them will tell you that no, they did not.
---
Carry on with your unfounded guesses though.
---
I hear you dude.
---
It literally boggles my mind to think that a Blizzard exec had the nerve to say "you think you do but you don't" about Classic. I rolled on a pserver in early January after BlizzCon got me all hyped for Classic and I was IMMEDIATELY drawn in just as hard as I was 15 years ago.
---
Uh, yes. It enables all kinds of skillful plays that are no longer possible in modern WoW.
---
Selling my Frostfire in tbc to secure enough gold for my epic mount. Then xmog came out a few xpacs later -_-
---
&gt; Doesn't quite seem representative with Warlocks being so popular and Hunter one of the less popular.
---
I kinda miss being a rarity as a warlock in 2005. Ah well.
---
You're hilariously underrated as a content creator.
---
Damn son!
---
They are really getting into it. Love it.
---
Release the planned server names/count so we can start planning which realms we want our guildies on!
---
No prob =)  Sunder does increase DPS a lot in certain situations but only in longer fights.  In instances, it helps any physical DPS class do a lot more damage probably buffs it 2 or 3% for each stack. 
---
True, I was a weirdo in TBC as well. I tanked Karazhan as a Moonkin Druid with my SL/SL Warlock offtankning. We did clear the entire raid though (all in heroic / kara epics though, so it was quite high DPS / heals).
---
But the problem is that even if every damn boss have been tanked by a Druid or Paladin. People will say they can't do it.
---
Agreed I think it's an awesome high skill cap class
---
I dunno man I love the classic grindy model but I really doubt the average kid would today. Wow was casual when it came out but its pretty grognar by the modern fortnite zoomer's standards
---
I know some people don't like leveling and/or want to get to 60 as fast as possible.  But I have never ground mobs except when farming mats, and I played a warrior as my main.  Seems like it would be a boring af way to level.  Also, from what I can remember, there are almost always yellow and green quests to do, so you don't need to skip the red and orange ones.  Just hang onto them for a bit and they'll turn yellow/green as you ding.
---
I think a lot of people were trying to temper their own expectations so that they wouldn't be too disappointed if things didn't go their way.
---
Fortunately, it's becoming more convincing that Blizzard actually is treating this as a passion project, with a level of competency and community concern befitting of the best game of all-time!
---
My flair says otherwise (due to my vanilla char) but I fully plan to main lock
---
Guess we'll see once people get some testing in on live, but I'm willing to bet that people just drastically underestimated the impact of glancing blows in 2006
---
Well OK thrn
---
This. wpvp is what hunters do best. Yes when standing face to face against another class that is geared you'll lose as a hunter (duels), but thats not how you play one. You'e supposed to track people down and surprise them with a burst from 40 yards away. Reset the fight with trap and bandage as many times as you possibly can. And anytime someone catches you offguard you trap them and just run away. A good hunter is sneaky and only take fights that they have an advantage in. why? because they can. Just like rogues and druids. There is a reason these 3 classes are considered best for wpvp.
---
Yes, it enables all kinds of skillful plays that aren't possible in modern WoW.
---
I was one of the officers in that guild.  We all met in another mmo, Horizons.
---
Few of us rerolled alliance near the end of BWL tier and joined Risen to raid.  Alleria was 80:20 alliance by then I think, Horde pop just couldn't recover.
---
There's a delightful irony in redditors downvoting the person who said they didn't want a software-based method of censoring somebody introduced into Classic. 
---
It’s undoubtedly a scam, I think its obvious why they banned him for ripping people off
---
They addressed this. False reporting will result in a PERMANENT account ban. Imagine you wanting to disrupt a R14 for one day but it gets your whole account banned. Many will not risk it at first. Very few will risk it after people get banned for this. It's not that big an issue. 
---
But if inaccessible nodes aren't in the game, the entire economy of Classic WoW will be completely unrecognizable from the original! /s
---
Continually shocked at the lack of Druid. They weren't that rare in vanilla. They aren't even a bad class. They are the most versatile class and all of their roles work fine in 5mans and PvP. They are arguably the fastest levelers. Their QoL is good aside from no standard resurrection. They are great at farming. Can do stealth runs. Is it really just their raid stigma? Is it vanity due to shapeshifting not displaying gear? Are they just boring too play? Are they too difficult to play(esp in pvp [ASIDE from root nuking Rogues lol])? I don't get it. 
---
I would love to play a Druid as I enjoy playing every role, but their tanking style is boring to me. Not enough buttons just a maul machine. I did it in vanilla and it was cool, but I don't like the drawbacks for feral tanks especially in raids. Feral DPS in raids is a little more fun, powershifting gets annoying but nobody is saying you have to do it (HC raiders won't take one even with powershifting so who cares?) Boomkins are awesome (ok they suck but the flavor is tremebdous) and we all know Druid healers are just fine.
---
I am actually sad that faction confined classes are higher than Druid. The class is really suffering and I hate seeing such low numbers for it. At this rate they will literally be the token Druid brought along for MotW and tank HoTs.
---
Its pretty fuckin heavy
---
I have mostly decided on a lock for classic on a pvp server - what are my best prof options? Obviously engineering. I want to do some wpvp. But does it make more sense to take:
---
1 eng/mining, grind as I level. Drop mining at 60 for ????. Or keep mining?
---
2 mining/tailoring. Make some gear and bags. make some bank alts and save mining mats, grind eng at 60. 
---
3 other suggestions?
---
Also, is it worth it to get both goblin and gnomish eng? Sounds like a pain in the ass. Thanks guys. 
---
That's because the scaling was totally inappropriate and people had the mindset of pulling everything in one go
---
If a guild can clear prophet skeram they can probably get about 3-4 more easily. Just like BWL, the first boss (or two in BWL) is a bit of a gate keeper and getting past it gives up a bunch of easy bosses
---
Friend, you gotta mellow out. You can't just throw out statements like "THIS SHIT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUT MONTHS AGO." Did you even see the demo stuff? They barely had a proof of concept to show in November and are still committed to a Summer release date. 
---
I'd say its safe to say we don't have a release date yet because they still have  no idea when they'll be READY to release it. There are still tons of little tiny things like spell batching, tweaking the content release date, figuring out what parts of 1.12 don't work any more.. trying to make it feel like real classic.. etc.
---
They are, for the first time since Overwatch came out, dedicated to releasing something great instead of meeting a release date imposed on them two years earlier by some CFO who thinks phones on games are "the direction gaming is going." Chill out and enjoy the wait.
---
Savage. 
---
Run in. Simultaneous counterspell. Silences simultarneously wear off. Simultaneousy sheep. 
---
Somewhere nearby a cloaked rogue laughs so hard that he accidentally blows stealth. 
---
Yes! 
---
I like these sort of flaws in games. As long as it isn't overly exploitative.
---
Exactly the “port”.  They didn’t actually have to port the game over to the new client. They could have just used nosts code and and the old client and tuned it to there hearts desire and this could probably have been done almost 3 years ago.
---
I played Vanilla on dialup. Dealt with pings of 2000-5000 lol
---
&gt; but having both toons on the same server+faction is so useful. 
---
doesn't that work on pve realms?
---
If you want the Hybrid that can do it all, I'd say go Druid. The hybrid tax is better spread-out between the specs for druid than it is for Paladin, for druid, the specs are roughly equally bad (healing a bit better than the others). 
---
LOOT THE HOUNDS!
---
*In my best Homer voice*: “Now we could play the blame game to decide who made us wipe, or we could blame the foreign guy doxxing the server.”
---
VC = Van Cleef = Deadmines
---
DM = Dire Maul
---
don't @ me
---
I played an ud mage and raped with wotf it is fucking amazing, but trolls have berserking and I think it would be worth checking to see if MQG and berserking stack because 1 sec r11 fireballs would decimate anyone.
---
The main thing I want is the ability to write a decent AP + trinket macro. Bonus if I can write it to handle multiple trinkets based on cooldowns.
---
The spirit of what I want to do is "blow damage cooldowns." I can decide when is the best time to push the button (and that's the only thing that matters for gameplay), but making me bind and press 2-3 different buttons for one conceptual actuion is just bad UX. There is no scenario where a mage wants to blow AP but not MQG or vice versa.
---
Awesome thanks for all the info!
---
I guess if they were actively tweaking the game and patching but I think they understand that defeats the purpose.
---
Its elites IIRC so not really a solo thing for most classes and its over farmed so I think thats why people have been looking elsewhere
---
This is how you become the Daniel Plainview of your server
---
I would say faction balance is a major one not mentioned.
---
Is your guild reforming in classic? Are they recruiting?
---
&gt; is there really much left?
---
Right click reporting is the big one. If that automatically mutes people then I expect it will have major ramifications. At this point I expect them to modify this system into right click ignore or right click report without the mute. 
---
Fucking nice dude.  I was 15 at the time and was there for Zul'Jin opening (3rd server US) and it was awesome.
---
It’s a “guild or community”. People can join a discord and see what’s going on. You’re not locking yourself in to anything. There’s no application process. You’re either a parent playing wow classic and want to socialise with others, or you aren’t.  
---
The people wiping on MC back then (my guild) will certainly do better. MC will be easy and approachable for everyone now.
---
The rest of raiding won’t be “easy” though. I suspect most people will still fail in AQ40 and Naxx, but we’ll see.
---
Because they're target is getting the game out in summer, its spring now so I'm sure they have a lot of stuff to start sharing with us if the game is 3~ months or so from release
---
Apparently you've never seen a Fury/Prot hybrid that makes sure two things never happen in a mass scrim:
---
1) Any enemy around him moves faster than 50% except a paladin, because they are spam-peeling with Piercing Howl
---
2) Any caster they pursue can do jack shit, because Shield Bash --&gt; Conc Blow --&gt; Shield Bash --&gt; Int Shout --&gt; Shield Bash. Oh you bubbled? Shield Slam *poof bubble*.
---
The vast majority of retail players don't care at all. Which means they don't bother responding, which means you only see the assholes.
---
This is true.  Often the OT has the more challenging job, depending upon the fight, and having 1-2 good OT's is invaluable.
---
But as others have said, tanks are expected to have good attendance, or it can cripple raid progression.  If you can't show up for most raids, they will most likely try to replace you with someone who will.
---
They already plan to roll out content in phases. Even if they aren't doing it as full on patches, they will be making changes. Even their "sharding for launch" means they will be tweaking as time goes on.
---
&gt; Well some of us do know a thing or two about game development.
---

---
Occasional updates from the wow classic team does not redeem 12+ years to total SjW style mediocrity.
---
The company is still awful, but I'm pretty happy with how the classic team is doing.
---
Prot war is better than you think, you make a good FC in WSG, and it takes forever to kill you in AB so you can spin the flag until your mates respawn / arrive.
---
shh, you'll disrupt the circlejerk. Managing threat is hard OK
---
exactly this. thank you.
---
There are a lot of unknowns, they haven't even announced how pvp will slot into the release schedule 
---
mats. does this mean that harmstring strat is a thing again? it wasnt working in a demo
---
&gt; LONG SHOT : Will led to Blizzard removing Activision shackles in the future.
---
It’s OK to dream.
---
BFA is literally a different genre of video game than Classic WoW. BFA is closer to Destiny than it is WoW at launch.
---
Having played on a pserver, something about Classic WoW just makes you want to go have positive interactions with the other players. I played BFA for a few months after release and you bet your butt I'd kick/ignore you if you missed a single interrupt in a 1750 3s match and throw a screaming fit if we wiped twice in an M+. 
---
Aside from whispering a few people asking questions about where to find stuff in General, I also damn sure didn't ever help anyone else out.. with anything, for any reason. 
---
But within 30 minutes of starting to play Classic that mindset was already completely gone. I was inviting anyone I saw in a quest area to party up, and we'd almost always continue questing together if we had some overlap. If I did as much as a single quest with someone I would make them a great new piece of leather gear. I was constantly talking to people in general chat, reporting rare locations, etc.
---
IMO, nothing to worry about. Its a totally different game, where interacting with other players is literally one of the most important mechanics to being able to play / enjoy successfully. 
---
You know what who am I kidding I don’t know a thing about making a game, ignore the previous.
---
Voidwalker when summoned: "Send me back."
---
What a beautiful bond :)
---
I believe the droprate back in vanilla was much lower than today if im not mistaken. 1.3 changed it to 1% up from .2%
---
Bust out the dunce cap boyos, this cheeto fingered fiend needs a time out
---
Definitely agree. I *never* thought I'd see Blizz roll out a vanilla server. Even though I am more of a BC fan, vanilla has a special place in my heart. 
---
This is what I think most people feel. Most of us are too old and busy to grind our R14, and its now WIDELY known how A: Bullshit the grind is, and B: How long it takes.
---
Most people will just totally disregard it this time around. 
---
The females do flips too
---
Well, as you mentioned. druids will most likely heal. Their healing isnt't too interesting, as is their tanking. Oomkin is a memespec and feral not even "viable" with annoying powershifting, compared to meta DDs. They're fine for 5 mans, pvp and 20 mans, but everything goes there, pretty much "zero" challenge, so I guess many people opt for more -&gt; 40 mans / progress raiding.
---
It’s no different from having a guild forum and vent imo
---
Remember doing that. Approaching level:skull elites and almost fell off my chair. Hightailing straight outta there. Good times!
---
Shit, not even that. It comes down to taking a pvp server and changing the description to “RP-PVP”. Sure, RP servers had special rules; but i don’t remember ever seeing them enforced.
---
I would be more surprised if they *weren’t* there on release.
---
it's very close though. seen one of all 4 of those classes consistently top meters on c'thun. depends on the fight too
---
For those that don't like this model, there's a dozen other games they can play.
---
For those that like this model, there's only one.  And it comes out this summer.
---
What kind of blasphemy is this? Recognizing that there are pros and cons that appeal to different people?
---
Your OP was long as shit. Honestly you've got to keep things as small as possible these days. 
---
It's going to be interesting if the people who played mage in Vanilla and a different class in Classic have a higher dissatisfaction than people who originally played other classes. 
---
"Time limited way" in the context of launch (When everyone is packed into Valley of Trials or Elwynn) is extremely clear on how they intend to use sharding. If you want to bury your head in the sand and claim the sky is falling in regards to sharding just because Blizzard hasn't specifically stated X time in Y zones then go ahead but you're in the vast minority since most people have a problem with sharding think they're being lied to, not that they haven't been clear in how they intent to use sharding.
---
Three of us are up on VanillaFriends, but so far no sign of the leader.  Ive yet to reach out to the others, but I may come closer to launch
---
&gt;Blizzard is already starting to feel like their old self.
---
This level of communication is too much for vanilla WoW. Please nerf. #nochanges
---
I will still miss Korrak, but I have hard time staying sad about it with all the amazing news coming out of the Classic team.
---
Will probably enhance it.  VOIP has always been big, and Discord functions just as well as for text chat.  Come to think of it, it will probably be super popular just because it can functionally replace a guild website as far as congregating and presenting information.  
---
The batching changes weren't altered in wrath/cata, it's a warlords era change I believe.
---
&gt; one thing that keep me away from WoW is that we know everything even before it goes live, and theres is too much information for every single thing.
---
So you choose to play a game that's 15 years old and we literally know every single thing
---
Mumble was widely used back in the day along with ventrilo and teamspeak. It's free and open-source. It wasn't all text chat.
---
Discord quality falls short of the above-mentioned.
---
I used to host my guilds mumble server back in the day for nothing but the cost of electricity. I probably will again once classic comes back.
---
To answer your question: it won't be much different than it was.
---
Depends on how much time you got on your hand and on aesthetics. Gnome is objectively better but also uglier, and diplomacy will be a great thing if you're not a full-time player. But alliance warlocks have to deal with undead rogues all the time, I say go orc.
---
Dammit I still can't decide:
---
Rogue is my default;
---
warrior has downsides but, tank;
---
Tempted by priest, will always find work as a priest.
---
But, there is a Warlock shaped itch that is begging to be scratched. Absolutely screaming for it. The solo play options are immense. The class fantasy is appealing. The group play, well, I wanna see just what I could do as a lock in 5 mans and raids. I know how my old vanilla squad worked and I wanna see how I measure up. 
---
This is such a hard choice.
---
I'm still torn. Back in the day I played my shaman, enh / ele hybrid. God was it bad. Leveling as well, absolute snoozefest. And I have almost no intention of going heal in classic so I may skip the shaman.  
---
I still think about "making" enh viable, or offtanking and such stuff. But so much work that most likely won't pay off.
---
I never play anything but Orcs.
---
I know it's popular to have a super low opinion of Blizzard on here, but you're fucking delusional if you think they don't have an engineer capable of *understanding* the source code they have. 
---
Female Tauren, female Undead, Gnomes in general, female Dwarves, Male NE. My main faction will be Horde and I'll play every class except Paladin and I'll possibly skip priest and/or hunter too. Undead Rogue, Orc warrior and undecided Shaman will be my most played with the Rogue being my main.
---
These days it's just constant alt-right propaganda/trolling, hopefully classic will actually be moderated
---
That was a seperate issue related to improved client side prediction for resources, they disabled that even in the blizzcon demo.
---
Not everyone, still chasing that CE
---
Just thought I'd share this once again, to really give some insight on spell batching from Neilyos perspective.
---
Also shoutout to Ohhgee for explaining this thoroughly in a video he made shortly after the Classic demo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6R-HSzndQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6R-HSzndQ)
---
This is true but if the person you're fighting is engaged with a mob, you can beat them down to low % and let the mob get the killing blow, applying the armor durability loss. 
---
no matter how badass your gear looks you're still a gnome at the end of the day :(
---
5k population caps, no dynamic respawns would be fine with me
---
Someone expressed concerns about the options to have the new type of water.
---
I'm not experienced with it myself, but supposedly the new water allows you to see beneath the surface of water, which wasn't possible with the old water. This causes significant changes to PvP near water because people can no longer hide in water, and gives a huge disadvantage to people using the old water graphics, forcing people to use the new graphics. 
---
If these concerns are true, then Blizzard should address this and force the old water graphics.
---
This is a good point. Discord offers a lot of other resources as well. I remember having to download an absolutely garbage calendar addon for my guild a long time ago and never got it to work, so I got kicked. Discord consolidates all of that and makes it easily accessible. 
---
It's not that they think they are being lied to. Its that they, like I, do not trust Blizzard to not implement it again later down the road. "Time limited way" and "very limited way" both could apply to the opening of AQ event, for example. The wording they've given is intentionally vague, and that's a problem, because it let's them use sharding again without having lied to us or gone back on their word.
---
I can't imagine they won't. As I said I hesitate to use the word OP because you can create scenarios where other classes are better for some things. All of that being said. Mages were over tuned. They have life as easy as it can get.
---
It’s such a simple change, and which their newfound willingness to listen to the community, I really expect we’ll see them on launch. 
---
Mumble was definitely used, but I don't recall it being used too often in the vanilla days. It took a while for software like that to propagate. 
---
I don't play races under 5ft tall.
---
Quality is irrelevant to user base.  You tell me to download mumble I’d just shrug and only do it if I really needed to for guild stuff.  Discord I’ve already got installed, even if I hardly use it because most discord’s suck.
---
It's a long raid with a shit load of very annoying trash.
---
In Naxx at least you can do each wing piecemeal and they don't take that long. The trash doesn't feel as bad either.
---
They were pretty expensive on vanilla.
---
But what if he doesn't want to be a thot?
---
No. It decreased. But not killed. Most people wont care, only hardcore PvPers, and those are queued in BGs 24/7, not out in the world.
---
Yea, I remember when this got added. There's one quest giver in the barrens that has about 10+ quests. The MAIN quest giver there, people would keep it dead 24/7 preventing people from leveling.
---
When this got implemented, they made her a level 60 elite with summons upon agro.
---
It recently came out that Blizzard had started working on this before they send the CnD to the Nost team.  
---
I'm not trying to take anything away from what happened with Nost and the conversation it generated for Classic. However, don't take anything away from the people who have been asking for Classic Servers since early 2010s.
---
Of happiness.
---
It's far more likely for a section of Blizzard to completely start a new company than for Blizzard to no longer be with Activision
---
Hell yea. It's even more fun now because you're more familiar with all the possibilities.
---
Holy shit: Meat! I better make sure not to vendor this because I'm gonna level the shit out of cooking this time!
---
Holy shit, a node of copper! I bet those sell pretty well so this time I'm gonna have a couple gold by the time I'm level 10!
---
Holy shit, dude, make sure you grab that briarthorn! If you get Swift Thistle, that stuff sells like crack to PVPers!
---
Holy shit, Sharp Claw! I don't remember what this is for but it's white so I may hold off before selling it or mailing it to a mule!
---
Holy shit, dude, let's make some mules real quick. Maybe get them to level 5 so we can at least get 75/75 professions on them!
---
Holy shit, I actually have a valid reason to use healing potions instead of thinking I need to horde them for later!
---
Holy shit, this game is running smooth as hell and the load times are awesome!
---
Holy shit! A 6-slot bag. Now I can hold more stuff.
---
This goes on and on.
---
&gt; I respectfully disagree. I can see how that's your prefered way of playing but I don't believe blizzard intended it to be that way. 
---
What you believe is neither here nor there. That was the vanilla experience and confirmed intentional from the designers.
---
&gt; I for one much prefer running into people and pvping while I level and hunt for mobs and mats.
---
I was not asking you what you prefer. I was telling you how vanilla was.
---
&gt; And the "shitty PvP" game comment is just silly honestly, PvP is a huge part of the game and a ton of fun for a ton of people. 
---
It has nothing to do with world PvP against the other faction. It turns PvE into a PvP game against your own faction where you race to tag monsters as they materialise out of thin air. Instead of being in a lonely but immersive world where you are on a quest and the things you kill stay dead.
---
As a self appointed king of meme specs id say the biggest issue for shamans who dont want to heal is: there is no warlock curse. No curse debuffs nature resistance
---
Enhance is basically just a novel way to buff your melee
---
Some say ele can be good once your decked out in naxx but my counter argument is what isnt viable when you give it BIS naxx gear?
---
You know Blizzard changed the game quite a lot during Vanilla, right? The game exists in more than one form, contrary to what you private server fetishists would believe. :)
---
donut.
---
Right! Although they're fun as hell, I don't ever feel completely satisfied for the more difficult stuff: Like getting exalted/revered with, for example, the Goblin cities.
---
But put me in Classic and I'll be killing pirates south of Ratchet all day like: "Fuck yea, 5 rep a piece and plenty of Linen cloth and silver for us!"
---
Damn, that's alot of Warlocks and Priests.
---
Dont swedes have a bad reputation in wow?
---
Shoutout to the Mangos devs and the community wide efforts to create the Mangos emulation project. Without them, Nost as a server wouldn't have even existed.
---
I use the scimitar that let's you move the number pad forward or back. Typically have the ball of my thumb on the back row. 
---
Quality is very important, unless you want to misunderstand an order from the raid leader. 
---
Having one that enunciated well was also important, but that's another story.
---
I can't stand discord either, I don't have it installed.
---
Currency shop, transmog and wow token for classic.
---
Yup. I remember when I was very young watching my brother play his Shaman grind that for his mount so it was cheaper. When I asked him why not keep going for rank 14 (young and naive I was) he just said the mount was all he was looking for.
---
Underwater breathing allowed you to swim deep under water to summon that lazy person who couldn't bother to run and fly to you. Faster internet and SSDs probably mean they won't drown a second after the loading screen disappears, but I'll still try.
---
I remember signing that petition. There’s no doubt that had an influence on Blizzard’s decision for classic
---
i would say its 'okay' at both. 
---
probably wouldnt run it in a solo healer situation and pve healers in serious guilds wont take u seriously. 
---
Nostalrius was living proof that there was a growing demand for Vanilla.
---
They were like a living petition of signatures.
---
Honestly every time I talk about this I just get the usual “you can’t afford $15 a month?” And just do it anyways. A lot of times I get stupid gift cards as well. The visa ones you can use anywhere, I just end up using those 
---
Didn't we already have one of these not even a week ago?
---
Every Broodlord wipe ever: "LOL I thought I could cast just 1 more shadowbolt, but then it crit with improved shadow bolt and 5 shadow weaving stacks up."
---
&gt;My question to you all is how bad do shaman have it throughout the game? At max level are you left solely to healing (by that I mean spamming one ability often downranked) how is the quality of life? Is the elemental/resto hybrid build still good for dps roles? (not raiding, dungeons)
---
30/0/21 is an optimal spec for a premade WSG team, and most will bring at least 2. So it's extremely good for that. In this role you do offhealing and also a lot of damage, it's pretty intense and skill based in PvP and awesome. 
---
Enhance is trash and you have to heal in any somewhat serious raiding guild. 
---
Warrior is first, as always.
---
I think it's because WoW Retail is gradually dying...

---
They probably see Classic as a way stop or slow the bleeding and to get a significant boost in subs, and without having to put much resources into it.  And when a company starts to struggle, it's funny how they often start being nicer to their customers.
---
They should add an in-game item for him; something tongue-in-cheek. 
---
We had these tools back in 2005. Why does everything think 2005 was some kind of dark era?
---
&gt; You really think they implemented spell batching, AV, content &amp; loot release plans, and removed loot trading... all in two weeks? After having done nothing for the past two years?
---
Those things are already done and have been done for over a decade. Most of Classic WoW is in the decision making process. And considering "classic WoW" is such a subjective term it takes a lot of deliberation to make a final decision on all these matters.

I had to go to the store and buy the game time cards because my parents would let me use CC on the internet lol
---
Wait, did they remove loot trading? Did I miss that? I saw the content/loot/1.12 AV/spell batching posts, but I didn't see anything new on loot trading... can you fill me in?
---
Didn't do a lot of raiding on the priest, so I can't give you a really detailed answer. I do remember that I had a prot warrior friend who also needed to do some farming so he and I would group up because we both needed help. Unfortunately, I don't remember much more than that.
---
Undead master race 
---
I was so addicted in college that I justified the 15 dollars as a smart investment.
---
I used to think “well, if I take a girl to the club, that’s at least two drinks 🍹, so that’s 15 dollars right there. Then I might have to feed her before I smash...let me just stay home and kill these wolves.”
---
And those plastic boxes added up like trophies on my shelf.
---
It gives me the courage to face a new day
---
People don't do it because you need to farm consumables like crazy for each raid to increase attack speed. 
---
A Druid tank does well on Rag, often able to get Fire resist gear with tank stats a little easier than warriors. We had one for runs when we didn’t need the extra healer 
---
\*Hunter pulls 20 mobs\*
---
\*Chuckles\* "We're in Danger"
---
server pop is still one of the "main" questions still standing﻿.
---
Love the communication from devs!
---
At no point ever in my career of playing WoW or any MMO did the general population ever "finally" understand the purpose of CC, watching your mana/power, letting the tank build some threat before you go berserk, not standing in stuff that looks like it would hurt you IRL, etc. And considering the past 10 years of WoW has conditioned players specifically not to care about these things, if anything Classic WoW will probably be a bit frustrating for a while.
---
I wouldn't expect them to be in classic based on what I've seen recently is what I'm saying.  There would have to be something *wildly* wrong with the drop rate, and I know pservs aren't perfect by any means, but they also aren't off by a factor of 10....
---
I solod them fine in vanilla :p
---
&gt; actual griefers do not get deterred from griefing and city raiders who do open world content do get punished.
---
***BOTH*** get punished for killing civilians. 
---
&gt;In my opinion raiding and controlling an enemy city for half a day is not griefing
---
Blizzard and much of the community would disagree with this opinion. Not all servers are faction-balanced enough for the minority to be able to do something about an event like this. In essence, a horde raid on IF on a 9:1 server is just the horde players griefing the alliance players, because they CAN'T compete.
---
&gt;playerdriven content and this should be made possible 
---
It's absolutely still possible. Just avoid facerolling through every lvl 10 NPC you see.
---
Nice touch pulling the claim that "all" this was done in the last two weeks out of thin air.
---
A paladin and a shaman in the same raid team?
---
Isn’t there a quest 2 slot bag from Westfall? 
---
This was like, every vanilla UBRS run I ever did. :)
---
Exactly. Rep grinding and such is a great example. Theres 0 chance in hell I'll engage in such things for character development longterm on an unstable unreliable private server. 
---
But those grinds etc are exactly what I miss so bet your ass you'll see me out there on the grinding spots with ya :D 
---
I drink your felshake, I drink it up!
---
Should be easing into a nice salary job shortly after WoW classic launches (if it launches late summer). So stoked to play WoW in financially stable adulthood! I started playing in 2006 at age 12, and the friends I played with back then are all going back too - going to be awesome :D 
---
Hearthstone has gotten a lot worse in quality over those past 3 years. And by worst I mean a LOT worse. ALL of 2018 has basically consisted of one single stale meta, Blizzard has gotten more and more greedy with monetization, no new modes or even quality of life features have been added for years now (the only exception being Dungeon Run). I'm sure r/hearthstone will be happy to tell you more if you want.
---
I have played the bulk of every AAA MMO around other than EQ1/2, and I find your statement to be true in *all* of them that actually have RP-PVP servers.  It will forever and always be my #1 choice, and I don't even really RP (though I respect people that do and don't try to wreck their RP and have been known to respond "in character" to them from time to time)
---
Shoutout to blizz for making the game, without them, Nost as a server wouldve never existed
---
As a dwarf hunter in late vanilla/early BC, I spent all the gold I made on every vendor/AH gear upgrade I could find, not realizing that the game drops gear at an acceptable rate for leveling. I thought being broke for gear was part of the game haha. 
---
I also didn’t know certain specs/talents were better for leveling, so I specced marks and OOMed my way to 40 (mana hunter ftw)
---
lmao...can you imagine playing with the current playerbase of a server like Emerald Dream but in vanilla and thinking you were gonna have an easy time ranking
---
My thinking, and others can correct me if I'm wrong, is you'll need to be a bit lucky (in addition to very committed and quite skilled) to get Sulfuras as a Paladin. You might be able to get it after your guild's main tank, off tank, and maybe a DPS or two. 
---
If you did pull it off though, that'd be fricking epic. 
---
With that said, if that's what you're into, and can commit yourself to it, then do it. It'd make you LEGENDARY on your realm as opposed to just another Orc Warlock. 
---
I suppose I do remember a couple shamans that had Sulfuras on the servers I played on back in vanilla, so it does happen. 
---
Griefers that don't rank don't care about a dhk that will not affect them at all.
---
There might be some, but if your intention is to use Hit gear from earlier levels, i wouldnt recommend it, as far as DPS goes the +spell dmg/shadow dmg from the pre raid bis lists sim for more damage than downgrading any of the pieces for a couple hit rating
---
Never played a private server. For the entire duration of vanilla, barring people listing them too low because they didn't know, they were expensive. Now maybe that was specific to the two servers I played on but I doubt it.
---
Same here. Definitely more a BC fan but Vanilla is still amazing and Nostalrius made me realize how much I missed that version of WoW
---
Even if youre a BC fan or a Wrath fan or a Vanilla fan. The important thing I think is that they are releasing the game in the version that people actually want. A version of the game that people love and that hasnt been changed by Cataclysm or Activision. 
---
Just a blue post about the server population now and i'm done 
---
I was saying this to my friend the other day, he wasn't convinced. Take WoW in a new direction after Naxx / change the events / alternate time-line.
---
Play both.
---
Well I also know a thing or two about software development and I don't know where you think you get your guesses from.
---
Despite no one claiming this was done in two week, it's not implausible at all. How much work do you think it is to disable the Dire Maul portals for now and remove the related quests? Or how high do you think spell batching is on the priority list?
---
Those are all such minor features in terms of development, I'm completely flabbergasted that you think they must have been decided upon early and implemented over a long period of time.
---
While you're quite right that they would want more info to get out closer to release as a PR choice, for very similar reasons a lot of this stuff will likely bubble up now as a release is on the horizon.
---
I *currently* have a 60 on the most popular pserv, and I've never seen it for more than 50g in the few months I've played there.  Usually around 20-30.   
---
100% this, after reading some of the venomous stuff coming from the "oldies but goldies" it's actually really put me off going back to classic if these are the types of people i have to "Oh no be social" with. 
---
Your non-healing specs are garbage. You can make ele work with some expansion Bis gear in pvp. That being said thats one hell of a wait for a pay off a mage is getting day one. Don't play a shaman unless you wanna heal or you enjoy suffering.
---
Nost was the hero we deserved but not the one we need right now. It was shutdown so we could have classic, it could take it. It's not official classic but it was the best private serv there was, the silent hero, Nostalrius. Amen.
---
I've never seen an honor farming group be that rigid about their classes, and I have around 500,000 HKs between live and private servers, a good number of which are from classic. A good group of players could spam wins with like an entire team of balance druids. This whole thing reads like some sort of bizarro-WoW that I've never played, but I am not too surprised, considering the amount of groups I see with people playing disc priests over shadow. The arena comp mindset seems to have really taken hold on private servers, but it's mostly irrelevant for vanilla BGs in my experience.
---
I also don't really understand your insistence on comparing individual talent trees. Surely you've realized by now that vanilla classes are typically balanced by the class, not by the individual trees? I was always talking about class balance, since my first post.
---
&gt;"I'll never understand how someone could possibly be paid ANY quantity of money to be a "community manager" who manages to make like one post every other week, almost exclusively bragging about his sick tmog or raid accomplishments."
---
If that was who Ythisens was, nobody would be missing him as much as they are right now.
---
And I can say without a doubt that was not who Ythisens was at all. You must be thinking of someone else.
---
Shaman/Paladin are actually the most popular, since they wont be spilt in two
---
[10 slot](http://classicdb.ch/?item=932) @ about 30% - and with three (?) in the dungeon, its about 1 per run.
---
Flight masters and plenty quest NPCs doesn't give DHK
---
Ele is decent at pvp. Don't forget to let him know though. It's total garbage until you have all the broken gear from AQ40 patch. Even then it becomes a caster that can burst moderately well. It's an okay spec. I wouldn't call it good though. Viable for pvp would be more accurate. Viable being the key word not good.
---
Sure that’s a good way of using alts but this will be done by top guilds. You said mandatory, I’d say this implies its optional to minmax.
---
Just gonna play something out for clarity:
---
If you're ranking to 14, you're likely doing so seriously. 
---
If you're PVPing seriously, you're likely not doing so in PUG raids in cities.
---
If you're not in PUG raids in cities (read: still able to raid cities, just avoiding killing DHK NPCs), then you have nothing to worry about.
---
What you seem to want is to just be able to go into IF or Org and fuck up the city with no repercussions. 
---
What other people see you 'going into IF or Org and fuck up the city' as (if you're just killing every DHK NPC) is griefing.
---
The goal of the system is to *discourage* griefing.
---
Rules exist in warfare in the Warcraft universe. Faction leaders ***generally*** discourage the indiscriminate killing of civilians.
---
*that is, until Blizzard decided to just start nuking things and burning entire cities with little to no reason*.
---
Interesting. Th margin of error is no greater than 1 mil at all times. So Dec18 was between 2 and 3 million subs which is bolstered by the 2.7mil twitter leak. 
---
Im pretty sure judgement is only good for pvp sadly :(
---
&gt; I'm more worried about elitists than retail players honestly.
---
I don't what you mean by "elitists" but the people who are obnoxious and cause drama are usually people who think so highly of their opinion, that they can't have a normal discussion about anything w/o being offended by every fact/opinion/argument that disagrees with them. If those are "elitists" then I fully agree.
---
But if you simply mean hardcore players who know their shit and try to be the best players they can while playing with likeminded people then I have to disagree. Those two types are more often than not *different* people.
---
stoneform my man
---
not being able to be blinded by a rogue is just 10/10
---
Honestly people are just greedy (myself included) and spend too much gold on shit they don't really need, especially when they just hit 60. If you're patient and don't waste any gold from 40-60, then spend abut 2 weeks casually just farming gold everyday you should get it about 2 weeks after you hit 60. It's just that people hit 60 and have like 400g and think "ahh man i'm not even halfway there, f\*ck this shit i'm buying my devilsaur set" then end up never getting their epic mount.
---
Only one of those things (spell batching) required any significant development effort. 
---
The rest are all matters of planning, with the exception of loot trading which would have required adding a check to see if the item dropped in a raid (which would be less than a day of a single developer's time).
---
They also haven't "done nothing" for the past two years; these are just the kind of matters that are best tackled towards the end of the development cycle. Most of the development time on Classic has gone into actually making the game itself work. They didn't spend two years thinking about whether Dire Maul should be in at launch or not.
---
So yes, I do really think that they probably only recently got their implementation of spell batching into a working state and finalized their plans on content release, AV and loot trading.
---
No? We had all that back then, it just wasn't called discord...
---
Because they were 12 in 2005
---
I'm pretty sure they'll announce the release date pretty soon.
---
The cascade of news is to hype us up. A hyped core audience is basically a free marketing tool. 
---
Did you skip the part where I specifically stated "on fear relevant fights"
---
The Classic team has engineers who *wrote* the fucking source code (well, parts of it at least).
---
Their models are just so awkward. Skinny torsos and then unnecessarily buff arms and legs, looks ridiculous.
---
Thank you for the detailed response.  The Corsair Scimitar does look like a higher quality mouse, and the biggest downside of the Naga for me is having to use Synapse.  However, I do like the design of the Naga Hex over all the other MMO mice.  There's no way I will use all 12 of those buttons.  Well, not deliberately.  Looks like it will happen a lot by accident.
---
How is affli for leveling? I think I read destro being better later on, but affli seems pretty hilarious putting the standard 3 dots + sl + nightfall and having 5-6 debuffs on several targets.
---
No one is talking about private servers.
---
They could if they wanted to
---
it's called a joke
---
&gt; We did MC, ZG, BWL, AQ20 and 40 + some of naxx with a Druid and Warrior swapping the role as main tank. Paladin off tank, Druid and Priest caster DPS etc etc.
---
So what you are basically saying is that you were not affected at all by elitists when doing all this content and just chose to play the way you liked?
---
I fully agree with this and can confirm from my experience as well!
---
&gt; office job
---
What better time for some WoW?
---
Why would you a private server’s code? Lol 
---
I’m much happier having them take the time to restore THEIR working code. Great things take time.
---
Should be more hunters alive lol
---
Is that tree of life form I see to the left of the moonkin? I'm guessing this was during pre tbc patch 2.0?
---
Yep though it's 10 slot and unique [Fel Steed Saddlebags](https://web.archive.org/web/20050116051732/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=932)

---
its funny really. with shamans, youre damned if you do or damned if you dont
---
resto is generally the only permissible raiding spec, yet is is nearly worthless in pvp
---
no matter what you do, you have to limit yourself 
---
Rogue was, is and always will be the class I will main.
---
I can't stop making a "click click click" sound with my tongue and the roof of my mouth.  Please help.
---
Might just be because they kinda kept us looking like leveling hobos unless you were a warrior. 
---
yea but doubles your problem of needing gear. seems kind of silly to spend all that time leveling an alt, gearing it up, when you could just spend that time farming gold for respecs
---
Dot and wand is great. You can go nonstop. 
---
None of that ever happens in vanilla from my experience. Your examples are entirely made up. Also most people don't PUG, except very early on or when content is already way on farm. People join guilds, organize and raid with them.
---
^^^Yeah ^^^but ^^^that ^^^was ^^^also ^^^kinda ^^^funny.
---
I'm thinking warrior, I want to be able to tank easily throughout leveling to find groups in a snap, but do I have to go full protection? I've heard you can do mostly fury and tank fine pre-raids, true? Also I want to have enough money early on so I'm thinking 2 gathering professions like mining/skinning. Any thoughts? I'm super excited to get a fresh start on mostly vanilla WoW!
---
Do I really think a multi billion dollar, fortune 500 company, can implement aspects of a 15 year old game, that they made originally, in a short time frame? hmmmmm
---
Even then, who the fuck cares? They are giving the fans what they (said they) wanted. Who really cares if they have been working on it for 2 years or 2 weeks? It's happening the way we want it to happen.
---
People like you are gonna bitch no matter what. Hope I don't run into you in game. Unless you are on Alliance.
---
Also, I think you are off base about how difficult it was or how long it took. If you actually read the post, you would know that spell batching was never removed and was simply tweaked to be closer (or exactly like) the original. 
---
Content and Loot Plans were known November of Last year, nearly 6 months ago now. They didn't mention any loot specifically, but rather the dates for the patches. Which is what controls what loot will be available and when. 
---
I can't imagine changing the way loot trading would be too difficult either.
---
Just because you claim to have knowledge of game development means nothing. Even if you were actually a game dev, you thinking it should take longer than 2 weeks maybe just means you're bad at game dev?
---
lol who else shoule get it
---
Potato music for potato graphics. I dig it. 
---
That's true, but it can still be seen as a reaction to the sheer popularity of Nost.
---
I'm not sure Blizzard would have considered it if they didn't see just how big Nostalrius was. 
---
Loot trading will only be enabled for instances that have a lockout (ie. raids)
---
Absolutely insane 
---
Most of my wow experience was in classic.  I was the 2nd mage on my server to get the full t2 set.  
---
I don’t think you realize the difficulty in reaching and completing naxx.  There were only a few guilds on the server that could do it.  Those guilds were not casual, and were not easy to get into to.  
---
You were expected to play 8+ hours a day, every day.  If you weren’t in a raid you were farming mats, gold, gear, etc. for raiding.  Raids themselves could be 6+ hours long, and everyone was expected to stay until it disbanded.  Learning a dungeon was mind numbing.  Wiping over and over for days, sometimes weeks, to get 40 ppl to learn the fight and execute it perfectly.  
---
I still miss it ;)

Allright I was completely unsure if the guy who gets upvoted saying stuff about elitists and PUGs was a troll. But this explains it ty.
---
I can only confirm. All this talk about elitisits/min-maxers/hardcore players is basically BS. None of that affects anyone except the very few people who *want* to be like that but don't put in the effort.
---
Also the vast majority is raiding/doing content in guilds, so there is really no issue regarding all of this.
---
Their classic communication*
---
Shoutout for earth for having snow storms which created the name for Blizzard.
---
It is absolutely relevant info.  They are not going to be 200-300g.  I can login RIGHT NOW and see 8 of them for under 30g on the AH of a popular pserv, and my addons are showing that to be nearly 50% over the historical value I've scanned.     There is absolutely *no* way the drop rate is 10x higher on a pserv to make the cost 1/10th.  
---
They are super, super in the minority. I personally haven't seen any of those so far in the actual game.
---
Or actually not even in forum discussions at all. The vast majority of comments and upvotes go in the complete other direction.
---
Can you even reach Ragnaros, little guy? maybe befriend a few tauren to help lift you. :D
---
Female trolls are downright sexy though.
---
how do I apply 
---
Good. I'd be pissed if I were playing Vanilla and someone shows up as a Draenei somehow.
---
This was definitely pre tbc.  We didnt run it after tbc dropped.
---
&gt; If you offered them a choice between High Elves or a complete revamp of the game's systems, an alarming amount of people would choose the former.
---
This sentence alone is enough for me to never even consider joining that community. It was these people who annoyed me in the first place when I quit WoW.
---
Not sure what could be done for gameplay considering the difference between retail &amp; Vanilla at this point, but I’m hoping the retail team takes note of how Classic has actively listened &amp; responded to the community’s desires. Blizzard has lost a lot of the good faith they used to be able to bank on, but following the Classic team’s response to the community would go a long way towards repairing the damage from ignoring BfA’s alpha/beta feedback.
---
I have thought about this.  I know swifty swears by them.  Not like he has much of a choice, but if it works for him it can work for anyone.
---
You lose a ton of stam though? I always found this the tradeoff on warriors. Wearing t13 was great for pvp as I'd last so much longer and most damage came from weapon, but with aq and bwl. Gear did hit harder but hp would be much lower. 
---
Blasphemy, give me the sweet sweet dial up experience again please  
---
Honestly this is my biggest hope.
---
I do want to play classic, really do, and I will. But I already played it a ton as a hardcore raider back in the day and further, intermittently, on private servers. I hope they leave it running for a long time as a testament to what it was. But I also know nostalgia will only carry for so long. The simple fact is, it won't ever be the same because I already know "everything," and that bit of wonder will simply not be there.
---
Long term gain, should this be successful, would be a return to the older design philosophy.
---
People point to specific features that did *this* or *that* to WoW. But individual things like a guild bank didn't "kill" WoW. In fact some improvements, taken in exclusion, that wouldn't be #nochanges worthy are arguably better (maybe not for classic but you get my point). My point is that a general change of philosophy "killed" WoW and if we can fix that it's a win for everyone.
---
This may very well be true, but when Uziga did it, I remember it being something unheard of.  She was super excited to have done it.
---
&gt; But once you hit 60 the most you're going to tank is 10 man raids or trash unless you're a warrior.
---
This is demonstrably false. Druids and Paladins have tanked every raid boss in the game and Hunters have tanked up to Nef.
---
I'm not aware of any shaman tanking raid bosses, but I'm sure they could do Ony and MC.
---
Just buy bags from the AH. They  don't become soulbound so you can resell them or give them to your bank alts.
---
I don't understand why so many people should get it before Paladin/Shamans. People raid to obtain gear to do both PvE and PvP. Sulfuras is literally a GODLIKE weapon for Ret and Enhancement, but BRE is better for Warriors. So why shouldn't it go to a Ret or Enhancement that has commited for a good time getting the mats for it? 
---
I disagree. Most of the discussions are interesting and pretty much void of any kind of trolling with a few exceptions.
---
ever play an idiotic ele/enh on-hit build that abuses the kazzak neck, flametongue, and an alcors or something of that nature that stacks like 2/3 caster gear 1/3 melee gear?
---
its hilarious
---
real shame some private servers nerf it
---
There’s a good chance if you make that dwarf paladin you will never get sulfuras. Keep in mind realistic goals, Ret sucks for pvp and pve and you will have trouble getting good gear.
---
Orc warlock isn’t just strong, imo it’s really cool on looks too, but that’s just me. 
---
Those 2 are totally different gameplay. Maybe besides looking at what’s cool or strong, you’re # 1 question should be what’s fun. Do you want to play a tank spellcaster or whatever the fuck a ret is?
---
Sry I’m biased for lock gameplay, and pally is my least favorite lol.
---
Nostalrius LIVES !
---
Awesome so I will still be able to kill people in duels ;-)
---
yeah I know but there was a pre tbc patch right before tbc that gave you tbc spells up to level 60. Hence the druid in tree of life form
---
Whichever you like the most, forget min-maxing. I'm rolling orc cause I don't like the tauren or troll models.
---
Still watch the announcement vid once a week
---
Do you have a source by any chance? 
---
I don't know about low ceiling.  I have played at a competitive level.  It's more like, if you face someone who doesn't do this, they're going to have the edge over you because you might take half a second longer to react.
---
They should name a walrus on some beach Nostalrus.
---
This is sad. Not for the company and its owners sake but for the game wow that we all love. It would be very sad if retail wow died. Hopefully there is a rock bottom and this is it. 
---
I'm trying to keep an open mind about what class I'll play but I keep reading stuff like this. Guess I should just accept my demonic fate 
---
So asking group when there are like 50 people standing in the same place is something that requires 200 IQ now?
---
&gt;(by that I mean spamming one ability often downranked)
---
Shammies have the most complicated role of any healer because of totems, there's a lot more to it than spamming one ability.
---
Because if the characters that can use Sulfuras for PvE content first get it first, they can help the guild progress, rather than giving it to a character who will use in PvP but not in PvE content doesn't help the guild progress through raid content. Then again, as you say if they have BRE then they might not want it, but there's still tonnes of DPS who most guilds might feel more comfortable giving it to before they give it to a paladin who will only use it in PvP. 
---
Shoutout to the Bigbang for having happened. Without it, the Earth and thus snow storms would have never existed. 
---
Hunter 
---
I always thought it as a Pally/Shaman weapon and seemed really lack luster on anyone else.  Not sure who else should either.
---
/u/sangernegru
---
I think $15 for a month of entertainment is worth it.
---
That being said, I wish I had spent $15 drinking with friends instead of playing WoW.
---
That seems to be a pretty specific question on how loot distribution will go.  You should ask your guild. 
---
Other than that, tanks get tank gear... dps gets dps gear.  There are some grey areas as getting hit% on tank is pretty huge, which can also be found on dps pieces.
---
2h fury slam warrior it is bus. 
---
Oh, fuck yes.
---
It also doesn't matter. Whether 2.5k was an aesthetic choice or a hardware constraint, the rest of the game was designed around 2.5k. That was vanilla. Vanilla was not designed for the population levels pirate servers cram in.
---
Tipsout receives Dark Edge of Insanity

Its funny how the counter argument is pretty much ad hominem attacks and "all or nothing" examples.  As if no middle ground ever exists!!!
---
 But I guess that's what you get when nostalgia driven neckbeards such as you and the two other dudes I blocked have 15 years of knowledge distillation occur and all of a sudden you think you know/do everything perfectly. (Hint: you don't)
---
Read my lips: I DON'T CARE IF YOU MIN MAX. You are MORE than welcome to act like a complete and utter elitist asshole in game and trash talk.anyome not wearing BiS (but you might find yourself low on friends and guildmates who will do anything with you if you do).  
---
You are free to curate your own gaming experience by not running anything with "newbs like me."  You are free to downvote me for having a "noob" outlook on the game (like I give a shit about karma).  
---
What you aren't allowed to do is bash me for having a different outlook on the game and think YOUR way of playing is somehow more valid than mine.  I'll find like minded people to play with and so will you (hopefully).

So fuck off if you cant comprehend this.  Seriously it's so stupid I have to blatantly say this to grown fucking adults. /blocked

shoutout for my mom for giving birth to me
---
I dont think there are any 15 year olds trying to play wow right now. In the hundreds of people that i know in current wow probably 2 are under 18. Most are people that are quite old, come home from work and raid with their friends.
---
A lot of the time if you're open with your intentions then you'll be allowed to roll on most DPS gear as an off-tank. Don't expect to take BIS gear away from Fury warriors but otherwise snatching up plate dps items without hit on them and two-handed weapons shouldn't be an issue.
---
They just wanted to wait until they had concrete things they knew they could deliver on.
---
Totally agree. All i read about is how terrible hunters are meanwhile I was absolutely dominating PvP, being main puller for my guild and crushing dmg meters 
---
It was in one of the interviews Ythisens did after he got laid off from Blizzard. I'm not sure in which one though, might of been the Classic Cast one.
---
One of those old ones with 5 channel cables?  I remember when "something better" came out and pretty much everyone doing photoshop work was dumping these.
---
That thing was like 70lbs, and in the sunlight you could see dust motes shimmy around it when you turned it on.  So much room for activities, though.
---
Oh here I thought we were talking about classic.  My bad I didn’t realize we were talking about non classic games. 
---
Nost wasn't the first private server. We've had private servers since Vanilla. 
---
Cheers dude 👍👍
---
hunter roleplaying as a pala
---
Undeads had big shoulder pads on release.
---
However it was removed in patch 1.3, before most players of vanilla started playing. That's why it's not as widely remembered. 
---
Stop it blizzard, I can only get so hard
---
This video is so very very good.  I'm snobby and usually skip people's janky attempts at machinima, but I not only loved every one, it even motivated me to watch the other factions quest part that I originally had no interest in.
---
Please keep up the great work and you need more subs!  Really looking forward to your videos in the future.
---
I don’t think bad of Blizzard engineers at all. It’s a very general opinion in the programming world.
---
Can I ask a noob question here then? I know about tab cycling but if there are many enemies around you in a bg, as a spellcaster for example, and you want to target a certain enemy, is there a faster way than clicking them? Honest question. 
---
Are those hooded cloaks or just hoods?
---
Bringing back wall walking 
---
Kaivax is Randy Jordan who used to be one of the co-hosts of the Instance until he joined Blizzard in 2011. He isn't new. And if you think the current uptick in communication, or the decision making behind what to share and not share at blizzcon, has anything to do with lower level CM's you have a gross misunderstanding of how businesses work.
---
DM for Dire Maul is useless, though. Unless you plan on a 6-hour slog through all the wings. 
---
DM = Deadmines. 
---
DME, N and W = Dire Maul
---
Yeah, I also think it was the ClassicCast.
---
You may be right in a bg setting depending on the matchup and number, but that is not the case in world pvp. Easily top world pvp 1vX. Which when I think of vanilla pvp...world pvp is life even though I did Bg farm rank 14 High Warlord horde and rank 11 commander on alliance.
---
Also have to consider what you are giving up in order to have that melee slot. Give up a warrior for that spot? Or a rogue? They have bigger parts to play in the WSG meta than a ret paladin does.
---
dps wars still look like hobos
---
Choo Choo
---
Both were enjoyable. Especially when they were the same friends playing WoW.
---
We all sucked. But it was fun.
---
It’s funny to contrast these threads with the warlock love threads. Warlocks are bottom dps in MC and BWL, but then become average in AQ, then good in Naxx. Hunters are really good in MC/BWL, average in AQ; and bad in Naxx. 
---
From some reason everyone thinks Naxx is all that matters. Yet Naxx won’t be available for a long time, and most players won’t even do it because it takes a huge time commitment. 
---
Hunters are fine. Enjoy being one of the strongest classes early on, and then if you make it to late game guess what, hunters are still really strong in PvP. And if you’ve been raiding with a guild for a year or two by the time Naxx comes out, guess what, they will still probably bring you to Naxx because you have been a part of the guild for so long. 
---
Nostalrius was a lot more than a technical implementation with Mangos. There are many pservers out there, but they are the ones who galvanized the vanilla community &amp; spurred Blizzard to sit up and take notice that this community existed in large numbers and that it consisted of more than nostalgia.
---
I do still have my NA account as I have just recently come to Europe , I’ll give that a try, good idea! Tbh I don’t expect it to be any higher than 200. I play games like CSGO on west coast servers with maybe 120-140ping, bad battlerite plays well too. 
---
A statue on the bridge to stormwind
---
5% extra spirit is not enough to compensate for lack of FW. 
---
I don’t know man, good ele shamans are pretty godly on pservers. I don’t know the class well enough to say whether the same will be true for classic but I don’t see why not. 
---
Male Orc Warlock. Those beasts arent meant to ride those warlock horses, looks horrible
---
See now I'm just going to say this every time I pull aggro.
---
Both of those raids can be done in under 90 minutes with zero gear from the raid itself. Easily under an hour once the raid is more geared up from that content. Speed runs approach 30 minutes for each.

This was a reason for me personally to get a gaming laptop. I simply *love* going to my friend's apartment to play Company of Heroes from noon to 10pm and then get ready to head out. 
---
So much fun!

Tremor totem is a poor man's FW. It doesnt even come close to being as effective.

Oh you're missing a great one! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHOpWD5ESso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHOpWD5ESso)
---
Excellent, well written guide. Thanks for sharing
---
This is kind of true. You are ignoring two things though. The first thing is that you can take any class and put them in their BIS through AQ40 and they will be just as deadly. The second thing you may not be accounting for. Is that the average human who is willing to do the work to become a proper ele shaman is going to be 100% better as a player then a random mage. Or even a mage in AQ40 BIS gear.
---
Just to be clear if you have your gear loaded. Ele is viable in pvp. I am not trying to take that from them. That being said you are working your ass off for a payoff. That is simply handed to mages. 
---
The thing that makes ele shamans scary is the same thing that makes any caster scary. They are just stacking Spell power trinkets like ToEp and Hero charm to do massive burst. Which is a good strat but one in no way shape or form unique to a Shaman. 
---
Ah my first main, so many /spit on me lol
---
I really don't get this. Why would my behaviour towards others change based on the game I play ?  
---
In the same direction, I always ask myself, why the whole classic community isn't just playing retail, as a community, where that aspect is so important. Do your world pvp, do your gurubashi arena tournaments, do your raids together. People always talk about the community aspect, which somehow is impossible to recreate on retail and it just doesn't click for me.  
---
In the end, WoW remains a gear treadmil as the main motivator for most people (statisticly speaking). Retail is just going way faster with a sprinkle RNG added.  
---
Anyway, I still hope people will be nice in classic :)
---
Wasn't this previously vanillapriest.wordpress.com? What happened?
---
geared elem shamans (aq40+) are much more than casters than can burst moderately well. They are the true battlemages, 1h + shield vs warriors, rogues, hunters, paladins- they are very tanky, disruptive, able to kite and heal back to full in 1-2 casts. They *are good* in pvp, just takes much more gear to do it consistently than other specs.
---
Retail is dead to me. 
---
Would you like some comment with your salt?
---
I would not recommend picking warrior if you won't be able to commit to a raiding schedule. It's the most gear-dependent class. I'd suggest mage, rogue, or hunter. 
---
I foolishly changed the URL without realising Wordpress wouldn't re-direct it. But should index better long term for Classic.
---
Yo are we going to be allowed to stack TOEP and ZHC like it was in the early days? or they gonna be nerfed right from the start?
---
&gt;real shame some private servers nerf it
---
Probably because there exists no evidence that shows those items actually scaling.
---
[Everyone over at r/WoW](https://www.wowhead.com/item=45057/wind-up-train-wrecker)
---
Shoutout to time itself, which allowed the bigbang to have happened.
---
I think they were nerfed by that point.
---
Every comment and reply:
---
The guy above me is wrong and his opinion is invalid. I have a valid opinion though. Everyone is stupid. The reason we are getting information is because the game is close to release. Obviously I am the first person to say this. Bask in my knowledge.
---
Hi, /u/cameronsalami
---
Noone will be using Sulf in raids though. 
---
It's typically given to to whoever can afford the mats for it
---
Mage is better in pve, lower skill floor, slower lvling unless u can get a good aoe grind going, more raid spots but less unique utility (warlocks are needed for banish), better overall in pvp but warlocks are Kings of 1v1. Both classes can do wonderful things at the skill ceiling in pvp but I don't think premades will take many warlocks. Although, especially if you play alliance, there will be much fewer locks to compete with. Both can farm gold very well as mages can aoe grind even in instances solo and warlocks can do maraudon princess runs solo. As far as fun factor is concerned, each class pretty much does what it says on the can. A mage is a mage and a lock is a lock; to me, in pvp it's sort of whether u want to be better in general or better in 1v1s. What's your style?
---
Finally choosing to roll rogue inc.
---
Probably not punishing enough in PvE. but in PvP the ceiling is certainly very low, no question.
---
Oddiz4u No I agree with you that they are more then casters that can burst. That wasn't my point. My point is that it's the burst that makes them viable in pvp. With out the burst they don't have the kit to survive like a lock or mage.
---
The core to my point is not to say that ele is bad. My point was that they aren't better then the rest of the casters, but they have to work 100X harder to achieve the same result. Ele is completely unplayable with out the ability to burst. All that tank shit is not gonna balance out vs. a mages ability to control his enemy.
---
Again I am not saying ele isn't viable. I am just saying it's not OP or something to write home about. It's a solid caster dps in bg's under the right conditions.
---
English is the business language but is that the main reason that should drive people to learn something and not something else? English is far behind of Spanish for example in the amount of native speakers
---
Didn’t retail want more mounts and mini pets? They got them. 
---
Paladins got a lot better through patches. They used to have a 6 second buff you'd have to cast constantly. Back then addons could cast spells on pressing any key if buff was not active. That. Made it bearable. 
---
Just some Finnish propaganda.

---
The typical break down if class population on private server is as follows from high to low:
---
Warrior
---
Hunter/Mage
---
Pally/Shaman
---
Priest/Warlock
---
Druid
---
But that “clusterfuck disaster” is part of the true WoW launch day experience.
---
Can confirm paladin is in a dress.
---
Came here for answers to this
---
Either way, the Classic team deserves the praise, not Blizzard. 
---
Yep, we are going to have a fucking great summer boys and girls. They listen, and I have gained a shitload of faith in there recreation of classic !!!
---
The wait will soon be over
---
Both tanks and dps warriors need pieces that the other have priority on for their PvP set. Everybody gets T2.5 pretty quickly so that isn't much of a concern. Tanks would probably get their PvP gear slightly faster because they would have priority on Dreadnaught/Wrath off pieces and good PvP trinkets like Lifegiving Gem. 
---
"Please help. I am a prince being held captive in The Barrens. If you can send 50 gold..."
---
I agree. I’ve found that the English speaking Russians are always the most nicest people in other ways too.
---
Thanks, I'll look it up.
---
The troll women are way hotter.
---
Since we're already daydreaming here, let me say that this could potentially lead not only to a new independent game studio, but a complete reboot of WoW (with another name of course) with completely new lore, races and classes and start a new mmorpg with roots deep in the vanilla WoW structure.
---
How can you not understand people in Discord? It sounds fine...
---
Hi! I'd really rather that you just tag me or name me next time.
---
I really don't feel that I 'talked down to you' looking back over our last chat.  I disagreed with you, in what I think was a pretty respectful manner.  If you disagree, let me know where I may be wrong.  Also, I really feel that we were going back and forth on a separate point that wasn't even really about Ythisen's comment.
---
Anyway, regarding this news, I definitely thought about that Ythisen's comment when I saw this, and the recent 'backflipping' if you will amongst the news we've been getting has been pushing it more in that direction for sure.  I still feel that whether or not the game turns out to be #nochanges comes down to people's definitions of #nochanges, which is a hairy topic that people still argue over.
---
I've been told that my interpretation of it is too rigid, and I totally understand where people are coming from when they say that.  All I can say is that I still categorise some of the things we believe we're getting as 'changes'.  BUT, those things seem to now being reconsidered by Blizzard on the fly, so who knows what we'll wind up with? I'm glad we're veering in this direction though.
---
This argument could be used for a lot of changes for Classic, but thats none of my business 🐸☕️
---
Man I want to do Shadow Priest so bad but I'm afraid I'll be stuck healing more often then not.
---
Tbh I think druid healing is some of the most interesting in vanilla. Not many other healing classes have 3 separate healing talent specs with very different playstyles, much less the ability to equip tank gear and pick up some adds in an emergency.
---
I hear you. 
---
As I mentioned in an above comment, it’s more of being excited about the raid and the potential gear drops for your class vs. doing more damage. Physical DPS sees that power spike due to AQ40 weapons, and it would be nice to have similar feels. 
---
I’ll be honest, I’ve never played Caster DPS so I am not sure if the excitement exists for you guys in these raids at all either. 
---
I didn't have any gaming friends, but that sounds awesome.
---
Honestly, if retail WoW died we could get a server for each expansion. I don’t see that as sad 
---
Shoutout to God who created time and everything else.
---
Perhaps that will happen after release. I doubt much will be altered before any possible issues are apparent.
---
An extra epic? I'm not sure how much spirit a priest has during each specific period of vanilla, but the human racial is not going to amount to the stats an epic item would provide. Even if a priest would have 400 spirit (which they wouldnt) that would only grant 20 extra spirit to a human priest.  That's not even a green, let alone an epic.
---
From every program I used, discord is by far the best. Not only quality - but also utility wise. I used TS2,TS3, Ventrillo, skype and discord so far. 
---
Discord has 85 million users and is free. Vent was paid. Mumble existed, but it wasn't widely adopted until later (it launched early 2006 but only supported text chat.) 
---
I'm not saying they didn't exist, I'm saying it was much much less widespread. 
---
Shout out to the Flying Spaghetti Monster 
---
I remember paying 60+ dollars for games on playstation 2, when I started playing wow I literally only played wow and nothing else, so paying 15 bucks a month was actually saving me money :D
---
Yea, I don’t think we’re really disagreeing, I just have seen some disgusting ele shamans and wouldn’t call them merely viable. With the right gear setup they can burst almost as well as a PoM Pyro mage plus all the other value they add in group PvP. Every good horde premade I’ve been in or seen has at least 1 ele shaman and often 2. Granted it’s partially for the purges and totems but I would still put them among the top tier of PvP specs. Anyway I think we basically agree I would just give them a rating above viable :)
---
Kind of both at times.  When you’re dumping your reckoning stacks you want the 2h so each hit is as big as possible.  But you can sit there with a shield to help reduce the incoming damage.  
---
Yes they are squishier than a mage or lock but that doesn't mean they are worse. They just have a different role, they do things no mage or warlock can as well. Namely purge, earthshock, tremor totem, WF totem and heal.
---
It was in the game from the start.
---
I have two concerns right now:
---
1. that there won't be enough servers at launch because of an underestimation on their end.
---
2. That they'll make too many servers, and management will use that as an excuse to lower classics priority/funding or something.
---
Something like underwater breathing would qualify but with war stomp being so useful in combat it isn't as niche.
---
Oh I see you meant DM
---
Make sure you send your G Spots to me! Id appreciate it 
---
I'm sure they were investigating the feasibility for a long time prior to us finding out about it, but they did also say they only figured out a way to actually do it very shortly before the Blizzcon reveal. 
---
Low quality bitching thread is low quality.
---
With the mana problems and low base damage, shamans would probably need more than 10% damage bonus from curse.
---
This is my order for best pvp classes I am not accounting for spec. I am just ordering them.
---
1. Mage
---
2. Warrior
---
3. Paladin/Priest
---
4. Shaman/Warlock
---
5. Rogue
---
6. Druid
---
7. Hunter
---
That's how I view the pvp rankings. It's not that I think Shamans are bad. It's just I see other classes that fulfill their "role" better. Maybe better isn't even the right word. Perhaps more efficiently would be a better way to say it.
---
Wait until it comes out and you remember what classic was really like 
---
I had no idea [archive.org](https://archive.org) archived old WCM videos!
---
K. If you're trying to make a point, feel free to just say it, but that's none of my business
---
Yeah. I thought it was 1000g mount cost and 100g training cost originally, and switched much later, maybe 2.0? 
---
Vol'thicc
---
But geared up, they really aren't squishier than a mage. They have grounding, tremor, and instant heals with nature's swiftness, as well as mail armor + shield. What exactly makes them "squishy"?
