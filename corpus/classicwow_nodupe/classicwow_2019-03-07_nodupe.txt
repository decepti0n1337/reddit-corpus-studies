I agree with your example as it's clearly a bug and not intended to work. But in the Classic demo we saw that the warrior charge is not affected by slows nor does your player target freeze mid air when stunned:

This does have a decent impact on warrior pvp balance (more than the pet summoning) and I don't necessarily think that the slow charging is a bug. 
---
---
---
I hope it’s not used on blizzards vanilla severs. They used GS for a few vanilla servers out there and it ruined the experience for me 
---
I honesty don’t recall fully pugging dungeons at 60. I feel like every run I did was with friends and guildies.
---
In my experience most groups would prefer shamy or paly heals over priest if they can get them, the group buffs are huge and it's rare healing is ever a problem in 5 mans. Also you missed warlocks who i'd put below as about the same level as hunters. Warrior dps is great for 5 mans too, on the provision that they don't need any dps gear that the tank needs. Although they don't have CC their dps is so good i'd put them up there with mages as long as they have decent gear for the instance.

Ya don't need reagents to cast the food. 
---
The rampant anti-Gnome sentiment around here is frankly appalling to me.
---
#GnomeLivesMatter
---
Ohh I didn't read this was about portals not food. Ma bad
---
Yeah that killed half the game for me. I was 100% for having good or even the best PvP gear available through PvP, but resilience made any other gear unusable and turned me (and a lot of my guild) from players who did PvE and PvP to a pure raiding guild with some guys who happened to do PvP too.
---
&gt; I personally don't understand being against right-click report.
---
People say its about the auto ban. But its since been proven the auto ban is removed.
---
I think people just have a problem with easy access to reports. If you are someone who trolls most people wont bother to report you by going through all those menus, but when its as easy as a click + that person can get muted losing access to the audience they so desperately desire to troll.... you can see why they are so rabid about it.
---
Lol, the starting zone is literally an hour, and hour and a half, *tops*. After that you outside the sharded area. 
---
You’re seriously going to not play for weeks until that ends?
---
That’s... really dumb, dude. 
---
Your mileage may vary
---
&gt; $tatues with bows that have humans which are clearly Hunters
---
You mean the statues at the entrance of Stormwind... Only bow user there is Alleria, a high elf. Also humans aren't one giant race. You play a stormwind human so there could have been lordaeron human hunter for example (Nathanos) but you aren't a lordaeron human. 
---
&gt;Shit talking with strangers in the barrens.
---
And getting promptly banned from some snowflakes. RIP.
---
&gt; This whole demon summoning thing is making me wonder how many more things that differ from private servers will be found when Classic is out
---
Next up is *Stealth*. Quote me on that. I didnt see it brought up much, but stealth on actual classic was way more potent than it is on private servers at lower levels. People from PServers are going to report it like crazy only to find out they are wrong.
---
Im personally waiting on that one.
---
I posted a question.
---
So I have done some googling and it looks like people are taking the fact that they haven’t said anything as evidence that there will be no expacs. From what I can see there is no actual evidence of what you are saying. I could be wrong I’ll admit I only search for about 10 minutes but ever article I read said the same thing. Blizzard hasn’t said anything about tbc and therefore it must not be a thing. But hey if you can find something let me know but after my research I’m even more doubtful than before.
---
there was always really good PVP there too
---
you could go there and wreck fools
---
no, no. he's saying that these players also want blizzard to release servers for tbc and wotlk, which would naturally include flying mounts and lfg.
---
as we can see by the fact that vanilla, tbc and wotlk private servers already exist, clearly tbc/wotlk existing would just absolutely destroy vanilla. that's his (stupid) argument 
---
&gt;I posted a question.
---
Did you not want an answer?
---
This manual raises the bar for class guides in the current era and the vanilla era.  
---
true, i think about this all the time while shitposting in barrens on p servers. Blizz won't have it, for sure. No-fun Blizz; circa 2019.
---
I meant to say pose. Blizzard made a official comment on it then but I don't recollect what it was.
---
Warlock named purelight *thinking emoji*
---
But every single person tells me to this day that Boomkin won't be viable for classic. And that's the reason why I think Blizzard should buff it.
---
Cuz I still wanna play druid tho :(
---
OP pays sticker price when buying a car, I guarantee it
---
No to that too
---
Impressive, mates.
---
pally is weird, make sure you do so video research cause the only thing your gona get here is "durr dont play pally its bad".
---
I'm doing all the routing on heavily modified database in order to disable everything that's very likely to not be in. Zones like searing gorge and hinterlands have essentially nothing in them on blizzlike private server, but on classic launch they might just allow those in. The amount of quests in both of those zones is significant enouh to warrant an entire rerouting, which is why I would prefer to wait for some information before doing it all over again.
---
Go play retail if you want a human hunter. 
---
If you're not on the dev team you don't have a hand in saying that. 
---
Drakova is a God
---
I just googled it, couldn't find anything on it for Vanilla wow.  There simply isn't enough noncombat quests in it.
---
When I did shaman it was still relatively early in Vanilla and I think there was a stigma against shaman healing since most people had very messy talent distribution and it was harder for a poorly specced shaman to keep up with the HP/S of a poorly specced priest. We *always* wanted a shaman DPS though, because they could toss a heal now and then if needed, while doing.
---
I didn't do Warrior DPS or Warlock in Vanilla so I can't comment directly on that. I do remember that we viewed Warlocks as "well it's not a mage, but it's close enough".
---
This is healthy skepticism and back-and-forth. Expect a lot more than this after release.
---
Keep in mind that while the community misremembers this one thing (lock pet despawn), there was **an entire list of Classic WoW mistakes the community compiled.**
---
It's very important that the true fanbase stays vigilant.
---
It will take years for the average player to complete Vanilla content. 
---
From what I can recall:
---
- If you’re a tank, from 1 minute to 15-30 in extreme cases when you don’t have a healer
---
- if you’re a healer, it can be from 1 minute to 45-60 worst case in case no tank shows up
---
- dps... well, you have to search for everyone, so at least 5/10 minutes if you have plenty of tank friends and sometimes you even drop after searching for 1 hour+
---
Can be even longer if you ask the tank or the healer not to roll on dps stuff
---
Well druid is still viable for vanilla, and imo very fun in PvP. But yeah in pve boomkins are quite underwhelming sadly :(
---
&gt;Blizzard made a official comment on it then but I don't recollect what it was.
---
&gt;Blizz official response was that they weren't saying BE warriors weren't in the world, just that they couldn't be PCs.
---
The one and only reason you should choose race/gender is the fun factor (i.e., looks, animations, lore, irrational emotional attachment). I guarantee that you’ll regret picking the “best” race because you “had to.”
---
2.01 is still technically Vanilla, although it's a version of Vanilla we don't want
---
Oh you!
---
Oh, I'm referring to hunters during the span till BC.  It BC at all
---
What
---
You guys keep trying to focus one aspect instead of all of them. The fact is, you dont have accurate proc rates, you dont have accurate mob parry/defense numbers, you dont have accurate mob armor values or correct mob resist rates. And when all of that data is off, the **combined effect of improper proc rates + bad armor values + bad defensive skill percentages + bad resists == super faulty data**.
---
Individually they might not be the biggest deal, but when stacked on top of one another, you get significantly different outcomes.
---
Im looking forward to accuracy through and through.
---
Multiboxing has never been against the rules, but if you're going to spend all that time leveling a mage just for food, you could more efficiently use that time to progress your main character and spend that excess gold on buying mage food/water.
---
It should be incredibly cheap anyway, and in many cases even free!
---
I've been playing on my pserver for months now and I've only paid for food/water three times since I'm in a large guild and we usually have a mage in the city happy to supply food.
---
Giving players a button that has the ability to punish other players administratively is going to be massively abused.
---
*points at aragorn, legolas, the ranger class in d&amp;d
---
*blinks slowly
---
*walks away
---
Night Elf Feral Druid and a Dwarf Mage alt. 
---
Played a NE Rogue during classic so kinda don't want to do that again and also because there are gonna be a shit ton of them. Did Orc Shaman too at one point. 
---
lmao what are you talking about??? won't all the Real Vanilla fans like you go ''nah i still like playing vanilla'' and keep playing? you think every person who begged for classic is actually just a nasty tbc-lover in disguise who will jump ship asap?
---
__You presented a salty human paladin because you're witch hunting and ret sucks because they're racist.  I understand your post.__
---
The key difference is that Classic won't kill retail because they are essentially completely different games.
---
TBC and WotLK are immediate expansions and will completely cannibalize the Vanilla playerbase - just like it has *every single time it has ever been done.*
---
Yes, I'd also like to know.
---
1g is reasonable for lvl 55 mage food. (lvl 45? you're lucky if you get 10s!)
---
It's still a good deal if you know you're going to use it that session since vendors sell lvl 45 food for ~30s per 5.
---
Wolfshead Helm was a thing in Vanilla. No one farmed Manual Crowd Pummelers, though.
---
In early wow vanilla wow tanks would get a slot within 10 minutes.  During one of the warrior flavor of the month moments in wow, in wow healers could get a slot in about 10 minutes.  Also, mages were in extremely high demand due to buffs, water, and CC.   I used to get tells the moment I logged on my mage to run groups and rarely had to wait too long to find a group if I wanted one.  
---
However, the best way to get invites in wow is to play well in dungeons and make lots of friends.  You'll end up on a lot of friend's list and people search those looking for people to invite.
---
Furion can you TP TOP?
---
They won't even compare. Release Classic won't even be close to how authentic 1.12 servers are. It will take a lot of work post-release.
---
!remindme 4 months
---
Bruh, everyone in this forum will be R14 server first main tank dps meter toppers.
---
Seriously though, maybe I was just a dumbass teen, but my 99% of my Vanilla WoW experience back then was rerolling various classes and having fun, not min/maxing and worrying about pvp rank and server first progression. 
---
Looking forward to the progression to MoP and BfA.
---
Note that the poster above is a borderline troll and seeks argument. Give one or deny one based on how you feel about feeding this behavior. 
---
Should Dwarves be able to play all classes except Druids since they're all represented in the classic game?
---
I want to hop on Classic WoW and make it to this level but.. I've never raided.. don't mess with keybinds.. and I'm overwhelmed thinking about it.  
---
How can I prepare myself? If I don't do it beforehand I'll be like... late to the party.
---
In retail there was no option to "remain Vanilla" per se so Vanilla died no matter what.
---
On pservers what they've done is optional character copies so you can keep your character both on the Vanilla server and have them on the TBC server at the same time.
---
Despite this, the Vanilla server population crashes and the server turns into a ghost town.
---
Maybe Activision Blizzard will be able to supply a solution pservers have not been able to.
---
Exactly, I share the excitement, but I do care. This needs to be right, not rushed.
---
I think some people forget that this will be server locked communities on official servers, not gigantic private realms filled with chinese and russians. Ninja looting and similar stuff will make it harder for those people to get in to groups, and it will be easier than ever to add good people to friend lists/communities/discord servers etc so you probably won't have to run too much with complete randoms after a while.
---
Honestly, the paladins seem unnecessary. All you really need are druids and druids to support the druids.
---
Some of those names look familiar, my reddit name is/was my in game name btw
---
I remember OSRS had a lot of turmoil over whether or not they should add the grand exchange (basically an anonymized auction house). It is still a tough debate for me personally however the game seems to have been better off for it. This is essentially what I think should happen with classic wow, release a pure vanilla and let the community decide what needs to be changed. While this may piss off elitists it is best for Blizzard as it would likely provide the highest player count.
---
The secret--especially as a DPS--is to manually search for and invite people to proactively create your own group.
---
For example...
---
/who warrior 17-20
---
/who druid 17-20
---
hey man, interested in running VC? We need a tank.
---
It took no more than 30 min that way.
---
agreed! i would argue that the original graphics being so cartoony was part of what helped them last so long - yeah, there were still people complaining that they looked ugly and outdated, but i'd actually argue they aged much better than old games that TRIED to look realistic and ended up looking awful within a few years.
---
i dislike (most of) the new models too, but there are plenty of reasons to complain about them that aren't just ''Disney''. saying the old graphics were not cartoony shows a real lack of knowledge for wow's roots
---
Even as one of the people who DOES hate transmog, I am aware that I'm in a niche minority who would rather have forced visual character progression than more customization.
---
The battleground and honor system were an extra yes. World pvp was not. At all.
---
It had a lot of great stuff, but lets save that for a TBC server. This one is for classic. Nothing wrong with that. 
---
Only one T2 piece drops in MC, the legs from Rag.
---
Yes, I played both. I played Vanilla from almost around release and have been playing pservers for some months, Naxx released server.
---
In Vanilla despite being rank 11 and a respected member of one of the top raiding guilds on my server, I was an incredible noob.
---
I thought I was so knowledgeable now having read all these guides and such, but starting on pservers I learned so much more. It really is a tremendous advantage to have had pserver experience.
---
Makes me think of the Chronicles of Riddick
---
I saw it in a video 2 or 3 days ago. Something like "wow's most famous players" on Youtube, might be part 2 or 3 of the video series. There is an asmongold reacts to it video.
---
I didnt start using keybinds until WoD lol. I always figured they were just a gimmick, but damn if only I used some back then. 
---
MC drinking games were awesome. We started doing it after we had it on farm. We had around 50% participation, and it hardly ever went awry.
---
Epic BoE dropped? Everyone take a shot.
---
That was earrrrrly vanilla. We used to be able to sac our pets for the talented sac debuff, and a druids battle rez or a fast cast rez of any kind would bring the pet back, allowing us to have the active pet buff + the sac pet buff at the same time. Hilariously overpowered.
---
Thats awesome to hear - I don't even remember my guild back in the day.  I was on Frostwolf and lived in the east coast.  I didn't even consider that the server was west coast.  So i'd raid until 2am on school nights and have to be up at 6am.  Good times lol
---
Yeah they approach this like a politician who picks something irrelevant and goes into great detail about it. Why not talk about the big issues? 
---
The issue is population. A certain critical mass is needed to keep any community alive.
---
Even if servers are merged, the fact that entire guilds and server populations will be eviscerated will be a massive blow to the community, possibly a killing blow as it has been so many times before on progressed pservers (even with optional transfers).
---
It's going to be the accumulation of little things. I'm already 40-80% of the way to my "Fuck it I'm out" threshold. We'll see how poorly or unobtrusive the sharding, loot trading, and right click reporting implementations end up. If those are all done in the worst possible manner then almost any other change would be enough to just save the $15/mo. and get a more genuine experience on a private server. 
---
We'll it's using the actual client for one and isn't baking concessions into it. 
---
*What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in SI:7 under Mathias Shaw, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on the crossroads, and I have over 300 confirmed honorable kills. I am trained in ganking and I'm the top moonfire spammer in the entire Alliance. You are nothing to me but just another target dummy. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on Azeroth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over /1? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Eastern Kingdoms and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with moonfire. Not only am I extensively trained in moonfire spamming, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Cenarius and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what druidic retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will spam moonfire all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.*   
---
Haha it was just a joke - I've played (and still play!) on private servers myself :)
---
I mean, I'm fine with just r-click&gt;ignore. I caaaan type /ignore player
---
But if they bring back special characters, then RIP.
---
Ret is terrible for that. 
---
Can I at least have r-click&gt;ignore? 
---
Just because you're in a Tier 1 encounter does not mean you have "Full Tier 1" as the title says.  All that happened is that the OP mistakenly called dungeon blues Tier 1.  It's not a big deal.  Chill out.
---
How absolutely pathetic on their part then. 
---
Nah, before they split the tier sets full t2 dropped in MC.  Was about a month or so before they changed it.
---
The server has been a dumpster fire for a while, the biggest problem was 1.12 talent hunters, with early patch pet stats, and 15 minute respawn timer on lupos. 
---
No idea but you go OOM after 1 wrath at level 1. At level 2 you can suddenly cast 3 wraths :D
---
sharing skips that my man
---
Can be made with an add-on most likely.
---
Time is irrelevant. Which class did you enjoy the most and why?
---
Struggling between Gnome mage or Dwarf Priest. I’ve played heals in most wow expansions, but in vanilla my main was mage. Main thing holding me back from priest is just not being super strong in the world with high end +healing raiding gear and not being able to farm as well as mage. 
---
You dirty magnificent bastard!
---
Sharding.
---
Lmaoooo why haven’t I seen that copypasta before 
---
Calling someone a nigger is pretty tame from my experiences on Pservers
---
Finally completing the Benediction quest on my priest was probably my best moment in Vanilla. It took me a few tries and when i was finally able to link it in guild chat, everyone cheered. Awesome feeling.
---
IDK
---
Some people thought of the dungeon set as T1, confused the hell out of me when I first listened to BluePlz and the other WoWRadio shows.
---
Pathetic is debatable, but nobody can say it isn't a very smart move. Anger and outrage can easily poison a game launch. 
---
No dude it’s just you’re lying or being extremely hyperbolic because naxx gear Wasn’t replaces by lvl 61 greens
---
Outside of just managing to log in/create char quicker than others, I don't really know how people will get ahead to dodge the chaos during the first hours tho. The way XP works in vanilla just makes it so bad to kill higher level targets so it'll take a long time to level to ~5 even if you go outside of start zone in a group. Other than that I guess finding some quest you can do in a city or whatever? I don't think exploring will give a whole lot of XP to get ahead?
---
The meta has recently changed. You will find people farming Tyrs but it won’t be the same like in 2005. Most players will usually resort to dungeon grinding for most of their money, as the prices from dungeon grinding is static with trash items.
---
Right but what’s the plan if it does well? They will lose subs and money if they don’t come up with more content
---
*rogues attack.*. Glorious. 
---
Heh, I just edited [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta) (unless you mean my rendition of it, in which case I literally just made it haha)
---
Never really used it in retail.  So whatever.  
---
Actually waiting for the game to release and people to start raiding might be an idea, not looking for a guild months before it’s even released.
---
Lol that's because half the heads excited for classic WoW were 9 when classic was really out so they're all TBC babies. 
---
As an ally player I would like to camp the bridge leading into Stromgarde Keep as a Hunter. 
---
This screenshot alone gets me so hyped for Vanilla raiding, Summer is so close but yet so FAR.
---
You do realize Ion states Elwynn forest as being possibly being sharded? That is a lot more than an hour and half of your played.
---
&gt; That said, when everybody is packed into Valley of Trials, when everybody is packed into Elwynn, we think we can use sharding there in a limited, time limited way, to solve the initial launch day load problems, while making sure in the long run, that as server communities solidify, there's a healthy population as single worlds for everyone to live in."
---
*Note: Northshire Valley is the name of the starting area of the human version of Valley of Trail.
---
You really need to add a /s for that.
---
My time is not free.
---
I think the makeup of posters will become very different. A lot of people here will just play, instead of posting about playing as we do now because we can't play, and the influx of new people will have very different things to say about the game - ie. it will become like an official forum, lots more complaining about trivial specifics.
---
Same here. A group of friends and I have already said we'll pass if we have to see some jagoff riding around on one of their "cool" $25 mounts.
---
Tanaris 40-50? Is there really that much to do there?
---
Yeah there's a big difference between Vanilla 6 months in and Vanilla 18 months in. Classic will be even further from the original experience. If you played a shaman/paly/druid 12months+ into vanilla then it mostly just went without saying you were 100% a healer at 60, and in pve you were often wearing more than 50% cloth gear. Palys/Shamans/Druids specced and geared for healing are perfectly capable of healing at all stages in the game, and paly/shamy in particular just have the best group buffs.
---
I can say being too much of a coward to release actual information because of hypothetical backlash is a dumb move and certainly isn't what's going on. It's lunacy to believe that.
---
Pay $60 to boost to level 60! If this is added at any point, I'm done with Blizzard games forever.
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
There will be two install locations because they are two separate games.
---
Where is the complication?
---
The financial impact of your corporation being perceived as "cowardly" isn't noticeable I'm sure. 
---
This boi is looking to AoE farm.
---
He killed me in the Burning Steppes once.
---
Yes, it is. Notice the original user was asking for Blizzard to check their data and confirm when it was added. He noticed it only showed up in notes in TBC and was suspicious that it was added in TBC but didn’t understand why that addition wouldn’t be in patch notes. It makes sense. He wasn’t just whining or trolling.
---
Feels fcking good to see this thing finally released. Hope you guys like it
---
Not really, I think 25 was the superior raid size.
---
I played as an enhancement/elemental Shaman for a good part of my vanilla days. I could usually find a group within 15-25 minutes. Sometimes I healed but most of the time I was DPS and backup healer. I pug'd lots of instances bc I only had 2 friends that played. Most of the time it was BRD, UD Strat or Scholo.
---
You must be remembering incorrectly, or you never played TBC at launch, because throwing away naxx gear for greens was a hot topic. The boards were filled with theorycrafters trying to find some way to make the gear and set bonuses remain relevant for just a few more levels. 
---
Maybe in your effort to be contrarian you forgot that current item stats were completely overhauled and the wowhead data you're looking at is not applicable to what we had during TBC.
---
Tank 1-2 minute, healers 5-10 minutes, caster dps 10-20 minutes, melee dps 20-30 minutes.
---
PVE is for cucks 
---
You can aoe pirates. Hopefully without competition 
---
I'm doing multiple priest runs simulating lack of mobs and skipping several quests that has long timers and so far I can hit level 10 between 3 to 4 hours. The 1 hour discretion is grinding for a wand at lvl 7 vs no wand until level 10 and hope I have enough skinned leather to make greens for a DE to make a wand for me. 
---
Then at logged in 27 hours got me to level 25 on first run. 
---
I'm on my second run now and currently level 15 at 7.5 hours.
---
First run I skinned everything and tailored what I could and cooked what I could. Second run will be skin everything and create LW items hopefully greens to trade as payment to a enchanter to make greater wand and can keep the extras disenchanted. Cook only what is necessary and on downtime for self mana and stam. 
---
I liked the calendar too but I’m sure it won’t be there unfortunately. There were add ons that provided the service though. 
---
On fresh launch I have to call bullshit. Unless you managed to tag all mobs and no wait time on item spawns for quest, then maybe. 3 hours doable via exploration and finding a hidden spot st level 6 to grind till 10.
---
Wife and I are looking for a  raiding guild for classic.  We both raided in vanilla in one of the top guilds on our server.
---
Looking for..
---
\- NA
---
\- Horde
---
\- PvE
---
\- DKP
---
\- Hardcore/Semi-Hardcore
---
We're probably rolling Priest (holy)/Hunter.  But we will both be grinding to 60 as two boxers, so there's some flexibility.  Our raid times are open.
---
Uh, Cthun hotfix was released pre-reset for EU and post-reset for NA.
---
Literally everyone struggling on Cthun killed it within a couple hours of the fix, NA guilds had to reclear AQ40 obviously.
---
This NA vs EU thing sure does a great job at painting dorks... imagine trying to be rude to a whole country while being demonstrably wrong.
---
so not a choice based on hardware limitations at the time.
---
Sorry man, flying did ruin World PvP - again, this is objective fact and there are thousands of threads on it throughout the years.
---
Flying did ruin PvP outside of instaces for portals that were accessible by flying into them. Many instances in BC were. You no longer had to journey there on foot (summons were not available for all instance groups) and put yourself at risk.
---
Flying mounts did ruin PvP in contested zones. You can bypass everything on the ground to land exactly at your destination. Ganking is much, much easier with a flying mount (swoop down on someone) and allows you to pick your fights every single time. Retreating is also much easier, you cannot be tracked down or intercepted, you just hold spacebar and fly to safety.
---
Yes, flying mounts did spoil PvP while leveling. Since ganking was much easier, it was much more prevalent. There was no way to avoid people you can't see (you are not staring at the sky while leveling), unlike with ground mounts.
---
Yes, flying mounts did spoil PvP in grinding spots, daily quest spots and world PvP objectives (all were able to be flown directly into) due to the increased ganking and ability to curate your fights mentioned above.
---
What did it spoil? It spoiled every PvP interaction in the open world and much of the PvE content in WoW. Flying was the equivalent of introducing noclip into the game.

After progressing all the way through the MC and BWL on my hunter I had a lot of DKP saved up. I'd been with my guild for 5 months or so and I was keeping my DKP spending to a minimum while still dominating the DPS charts (more in MC than BWL, but still #1 hunter DPS in BWL every raid).  
---
We'd had BWL on farm for about a month and I was losing interest.  I'm not much for farming content and I hadn't even finished up my giant stalker set in the MC when I stopped raiding it. I really wanted to get moving into AQ 40 instead.  So I started spending my DKP on dragonstalker pieces prepping to stop raiding BWL altogether.   So on the night where I picked up 2 dragonstalker pieces the Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting finally dropped.  This is the ultimate weapon for vanilla hunters.  Hits like a fucking truck and is the best-ranged weapon outside of very deep into Naxx and Naxx wasn't out yet.
---
I was so excited until I checked the DPK tables.  Another hunter who was new to the guild but who never really spent his DKP but made it to ever farming raid was about 42 points higher than my 1300ish dkp because of the items I'd picked up that night.  I was beating myself up for spending a couple of hundred DKP on the items I gotten earlier in the run.
---
I thought I was screwed but hey, you have to try. We had a silent bid system, so I sent my bid in as all my DKP.  The raid leader asked me, you sure you want to bid that much? It was the largest bid in guild history  I said yes.  Then the GM sent me a tell asking if I really wanted to bid everything. I said absolutely, it's the best hunter weapon then available in the game.
---
I won.  I couldn't fucking believe it.  The other hunter who bid against me quit the raid instead of congratulating me.  Turns out he'd bid something like 800dkp or so for the best bow in the game.  He never thought I'd bid everything on it.  I was over the moon.  
---
We finished the raid downing Nef and I went and put a scope on it and headed to AV.  I remember the first time I fired multishot with that sucker. A gnome warlock and a gnome mage both died to it.  It was an amazing weapon of gnomish destruction.  
---
Well, I'm taking into consideration doing Zul'Farrak a few times and also the quests in there. I may end up having to do some Hinterlands stuff too
---
[removed]
---
You doing okay Josh?
---
You say "what's up party people?" Like you're at a funeral. 
---
I wanted that Staff, I wanted it bad.
---
yeah, newer engine 7.whatever.the.heck is more efficient at low quality but more demanding at high quality than the original engine. Would be my guess
---
&gt; Hopefully without competition 
---
LOL, no chance of that.
---
True. A 10 level grind out there. Goodluck in those 10 levels.
---
Better be very far ahead of the curve
---
Why do you think they have community managers at all if they're "afraid" of releasing information? The internet is full of anger and outrage and yet nearly every company in existence has an online presence. And clearly "dunking" on their fanbase by posting old and antagonistic shit online isn't something they're afraid of. 
---
It's amazing what lengths people on reddit will go to to justify ignoring what is self evident. 
---
Haha yeah I’m more than fine, thanks for checking though! I decided to take a step back from the kick down your door persona over the last 10 eps or so and chill out a bit more on the show haha I think it works a lot better and listeners seem to appreciate it a bit more :p
---
Damn. An extra two hours? Insane! Stop everything. This is too far. 
---
Three whole hours before Westfall will be sharded for a week? My entire two+ years of Classic is now ruined.
---
Should be able to shift click their name to copy the special characters.
---
Yeah. Keybind everything
---
Its doable grinding rushing to wand and have one at level 7. I've done many multiple 1 to 10 runs on alliance and tested many variety of grind spots that are off the path of the zerg to grind away. The grind will take you from level 5 to 7, 1 hour approx to get the required resources to make your own wand. 
---
Better make sure to have your FR gear ready bois.
---
Maelstrom was about 5% of total damage for my T2 rogue. 
---
Only Shaman would be worse, but it has 2 chances to proc if SoC procs just like it would with SoR.
---
Again, it comes down to who wants to do Nightfall? The Retribution Paladin? Perfect, no one has change their playstyle while doing farmed content while still increasing caster DPS when it's up.
---
You havint leveled vanilla before have you? There is no way you will hit 60 with skipping this many zones unless you want to spend hours mob grinding. There is not enough quests to level like this.
---
Correct, and reinforcements were not in vanilla. Lots of people on this sub seem to think so whenever this topic comes up.
---
Wutnaught! Dude! This is Jeydax. Send me a message, it's been ages man!
---
The whole "BIS" meta doesnt exist in the top tier of players on pservers.  They dont follow a meta. They take everything at face value, and adjust accordingly.  Pre-bis sheets are almost always wrong
---
Why you no reply to my DM.... :(
---
Anyways thanks for sharing this. Currently 30 mins behind ur paladin as a priest with a wand, but then again that is probably because of skinning, leathereprking or tailoring and cooking. I really should stop the other profession after I get my greater wand.
---
Okay, we're in agreement I guess. Ret can technically and poorly fill a very niche role that lots of other classes are better suited for as a one of. 
---
Story of their life, I guess. 
---
I'm aware that's the case for BoEs, but do you think that applies to items that don't bind, like the [Azure Silk Hood](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7048)?
---
You’re making a lot of assumptions. I didn’t look at any database. I didn’t say naxx stuff wasn’t replaced by greens. But it was not replaced by the first green you got.
---
Well my post didn't include all the dungeons and AoE mob grinding us mages enjoy doing
---
When was that retarded mount introduced? 
---
Dungeon XP is not that good you wont gain amazing XP from it.  
---
Also  
---
You wont be able to AoE grind if u are on a popular server unless you are way ahead in leveling. Are you stuck with the slower levelers there will be no mobs to farm.
---
Feral druid.  Make them your herbalist / miner.  You have stealth to get to tricky nodes.  You have entangling roots to CC mobs/players while you loot a node.  You are a tank for dungeons along your leveling path. 
---
I enjoy the druid playstyle.  HoTing up, shifting to bear, charging in and mauling mob after mob until your health gets low.  Your mana should be back so just heal up and go again.  Nice tool kit and escapability.
---
meant to reply, but kinda hard to put metrics on a generic "milestones" - aside from your goal of 30 in 24 hours is doable. If I can do it as a paladin, a priest can do it too.
---
Not to sound elitist but this leveling plan is a whole basket of yikes and then some
---
I've only (really) played paladin. And since I enjoy paladin, I'll be playing paladin again.
---
Do you actually believe item stats, abilities, and other things are that far off from what vanilla was like? LOL
---
Even though there are some notable differences, such as armor values that are not entirely correct on pservers, the builds themselves aren't going to change.  Minuscule changes in values aren't going to completely change builds and proper itemization. Players had much less knowledge 14 years ago and played the game entirely differently, they had no clue what they were doing in comparison to the knowledge that is present now.  Youre comparing someone who theory crafted ONE version of a game for 2-3 years max, to people who have been theory crafting that same version for 10+ years. 
---
How does this have to do with classic wow`?
---
I remember being so excited for flying, only to realize how many parts of the game that I loved were about to be obliterated. Happy to return to the basics on this one. 
---
Disagree. So much has been done to get classic up and running and to finally get Blizzard to listen. It's truly a huge milestone and I want it to be the best possible version. Some people have waited years for this, a few more months won't matter to me.
---
Classic will attract new players for a long time, but the game will be self-sustaining financially with a very small population of players.
---
If Blizz decides it's worthwhile to specifically expand the Classic userbase, who knows how they'll do it. But I suspect that will only happen when they give up on retail being a viable product.
---
Cross server bgs.
---
I don't think anyone has a problem with "Ignore'. The real issue is with "Report" and what's the worst thing that can happen to an innocent player who is mass-reported on by 40 people in AV.
---
Right on both accounts. It is much too late to just remove it. Blizzard knows that and it's evident in the way they keep enabling it after enough time has passed in an expansion that they can't stick to their guns anymore. The rep grinds to unlock flying are convenient enough because they keep people playing while at the same time providing some illusion of earning it at all. So, they have confused the majority into thinking that this is the default state of the game (flying enabled) and made them feel like they're entitled to it because they're stuck doing the rep grind anyway. Just a terrible psychology. Give a hand and they take an arm.
---
I was a hunter back in the day. I recall groups taking either a long time to get going or no time to get going. For example I had the UBRS key and could kite Drek. I found groups to UBRS very easily. More or less as soon as I siad I had key and could kite, I got an invite.
---
I also knew how to do LBRS well back in the day, so if I posted I wanted to get a LBRS group going and said I knew the paths, I got whispers from people wanting to come.
---
As for other dungeons I recall it taking a while to get going often times as a hunter. 
---
I never played a tank or a healer in Vanilla so i cannot speak for them. But historically throughout all of Wow. Tanks get groups more or less as fast as it takes them to say they want to go to a certain dungeon. Healers aren't quite that fast, but they can be. 
---
The mistake can be repeated in Classic with TBC servers.
---
You're referring to a minority of pserver players. Most of us are just like you.. we love vanilla. We recognise pservers have it wrong and can't wait to play the real thing. You sound like you listen to fanatical people. Don't assume we are all that way because of a vocal minority.
---
Let the man be. I like your plan. Will you have to adapt? Probably, but whatever. Enjoy the ride.
---
I won't have a plan, other than I like leveling horde in the Eastern parts. Don't even really have a class chosen. I'll probably make a few alts and if I don't even reach 60, I also don't care. I want to to have fun, that's all.
---
If you can source it out. There was a Orc Hunter called Pup
---
He released a couple of videos called Pup Fiction.
---
The original one was the first time I saw the actual potential of a Hunter, his pet control, trap placement, feigndeath usage and kiting skills were top tier. 
---
I've never been able to find the video again - I think its on Warcraft Movies, but its archived I believe. However I can't think of any better level 60 hunters 
---
For more info, he was US and I think he played on Dunemaul? Also used Coremarksmen Rifle (my favourite gun ever!)
---
I remember everyone was 
---
But it takes away from a lot of things for better or worse that made Classic so good and memorable 
---
You'd better get on telling millions of people that they were playing the game wrong.
---
Easily. What a shame it would be.
---
Yup, the flying trailer got me hyped. As the article mentions:
---
"Part of the problem is that the game’s flight is very, very simple in its mechanics. You mount up and you are, essentially, swimming through the air. There’s no momentum, no need to get up speed before you take to the air, no delay, and little up there to threaten you. You certainly can’t fall from the sky or have to engage in any sort of elaborate maneuvering to stay airborne, a trick that even Super Mario World realized was necessary."
---
I guess I don’t know what that means. 
---
My left hand is on wasd to move and press my most used spells 1-4. 
---
I have a few cool downs on my mouse for my right hand. Like blink, frost nova. 
---
Not sure what else I should do? Like why would I have some ability I rarely use on something like shift-1 or the letter G? 
---
It just doesn’t seem optimal to me? 
---
nah
---
Couldn’t agree more. Games obviously change over time, I still play retail and not to beat a dead horse but, it’s just a shell of its former glory. BC and every xpac after would eventually be a Pandora’s Box that would strip away one small thing after another. Glad we’re returning to, in my honest opinion, the best state of the game that ever was. 
---
Tidal charm is rather well known. 
---
thing i'm most interested in is what happens after naxx.
---
How fuckin wicked would it be if they released the raids they wanted to in vanilla that they never got around too like karazhan or maybe even some new raid material.
---
That'd be dope. 
---
new T1 or T2 raids would be fuk'n siiickkkk. Lets be real, MC was whipped together in a week.

Yeah I stopped before WOTLK was released 
---
But I’m kinda glad because I have so many fond memories of trekking across the lands and enjoying the journey , no matter how time consuming it was 
---
You never felt safe going anywhere alone due to raid groups or people with OP gear 
---
I still remember the first time i saw a character level 60 and saw his gear , I was obsessed with getting me some for my own character to no end 
---
&gt; You’re making a lot of assumptions. 
---
You mean like how you assume that I'm lying or being hyperbolic.
---
&gt;I didn’t say naxx stuff wasn’t replaced by greens.
---
Go ahead and backpedal more. I'll wait right here for when you're ready to return.
---
I don’t think there is a realistic deal breaker for me right now. I’m going to play it at launch no matter what. Where it goes from there, we’ll see, but right now my goal is a KT kill.
---
what kind of xph are you getting doing all this questing from 30-40 and 40-50?
---
I get 23k- 26k xph from 30-35. 28-32k xph 35-41. 32k-38k xph 41-50. This is all 100% consistant.
---
In my grinding spots as a rogue. I rarely eat and do all this in greens. Tossing most of vendor loot away. If possible I do a few elites in stv for upgrades to leather green gear. And in feralas upgrades for green gear. Still not sure if going to hinterlands for the undercity cap is worth it but. Fuck questing. Spend 60% of the time running around feeling like I could be getting xp.
---
I love how the article discusses how TBC quests are basically undoable without flying mounts yet everyone in TBC did almost every single quest in the expansion without a flying mount. No one except druids could fly until level 70. We all have memories of riding through those zounts on ground mounts and doing quests.
---
That meant only Shadowmoon Valley and Netherstorm initially had areas that required flying. 
---
So you hated healing that much?
---
It interests me because I’ve never mained a healer before, but my primary alt was a priest in Cata. I played him a ton, larger arena and BGs, but also really enjoyed 5-mans while I leveled. Unfortunately, I never took him into a raid to see if I liked it.
---
I’m currently considering a priest in Classic, but my goal is solely PvE. I’d hate to think I join the first raid and I hate it...
---
This. It’s a variation of a flipping a coin and assigning one to each side. However you want the coin to land while it’s in the air is what you want to do.
---
Granted, that’s different than just looking for more information on both classes. Always good to be more informed.
---
I liked the flying mounts, sorry not sorry.
---
That’s what I do. 
---
I would hope the extreme nonsense of saying "STV was super peaceful" would have stood on it's own as sarcasm, but eh... whatcha gonna do?
---
I used to be in Erazer to on dragonblight, joined the guild mid tier for a short while before i left for Aventura. Played a druid called Thundertje.
---
Fun to see the nostalgic :)
---
Agreed. I am one of the switchers to Druids for Classic. It is one of a few classes that can more than 1 role with 1 spec. And arguably even all 3 roles with one spec(though not in raids well).
---
I think a lot of the old stigma for Feral Druids won't be there this time around. I do however think it will be around for some other hybrids, like Ret Paladins, Boomkins, Ele/Enchan Shamans.

---
Hard to say. Most of my groups formed organically while I was questing in the zones. As a druid, I'd get whispers asking to heal or occasionally tank and the group would be formed by the time I got to the entrance.
---
I joined a guild at 60 and groups were forming a lot. However, I never sat around waiting for a guild because I ALWAYS had something in the world that I was trying to accomplish.
---
And you completely ignored what he was saying. He mentioned that a meme spec flasked and fully buffed can do mediocre/slightly below average dps. To do this mediocre damage you need to spend 200-300g per week for every single week (even when the raid is on farm), and the reality is almost every single person who is willing to go to that effort does not want to be mediocre and would roll an optimal dps class rather than a meme spec.
---
Is the time saved by using a wand from level 7-10 worth the time spent running to &lt;Capital City&gt; to train Enchanting, and then running back to &lt;Quest Hub&gt; rather than just waiting until level 10 when you will go to &lt;Capital City&gt; anyway?
---
It’s already been a known fact that people unsub in progression and a ton unsub once progression is over. Every expac sees a massive decline once the end game content is done. Just leaving it up while the sub count continues to decline is not a good business model
---
Sparkle pony was added with Ulduar patch I think 
---
I think it makes more sense to have a new experience. I mained a Mage — and have through virtually all of WoW, so while there would be some fun nostalgia to rolling a Mage again, I think I’ll enjoy it more playing another class.
---
I feel like I’m fairly wide open in terms of role — if DPS, I prefer range, so I’d lean Warlock. Also considering a Priest to go healer (or even a Warr if tanking is needed for my guild).
---
Rogue and Warrior are really slow to level overall, especially early when you don't have most of your abilities and little-to-no greens, but it doesn't get much better even at higher levels. It mostly just comes down to having to eat/bandage in between almost every single pull but there's lots of other factors.
---
People expect rogue to be fast because energy is self-regenerating but they forget it's a slow, fixed rate. Even if you get a bunch of lucky crits and drop a mob fast, you still have to wait for your energy to regen. Those 2 seconds waiting for an energy tick often feels like an eternity. If you kill a mob and end at 0 energy (which is typical for a pull), you effectively have to wait 8-10 seconds before your next pull.
---
Also, both Rogues and Warriors have trouble fighting more than 1 mob at a time. Rogues can CC one but that costs a combination of energy, combo points, and/or cooldowns which means you're killing them very slowly. Simply just gouging a mob costs 45 energy, or 4 seconds worth of energy; compare that so something like a mage that can frost nova and continue to pump out frostbolts. Warriors have ways to manage it too but anything other than brute-force focusing down singular mobs slows them down even more as well (using a shield, def stance, hamstring kiting, etc).
---
Druid is possibly the slowest 1-20 class overall but once you get cat form they're probably one of the fastest. You reach a point as feral where you can kill 3 or 4 mobs in a row without leaving cat form &gt; switch out and heal &gt; go back cat and repeat. You never have to stop to eat/drink unless something goes wrong and once you get innervate, you can skip emergency downtime. 
---
You also have stealth for cheesing quests (skip to the end of the cave, kill the named mob for the quest and stealth out, etc) and travel form, not to mention the passive 30% movespeed boost in cat form to minimize time spent moving around between pulls.
---
Yeah their culture is a lot more selfish on a whole compared to others.
---
Why do you think it’ll be easier to group as a lock instead of a rogue?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0vvvJwvvvJwvGGHwvGGHwxxxHwvGGHwvGGGHvGGGH
---
looking good
---
&gt;not private servers please
---
What is your reasoning for this restriction?  As much as you might hate it, Classic is going to share more of a private server culture and meta than wow did 15 years ago.  You can't reverse 15 years of experience and theory crafting.
---
&gt; It’s already been a known fact that people unsub in progression and a ton unsub once progression is over
---
That's in retail. Do you realize how long it takes for a normal player to complete progression in Vanilla? Most of them are going to be leveling to 60 for the first 2-3 months. Then they're going to spend another 2-3 months just doing level 60 dungeons. It will be common for players to play 6-9 months before they even set foot in MC.
---
Are you joking me? I didn’t say they weren’t replaced by greens I said they weren’t  replaced by lvl 61 greens lmao
---
How so? I’ve never raid healed before, but feel like as one of my guild’s better players, I’d do more good as a healer than a DPS. I feel like I’d enjoy Priest healing in Classic, but looking for more feedback from those that have done it.
---
It is when this is your keyboard!
---
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AM5RB6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_IFhGCbRN18342
---
Okay so let’s walk through this since I guess no one can do it themselves. What happens once all the raids are done?
---
Good to hear!  Look forward to your show every week. 
---
From what I've experienced, you always want to auto attack before judgement -- because if you judge first there is always one white hit that doesn't get the affect of the seal. 
---
But I still don’t get why I would need that as a PvE mage?
---
I did a rogue in that bracket for awhile and the level 29 bracket too. It was so fun 1 shot ambushing under geared mages lol
---
Night Elves start with 20 int, Tauren start with 15.
---
This is accurate. I was one of the tanks involved in many of the world first for DNT (Jeydax) in Vanilla. EU didn't get a single world first until C'Thun which was strictly because EU received the hot fix prior to the US. Similarly from what I recall the same thing happened with KT in vanilla Naxx. We got KT down to 1% several times before the encounter bugged an despawned him and the EU servers ended up getting the hotfix first.
---
I was not part of the Sapph/KT kill but that is accurate from my recollection, someone can correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Regarding Naxx though I do distinctly remember being pretty proud of the fact that we got world firsts in the entire Construct Quarter of Naxx because of Patchwerk's difficulty (and gear check) before anyone else. Grobbulus and Gluth were pretty easy encounters but it took us a few more nights to get Thaddius down. The entire Arachnid quarter was a joke, the Military quarter was a cock block at the Four Horsemen which was from what I recall (again this was years ago) was more impressive than an other world first in the entire raid because we were the only ones to beat the pre-nerfed version of it.
---
Now I just feel old... this feels so long ago.
---
I would argue that mage is better overall in PvP and World PvP, and honestly I don't really think it's close. Also, are you against playing Undead Mage? If you're into PvP WOTF is an amazing racial to have

I don't know how many mouse buttons you have, but, many things you would certainly want to bind, rather than click.    Assuming your main nukes on 1-4 or whatever,  you have to bind frost nova and blink like you said, and I would add polymorph, arcane explosion, blizzard, mana shield, and also your cooldowns depending on what spec you are (ice block, PoM, etc)
---
This was a fun listen! I was on Medivh back in the day and had friends in Ascent and I would hear about the world first racing from them from time to time.
---
bruh getting the first grey cloth shoulders on my first char pally and immediately hearthstoned back to SW to stand around like a boss
---
Well, it differed quite a bit. Firstly, and most importantly, server population.  
---
I was on a really crowded server, that helped a lot!  
---
Secondly, time of the day / night, obviously.  
---
During prime time, either as elemental / enhancer or hybrid of some sort, it took about maybe 10-30 mins, but to be fair, I rarely actively searched, I just asked whenever something popped up in chat, while I was minding my own business, so I can't give a real precise time.  
---
But especially 10 man UBRS was pretty fast, probably because you needed more DDs.
---
Glad you liked it, thanks so much for checking it out! :)
---
Yes, I will be the only warlock and soak up gear like the only druid in the raid has been doing.  
---
What was the Mountain Dew promotion?  I don't remember that. 
---
You are exactly like me in the races you can tolerate! And I am debating what to level first between mage, warlock, and hunter.
---
Well, as you, said, hunter is god world pvp tier, although I don’t think they are better overall, mages are great in bgs. If you think you will eventually make both eventually (obviously compromising on race for one, or playing two different servers), I’d make some arguments for leveling the hunter first, since hunters seem to be strongest early on when people don’t have as much gear, and you will be able to enjoy world pvp to the maximum, etc.
---
If you do decide to make both on one faction, I guess it depends on what your priorities are. Personally, I’ve chosen horde, as I’m bothered by the fact that the races I like the looks of on alliance are the ones with the shitty racials (humans and night elves). But I like the looks of orc, undead, Tauren, AND like their racials, and have much nostalgia for having previously played horde. Shadowmeld is at least actually good for hunter, NE is probably the alliance combo I could most tolerate for that reason, but certainly the combo of UD mage/orc hunter has better racials than Human mage/NE hunter.
---
But if you just prefer playing with pallys/alliance cities/etc., that’s kind of a personal choice. There’s ofc also argument for experiencing both the alliance and horde on serparate servers, but that also his it’s own obvious drawbacks.
---
This is all assuming the possibilities of playing multiple. If you are really going to have time for one/won’t compromise on races, you should probably prioritize the class you want to play more, and just pick that one.
---
This! All of this.
---
I was the first hunter in my guild to complete this. Then I helped the other 5 hunters get their's. 
---
I wonder if it is PPM based, and would therefore be a good chunk of bonus damage for "low" dps specs like enhancer or feral. It should proc equally as often, deal the same damage but as the average damage is lower, the procs should be greater amount of damage %-wise, if I'm not mistaken...hmmm
---
Why would you take human or dorf or Nelf?
---
I don't have a lot of deal breakers that haven't already been addressed. We're getting content buckets, not having at least some nod to patch progression was a dealbreaker for me but it looks like we're getting staged content releases.
---
Ultra high realm pops are probably a deal breaker for me. I tried 8-10k on a pserver and it wasn't fun, and it ruined a lot of the leveling experience and feel that I was hoping to find on that server. Additionally the competition for quests and profession nodes was at extremely unfun levels. I did find a \~5k server was still playable.
---
Tying into the above, I will not play if there is sharding. I don't mind sharding in the starting zones when they meet certain occupancy thresholds, but I would prefer not to see it past launch hype. I wouldn't quit if it stays in starting zones, but I will if it extends beyond them.
---
I'm on the fence over cross-realm BGs. I don't want to see them. I'm not sure it's a hard dealbreaker for me, but it's close. "BuT iT WaS iN VaNiLLa" and it goes against the spirit of vanilla in my opinion, and wasn't in most of it anyway.
---
Human fits with the class fantasy. ^of ^being ^a ^hunter
---
Haha true that. Honestly, it'd probably make their day and they'd get to boast about how they're the guild's Retribution paladin while at the water cooler the next day. People are strange.
---
For an elemental spec, the first decision you need to make is whether you want your Frost tree to be purely for support or whether you want it as a source of damage to supplement Fire. The latter is a bit less common as Fire will out-damage it, but is useful for leaning fully into the instant/burst mindset. That said, quite a few elemental mages use Frost exclusive for controlling enemy speed and crit chance instead, meaning the main talents would be Frostbite, Shatter, Ice Block, and Permafrost (skipping Ice Shards and Imp CoC). If you go this direction, Frostbolt should only be used at Rank 1 to slow enemies and proc Frostbite to fish for crits.
---
IMO 8 points into Ice Sharks and Imp CoC is a huge investment for little return, it really only increases your CoC damage and those points can be better spent elsewhere. 
---
In my experience, trying to get damage out of both trees spreads the points pretty thin, it works when relying on instant spells for a ton of burst but makes the spec even more of a mana hog, just be aware of the sacrifices your are making by going either way. 
---
This is the spec I use: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgMzfcuZVbGhobt](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgMzfcuZVbGhobt) 
---
Rank 1 Frostbolt is used to slow and freeze enemies, while Scorch, Fireblast, Blastwave, and CoC are used as a main sources of damage. 
---
Another benefit of Elemental is the ability to use Scorch as your main source of damage when your instants are on cooldown, this is nice as it has a short cast time and can be cast from behind cover which makes you harder to find due to lacking of a projectile. As such, buffs to Scorch go a long way and makes for some interesting plays as elemental.
---
Just some food for thought, obviously Vutrne's builds work very well but there are multiple options for elemental mages, be aware of how you want yours to play and it should help inform your spec choices.
---
I doubt they would do that if they did TBC Servers. Makes more sense to have the TBC ones be separate and allow an opt in transfer for those who want it.
---
I was in college and barely had time to play for most of Vanilla. But over the summer of 2006, I hit the game hard. I decided to level a Mage to raid with my guild and I got him to 60 incredibly fast. I played day and night and did it in a few weeks.
---
Hunters should level a bit faster than a druid. And rogues are probably only faster leveling than a paladin (slowest).
---
Yeah but why would you pick it? Dorf and Nelf make so much better hunters. More fun with Nelf and dorf is stronk.
---
Retail is hot garbage now and I don’t enjoy it one bit
---
This was awesome! I remember tanking some of the AQ40 test realm raid with a lot of the DnT guys.  Funny enough our first Rag kill came with the help of a warlock friend from DnT, lol.  Fire resistance... who knew?  We transferred over from Shattered Hand to Bloodscalp and he stayed.  I can’t wait for Classic!
---
Whorde 
---
Bc the only hunters I know of are humans
---
I'm very interested to know those little things they aren't going to 
---
"fix" because people will just use addons to gain those features anyway.
---
Will they leave in /focus?
---
Will they leave in the auto loot toggle so you don't have to hold shift?
---

Doesn’t matter they didn’t change it til cats it won’t be in Classic.
---
Yeah I know it's like a open world battleground lol, the spirit healer is nearby too so it's perfect if you want some action in your early 30s
---
first MC raid with full tier one? so what website did you buy that account from? "vomits"
---
What?  Noone considers UBRS a true "raid".  That doesn't count.  
---
And he was referencing badges from dungeons/raids.  Not world events.  The only badges that were around in vanilla if I recall correctly were the cenarion gear badges.  Why are you trying to use ambiguous language, purposefully distort, and strawman/cherrypick things to your liking just so you can make a post where "you're right" and "QueenSpicy is wrong". 
---
What are you hoping to achieve with this tactic. Other than to prove that you're infantile and petulant and just HAVE to be right at everything?
---
Deadmines is actually really easy to get to as horde. You just take the zepline to STV and jump off into the water, swim in the water (100% safe) around the coast and you end up right on the shore of westfall.

---
Rank 13 Warrior going 67 kills 0 Deaths in AB with pocket healers.
---
Warriors with premade healers are crazy.
---
Rogue is pretty crap first 20 levels really. You have no cheap shot or kidney shot, you have no buffs, no poison, no regen. You're a warrior without battleshout or overpower and have to wear leather.
---
If they put in the option to toggle on auto loot without holding shift you wouldn't play?
---
People often ask what the best group PvP class in Vanilla was or what the best PvP healer was. The last 5 minutes of this video answers those questions. Clicking and gear/level advantage aside, I don't think you could swap out either of those classes and be as successful as they were.
---
&gt; Flying did ruin PvP outside of instaces for portals that were accessible by flying into them. Many instances in BC were. 
---
And many were not. If you really wanted PvP you could go to the ones that were not.
---
&gt; Ganking is much, much easier with a flying mount and allows you to pick your fights every single time. Retreating is also much easier, you cannot be tracked down or intercepted, you just hold spacebar and fly to safety.
---
So PvP was ruined because it was easier *and* because it was harder? Mmm.
---
&gt; Yes, flying mounts did spoil PvP while leveling. Since ganking was much easier, it was much more prevalent. There was no way to avoid people you can't see (you are not staring at the sky while leveling), unlike with ground mounts.
---
Because levellers could totally avoid people on epic mounts in vanilla? This was always part of WoW. If rich, max-level players wanted to grief levellers they could do so.
---
&gt; Yes, flying mounts did spoil PvP in grinding spots, daily quest spots and world PvP objectives (all were able to be flown directly into) due to the increased ganking and ability to curate your fights mentioned above.
---
Same issue. If you really wanted fights you could find them. If people really wanted to rez and leave they could. Sounds perfect to me.
---
I think you're just pointing to every difference and screaming that it's the end of the world, even if there is no real difference from vanilla, and even if the differences cancel out or are a net benefit.
---
&gt; Flying was the equivalent of introducing noclip into the game.
---
Kind of. But really slow noclip while levelling, so that an epic mount was still faster, and by the time you had fast noclip you should have been far beyond any content you could skip. It was just a convenience so 70s in full purples didn't need to whack every trash mob they passed. For those of us who weren't herbalists or miners it almost never mattered.
---
&gt; lol what? Tauren have less mana than night elves?
---
No but different races start with different base stats. It's not a big deal and doesn't make a massive difference once you reach level 60 but Taurens start with 5 less intellect than Night Elves.
---
Blackrock Mountain and the areas next to it are all time favourites. Plague Lands can be fun as wel. Same goes for Tanaris, un'goro and later silithus!
---
Of course it’s easy, but it’s still out of the way for a level 20 ya know?
---
Too bad private servers are nowhere near a "genuine experience"
---
It depends, the best tank with return damage is paladin with consacration and bless of sanct, you deal so much dps (as a tank) and you can solo farm a lot of the content and don't worry if you get the top dmg meters as a pally late tank (tho raids is a nono, you can tank trash in raids really good, for speedruns I will try out in my raid a trash pally tank because they have sanctuary lol.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHfetq38xNI&amp;t=40s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHfetq38xNI&amp;t=40s) drakova is a fucking god  
---
Druid is faster level tho but you can do everything, jack of all trades master of none.  
---
I would argue that for raids you don't really take paladins as MT, but druids can do it, not optimal, mas doable.
---
Yeah you're probably right actually. I'll edit OP.  
---
Both are in alliance territory so they won’t be flagged for pvp. 
---
SO?!
---
I'm still going ret. I'm a fan of melee dps and have played warrior for 12 years. I want a change
---
Lets be fair here. I hated healing because I absolutely sucked at it. Worst of the worst.  
---
There is a simple quest to get access to a teleporter in Booty Bay that will transfer you to gnomer. 
---
Was going off this comment:
---
[https://vanillawowdb.com/?quest=8189](https://vanillawowdb.com/?quest=8189) 
---
He was saying white items become bound to you after zg enchanting them.
---
You said you only did a few raids though — so it seems like more than just being bad at it, no? And what role do you normally fill — are you “good” at that role?
---
So you cannot sneak up on their unsuspecting asses to exact death. They won’t be flagged for pvp.
---
*Hi human!* It's your **7th Cakeday** Stavica! ^(hug)
---
It's not an issue because people tend to tame certain pets over others but **make sure your pet doesn't have a mana bar before taming!** If you tame a beast with a mana bar they're considered a "caster" by the game and have ~20% fewer stats than your average pet.
---
I heard that every mob in the game now levels up as you level up and you loose abilities. I think the devs have lost it somehow. Liked the pet battles in cata but quit around MoP as they have changed just about everything there is, one thing at a time. 
---
this
---
I could tell pretty quickly that healing wasn't my skill. Even in 5 mans I struggled to keep certain people alive. I just can't look at raid frames I guess.  
---
I can tank, melee dps, and caster dps at a decent level. Healing is a no go.  
---
In vanilla I was a mage. In Classic I'll be playing warrior. I raided a high level as a dps warrior in Wrath, but that's a different thing entirely.  
---
KKona
---
not as high as you think it gets.
---
I gotcha. That was posted in Wrath though so it might have been changed at some point. I know during BC the leg armor kits were changed to bind items when they initially didn't.
---
That poor warlock. All that soulshard farming. I feel him.
---
Ok, cool. I ask because I have performed at a very high level playing a Mage for 15 years. I take pride in min-maxing and excelling on the DPS meters. I feel like I’m up for a new challenge, but it would certainly be deflating to learn I’m bad at healing, haha.
---
At the same time, I feel like rolling a warlock is taking an easy way out. I know I’ll be successful at it, which is good, but also feel like I won’t have too big of an impact on our raids success. It’ll be probably be much easier to assist with raid leading as lock though....
---
Which is correctly called tier 0. The quest upgrades for them are t0.5.
---
MC is T1.
---
First raid, full t1? What?
---
Druids are just slow in the beginning till they get Cat Form. Bear's great, but grindy.
---
Same for Rogues, they don't get their really awesome stuff till a little later. And they're so squishy, if you get an extra add you're toast before Bear Form is available.
---
The druid is also a NElf so I had to make the manual run from Teldrassil over to Stormwind to keep the same leveling experience. Then I went and did the swim form quest, which makes you run all over and takes a fair whack of time.
---
Part of the reason I wanted to keep track of all this is that I seem to remember in Vanilla that the different classes have different stretches where they're really good, or they struggle. I expect the druid and the rogue to pull ahead in the next 10 levels and up.
---
Ha! It's becoming clear to me that my original classes I played in Vanilla are still my faves. Something about Priest appeals to my sort of plodding style. And I like throwing out buffs.
---
Least fun so far has been the rogue, she just really struggled. I expect now that the 20-and-up skills are available it'll get a lot better.
---
And hunter is always a blast. It just has everything you want for a solo leveling experience.
---
I've leveled an embarrassing number of alts over the years, that's kind of been my thing. So I had been through them all in the past but it was a long time ago.
---
I expected the paladin to be the slowest because he's the one I take out first in the rotation (I do them five levels at a time then switch to the next character to keep it all interesting and to keep the comparisons more valid). But he turned out to be fairly zippy, I'm not sure why.
---
I will say I haven't done a TON of foolish wandering around though.
---
Looking for a guild that accepts fresh blood for Classic, willing to learn the ins and outs of the game, but **strongly looking for the community setting**. Only played 2 months of retail BFA then stopped in hopes of enjoying the full experience of WoW.
---
I'm from GMT +8 and have an 8-5 job. I can dedicate my time post work for a couple of hours but not really looking to min/max things, as this will be my first time experiencing WoW. But I would want to experience raids in the future.
---
Still unsure if I would be going shaman or dwarf priest but I enjoy playing support classes. Definitely going to a PvP server for the full ride. 
---
Let me know!
---
There will be a slow and tectonic realization that Classic WoW is *not* Vanilla WoW and there is a tremendous list of inaccuracies.
---
The diligent fans will be hard at work cataloguing these inaccuracies and hopefully the dev team will continue to fix them after release.
---
Far too many people will be dumbfounded to realize just how inaccurate release Classic will be compared to Vanilla, completely without comparison to the level of fidelity 1.12 client pservers have.
---
And, of course, the "I told you so" and people claiming they always knew this would be the case.
---

---
I'm very interested in how BRE works on their 1.12 client. I've heard a lot of conflicting info from people on private servers and have even been shown that the wow wiki doesnt have -all- the patch notes regarding its changes
---
I did Horde last time I went through this kind of rotation with all classes and it was really fun. I thoroughly enjoy the Orc and Tauren starting areas. Not so much the Undead, but they're sort of not my thing in general.
---
Very kind of you to say, thank you!
---
a fellow kiting master i see :)
---
Thanks for that, I appreciate it! 
---
Skarm is an extremely knowledgeable tank player and he breaks down the modern Vanilla tanking knowledge,
---
including the best tank meta (deep fury tank) and when, where, and how druid tanks can tank and even tank better than a warrior.
---
Here's a quick video about druid tanking. He hasn't got many videos but all of them are absolute gems of value for anyone knows to recognize the merit.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGo5SMeqgo
---
Perhaps I'm not playing on the correct servers, but at least Light's Hope is not an authentic experience. I'm finding examples of bad scripting, bugs and missing implementations there nearly every time I play. While raids are implemented a little better, there's still a ton of known issues, such as boss resistances in AQ40. And I'm not even getting started about the amount of corrupt GMs.
---
What I'm looking for is vanilla that works consistently from level 1-60. It's clear that private servers don't have the manpower to focus on the full experience, and many elements of vanilla are ignored.
---
I'm really looking forward to it for sure. One of the hardest things about this rotating grind (I do them five levels at a time, then switch to a different class) is when you get something AWESOME on that fifth level, but then have to leave it to go do something else. Sad.
---
It generally takes as long as it takes to find a tank.
---
Finding dps is trivial, and contrary to common belief, so is finding a healer.
---
If you have a tank it is near instant to get a group.
---
The only exception to this is UBRS, because it's a large time commitment dungeon, it takes more players, and it requires a rare key.
---
I did, and that's definitely part of the speed. Wands are pretty ridiculously OP for the first 20 levels or so. I was punctual about upgrading as soon as I could. I can start to see that they're going to be tapering off soon in comparison with weapons available at this level, which is too bad.
---
I didn't mention it but my standard practice is to have an AH alt to handle buying and selling. Which is also fun, I enjoy playing the auction house and it's convenient for handling materials.
---
I always make a gnome and name her Proxie, because she acts as a proxy for the other characters and it sort of sounds like Pixie, small like a gnome :-)
---
Perhaps I'm not playing on the correct servers, at least the most well-known servers are not an authentic experience. I'm finding examples of bad scripting, bugs and missing implementations there nearly every time I play. While raids are implemented a little better, there's still a ton of known issues, such as boss resistances in AQ40. And I'm not even getting started about the amount of corrupt GMs.
---
Correct, it was 100% a design choice to have that amount.
---
Yep, that's the plan. Five levels each, then rotate to the next one, up to 60. Which at my pace I'll never do before Classic comes out, but oh well -- the important thing is to have fun.
---
&gt; If they opened brand new servers (requiring you to level fresh) or allowed some kind of character transfer / copy allowing those that want to stay in Vanilla to stay in Vanilla, I would be happy.
---
Then those who decide to move on hurt the character population of classic and will likely not transition back. There's no other way to do it than to forcibly transition to BC.
---
Glad you're having fun with it!
---
Are you talking about the front shred? If so there is no telling if that will happen in classic
---
There is a benfit to shift work aswell. Being able to play in off peak means everything is free to farm. 
---
Obtaining Benediction for sure. I was definitely not one of the top priests in my guild but I was lucky enough to be in one of the top raiding guilds on my server. We were long past MC and getting the drop to start the Benediction quest was just one of those things I had come to accept I missed out on. Then one day the guild did a speed run through MC and sure enough I got the eye of divinity and I remember my guild was so encouraging and happy for me to get to take that next step in the game. There was something about having Benediction/Anathema back then, I just felt so freakin proud, it was such a status symbol. I remember the feeling of being in IF with it and just feeling like I had beat the game.  
---
&gt; should shoot for that
---
ba-dum-tiss!
---
I took a lot of time researching pservers and I believe the one I'm playing on is the absolute most blizzlike one currently available.
---
There are certainly inconsistencies but they're not immediately noticeable. You have to understand how much I no-lifed WoW during retail Vanilla. I was rank 10 pvp on top of raiding on top of leveling alts on top of RPing in cities, etc.
---
And yet it's very difficult for me to put my finger on *any* inconsistencies with Vanilla on my pserver, despite of course knowing they must be there.
---
Release Classic, it will be extremely obvious that it's not Vanilla. Hopefully the devs put in the time and effort needed to fix it. I sincerely hope they do.
---
Horde tends to stack resto shaman, up to 8 ideally which is more than alliance usually take paladins. So priests are more in demand on Alliance.
---
For me it’s the Badlands. 
---
Since I played Alliance the first time around the only time I really got to see it was when I ran Uldaman. Uldaman if I recall was right on the edge of Dun Morogh/Badlands so that tiny section was literally all I saw.
---
True that. I am sloooooow. By the time I realize I'm getting ganked, I'm usually already dead. 
---
Oh well, I'm having fun which I guess is the important thing :-D
---
I care about all those things and I still can't wait until Classic comes out.
---
I'm willing to bet the ratio of melee vs caster dps will be 2 to 1.
---
Rogues are almost always the most playing dps class it seems
---
I realize that but it's a matter of degree. I'm so eager to play Vanilla again that I'll pick whichever option is more genuine. 
---
A bold strategy, considering getting chat silenced is a massive disadvantage in Vanilla WoW.
---
I only played as a warrior for the entirety of vanilla, and tanked the whole time as well. I never had to wait for a group, I could form one instantly, or more often than not one would have already formed and when I came home from work they were already waiting for me.
---
A good strategy for damage classes is to  get all the keys you can, then you can sometimes get brought to a group just because you can get everyone in - its crazy how few people had the UBRS key for the longest time.
---
Yep..great idea. Pick a server, spend a couple hundred hours leveling and gearing, then find out there are no guilds on that server raiding the times I'm available.....
---
Dang, I thought I answered this.
---
For me, it's still the ones I first leveled to 60 back after the Open Beta -- Priest and Hunter. I love buffing people, and a hunter is just everything you want in a solo leveler.
---
The worst from 1-20 has been rogue. They get insanely fun after that but the grind in the beginning is a real drag. Paladins are kind of boring too so far.
---
I have a huge list of these and there's no way in hell I'm sharing any of them, sorry not sorry!
---
Looking forward to sharing all the sweet secrets with my future friends and guildmates, though.
---
It's amazing how much there is still that is not well known, even after all these years.
---
By the way, Gift of Arthas is a really good one. It's often worth a debuff slot in raids.
---
Great comment, I agree completely on all points.
---
&gt; Really Sticky Glue
---
When I deleted my character when TBC came out, I *still had that in my bank.*
---
On pserver, I still have it in my bank. The perfect opportunity to use it will come up... one day...
---
Do reck paladin next!
---
If you mean the SotC, you can judge before you even get to melee range. Same with the other sometimes. These were just examples.
---
Possibly data mining from the demo
---
Sounds fun! I've been keeping all my professions (including FA and cooking) up to par with all of them along the way. I enjoy that aspect but it definitely slows things down.
---
I don’t recall when nerfs hit naxx, in fact I don’t really remember there being very many at all, but just like you my memory is not perfect of that time either. 
---
I raided in a US guild that was pretty consistently in the world 9-15ish range. I, and some of my guild, felt slighted by the EU hot fix time making us get world 11th C’Thun, but what can you do. 
---
Keep in mind that the "private server data" is based off of databases created during retail Vanilla which tracked drop rates.
---
So the rates aren't exact (because they're based off of the drop rates people experienced) but they're reasonably close.
---
There might be exceptions of course.
---
I hated druid tanks on my healer.
---
they took so much more damage. 
---
Oooh did not know that! Cool
---
Alliance only?! &gt;:O
---
If that staff doesn't get consumed on use, it's good af. Would definitely dedicate a bag slot for it permanently.
---
Ah, fair enough. I haven’t played on private servers, so you might have more insight into how it shakes out lately. My assumption was simply that most Warrs would end up tanking, so rogues would be the bulk of melee DPS, certainly while leveling. And then you’d have mages, locks and hunters filling out the other common DPS classes. Druids are the least played and can fill any role.
---
As far as i remember it was an addon that did this before it was implemented so yeah 
---
"Only 90s kids would remember this"
---
It’s easy to be tricky tho
---
Never knew that
---
What I've seen on *redacted* servers is that sadly most warriors plan on going fury or arms lol.  
---
&gt;not quitting work, selling your kids' kidneys, and living in a PC bang in Taiwan
---
Filthy casuals.
---
You... you can't be a dwarf mage
---
Clicking between stances, 0 key bindings, key-turning city. I love vanilla as much as anyone but my god. All R14 took was time.
---
I have already explored every nook and cranny of vanilla but i am looking forward to the old Azhara and Darkshore. I also can not wait to walk into southshore again and do the quest there. There is also a cave that is accessible underwater in feralis that was one of my favorite grinding spots at the appropriate level.
---
Something new. Too many years as a prot/fury warrior with a hunter alt. So I'm playing ret and will likely alt a hunter or priest eventually 
---
They are losing their time. Players have things to do other than spend all day making portals and food.
---
Your replies in this thread are stupid. You try to start fights over if there should or shouldn't be human hunters by bringing up item trade sharding ect. Why the f would they allow a race class combo that wasn't out till like cata? Might as well give us dks dhs blood elfs space goats worgen goblin pandas and all the allied races too cuz "they existed in the lore. " smh 
---
which is a failing of the game designers. You don't let your kids just eat candy for dinner every night no matter how much they say they want to. 
---
Sadly most of the original wow devs who created vanilla based on certain philosophies were edged out once the game started making the big bucks.
---
I decided to save my DKP early on to get some massive item once we had cleared a few bosses. Boy, did I regret that once they made the change when I had passed on a few pieces already during the first few weeks of raiding. 
---
No ChAnGEs GaNg ChEcKing In
---
It's crazy. I'm playing on one as a test run to level and maybe find a guild to roll with. About 2/3s of the guild I'm with now aren't planning on playing classic. 
---
It has been a long time so I can't blame either of us for not remembering correctly but from what I recall regarding Naxx is that KT was more of a hot-fix and 4H was a huge nerf. KT would despawn for some reason and 4H was just way too hard/OP/however you'd prefer to call it at the time. Even though I was on the forefront of the content at the time with DNT I would still defer to someone who has a better memory than I.
---
As a USA guild though, 100% agree about being a little butthurt over the release schedule vs. the EU getting a head start. That really did not become a problem until AQ.
---
Total side note: I remember our (DNT's) world first on Viscidus being a big deal as well use the horde had such a huge advantage with frost totems. I wasn't in the actual raid group for the kill but I was watching my IRL buddy's screen during the kill because warrior's were not needed for the fight. That fight was all about having frost damage (ie: alliance side frost mages) and frost oil pots up the ass to get it done. You wouldn't see stuff like that nowadays. That fight was dumb but so niche that it made it awesome.
---
But think of the epic Gnomer only loot! And the absolute thrill of sneaking in there!
---
Not really sure what hunter fantasy you have in mind that excludes axes and swords. Hunters are just as well outdoorsmen, pathfinders and trappers, thus axes and hatchets are incredibly thematic to that. As for swords, I could easily envision an Elven archer gracefully dancing between bow and blade.
---
What's this quest called? Never came across this after years and years of Vanilla... still so much unexplored.
---
I rarely pugged but i do remember on my priest it was always fairly quick. I do remember it taking a while on my rogue particularly when i wanted to reserve a piece of gear. People ran with there guilds more often then they do in wow now so find a guild with a lot of active players and you rarely will need to pug.
---
Play retail
---
My wife and I pretty much always level a pair together. Usually me prot warrior and her healer. This time she wants to try something new so she's playing mage and I'm playing ret. I cant bring myself too heal.
---
For our Viscidus kill we used a bunch of alts for the extra cleanse. All melee has to have frost enchants in weapons and stayed out of most of the fight to not over tax the mana on cleanse. This was the big horde advantage, grounding totem and cleansing totem. We put aside killing Viscidus until after our C’Thun kill, just to say we did it, and we were still first on our server even with horde raid guilds trying. 
---
Honestly I'd love to see Blizzard evolve vanilla servers all the way up to wotlk. Obviously giving folks the ability to play thier preferred expac. But at the end of wotlk: give us a different timeline. Arthas kills us. Tirion doesn't shatter frostmourne and the world falls into the hands of the scourge. This acts as the Segway to wow2. Give us a fast forward into a world dominated by the Lich King. A new engine, new system and an opportunity for a much needed power reset that we need in lore. (Killing Sargeras is unbelievable to me) 
---
i meant gnome mage i don't know who wrote that 
---
Almost 75% of ur list can be answered by blizzard saying "well keep as close as it was" (they did say that)
---
If u really think, there's gonna be a cash shop men... 
---
I never really ran it in Vanilla. I’d love to go there
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/
---
Azshara, I never really explored it too much since there are almost no quests. 
---
I just hit 70 on Netherwing and TBC is just as amazing as I remember. I hope more than anything that Classic is successful enough to warrant a TBC server option.
---
The last time I saw one summoned was in wrath - and it was a mammoth effort to do. Getting the 10 people for summoning was hard because most players didn't know what we were doing standing in circle in the middle of nowhere. 
---
People thought it was so cool when we finally summoned our big elemental. Just a shame the average game was over far too quickly for this to happen now. You can only accomplish a summon if that is your goal going in - ie. turtle and get as many people to hand in blood as you can.
---
I would love the original AV. I only did a few with the big Orange Troll so it would be cool if he could be returned. 
---
You forget the fantasy where every weapon is a hunter weapon /roll 100
---
I’d love to get a manual like this if they came out with a deluxe edition you could buy or something like that
---
Not planning on playing horde but i will be doing wailing caverns, and shadowfang keep. I am actually going to make sure i hit every dungeon at least once.
---
You can raid in current wow to get a rough idea of some of the mechanics and group play. There also instant 60 private servers where you can just pop on and start practicing max level content. 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Chief_Engineer_Scooty
---
Its basically only good for a nice quiet grinding place. But it is a beautiful zone also
---
You clicked to decurse in a 40 man raid?
---
That's mad, lad
---
Models and textures aren't upgraded, the graphics engine however is the modern one. There are settings which set the modern engine to be a quite good approximation of the classic engine, but you can also turn on some visual improvements, like better foliage.
---
I played in the beginning of vanilla 2004 and rolled a rogue... big mistake lol. It seemed like EVERYONE was a rogue. So I always had to create my own dungeon groups. On average I would spam at least for 30-40 minutes for a full group. UBRS at least an hour. Finally got sick of it and made a paladin. So much easier finding groups.
---
&gt; What happens once all the raids are done?
---
People keep playing Classic WoW online with their friends?
---
I mean, is it really that hard to wrap your head around the idea that LOTS of people will be playing WoW to hang out with their friends, not to chase loot?
---
Sounds about right. You're thinking of frost oil for melee (no longer in the game AFAIK). Between grounding totem, cleansing totem, and frost totem the it is wild that we (an alliance guild) ended up being world first on it.
---
Yes/No. I mained a hunter back in vanilla and absolutely loved it. Im going to power level my hunter for gold farming for a bit, then level a priest. or warrior.. Then I will leverage the hunter into raid groups with priest and warrior swaps every other week! BUahaha!

The nochanges crew are setting their-selves up for major disappointment. The way they analyze everything through a microscope- you would think they would have figured it out by now that Blizz was never going to make the same game, as they reverse engineered what Classic is now from a WoD patch. Instead of building from the ground up as P-servers (seem to) do.
---
Imo; Blizz could have put out their own version of p.server-type-classic years ago, and they could have had a few 'Classic Realms' (maybe name them after the places ruined by Cata). But then they would be making WoWII right now- in the image of the original. We will probably get a mishmash of the two. Wish it would come out already.

---
Goodness I want to dungeon so bad. I frequently see fights at SFK
---
What would make the average player stay? And what makes vanilla after ALL content has been played worth staying?
---
You'll wake up in the future...for the re-release of BfA!
---
I wish i still had my copy would be fun to look through it again.
---
&gt; What would make the average player stay?
---
The opportunity to hang out and do shit with their friends, just like the millions of gamers do in other online games.
---
But they have things to do in other games... you think the average wow player will log in to do the same thing over and over when they have other new games coming out to play with those friends?
---
God I hope there is oceanic servers.
---
Yes I'll play at 250ms for that authentic classic feeling, but it's not the same... 
---
Amazing, thank you.
---
&gt; you think the average wow player will log in to do the same thing over and over when they have other new games coming out to play with those friends?
---
Who knows what the average will be? You don't know. I don't know.
---
But to speculate that there will be mass unsubs because that's what happens in retail is unfounded. There were NEVER any mass unsubs in Vanilla or TBC content because all of the content took time. People would re-roll alts because leveling was fun.
---
It wasn't until WotLK when everything started getting streamlined that people got bored and looked for other activities.
---
So let's not jump the gun and try to solve a problem that may not even exist just because some people are accustomed to rush-leveling, clearing Naxx and then doing it all over again. Those people are not the average. They will be less than 1% of the overall classic population.
---
There are still plenty of mysteries! Such as: "Why doesn't this warrior have a fucking shield at level 28?"
---
What would be a good alt to someone with a Rogue main who plans on PvPing a good amount?
---
I was thinking either Shaman or Hunter, both are decent/good ranged PvPers which could switch it up, hows the life at 60 for both of those classes?
---
Disgusting clickers 😂
---
Do we know if Lupos is going to be worth getting in Classic yet?
---
&gt; I said they weren’t replaced by lvl 61 greens
---
But they were. I know because I was there. I also know I was not the only one in that situation because it was all over the forums.
---
I don’t understand how you don’t get it... the end of content means people will leave. It’s not a wow only phenomenon. It’s every mmo has that pattern because people want to play things. This is incredibly naive to think it won’t. So your saying you won’t seek new content after say the first straight year of best in slot gear? You’ll keep logging on every day for what? To sit in you faction city and chat with your bros online? Content fatigue is a real thing everywhere. People want new goals and new challenges. I doubt you would stay subbed for 3 years doing the same thing over and over after you have the best of everything
---
Holy fuck never the fuck mind
---
&gt;Perhaps it is like the tortoise and the hare fable.
---
It isn't.
---
Bear form moves slower, can't go invis, does a lot less damage, kills slower, therefore taking way more damage. I don't really see any advantages to leveling in bear from a speed perspective, but if it is fun, then it is fun. I would also burn out a lot quicker in Bear form because it is like a warrior without the damage spikes when you get new weapons, though it has a lot more sustain.
---
&gt; I don’t understand how you don’t get it... the end of content means people will leave.
---
I don't understand how you don't get it. The content is socializing with your friends. There are years worth of actual game content in Vanilla wow. 
---
&gt; I doubt you would stay subbed for 3 years doing the same thing over and over after you have the best of everything
---
There's that mindset. The only reason you play is to get loot. I get that. You will definitely quit. Not everyone is you.
---
Wow this is phenomenal great work.
---
Troll Hunter has been my main since Vanilla and I can’t wait to lvl him again!
---
One complaint you don’t mention how important it is to get a pink screaming tall strider to harass the melee DPS during rag fights with his shrieks before his eventual death. 
---
So let me get this straight you think subs would never take a hit with lack of new content to play...
---
I spent ridiculous amounts of time exploring the world as a level 40 hunter with Aspect of the Cheetah. I liked to snag flight paths and find new ores (I was a sloooow leveler and my professions caught up to me pretty quick). I visited pretty much every zone in the game. That said I didn't get a good look at them because I was usually always running from ?? bears that aggroed me from 1000 feet away. Look forward to actually seeing some of the areas more in depth.
---
This book has something wowhead doesn't for new players, super specific/basicsh tips. Like, how does a guild operate, what is the AH and how do I use it for profit, how to find a group and much more. It answers almost any question a new player has.
---
Dire Maul, Scholomance, UBRS.  Basically any max level dungeon except for Blackrock Depths, which I did while leveling.  I started WoW 2 or 3 months before TBC dropped and never got to experience life at 60, so I'm really excited to see that endgame stuff!
---
Heck yeah Haha. Even just flipping the pages triggers so much vanilla nostalgia :)
---
I have actually never done Deadmines so I look forward to this.
---
The only thing that confuses me is that there is an imp but you don't have bloodpact. You are all stacked together, so the question is, why did that warlock have bloodpact turned off?
---
Thanks so much for this! I recently subbed to your channel and am loving your content.
---
&gt;So let me get this straight you think subs would never take a hit with lack of new content to play...
---
It's a sign of desperation when you are reduced to putting words in other people's mouths because you don't want to acknowledge their point.
---
Not everyone thinks the "content" in WoW is loot or raids. I know people who are currently playing retail for whom there is zero "new content", yet can't wait to play Classic because they want to play with old friends. 
---
I think the human animations and in particular casting animations are terrible, so there's that to consider.
---
I think people who are against the in-game calendar being in place on the mini map have too much time on their hands and not enough to complain about.
---
I’m going to ask it again and in a different way... do you think there will be no player sub drop when there is no new content to play?
---
I also found it to be useless to argue with this guy. He claimed flying didn't kill World PvP with a straight face. The fuck?
---
This.  I usually wasn't super picky about what I ran, so I could find a group pretty fast.  And if I couldn't get a group together for one instance, I'd just jump to doing a different instance.  So there were times where I'd log in, get a whisper and be flying somewhere in 5 minutes.  There were times where I was looking for a group for an hour..  But over all, it was usually quick for me.
---
I'm absolutely sure there will be player sub drops all throughout the lifetime of Classic WoW as people lose interest, but there will also be some stable point at which the new subs align with the unsubs.
---
Classic WoW will still be profitable for Blizzard at that point.
---
Never hit 60 in classic, so here's one of my memories.
---
My cousin and I had mains on PVE server. We were like 14 and didnt know anything about pvp servers.
---
We decided to roll horde on a pvp server, he went rogue, i went druid; we got to like level 30'ish and proceeded to stealth from the boat in STV all the way up to redridge to gank  "noobs" so we thought.
---
Looking back on it, we were the noobs, and it was great. 
---
And as a business you don’t think they would want to increase subs not lose subs?
---
There's a few NPC only tauren items I've always wished we could grab. I also recall in later expansions the Thunderbluff Quartermaster had some dope maces that you couldn't obtain for transmog sadly. Definitely wish my Tauren shaman could throw down 4 totems and then pull out two more to smash dudes with.
---
&gt; And as a business you don’t think they would want to increase subs not lose subs?
---
They will do dev work to increase subs if they feel like the additional subs will pay for the dev work. 
---
The number of new subs Blizz is going to get for Classic WoW could be tremendous because there is not much overlap between the retail playerbase and the potential Classic playerbase. It's a smart bet by Blizzard.
---
But there's a LOT of overlap between a Vanilla and TBC playerbase, so it's a harder case to make that Blizzard would make a Classic TBC when they've already got a Classic Vanilla server working. There would have to be both a huge drop in Classic Vanilla subs *AND* the expectation that most of them would come back for a Classic TBC server. 
---
That's a customer service and marketing question that cannot conceivably be answered at this point. 
---
12 hours???? That was a fast game, some games on unofficial aussie servers went on for days, i remember joining one when farming for the Ice Barbed Spear in there, joined a game for about 6 hours then went to bed, woke up the next day in the afternoon and the same game was going on. 
---
I had the best time in that PVP instance, there was a whole alliance group with names like Mario, Luigi etc and they where fully decked out and would just dominate the middle for hours, many forest lords and ice lords where summoned, it was an absolute masterpiece of a pvp raid
---
256mb RAM... WHEW!  I remember upgrading to one gig and thought im was the shiiiiit
---
No reason for Lupos to be in its un-nerfed state as Lupos was never available in its unnerfed state with 1.12 talents, but no way to know until the Beta at the very least.
---
You should care about all of those topics and what they could potentially do to the game but the hype is good \^-\^
---
Kargoz! Love your videos. I’m also looking forward to the rest of your master class series. 
---
Eh. I dunno. That sword cuts both ways. I'm not 16 anymore. I don't find most of this edgy cringey racist shit on pservers barrens chat funny.
---
There was about 2 1/2 to 3 years between those two releases... you don’t think that they are planning on releasing raids around the same timeframes? Which once we get to nax do you think they would then announce tbc to keep sub count up? Honestly why the hell would they allow sub counts to fall... this idea is just dumb they are a business for crying out loud... the entire point is to make more money not be okay with losing money... plus you don’t think investors would be wondering why they went from most likely record breaking to making less than they did before... I just don’t understand how people think investors would ever be okay with a decrease in revenue
---
Horde has quests for Gnomeregan, no sneaking required.
---
It took me about 8 weeks to get to 60 on a druid. However it was really my 2nd toon since I had leveled a mage to 54 on another server.
---
Maybe unpopular opinion, but i do not care for the way flying impacted basically every non-outlands zone. 
---
I also felt like a lot of the outlands was just same same old creatures with an ever so slight twist that made the grind to 70 at times even more of a slog than 1-60.
---
Lastly, i never raided in BC, so i’m sure i missed a LOT there that I can’t comment on.
---
Personally while i do have some nostalgic memories of BC, most of them are from vanilla. I would actually prefer to see an alternate timeline all together that takes the game in a different, and more vanilla direction.
---
I would be ok with the classic cap staying at 60. I would like to see either *slight* balance tweaks or tier bonuses to help underperforming specs but only after current content is clear, and i would heavily lean towards tier sets not stronger than naxx gear, but side-grades for quite a while.
---
Shapeshifting ABSOLUTELY drains your mana...don't do it.   If you're flag capping at 60 and shifting, you're probably resto and talented for it. Leveling, you get an addon like druidbar and don't shift unless you have to.
---
It was full of chinese farmers killing stuff near the coast, farming for BoE drops.
---
As far as SWP vs Naxx, remember that BT was pretty easy and that the tier pieces out of SWP were still tier 6, same as BT, just the missing slots.  And the first 3 bosses of SWP weren't really that bad.  Kalecgos just needed decent coordination and Brutallus was just a "can you push buttons in the correct order?" check.  He was Sunwell's answer to Patchwerk, right?  Gear check with low mobility.   
---
 Felmyst didn't bring anything special to the table and was basically a gimme after clearing Brut.  Eredar Twins was where it started getting hard and then immediately after was the biggest cockblock ever in Mu'ru.  So there were plenty of guilds \*in\* Sunwell, just very few that could kill Mu'ru before the WotLK pre-patch.  And if you could kill Mu'ru, KJ was a similar loot pinata to Felmyst.
---
Some really great points here: it's sort of funny that you max every talent that I outlined as potentially useful to put a couple points into in Frost. The build you use seems really powerful in the control department; do you ever feel like you have a lack of burst? I ask because sometimes the crit damage on a frostbolt or a CoC seems to push the fight over the tipping point when I am facing 2v1 or trying to burst down a healer when my CS is on CD. The whole offense is the best defense, you know? Whereas scorch and FB/AE tend to finish the job. 
---
do you have any experience running a company? running a large software project? writing software?
---
do you have any idea how much money it will take to make a Classic TBC and how many additional subscriptions would be required to justify the risk of the project?
---
Because I don't think you know any of that. At least I have the common sense to recognize the unknowns instead of jumping to wild-ass speculation about what Blizzard needs to do in an unknown number of years after an unknown number of subs to Classic WoW decreases to some other unknown number, triggering the need to develop Classic TBC for an unknown cost.
---
I get it. You like TBC. You want to play it. 
---
eaten away by dots...that can be easily dispelled....
---
The only thing a paladin has to worry about with a lock is drain mana, which is a long fight but totally underrated ability by locks.  
---
Not a great matchup for a lock, i think they're better off going after druids TBH
---
Anyone know of a resource that shows when and what you need to tame to rank up pet abilities? I've seen so many places where the fact that you need to gets talked about but haven't found anything with specifics.
---
Well done easily the best endgame hunter guide i have seen. I would love to see one for priest with this high of quality focusing on endgame all the priest guides on YouTube i have come across basically just talk about leveling. Yes this is a hint to any content creators out there that care about there healers😀
---
OMG I just remembered fear ward. Dwarf Priests were the shit.
---
Nah
---
Nah to the change or nah to being opposed to it? 20~ quest log isn't that much of prefer double that.
---
Unless you are playing a Priest.
---
Exactly. I assume the vast majority of Vanilla's hardcore raiders were high school &amp; college students. The target demo--actual Vanilla players--are all 25yo+ now. I have a feeling that a lot of nostalgic people here haven't considered the logistics of gaming like a kid when you have a full-time job, family, etc.
---
You honestly think it’s a good idea to start adding quality of life changes? 
---
I don't see any downside to increasing it besides the slippery slope thing. Or would this be included becuase of the legion client ? 
---
100% yes
---
As someone torn between hunter and holy priest I would like to see this as well. 
---
The loot is a random selection of greens, potions, gathering materials, food, and greys.
---
Occasionally you can get a few good health pots - maybe a green.
---
Doesn't look like wowhead has it populated, https://classic.wowhead.com/object=106319/battered-chest
---
But https://vanillawowdb.com/?object=106319 is a good indication of what can be found.
---
Not as common as they are in bfa. But you could get good BOEs from them if the RNG gods love you.
---
Are there any resources on advanced pvp techniques for hunters? 
---
There are a lot more of them around but dont pick Drawf because of that racial. Chest are worth grabbing in vanilla the occasional blue is fairly common.
---
I'm like that.  Could never play human, only alli race I like is dwarf
---
Common sense? Your pitching that a COMPANY will be okay with LOSING subs when it is really their MAIN way to make MONEY. I don’t care about tbc it’s just not realistic to think a company is going to see a decrease in subs and just think it’s okay. The entire point of releasing classic is to make more money... I’m going to say it again it is a BUSINESS... a PUBLIC BUSINESS at that. Activision will want to see a steady growth of income not stagnation not negative growth but positive growth. The idea that there will be an everlasting vanilla is again naive. Again MOST people will experience content fatigue and with new games coming out will leave. There isn’t a dispute to that... that is a fact of human nature. Another fact is that a business will try to capture more business. NOT lose business but make more. Once they peak in vanilla it will be a question of how to we keep subscriptions not ,” eh, fuck it it was nice while it lasted.” 
---
You likely wont find one from official servers that is not broken into snippets because of the recording software back then and uploading large files to a baby YouTube was not convenient.
---
For me the zone I never got to explore back then was the female body. Hopefully this time around chicks will be all over me once they find out I'm playing Classic WoW.  
---
Such an amazing collaborator too

Pservers have 3-4x the realm population

Click your way through to the ability and you'll see what pets, lvls and zones for each rank. Put your main pet in the stables and tame the pet with the new rank. Feed and kill some stuff with your new pet until you learned the new rank and it shows up in beast training. Then you can abandon the pet and pick up your main pet from the stables and teach it.
---
I've been using Petopia to plan my pet leveling out and they plan to update it as more pet info comes out.

Hey man, people have been concern trolling about Classic WoW "post-Naxx" literally since the day it was announced at BlizzCon 2017.
---
You're not breaking any new ground here. 
---
Why not just wait and see how Classic does before jumping to conclusions about what they may need to do years from now.
---
Thank you so much for this post. As much as I dump on Feral DPS for being a legit meme, everyone in the pserver community knows that Feral tanking is not a meme at all. It’s 100% viable and well-tested over the past thirteen years. 
---
This is one of the biggest reasons I’m excited for Classic to last a long time. Nobody knows what the true post-Naxx endgame / meta is like. Naxx only lasted three months in retail after all!
---
On pservers, with Naxx itemization, all sorts of weird and interesting things happen, like Hunters all of a sudden switching to DEEP Survival (a spec literally nobody uses pre-Naxx) because it not only becomes viable, almost mandatory because of the Lightning Reflexes talent (a percentage-based Agility boost.)
---
Just having Naxx last a long time will be enough to inject a much needed sense of newness to the game. 
---
Okay my friend,thnx for sharing this nice pic with us. :D
---
I had no idea. Thnx.
---
I was looking into this and and the only video I found in PvP was from late 2006. At this point it is hard to say if it was 1.12 or 2.0 but clearly shows the BRE as I remember it, as a buff on the weilder.
---
Accord to some sites, this change was included in patch 1.10.
---
If I’ve learned a thing since playing 10+ years. You give activision blizzard an inch, they’ll charge you $25 for a mile.
---
&gt;there are -quite a few- bosses that Feral Druids can tank,
---
vs
---
There are -**ALL**- bosses a Warrior can tank.
---
That's why raids bring warriors.
---
Because I’m tired of people running around thinking that a company is content with what a few people want. The millions of subs would eventually become a handful if they did nothing. That is absolutely the worst business model I have ever heard of. Just like you thought I was just dying for tbc I’ll say it. Just cause you want your forever classic doesn’t mean it’s realistic.
---
I remember sitting on the floor of my neighbor’s house reading the Brady Games WoW guide class and spell descriptions while he and my brother played Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert 2. Wizards were always my favorite fantasy trope, but for some reason (maybe it was that amazing intro cinematic), I had a last second change of heart and rolled a hunter.
---
This time, I’m going to rewind the clock to fulfill that alternate universe and join what the Brady guide calls “the ranks of the mystic elite.”
---
S(h)ee(p) you all out there this summer!
---
Professions are generally not youre main money maker in vanilla its better to just pick your profession based on what will benefit you the most based on what you plan on doing at endgame. I cant say much about blacksmithing particularly because i never lvled it in vanilla but i assume it is a lot like tailoring and leather working mostly useful to craft best in slot then abandon it for engineering or alchemy.
---
Amazing video, glad to see you go the extra mile and put out quality, high-effort content like this. This is the exact kind of content I want to see being put out, keep it up. 
---
Awe man! Now how am I suppose to be ahead of the curve?
---
As much as I dislike BFA, you literally pointed out how we outrage about things all the time. People still outrage about flying, it won't stop, I hate listening to "I PAID 60 DOLLARS FOR NO FLYING?" While I don't want flying. I don't like how often you said "everyone" or "all". I'm a big Classic fan, can't wait for it. But I actually like some of the changes over the years. It's just a different game now, they changed with the times so much over such a long time it might as well be called WoW 2 now. I transmog, I pet battle, I achievement hunt, I was always too scared to raid but Dragon Soul LFR introduced me into it and I have raided since, my biggest complaint is the 50 character slots as I have to delete toons to make new ones. 
---
But I still love Classic, not everyone is the same.
---
Whats even the upside though? Do you really need more than 20 active quests? 
---
[Archived version of Petopia's website from TBC](http://web.archive.org/web/20070408182332/http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/html/articles/skills_list.shtml). I prefer that formatting over the one on Petopia Classic, but it's neat to have pet attack speeds/abilities on the same website rather than having them spread about.
---
There are definitely ways to exploit mob tagging and xp that will get several people a few minutes headstart out of the starting area.  It's usually a group effort to funnel XP to one specific person.  People have probably been practicing and perfecting these strategies for months.  Some people care a lot about server firsts.
---
There are some bosses, even in Naxx, that are easier and more efficient to tank as a Feral Druid during progression since all the BiS gear the Druid needs for the fights is from AQ40 and before.
---
You can sneak up on asses whenever you want. As long as they use a aoe spell to accidently hit you. You get to sneak into they asses. Great adventures!
---
I'm sure this random nobody u/awesometographer is more knowledgeable than the MT of a guild that literally has Naxx on farm, with video proof and guides, though.
---
The information is out there. The biggest barrier is Dunning Kruger syndrome, people not aware of their own ignorance and thus not capable of learning new things.
---
Damn that gets me nostalgic...I still remember the shitty fps I got during raids too
---
Pretty much this. There’s some high end recipes that are hard to get so people will pay a lot to have them made. And transmutes make good profit.
---
Way more warriors go dps as opposed to tanking. So between that and rogues being hugely overrepresented, getting a group as either can be quite annoying. 
---
The average person lfg in chat is turning down 5 rogues a minute lol. Meanwhile locks are far rarer (especially on alliance) and ppl are pretty eager to have their utility.
---
But no moving auto shot right?
---
Since he won't say, they ninja fix farming areas all the time, Love Charms in Icecrown, Frostweave in Icecrown, Nethwrweave in Black Temple, Embersilk in Bastion of Twilight, Spirits of Harmony from various turtles, and etc I could go on all day. But honestly that's not that huge of a deal they've done it for years. One actual ninja that was a big deal in Legion was making all open world mobs scale with item level. It was in the PTR but nobody noticed or knew, it caused big outrage after 7.2 launched and they mostly reverted it. But overall, they mostly only ever ninja fixes or farming nerfs.
---
As long as they never nerf my Mogu'shan palace Lovely Charm farm we are Gucci 
---
To Hell with that naga cave. 
---
theres a million other words you could use without being a racist piece of shit.
---
moron.
---
I love reading about the ins and outs of various random professions like this. Slang, stories, slice of life type stuff. I was just reading one of the private investigator subs early. Anything similar for this career field? I'd love to learn more.
---
As someone who has played Feral on one of these servers, the only difference that I can see that would make Feral more viable on private servers compared to 2006 WoW is the average player's internet speed. People played with high latency back in the day that just doesn't exist on modern computers. I would bet that any Feral DPS who could play with close to 0 latency back in 2006 would have been able to pull private server numbers.
---
Powershifting wasn't really a thing until BC, which is when Blizz started allowing macros that dropped form and shifted you back into form instantly, without any delay. In Vanilla, those macros didn't work - you had to press your keybind once to shift out and then press it again to enter form. Very easy to lose your energy gains in that situation if you're playing on a 2006 computer with 2006 latency.
---
Another reason why Feral will be great in Classic even though no one played it in 2006: we're going to be playing with 1.12 talents from day one. Feral was buffed significantly throughout Vanilla. Patch 1.8 came out in 2006. If you were a Druid in a raiding guild that had already downed Nefarian, then you were only viable as a healer up until that point. You would have only had healing gear. You wouldn't have even considered taking that Mark of Tyranny trinket, which is a one-time only quest reward. People couldn't go back in time and undo those decisions. In Classic, we will know from day 1 that Feral will be a very viable option for anyone who makes the right gear choices along the way.
---
Make sure you find a guild for snowflakes.
---
What's more important. Inconvenience when leveling, or having the option to wpvp when you feel like it for the entirety of your experience.
---
&gt;  all the BiS gear the Druid needs for the fights is from AQ40 and before.
---
So we should bring along subpar tanks for 80% of content to let them gear up so the last 20% is marginally better?
---
Lol "I don't see any downside to doing it other than a slippery slope in which we start adding things to the game in such high quantities that it doesn't look anything similar to the WoW game we were trying to recreate from 15 years ago."  
---
If you go hunter you can farm on it by doing Dire Maul Tribute runs. That's my reason for picking hunter as my "main" alt. You'll need Eng in both DMT and PvP so it's perfect imo.
---
Their dps in raids is shit but that won't matter much if you're mainly going to PvP on it. If you do, however, decide to raid on it they actually have an interesting and more interactive rotation than any other class + with a high skill ceiling. 
---
Someone else will have to tell you about Shamans as I sadly only play Alliance :P
---
60m cooldown builds character. And calf muscles.
---
&gt; Just cause you want your forever classic doesn’t mean it’s realistic.
---
Blizzard has already stated that Classic Vanilla servers will be supported for the life of WoW. So apparently it is realistic.
---
Nobody cares more about the bottom line at Activision than Activision. They will be monitoring subs and activity for Classic WoW and they will make informed decisions about the project regardless of what you or I post on this subreddit. They don't need our approval to act. You need to chill out and stop acting like the game is already on life support before its even released.
---
Rogue leveling is almost as bad as warrior especially early on. I've heard some experienced people say that it's worse than leveling a warrior.
---
At least with a warrior you have a 2 hander and you can hamstring kite the mobs, but with a rogue you're wearing leather and you're basically just taking the mobs head on while chipping them down with 1 handers. You take a lot of damage during that, more than a warrior would take hamstring kiting a mob so rogues actually have a considerable amount of downtime as well.
---
A rogue class quest is done in azshara. That's how I know there are a bunch of nagas on the beach. And it's very hard to get out of there
---
dont be a racist. if you cant help it, try drinking bleach. problem solved.
---
Where have they stayed this? Please cite those sources directly from blizzard. If I’m wrong I’m wrong but I through all my searching I found otherwise
---
Featuring Sidonis of Relentless.
---
Well yeah, it's what they're going to do
---
And every single one of these instances, these people have never taken into account their progressively increasing burnout that affect their enjoyment of the game. Blizzard can't control a player's burnout. That's the players responsibility, and I know blizzard gets annoyed when players keep turning their own frustration at being burned out against blizzard for whatever reason
---
I haven't played WoW of any sort in a long time, but BC was absolutely the high-point of the game for me.
---
There's various reasons for this, in part because I was a little behind the curve in vanilla so I wasn't exactly doing new content on the bleeding edge while in BC I was doing things in a more aggressive pace. I loved the raids, Black Temple is still probably my favorite (in part as I was often an oftank and had great fights for that like Bloodboil &amp; Illidan). In general BC felt like the sweet spot of hardcore-ness and quality of life, especially with the dawn of tier gear for all specs.
---
Also as the first expansion, it was the first time we got really *new* stuff on such a scale, both feature and zone wise. New races, starting zones and quests, and whole regions that were totally different and surreal. Wrath also had this feeling (with a new class as well), but I don't think it held the awe of getting something new for the first time in the game that BC did.
---
There was a comment from J.Allen Brack that specifically said the Classic servers would stay up even if only 10 people were playing. It's an older comment, made pretty soon after the original announcment
---
Dope dood. Another post about this that's going to die. You are the true hero.
---
Admittedly, 4 bear tanks, 12 healers and 24 powershifting shred is a hell of a lot of innervates and melee DPs.
---
Total DPs might be men, but they wouldn't run out of mana any time soon affording 3 innervates per healer...
---
You can play the game however you want so long as you find the guild with players who are also in tune with your general play time and effort. And if the guild does not exist, you make the guild.
---
Please cite your sources
---
Not really...
---
IIRC blood pact only covered the locks group. Not sure though
---
Number of roles in a dungeon party scales proportionately
---
Yeah for hunters the big positives would be, good gold farm &amp; fun PvE rotation. The biggest downsides would be that I had two DPS classes, and getting a raid spot on my hunter might be difficult. With Shaman I was thinking healing in raids would be a good change of pace, but no gold farm etc.
---
Yeah, its quite the adventure sneaking all the way to ratchet and BB to port to gnomer 
---
=D
---
Lol. Okay.
---
Nothing because I don't look at it as an amorphous Guild blob. I look at it as the individual members, the people, friends, the really basic stuff.
---
I randomly picked Varian as my first character's name on Blackrock and the game allowed it. I didn't realize till BC that my troll rogue had the same name as a main alliance NPC.
---
Calling someone a name in a videogame about killing zombies = literally shaking levels of racism. You might want to play retail, vanilla wow melts snowflakes.
---
ok, first of all dude, I am not going to lie about something like that. It was something I read a long time ago and it stuck with me. 
---
Now, I have already figured you out and knew that you would be anal about sources, so I did about 5 minutes of googling to find this:
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-11-04-wow-classic-blizzard-answers-some-of-the-big-questions
---
Interview on Nov 4, right after BlizzCon 2017. 
---
J. Allen Brack says this:
---
" One of the things we do know is that by announcing this, we're in the WOW Classic business forever. Once that starts, there's a commitment on our end that we're going to continue maintaining those servers for as long as there is a World of Warcraft."
---
Sources cited. You can now stop clutching your pearls about the death of Classic WoW.
---
It's awesome because for many of us, it won't be a grind, it'll be an adventure with friends and cake
---
Oh there will be plenty of people go go go going, that's just an innate part of wow from the very beginning
---
Hook up with people who are more your speed. What it's all about
---
As a dwarf priest - I think it will be beneficial for me to get the wand at 7. Even though this test run took me 4 hours to hit 10, I would assume I would hit it still at 3hr.
---
First to answer about training. So I have an exploration route and a hidden grind spot at level 5 away from where most of the players will be. I will grind from 5-6 mandatory and this will decide if I will stay from 6-7 depending on how many cloth I gained from 5-6. All I need is minimum 66 cloths unless I get lucky with few greens, than I can just grind to 50 if I have 2 greens. 
---
Go to Stormwind, get my tailoring and enchanting, get my wand, make any extra I can to sell. Drop enchanting and learn skinning/cooking. Drop tailoring for Leather work.
---
If I am unlucky with the cloth drops - I'll finish turning in my quest and run to Stormwind, pick up skinning and leatherworking. 
---
Both situations - wether I have a wand or not requires me to hearth back to my dwarf starting area.
---
------------------------------------------
---
So when I had a wand, I still ignored the wolves, boar and several other quests in Dun Modr / Kargath to simulate lots of competition.
---
IF I HAVE A WAND - I will attempt to tag wolves and boars while still doing those quick point A to point B quests. This will be added experience I did not have before. I should be able to out tag most players other than hunters now and kill those mobs extremely fast. This will also allow me to farm / out tag those yetis in the cave and grind on leper gnomes w/ ease. 
---
So this will be XP I did not account for and should put me up in the 3hr mark. If I can't, I'll continue my route as usual and expect 4 hours to level 10. But from here on out, I am moving along faster. 
---
Next time I go back to Stormwind for my level 10 spell is at level 12 when I enter Loch Modan. Loch Modan has a FP quest to IF and IF sends you to SW. Take the tram, do the free 1k xp rat catching, turn in quest in SW, pick up lvl 10 spell and hopefully barter with an enchanter. (this should be on the 5th hour, there will be some enchanters near the 75 mark) - Either I can trade him X amount of cloths or if I have enough leather - make enough greens to trade for a Greater Wand (level 13).
---
Haha, well if you do the simple thing of standing up while you play you can avoid blood clots
---
Yup, only the lock's group. Drimetron is in the same group as the player in the picture.
---
Terrible ranged damage, terrible aoe, no interrupts, no way to remove magic buffs or debuffs, no ress outside of bress, no pally/shaman/priest/warrior buffs, no slows. Would be hard mode for sure.
---
Sharding likely means VMs/containers, and probably more things broken up in "the cloud". Vanilla used dedicated servers. Its like comparing a Ford Pinto that runs great to a multi-million dollar fighter jet that has problems. More parts, more complications. 
---
lol, there is a profanity filter ya know, and you actually downbooted me for that? derp
---
There's a difference between shit-talking, and being a toxic edgelord.
---
Oh sorry I'm stupid
---
Are you trolling, or are you really that ignorant?
---
A Feral Druid in pre-Naxx gear is a more effective tank on certain fights in Naxx than a Warrior in pre-Naxx gear.
---
Have you even watched the video? There's really no point in my wasting any more time with you.
---
You could reach out and talk to those old friends again and see if any of them want to play as well. Got to brush up on those communication skills for the game anyway
---
It makes the world feel smaller.
---
It's more of an ego problem, IMHO
---
Yeah I just don't know what other folks time meteric has been. I guess 25 at 27 hours with cooking, skinning, leather working would have costed me maybe 2 hours and maybe 1 hour loss being lost and another 30 min from corpse run.
---
I am probably doing something wrong still somewhere. 
---
Ugh, guess another run - no profession and just buy a lesser wand at 10-12 (I am going to assume worse case scenario of 30s and make sure I throw away 30s from my toon)
---
Nah, it is hard to see with all of the chaos in that picture.
---
Accepting that that was how it was 15 years ago for classic. High pop or low pop, the vast majority of people took pride in their server, their community, and they didn't get all panicked like so many private server players do that their server is dying or dead or low pop or dead dead dead. It's silly. 1000 people or 100 people, the community is what you personally make it.
---
&gt;  people who come from private servers will be mega pissed
---
If the meta changes significantly, some definitely will. For example, everyone knows warriors are the top endgame class on PSs. This means a lot of tryhards will play them specifically for the edge. If it turns out they're not so OP in the Vanilla endgame, then a lot of those players will definitely be pissed.
---
You play longer than everyone else the first day, simple. Most people won't play longer than 8 hours. If they release at midnight most people will go to sleep 2-3h after that.
---
Basically you pull an all-nighter and win.
---
The first few levels you have to deal with the zerg, except there is sharding.
---
Hot tip, make friends now, plan to join the same server now. Or accept that 15 years ago way back in the day, there were high POP servers and low POP servers and each of them had their own communities, the players on which valued and built and enjoyed those communities. Or, you know, after a month or two just reroll. Going into it as though the first character you roll on the first server you pick is going to be the one you stay at for the rest of your life and if it somehow doesn't work out and it is completely wasted time, asking for disappointment
---
Are you stupid?
---
So the players cant be trusted, and dont know what makes an MMO. The real world has problems. People in the real world arent ubermensch. WoW is literally the "world" of warcraft. Alot of those changes were anti-MMO.
---
Many of us had no clue what we were doing. We took the long way, we died over and over and over again, and we had no idea what the optimum path for leveling or specking or rotations was so every time there was a delay we did not get frustrated because we thought we were suddenly diverting from the most optimal course of play. We just played the game. That's the magic of the first time that can't quite be recreated.
---
There is something definitely wrong with the leveling pace on PS because so many players have beaten Joana's Vanilla world record by 10 or more hours.
---
Yeah I was mostly thinking about up to level ~10, feels like there isn't too much you can do to get much ahead there as you will have to do some quests and there will be people at every spot where there are mobs. After that tho it's definitely about not sleeping :D 
---
Which is why there is no playbook for this. Because no private server has been around long enough to go through so many expansions, and had a large enough player base to where they could confidently keep A1 server on each specific expansion while also having a progressing through expansions server. Much like how blizzard wrote the book for the original World of Warcraft, lasting 15 years and how many expansions, it will once again write the book for re-releasing the game from the start.
---
"You think you do, but you dont"
---
I wonder if they should keep the servers below 3000 in order to create more community - but maybe there is little difference between 3000 and 6000 because both are a lot of players.
---
You know it! I loved pulling raids. Even more fun when you get geared enough to chain pull!
---
Yeah, I guess. That relies purely on other people sacrificing them self for you tho, and probably very few people that will go for such a thing. I wonder if there's some other way people will try to get ahead without relying on the blood of a friend, except for just doing the normal questing/grinding and be as efficient as possible, not going to bathroom etc.
---
I also pulled for my guild. Got pretty good at feign death split pulling big packs when we were still under geared 
---
It's a trade off.  Hopefully the DPS could end the fights faster at least.
---
&gt; if they manage to keep everyone on the same shard without massive failure
---
Of course they will have several servers and of course modern technology (hardware and software) could easily handle 10K players on the server.
---
Always used to blow my mind seeing level 20 horde doing deadmines...like damn son well played coming all the way down here.
---
Read the comment I was replying to, carefully this time, and read my comment again.
---
Nobody said you can expect these numbers on a fresh server.
---
Curious, how is Ret paladin in classic compared with ret pala right now in BFA? do they do damage or its more like a support class?
---
The memories! Baron was one of my faves, pulling back into Garrs room without pulling Core Hounds. /tear
---
god i love this game but you boomers are so fucking cringey
---
Legit the only reason I'm playing classic is hoping one day I'll b able to play TBC.
---
I hope it's something like where you can choose to continue on pass 60 and leave the classic sever youre on to go onto a new TBC sever so those who want to stay can and nothing will change and so on.
---
They could even do it with wrath eventually but I would stop there if I was blizzard.
---
I got to know this inside of the alliance boats pretty well, personally.
---
I forgot what guild I was in when I first killed Ragnaros in 2005 but I looked myself up on warcraftrealms.com recently and found out. Try it!
---
Lol
---
Oh you mean like retail which can't handle more than 80 people in one area?
---
Sounds like it’s also ready for whelps on the left side.
---
Have you played the Demo? If so you would have noticed they try to match UI exactly as it was in Vanilla. I wouldn't count on a calendar to be honest.
---
When did you see "massive failure" on a WoW server? They don't crash often.  And, yes, there is lag on the current servers, and they have explained what is causing it.  
---
It's boring to watch. I dont mean to be a debbie downer but. Fucking yawn man 
---
I never remember really having many problems there personally no doubt there is better places but the naga cave is usually safe from pvp.
---
Did they explain why a GM teleported an entire WPVP raid out of a zone when they were attempting to attack a city when the raid was nearly crashing the server?  
---
Real question, I don't follow too much retail junk. 
---
How does it differentiate it if there's no GM
---
Why is this getting downvoted?  MC sets have always been tier 1.  Its even designated as such by blizzard officially.
---
Because this sub is absolutely chocked full of ignorant people, WotLK/BC babies, retail players who have never touched Vanilla, etc.
---
Nice videos, definitely a lot of good information. But he isn't arguing in good faith and avoids bringing up the real issues that keep druids from being progression tanks on most fights.
---
On progression raids of bosses where tank survivability is an issue warriors completely outclass druids. Crits/crushing blows make druid tanking much less safe, they don't have cooldowns like last stand, lifegiving gem, and shield wall to protect themselves at critical moments, and they take a lot more damage than warriors due to lacking defensive stance's flat 10% damage reduction and warrior's drastically superior avoidance. Their hp and armor advantage is not even close to enough to make up for this.
---
Also the comparisons are being made based on when Naxx is on farm status and everyone is fully world buffed. Druid tanks benefit more from world buffs and gear scaling in general due to their threat being based on multiplying damage rather than mostly flat threat modifiers. Similarly threat is more likely to be an issue for warrior tanks when world buffs are up because it boosts their raid's DPS more than their threat. Druid's survivability and mitigation is also improved much more by world buffs than warriors.
---
The takeaway from these videos is that when comparing world buffed fury/prot spec dual wielding warriors to bear tanks with infinite manual crowd pummelers, bear tanks are able to do similar TPS on most fights (Thaddius is an outlier due its scaling mechanics) while having higher survivability. The moment the raid wipes and world buffs are removed from the equation suddenly this is no longer true. The bear tank then no longer has the hp buffer needed to cope with crits and crushes on hard hitting bosses. The druid has to be willing to farm massive amounts of manual crowd pummelers or his threat becomes worse.
---
I see this argument a lot. I do agree that the raids get demystified when you can just see it all in a stupid easy version of it. If anything, LFR isn't the worst offender for me. Normals and to a certain extent, heroics, are. Blazing through the raid in normal mode, then going through heroic mode with a little difficulty but nothing too crazy, and then getting your face bashed in by the same boss over and over again in mythic. That's the worst part, imo. Even in WotLK when they introduced normal/heroic raids, it felt wrong. I never wanted to have to progress through the same raid more than once. A guild will usually one shot bosses once it gets the first kill, or at least get subsequent kills in a few pulls. I don't want to progress on the same boss, and almost exact same mechanics more than once. I think I would have less of a problem with it if your average guild wasn't running all the modes and just went straight for mythic at release. Never been in a guild like that, though.
---
However, I will never understand why people care so much that lower tier gear looks similar to higher tier gear. It doesn't matter. The stats on it matter. Your dps/hps output matters. Your damage mitigation and health pool matters. Whether it takes you 15 tries or not to get the boss mechanics down or not. The people that I remember the most aren't the guys looking cool in SW, it's the guys topping the meters consistently. 
---
I don't know, maybe I'm weird, but I've never really paid much attention to people's gear unless I have a good reason to. I look at what they do, not what they wear. It's also pretty funny how some of you guys will argue that gear is a status symbol but at the same time screech autistically at the mention of gearscore. 
---
You can find milk in the city
---
I didn't downvote you 
---
Most of the people he fights aren't even 60. Hard to tell because the video only contains 3 pixels, but yeah. 
---
Hooves? I think u need 4? Not sure
---
Unless you are pushing end-game raiding for server first, yes.
---
Plus, the time to get the leggy staff. I'd assume it took 1-2 months to get it, would be nice to see it relevant for more then 3-4 months 
---
Kara, COT, Dark Portal, Hyjal, Ashzara BG + more would all be fine by me. Even if you had gear that was only wearable within the instance.
---
E.g. you enter naked and there is a vendor at the start of the raid with t0 equiv gear. Then you can get instance specific gear as you progress through that raid. You can use that gear like transmog while outside those instances.
---
It's the only way I can think of that allows more content while not destroying the power curve but also giving a reason to go in there.
---
(Maybe have a few pieces off the last boss of each one that can be used outside for a small power bump)
---
Like Helm from Kara, Gloves from COT, Boots from Dark Portal and Chest from Hyjal. Give it a 4 piece set bonus.
---
I doubt you watched all the videos, but at least don't misunderstand what I wrote in the post
---
&gt;From MC all the way to Naxx, *there are quite a few bosses that Feral Druids **can** tank, and some that they can actually tank better than a Warrior.*
---
This is in no way to suggest that every boss is tankable by druids. The fact being shared is that some bosses can be tanked on druid, some bosses are tanked more efficiently on a fully geared druid vs warrior, and some bosses are tanked more efficiently by druids during progression.
---
The vast majority of tanking will still be done by warriors and if this nuance and depth of information is too much for you or your guild, you shouldn't even attempt any of it.
---
ah well, some guy that plays as a girl probably did
---
Compared to your spec I'd say it does less burst, but not terribly so. It's partially made up with Scorch, which has a higher crit chance than Frostbolt, shorter cast time, and benefits from the stacking fire damage debuff making damage output pretty similar. I will say that CoC without talents is \*much\* less satisfying to use, though I only tend to use it as a finisher or when an enemy manages to close. 
---
Either way I'd say both are solid, just be aware of the direction you want to go as it changes up some of the core talents for elem; one reason I feel elemental mage is so fun is there is a lot of variation that is still viable.
---
For example, I love Master of Elements but as far as I can tell that's an uncommon choice for elemental, I just think it synergizes so well and getting the mana back feels good so I don't want to lose it - I imagine the same goes for Improved Cone of Cold for people that have it. 
---
What is semi hardcore vs hardcore?
---
No worries mate. 
---
Just keep in mind, most of the ‘Auto sell’ addon of junk in your bags will consider White items as Junk, aka they’ll potentially sell your enchanted items. Shouldn’t if it’s equipped but say you’ve enchanted an off piece to swap to that’ll be in your bags and be sold. Horrifically you might not realise till it’s way to late and you can’t buyback. 
---
I’m quite sure you can add exceptions to the auto sell addon but they’ll all be different come Classic with the API addon changes anyways. 
---
Be careful and good luck haha. 👍
---
Quests can stay in your log for a long time in Vanilla. Like some of the city quests that send you to dungeons. Sometimes its painful deciding which quest to abandon, but to me that's part of the experience.
---
Semi hardcore = Just play as much as you can and work on leveling and progressing your character.
---
Nah, people did this in vanilla as well, and it was just as wrong then. Retail players probably don't even know those sets ever existed, they're just the heirloom appearances. 
---
I didn’t read that in there anywhere...
---
Think they have confirmed at least 1 classic server somewhere... I don't know where I heard it but I think it'd be stupid not to since there is Oceanic servers in retail.
---
Anywhere parties are engaged with elite mobs, like the Hinterlands elite area. Trivial for my rogue to sneak through, but you'll often see a 4 or 5 man party fighting a desperate battle to the top of the troll area, racing against respawns. The mobs are hard hitting, aggro easily, and are very distracting. It's easy to patiently follow a party up to the midway point and attack at just the right moment to destroy the healer and one or so others while they're engaged, then vanish and let the mobs finish the rest. Stromgarde is another good place. I only do this when I'm in a cackle-and-rub-hands-together-evil kind of mood.. 
---
&gt;The druid has to be willing to farm massive amounts of manual crowd pummelers or his threat becomes worse.
---
This is a key point that any serious Druid tank needs to know. (Non-meme tier) actual efficient/progression Druid tanking involves farming pummelers.
---
In some progression fights it's far easier to gear a Feral Druid to BiS state than it is the Warrior, and along with some fight mechanics, **on some fights** druid tank is more efficient than warrior tank even during progression.
---
Ehat about when it comes to raiding?
---
Huge Druid advocate here who also plans to lead his own raids. My perfect 40-man raid setup would only have 2 Druids. One Feral and one Resto.
---
There is no benefit to stacking Druids. Their only 'group' spell (i.e. spell that affects their 5-man party, not the entire raid) is Tranquility, which is pretty weak in 1.12. You only need one Resto for Improved Mark of the Wild and it's nice to have one Feral as your #2 or #3 tank (but not 100% necessary). 
---
In a perfect world, you want the rest of your healers to be Shaman or Paladins with a few Priests sprinkled in. Shaman in particular are awesome to stack. I would take 12 Shaman if I could. That way every group gets a set of totems while the melee groups get 2 sets: one with Windfury Totem and one with Tranquil Air Totem.
---
That said, I would take additional Resto and Feral Druids if they were good players. I would even take a dedicated Moonkin if he put in the effort. Good, consistent, dedicated, and reliable players are more important than having an absolutely perfect raid composition.

PM me on discord and I will answer your questions, you are just expected to bring your own consumables and are willing to share with everyone else you are good to go.

Creating BiS items for fury warriors if u have the patterns, the "anti-fear" trinket (can't remember the name).
---
Yes, many of his enemies were not 60 and of those that were 60 he out geared them. That being said, he was always out numbered and ended the video almost winning a 2v15\~.
---
This was the quintessential vanilla wow experience for geared warrior pally combos.
---
I want to find a guild like that haha. Sounds pretty meaningfull. I bet u dont demand that everyone have engineering as well? Yeah it seems obvious that ret palas can heal with modest holy talents!
---
Jesus you can’t even quote it correctly...
---
Prolly. I play a man with a ponytail
---
This is my favorite spec in the game. I will personally be using it and going deep into frost. I love frostbite for the awesome shatters and burst . This spec has so much versatility and once I get gear for it, all I will do is pvp. 
---
That is however not what he asked, so read the question before you write something. 
---
I did watch all the videos. As I mentioned at the start of my post he does not fairly represent the advantages and disadvantages of bear tanks compared to warriors.
---
Try not to be presumptuous, insulting, and condescending. It just makes the debate unpleasant, as you are probably experiencing right now.
---
I had to log onto my computer just so I can search for it myself... also I don’t read that as vanilla is permanent. It just means they will continue to maintain the servers... if anything the fact that he says they are in it for the long haul shows they are thinking about the future. Plus in one of the other questions it shows they have already thought about what I am saying. 
---
Next time you quote something please include the entire quote not just a piece of it. 
---
Actually I did answer the question multiple times. 
---
Yeah and an expanded ignore section. I filled up the regular one super fast in my time on a private server. In fact just go ahead and make it infinite.
---
Honestly, you have a point.  Nowadays, I've realized people should just do whatever's they're most used to as that's how they'll play best.  Even if they could play better with different keybinds or whatever else, branching out on your own is all part of their individual personality.
---
It's just that many people eventually reach a point where they wish they could do everything without having to think about how to perform it but just simply do it.  I believe it makes things feel more immersive that way.
---
Of course, this is all ignoring the obvious PVP implications of keybinds where basically every ms can potentially matter in any video game's PVP.
---
Someone who frequents t_d and craves attention in barrens chat? Who would have thought. 
---
Me and my roommate both have come up with a theory that classic will have 3-6 good months. After that will be a pet, or mount, token or level boost, then the servers will die
---
Yeah half of those plays won't work in classic as people are more aware and also shadow meld gets canceled by aimed shot channel. 
---
Well, he might also get tired of training skills in dark basements and backalleys. Try paladin, maybe, OP?
---
WhY wHaT’s ThIS i SeE? a ChAnGe To ThE vAnIlLa ExPeRiEnCe??? HMMMMM??
---
It is gonna be a lot more questions the first week. Then the complaining will gradually increase but slowly the memes will take over and reign supreme eternally. 
---
I don't know that. I know the lagging is a serious problem, but the retail servers almost never crash.  Likely they won't duplicate the bug/issue causing the lag on the new servers - it was the latest expansion code that caused it. It has to do with a new BFA feature.  
---
I feel like they could pretty easily have 3000 on a server and have the server be fine. Nost. figured out how to do this.
---
Tanks get instant groups in pretty much all of WoW's history. Once you build a reputation on your server, people will come to you and ask you to tank runs so you don't really have to spam LFG for runs.
---
Healers can usually find groups fairly quickly, but it's not as automatic as tanks.
---
For DPS: it depends on the class. Mages get groups just as easily as healers because every dungeon is easier with Polymorph. Shaman &amp; Paladins do too because everyone wants their buffs and their DPS is actually competitive in 5-mans. Some classes get instant invites to niche situations (i.e. Rogues for the Lyceum in BRD). Other DPS classes are going to have long wait times - these classes will need to build relationships with tanks and healers to get easy groups.
---
They should make pol talk against TOS tbh. Yea, I like America, and Ron Paul, so... yea, great.
---
Glimmering Mithril Insignia
---
You're addicted. 
---
Lol. Remember how BM and survival were crap? Like getting kicked from groups for even using those specs. GOOD TIMES
---
This is a good question. I don’t think there really is one, I guess you can make money crafting stuff like Lionheart helm early on
---
Outside of enchanting, alchemy, and engineering I can’t think of a crafting profession that seems worth investing time and money into
---
Yeah, it’s like this: your first crit% increases damage by 1%, assuming full hit. (Reality is more like 95% or whatever.) In the other end if the spectrum, with 99% crit, that last percent crit to 100% increases your damage by 0.5%. Assuming somewhere in between, I gave them 3*0.66% = 2% damage. Whatever. The hybrid tax gives moonkin 80% damage. 
---
This is ofc all wrong and doesn’t prove anything, it just gives you an idea of what moonkin aura is worth, approximate.
---
&gt;First MC Raid
---
&gt;Full Tier 1
---
Wait..
---
Getting server first Kel'Thuzad is the day I beat vanilla.
---
Guy sounds like a dick. He bails on his guildies and forces them to 39-man the raid if he can't have his precious buffs. Not someone you want to emulate.
---
By the time you get to Wailing Caverns you realize without a doubt that the game was build for Alliance.
---
It's no big deal, just wing it. By the time you're 60 you'll know everything you'll need.
---
Pallies have the best looking gear sets but god damn are the last 10 levels the worst thing that ever existed. 30+ seconds to kill a mob, and thats with Ice Barbed Spear.
---
Lol, yeah, we don't require folks to be engineering, but if you don't, we do require you to bring arcane charges from Un'Goro :) We provide alternatives, so no excuses haha
---
Ret doesn't really have a full toolkit of damage abilities.  You will have dead globals while doing damage.  To get full benefit of your class you will be weaving spells in between your melee and be playing as a hybrid.  This works ok while leveling, but once people hit level cap and start gearing you run into issues. Unfortunately there it a "hybrid tax" in itemization.  Unlike pure dps classes, you will have to choose whether to gear for more melee damage or mana/spell power.  Since ret's damage starts on the low side, they cannot afford to do anything other then gear for damage.  Slowly the effectiveness of your healing drops proportionate to other abilities, and you lack the mana or regen for long fights.    
---
Even before gearing becomes an issue ret's sustained damage is quite bad compared to proper dps specs.  Despite that their buffs and utility make them welcome in 5man content.  In such a role you would play as pure dps and be expected to throw out a spot heal in a pinch.  You would never do as much damage as a good dps, but adding in the value of your buffs you will be almost as good.  Unfortunately in raids all of their buffs can be provided by holy paladins and the fights are so long you can run into mana issues, as a result ret is almost always excluded from raid content.   
---
Their survival and burst are both pretty good in solo pvp, so they can be fun to play.  The issue is once again because holy paladins provide the same utility while being great healers, ret is basically never optimal in group play.  
---
You are beyond clueless 
---
This guy is decent.  Though his kiting was awful.  You should always strafe kite in PvP for better visablity and autoshots. His trap placement would have cost him his life with worse gear against that warrior.  A lot of what he got away with was due to his insanely good gear.  
---
Fight with the pally was pretty good, but he failed to keep a rank 1 sting up on him.  Pally cleanse is an extremely mana expensive spell so if the pally is cleansing stings, you should be hitting him with a rank 1 string every time just to get him to waste mana.  You can force a pally to go oom in short order that way.
---
The group PvP combat was quite good especially the strategic use of scatter shot.
---
Music was awful.  All and all a good video.
---
He only sounds like a dick because you're reading super hard into it.
---
It's on farm, he's the guild officer and everyone is his friend and they're more than happy for him to let someone else take his spot.
---
&gt; Not someone you want to emulate.
---
Lol we got a badass over here.
---
Well you don't really have a great deal of useful buttons tanking when leveling any way, best way to tank warrior is spam sunder while tab targeting for groups. Bears have great damage reduction and pretty good threat any way. 
---
I guess go druid first so you have another character to farm on. Warrior will have a harder time leveling, but the only viable 40man tank for bosses. Bears make good trash tanks for the most part. 
---
With real humans behind that group members... It's sad that I have to mention it
---
And Who might that be?
---
I never got kicked from a group for BM spec.
---
I'll be choosing the same. I enjoy picking herbs and both professions stay relevant throughout a server's life.
---
Fair enough, thanks pardner.
---
As long as we save divine intervention for the mages. 
---
Wotf doesn't break poly
---
Your video guides are one of the best, if not the best, I've ever seen. And I played retail until BfA.  
---
There is everything you might hope for, well explained, explained with numbers, well designed.... It's just perfect.  
---
Thanks!
---
sadly, when there is rightclick reporting, it wont matter :(
---
Had that exact board, went to a lan once left to go to bathroom and it was gone.... been looking to replace it for about 12 years 
---
that's great. I was personally thinking of a warlock at first but hunter/mage seemed a lot more interesting because kiting makes or breaks your pvp strength while as a warlock you're pretty much tanking it trying to get a fear off. I was thinking about trying curse of exhaustion on them but that means soul link is off the table which sucks. So now i'm debating more or less between a hunter and a mage both of which seem strong as far as what other people told me.
---
that's just an added bonus to be fair.
---
Terrible aoe? Imagine 40 bears swiping. 
---
Are they really putting loot trading in?
---
Yes but the #OnlyPrivateServerChanges movement won't rest until Classic has been changed. They've tried to change the realm population caps for example ever since the project was announced with no sign of backing down.
---
aaaah nothing beats those low frames, laggy as shit moments when your enemy goes from one area and lag speeds away... sadly this will likely not be apart of the experience which saddens me xD 
---
&gt; hit rating and +frost damage gear will not suddenly become bad because boss armor values change
---
Not in a BiS list sense but it could have an effect of the raid composition meta. For example if it turns out that mages do more damage than warriors due to incorrect armor values and spell resistances the meta could shift to a more caster based one.
---
aye its monkeynews he got 2nd place as a warrior in the wow classic demo tourney!
---
There are a very big group of people that love vanilla but hate Blizzard with a passion and any change from the experience they're used to will cause them to lash out at Blizzard, even if they're wrong.
---
Tailoring can make and recieve the set bonuses for bloodvine set.  But that’s about it
---
&gt; They don't want to wait long periods for bg's to pop or to form groups for the dungeons or not be able to do a quest because no one else is around to help them kill the elite.
---
That's very similar to the impatience you see in retail players. If they don't want an authentic vanilla experience that's completely fine but don't try to change Classic because of it, they will still have private servers if they want a non authentic experience.
---
currently playing alliance (lvl 30) and we "sneaked" to wc and sfk. and with sneaking i mean meeting with the group at ne nearest fp and then killing every horde in our way to the instance, hoping we would not meet some high lvl hordes. so much fun. would never miss that. did that as horde too back in the day.
---
140 days played on my Undead Mage. Time to see something new. Probably gonna roll Orc Warlock for that sweet Stun Resist.
---
&gt; In retail there was no option to "remain Vanilla" per se so Vanilla died no matter what. 
---
That wasn't your arguement though, your arguement was that "Vanilla servers crashed", which never happened at the end of Vanilla, to the contrary even, Blizzard was still opening new servers all the time due to the influx of players. Surely some individual players stopped playing or even some guilds disbanded. Not "in mass" though, but overall the game was still growing bigtime, even after the TBC annoucement. 
---
&gt; On pservers what they've done is optional character copies so you can keep your character both on the Vanilla server and have them on the TBC server at the same time.
---
&gt; Despite this, the Vanilla server population crashes and the server turns into a ghost town.
---
Like i said i haven't played a pserver doing this, however maybe this tells something about the community. IOf a lot of these players were solely playing to play classic the Vanilla Pserver shouldn't turn into a ghosttown, it should have been the opposite. Al most no one would be starting to play on that TBC server. The fact that the Vanilla Pserver turned into a ghosttown lets me believe that a lot of community members actually do want to progress to TBC. 
---
You do see the same thing happening on pservers without TBC progression though, a lot of servers turn stale after Naxx is released / cleared. It just feels a bit like that is the "natural" moment for a pserver to slow down and eventually "die". 
---
why that?
---
I played priest on both factions in vanilla, and then paladin in TBC.  PvPd a lot, but did raids because I wanted the gear to be good.  
---
For priest pure pve gear is too soft and you'll die.  It is a big deal for both factions.  As horde you'll never get BoP, and you won't have desperate prayer.  As alliance enemy melee will likely have wotf, tremor, and windfury.  
---
So if you want to top end pvp heal as a priest you practically need rank 12 for the 2piece +20stam set bonus.  This is not easy and takes a long time to get.  At the same time, the pvp gear is overall more itemized shadow then healing.  If you try to wear all of it you'll be missing out on too much +healing and regen and run out of gas before enemy healers will.  So this means you basically have to pvp and pve at a full time if you want to pvp well.  
---
Meanwhile hpaladin has so much survival, they really can get away with using almost anything so long as they have some plate and a shield.  The pvp gear is for ret, so you don't need to grind honor at all if you don't want to.
---
Whiles it true their sets are bad, they are so bad that hpaladins will often get priority when for all the good offset pieces.  Also blizzard figured out the sets should be for holy by naxx, so extreme late game hpaladin get rediculous in scaling.  
---
Here is the situation as I understand it: He doesn't like that his class is below the others in DPS. It makes him insecure. He goes above and beyond to get buffs/etc to out DPS others. No one else in his raid really cares that much about buffs because the game is easy enough without them. This Feral Druid then tops this meters in his guild because he has buffs that no one else has - but he leaves the raid and forces his guild to find a replacement as soon as those buffs go away.
---
The behavior you're describing to me is the definition of everything that people don't like about hybrid classes. It's why they are not usually popular DPS choices. He is hurting every other Feral Druid's chances of getting into raids by acting like a spoiled little child.
---
If you do your job, accept your slightly lower DPS, and actually use your utility, then you can be the MVP of your raid as a Feral Druid. If you act like a little child and throw a fit over losing your buffs (like this person you are describing), then you're just getting carried and literally anyone could fill your shoes. That seems to be what actually happens - he leaves the raid and then is replaced by literally anyone when his buffs are gone.
---
Only one doesn't make you 'real' money.
---
Terrible aoe ? Imagine 40 hurricane.
---
I wasn’t always a slip hand. I was a cop but got fired because I refused to arrest anyone (technically asked to resign). It was fun while it lasted. Did a lot of hot spotting and played a lot vanilla along the way.
---
The way I played paladin back, I spent the entirety of my time as an actual hybrid of holy and retribution. I just adored the fantasy of being able to dish some damage in order to defend myself with tossing out the occasional heal to myself or my party. It was the best of both worlds!
---
This made my day
---
Mining and Herb at the start. Sell everything until 100g savings (first mount), and then save most mats after that.  
---
Make an alt, get mining and herb again, lvl to 35 (For artisan Alchemy), drop mining for Alchemy at this point.  
---
Pick up Enchanting and Engineering on main, boost to max with saved up mats.  
---
???  
---
Profit
---
I might sound crazy, but hear me out. Roleplay. It's why I did it at least.
---
Also, your raid will need one or two to make the dark iron set, sulferon hammer and the nightfall axe.
---
I spent the entirety of my time as a true hybrid of holy and retribution. I just fell in love with the fantasy of being able to dish out some damage in order to defend myself while tossing out the occasional blessing and healing to myself or my party. It was the best of both worlds!
---
I've never seen anyone call dungeon gear tier 1 before the typo in this thread :s
---
When GS really hit off in TBC it really ruined playing and gearing alts =/ Only the 2 alts I was allowed in our guild could get PUGs, because of the guild name (Sunwell progression).
---
How does one participate in Barrens chat without a full alphabet on the keyboard?
---
That looks absolutely retarded and hillarious at the same time.
---
Are the switches as crappy as the thing looks? I can only imagine trying to get work done in between "epoc gaming sesh's" on this thing.
---
Mining and skinning or mining and herbalism till i can afford the epic mount. After that engeneering + enchanting.
---
for leveling i will use herb + skinning. at 60 i will switch skinning for ingineering after some time.
---
&gt;you dont have accurate mob parry/defense numbers
---
Lolwut.
---
Combat tables were very well understood in Vanilla, there's a ton of testing out there from back then.
---
&gt;you dont have accurate mob armor values 
---
The thing is that with optimised debuffs it doesn't really matter what exact armor values were, bosses would have had to have an unreasonable amount of armor if Vanilla for this to be an issue.
---
We know they didn't have insane armor in vanilla because rogues were always good damage.
---
&gt;bad defensive skill percentages 
---
Uh what? Are we talking about +defense? That again has very well documented behaviour.
---
&gt;bad resists
---
Would be an issue in PvE if we weren't running 1.12, the revamp mid vanilla made things a lot more simple.
---
&gt;the combined effect of improper proc rates + bad armor values + bad defensive skill percentages + bad resists == super faulty data
---
Nah I think you haven't looked at any of the sources and repeat things that sound good to you.
---
If you are cutting edge pve, you practically need to be human.  Sword bonus is a very big deal if you are not dagger build.  It is as much as 4% overall damage difference.  
---
The math is different in pvp, so human racial is almost nothing in pvp.  Perception is a dueling talent that is nearly worthless in any group play.  Dwarf I think is best, with gnome close behind.  Stoneform can frequently be comboed with vanish and functions like a poor man's cloak of shadows, something vanilla rogue is missing.  
---
I spent the entirety of my time as a true hybrid of holy and retribution. I didn't care much about raiding at the time, I simply fell in love with the fantasy of being able to dish out some damage while tossing out the occasional blessing and healing to myself or party. It was the best of both worlds!
---
Just don’t let the guild know. They’ll be asking for pots
---
same as rogue. it gets faster around lvl 20 / 30.
---
Mining/herba at start, but it will suck a lot as a hunter because ur bag slots are even more limited than the rest of the classes.
---
you can get the odd blue BoE in chests as well
---
They can ask away, they still have to pay me mates rates.

1 hour of top quality hunter pvp
---
Well hunter as for me(according to my vision of class fantasy) is more like  hermit  or lonely survivalist in the wild, who's only friend is his pet.
---
Daggers are used by them to cut the meat from body of just hunted animals.
---
1H Axes are used to cut the trees to create traps and get wood for campfire and other things like that.
---
Fist Weapons is just simple weapon that can be used by anyone who can hit with an fists.
---
Staves are helps to travel.
---
Polearms - no comments, its obvious.
---
I want to say that 2H Axes and 2H Swords are more fit to be used at battlefields, when hunters should avoid (Class fantasy) any battles with more than like 3-4-5 enemies - "thats not my war" - he should say.
---
Also you can't use 2H Axes/Swords in wilderness  -  its too big, heavy and useless, also you can't use it like a spear, its more close combat than polearm, but you wants to take higher distance vs big beasts.
---
Also 1H Swords are pretty useless when you're living in the wild - its too big for traveling, takes too much space, but too short to be used to hunt bears or any other big beasts(your choice if polearm for sure!).
---
Also, you can't cut trees with a swords, you can't cut meat with swords...
---
Rangers? Sorry, but (IMO) MM hunters is more like Robin Hood than some kind of high elven hunters.
---
I'm wrong? Or hunters just wants things like ZinRock/Ashcandy?
---
Very nice:-D ambitious yet not unreasonable.
---
Plus you don't compete for the same gear. (compared to leveling as Ret with a warrior) 
---
Lol u wrote all of this knowing absolutely nothing about the situation and being so wrong, lol. 
---
Someone really likes to hear themselves talk. 
---
this!!!
---
Why is that? What's different with priests?
---
Wait gs came out in BC? I don’t remember that.
---
Engi / Mining
---
It's on the table and loot trading was already a thing in vanilla, it just took 15 hours and manhours from Blizzards support.
---
Locks are much more valuable to 5man dungeons. They can provide similar DPS, have a more reliable hard-cc, have soulstones, healthstones, stamina buff
---
Druid is a bit of a dumb tank, you do lack buttons, but it does get better at higher level.  You never get many defensive abilities, but you get a lot of offensive stuff. 
---
 Eventually you get swipe, with talents it is 15 rage, hits 3 targets and anytime you crit you get +5rage.  You get a lot of crit from your talent tree and you'll also be getting rage from being hit, so often you can spam swipe infinitely and do quite good damage for a tank.  It isn't complicated or engaging, but you will often output far more threat then a warrior is capable of.  
---
If you like warrior tanking at all, I would recommend doing it.  There are never enough of them, it is a super high demand class.  
---
Any chance of a guide that isn’t just improvised rambling thoughts? What happened to your warrior master class? We got 3 parts of 20 and the three parts you actually finished are basically just rambling thoughts - will we see any actual numbers and evidenced based guides? Your video editing is great but how about some actual substance for people who want real info on how to play their class to its full potential?
---
And once you do, then there's  the mystery g-spot zone.
---
Priest get different abilities depending on their race. For example dwarves get Fear Ward, Undead get Devouring plague.
---
Some of these Priest racials are really strong and can influence gameplay quite a bit. I still say go for looks and feel before anything else, but it's worth considering
---
guides on advanced pvp techniques are few and far between and none of the youtube ‘content creator$’ are producing anything that will actually teach you how to think the game at a high level. 
---
PSH here. I still doubt that Classic will have the authenticity of private servers. But we’ll see what happens. At least demon summoning will be on point. 
---
As unlikely as it was to hit R14 back then, it will be even more unlikelybti hit it in classic now
---
Arrows?
---
We’ll be friends 
---
Glad you liked the video and your critiques are valid. Do you know of any better hunter PvP videos from 2005/early 2006? I have Avatar's T2.5 dueling video, Elehendril's, Laboros', Sylk's, Zookee's, and both of Vekor's. (Will upload them all soon). I'd even be curious if you had a video of *any* class being played near perfectly in 2005/early 2006.  
---
Just repeating the situation that you described to me and then adding my insight. That's called a discussion. It's what these forums are for.
---
By typing out exactly what I'm thinking, I gave you the opportunity to refute my points with logic. Instead you resorted to saying that "I'm so wrong" and "I don't know him or his guild". Those aren't reasons. I'm going to take the W on this one.
---
We know a few...
---
7. The first low lvl zones will have sharding like in retail WoW for a few weeks from launch. Why? Because it's more fun to play than to see "Disconnected" or "World Server Down" for a few weeks. It will then be removed, maybe reused for example AQ opening.
---
They explained this very well.
---
19. If you mean the quest in Un'goro it was in the game at 1.12, the reputation gain was changed in the pre-TBC (2.0.1) patch.
---
As far as I know, the tier set thing only applies to T1(even though some pieces are usable). T2 is actually pretty good for paladins and they wear it. At least some pieces for sure. And t2 looks just amazing!
---
Really some people have deep hatred for players that played on private servers.
---
I like comments that have more updoots than the original post.
---
Updoot
---
Thats how things rolled back in 2005
---
if by quality and high effort you mean well designed thumbnails to attract clicks and youtuber style video editing then yep that’s what this is. if you want to actually learn something that you couldn’t find elsewhere in written form and absorb in 2 minutes then maybe not so much. 
---
Cool, thank you for the answer :) 
---
I think he meant D1 aka Dungeon set 1 aka T0
---
&gt; it was in the game at 1.12
---
and was at 1.8, according to thottbot.
---
But, was it on 1.4?
---
I feel like that's being blown out of proportion though. Stuff kinda being made up to  make pservers look bad maybe. I dont understand why though.
---
Fear ward. 
---
Never heard of this. Have a source? 
---
To this I gotta raise two points:
---
1. PvP was way more notorious than PvE, meaning PvP players had way more spotlight than PvE players ever had with very few exceptions (e.g. Kungen). This trend seems like it’s finally changing thanks to Method thankfully.
---
2. Sadly these embarrassing idiots overshadow some actually good mannered players.
---
At least we had Swifty with Razer back in the day lol. Does anyone remembers the exercise videos and shit before gameplay on his videos? 
---
I still have one, it's in a drawer somewhere because I spilled tea on it years and years ago but it does indeed suck
---
Can you explain what reinforcements in AV is? :o
---
hmm, there was also that one guy reading all quest texts of AV quests...
---
I hope there is no right-click AFK reporting in Classic - at least not like today, that it will kick you even if you're not afk.
---
For one there are no world quests or daily quests, so other then group quests that are needed for atunement or gear, you don't really need to do them after you level.  For farming hpaladin is quite decent at aoe grinding.  
---
Furion can you tp top? Furion can you tp top? Furion can you tp top? Furion can you tp top? Furion can you tp top? Furion can you tp top? 
---
wtf? Do you wanna lose?!
---
That just seems to be the blizzard way nowadays. The devs keep asking for feedback on BFA and want to hear what the players think. And despite there being tons of feedback nothing happens and there is no communication.
---
Hah, yeah I remember it was either you were Marksmanship or you were a newb. Funny enough though, before the early rework of BM, spirit bond was bugged and all 3 ranks could be stacked making each attack your pet landed heal you a very significant amount. That bug, coupled with Broken Tooth's fast attack speed, made hunters nearly unkillable in duels. Sadly that spec was essentially useless outside of winning duels plus they fixed it pretty quickly after the first few of us learned about it.
---
He probably just mixed up D1 and T1
---
It's a shame because there is going to be a huge demand for that kind of content. 
---
&gt; Same for Rogues, they don't get their really awesome stuff till a little later. And they're so squishy, if you get an extra add you're toast before Bear Form is available.
---
&gt; 
---
Bear Form will never be available to rogues, fortunately.
---
&gt; The druid is also a NElf so I had to make the manual run from Teldrassil over to Stormwind to keep the same leveling experience. Then I went and did the swim form quest, which makes you run all over and takes a fair whack of time.
---
hmm, that explains everything. Well, I thought you excluded the run from leveling time.
---
The calendar was not visible in the UI but could be opened with /calendar. It even was possible to set dates for raids for example and afair it just showed molten core and bwl. Nonetheless it wont be there in classic as they tend to be authentic. 
---
If they partner with someone to remake these for the launch i'm 200% buying one to go with the new MX518 and reliving my teens.
---
here was also McDonald's one, with keys for pets or something.
---
&gt; once you get cat form they're probably one of the fastest
---
anyway, I'll balance half of my way XÐ
---
just for sentiment.
---
Yeah, PvP has changed a lot especially with all the new activated items/consumables. I'm curious though, even back in the day aimed shot was changed pretty early on to bring you out of shadow meld but the transition took long enough that much of the aimed shot cast time had already elapsed. Is that no longer the case?
---
Use the heat from the PC to warm your room. It's not like you plan on leaving it during Classic.
---
[Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20070406232342/http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/html/articles/stats_casters.shtml) is the relevant page on the archived petopia.
---
Both classes kiting and control orientated that are hard to master.  Frost mage has a overall higher skill cap, and if play perfectly is at a higher tier then hunter.  If played merely above average they are about the same with maybe hunter being better.  
---
Dont be afraid to go for druid, they are the least populated class so you should be well in demand. They are also great levelers, and can both tank a heal during leveling. The biggest problem with hybrid classes is that they are forced to heal at 60, but as long as you like healing, this is not a problem. I think you will like the class a lot
---
It took me *months* to get to the Arcanist 3 piece bonus.  
---
Then my girlfriend brought her hunter on ONE night's raiding, and walked away with the T2 helmet and pants, FOUR pieces of Giantstalker's Armor, and the Mature Black Dragon Sinew...
---
a Night Elf can cast 4 Wraths, and after 3 Wraths, the addon "Scrolling Combat Text" does its "tididididi" that you have "Low Mana".
---
Oh man, I played a Human Rogue and I was SO PROUD that I had a head gear (defias mask) and no one else had any.
---
Wish I had played in Vanilla.  Would have been awesome.  Defeating Arthas was my ultimate fantasy goal that I achieved.  Being able to tank a raid was my mechanical goal I achieved and was proud despite Wrath probably being easy mode tanking.
---
I remember running UBRS half a million times waiting for the Lightforge shoulders, the last item I needed to the full set. It dropped exactly once and another paladin got it.  I never collected the full set and later switched my main anyways. 
---
But I felt like a boss after finishing the damn 100% mount quest. 
---
Deadmines and Gnomeregan wouldn't be so bad, would it? Like yes, you may be the target of some PVP but doable. I played alliance and did Scarlet Monastery and Shadowfang Keep plenty of times. Stockades and RFC though... That's a whole adventure. 
---
Once you get used to it, it's not a struggle at all to farm them up. Sometimes you will have to delete some because you'll have tok many of them. Definitely wouldn't be concerned, it's a minor thing.
---
&gt; What datamining? We dont have anything to datamine so what is this referring too? Not attacking your post or anything. Just genuinly curious. There is nothing to datamine so this seems like misinformation.
---
from the demo client. Here is an example of datamined data:
---
http://thottbot.com/item=12303
---
"Requires Tiger Riding"
---
that's racist! Why don't we, Elves, have orcgrain for Stormwind?
---
That's what happens in any organized AV, even in vanilla.
---
Rogue is competitive and multiple will be brought to most raids, but it is often the most played class so you'll need luck, effort, or friends to get into a decent raiding guild.  
---
Did you have buffs/consumables/boes/enchants etc? Ie. Were these times taken as a 'fresh start'?
---
I had one and it was pretty nice actually, but yes. Kind of dumb. I bought it for the TBC looking one you got with it, never used the left side with the weird thingy, it was OK for CS but sucked for RPGs.
---
The TBC one was just a regular keyboard with some extra buttons.
---
A massive number of those SWP kills were during the Wrath pre-patches. 
---
You bought it for the TBC version, it was like a "clip on" keyboard you could change pieces of. The TBC version was just a regular keyboard, kind of.
---
Twisting Nether seems like good for PvP and PvE alike. Sure, the chance of resurrecting is only 10% but it could win you a fight or save the raid altogether imo so I will be going for that one for sure.
---
Maelstorm and Heroism also seem good but the best one is probably Blue Dragon overall for casters.
---
Yeah it's crazy to see how far the game has advanced in the past decade but I'm not too keen on private servers.
---
Right? Taken private servers did have a massive effect on classic even becoming reality. Btw is this ’private server hero’ a thing, or is OP just trying to start a thing?

(There is a new thread every monday.)
---
My main has always been alchemy/herbalist so I want to try something different. Probably, will just stick to gathering professions to make gold 
---
In the beginning I go mining, engineering. Level engineering while leveling to have PvP gadgets for some mighty fun. Mining to farm Arcane Crystals asap for Arcanite Reaper and Lionheart, maybe even Stronghold Gauntlets (if its in the game at start). 
---
If I'm on the side with PvP queues, I will drop mining and go herbalism to farm herbs and alliance while I'm out in the world.
---
Alchemy + maybe Blacksmithing on an alt which will be level 35 or 60 depending on the altoholism that I may or may not develop.
---
How can people play without. 
---
Everyone needs a yell button.
---
are you me?
---
Honestly all 3 of thes duos are awesome. I would just exclude the warlock priest. It's great but the gear competition could make it unfun. Both warrior priest and warlock druid are pretty much superb for both leveling and dungeons, chose what you like the most!
---
Very much interested.
---
Yeah my server is almost 24% warrior (prob inflated bc bank alts but still) 
---
Thats what you have the duo for, so the warrior doesnt struggle.
---
Let me introduce Rifluvr.
---
[Rifle lovin 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFtnLy0pLMY) is my favorite hunter classic PvP vid

I think hes trying to start a thing and his post is 100% fake news lol

this is a zoomer post tho
---
Hi MRD85, our Discord is for Classic: World of Warcraft Guild Recruitment and is listed on u/Teeb list.
---
Btw, our link is now fully functional again:  [https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq](https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq) 
---
relax
---
for me its same of the max level areas. i started when tbc was out and   at the latest from lvl 58 i went to the new zones. so my time in winterspring / silithus was very limited.
---
It's a cap on how many times people can come back to life, with every kill taking 1 reinforcement.  Other stuff also takes away reinforcements like capping towers, or killing bosses.
---
Epic BoP robe for mage(bis until T2 i think)/priest(at least pre bis). Tailoring is a must have for those class early on.
---
I see your point, but I fully assume they will make assessments:
---
1. Split classic servers (or add) into vanilla &amp; TBC
---
2. Progress all servers into TBC
---
3. Stick to vanilla only forever
---
Whatever makes them the most money, they will probably do.
---
I have this model, complete with the WoW key set. Yes, the switches are really pants, soft membranes due to the way the different key sets overlay the buttons themselves.  
---
  
---
I actually used the WoW key set when I played Vanilla, and would habitually switch it out for the ‘FPS’ set for those games and the normal set for everything else.  
---
This ends up being a massive fat as you can imagine, and you just end up with 2 places for keyboard crap to accumulate, in the key set itself and underneath where the buttons are. For most of its life I just left the normal key set on, and now I can’t remember where the others are at all...  
---
To let you know how bad the keys were, the replacement for this keyboard for me was a £12 Microsoft Curve.
---
The way private servers plays out is how its gonna be on classicwow just get use to it.
---
Holy fuck! I completely forgot I had one of the bottom two until seeing this photo. I seem to remember spilling my drink all over it and it never working again. Thanks for the nostalgia. 
---
Between retail Vanilla and pservers, I've done every profession.
---
With this experience, I'm going to herb + alch and be rich.
---
*Everything* except BoP things (and engi items) which you imagine you'll make for yourself and sell, you can easily buy off the AH and make more money selling herbs + consumes.
---
Herb + Alch makes so much gold it is absolutely ridiculous. Even if you get the rare raid drops and world drops (you probably won't) you will **not** make gold back being an enchanter, you will **not** make any significant gold with a crafting profession other than Alch.
---
Take it or leave it, a lot of people are resistant to this advice, but that's fine. Means people in the know will be richer in comparison.
---
F
---
lol fuck off
---
I will be leveling 2 characters from launch a dwarf priest who will be a tailor/enchanter until i craft my robe then i will change to alchemy. My second character will be a hunter for farming herb/skinning will be his profession.
---
Now that is funny!!! Nearly spit out my drink! 
---
Myself personally, I think they perfected the game on a psychological level. The RNG created this unpredictable atmosphere combined with the game's massive open world. Things either went really wrong, or really right. The flood of dopamine after getting the upper hand and killing a guy who tried to gank you at 50% hp with a mob on you as well. The frustrating elements of the game were also frequent, but prevented people from becoming desensitized to that dopamine rush, which all of course came from a sense of achievement.
---
Tailoring and mining to 60 then drop mining to pick up engi and have an alt with mining/herbing.
---
not for a lot of players. enjoy the game how you want to right.
---
I always play healing/supporting characters so the choice for the priest back in the beta/classic was pretty clear for me. What I really loved about it looking back was the basic focus on healing for the class. No playing around, no hybrid, a holy priest in classic uses a few powerful healing spells to keep everybody alive and if you perfect this it ican be very challenging.
---
 I always found a group/raid cause everybody needs a healer ;)
---
Also what I really enjoyed was the Benediction quest and having this awesome staff at the end of it.
---
weird reasoning but ok
---
I love the stuff that kid does but jeez he must have absolutely nothing else to do but play wow. Dudes had rank 14 on almost ever pserver!
---
I'm only a jealous really :( 
---
Bloody kids and jobs getting in my way of the true dream.
---
I love watching this old messy stuff! Gets me hyped more than anything &lt;3
---
I out my open hand above my eyes neR my forehead and look around. And around. And around. I just cant find these people you are talking about. It's like one big lie.
---
paladin for sure for group content. druid has no rez without cooldown so you can basically only tank. 
---
I dont know if its the ingame function or some addon but the second somebody starts a cast targeting you, he becomes your target and if you have a cast bar addon, you will see what cast hes using. 
---
Warrior can defstanc + shield.  
---
Rogue can vanish
---
Mage can iceblock/icebarrier + manashield
---
Hunter can feign death to interrupt the cast
---
Warlock can... die? Or sac VW
---
Shaman can equip shield
---
Priest shields and hots
---
druid goes travel form
---
Hunters cant sneak attack like a rogue can nowadays.
---
tailoring/herb on my priest for the bags and pre-bis
---
then swap out tailoring for alch later on down the road
---
I wanna combine rogue with something, and something ranged will be necessary, since I can't stealth with another class tiptoeing around me... It's hard, I might have to do some testing on private realms.
---
man I need a job xDDDDDDd but I live in the middle of no where and have no idea where to start since my anxiety really limits what I am capable todo in a social atmosphere, haha you jealous of him and i'm jealous of you... the circle of life is complete
---
skin and herb
---
crafting is shit
---
Q, E, F, G are all easier to reach than 1234
---
They could bring over every feature of retail and I’d still play if I’m honest.
---
What I want is launch date. No matter when it's but summer vacation booking has started where I work and I want to time it with Classic launch :D
---
I still have my zboard and still use it. The thing is, it doesn't properly work on Windows 10. First you need the old software to make it work, which I had because I saved the disc all these years. The new steelseries engine will not work on the zboard. So you install the disc and it will function properly.....until you reboot the computer. There's something in Windows 10 that blocks the  .MSI files. Many people have complained about it but nothing's been fixed yet. 
---
So if you want to use the keyboard to play games you have to uninstall and reinstall the software every time before you open the game. I mean it's quick, it only takes less than 5 minutes, but...if you're gaming everyday then, yeah, it's annoying.
---
Yeah maybe in premades but it wasn't the norm.
---
Man you are all over the place with your private server hate lol. Where is this mob of people trying to chnage classic to pserver classic? I need like links and websites and movement post for this junk you tall about. Like you are spreading propaganda. But why?
---
Nothing Barrens chat can't handle.
---
Red defias mask and those dark grey level 17 leather shoulders, bis for rogue until at least UBRS 
---
&gt;Yes you can get playtime through tokens on BFA but not in classic
---
Because both Classic and retail will be playable with same sub it's possible to just farm gold in retail, buy tokens and then play Classic. Quite cool!
---
I'll go full nostalgia mode. I'll make Tauren Druid with same name as my first character ever and I'll pick herb/alch.
---
If they don’t share launch who says they still won’t at AQ event?
---
NO
---
Naxxramas and back end of aq40. All overworld zones I've been to every nook and cranny
---
It will go from ‘what should I main’ to ‘what should my alt be’
---
Why mention devouring plague which is worse than shadow guard? Or was it an example of a bad one?
---
My first character ever created was druid. Still my main today. There is no other way than creating druid with my original name!
---
When I resubbed for BfA after a few year break, i literally redid my keybinds by putting my finger on each key and 'feeling' which spell went there. It was a bit awkward when it turned out some of those spells had been pruned, but hey..
---
Just look at ClassiCast for example. It doesn't go a single episode without Esfand saying he wants the realm caps increased, despite being told by Mark Kern himself that it was a design decision to keep them low.
---
I guess today you would get a Razer Nostromo or Orbweaver. 
---
I would quit if my server transitioned to TBC.  The appeal of classic servers to me is that it wont progress beyond 60.
---
I d0nt c4r3 about anigthny jus wan play
---
True. Unfortunately on unofficial servers it's kinda become the norm, especially on AV weekend. I'm hoping that things won't be so organized when classic releases!
---
Overall people weren't so deep in game back then. We were still learning how to play. Now we have 14 years of experience. I'm quite sure there will be minor class balances and those combined with our knowledge I am pretty sure meta will be quite different than what it was back in Vanilla.
---
Yah but that's just 1 guy and honestly if you ever watch esfand hes kind of a fuckin idiot.
---
Spam SS and finish the mob off with Evis.  
---
Snd over Evis in instances is correct.  
---
Opening from Stealth is not worth it.  
---
Don't go Hemo while leveling. Ever.
---
Lol yeah, the guys with the actual source code are going to get it wrong while the guys who had to reverse engineer the source code with guess work and anecdotal evidence got it 100% right. Especially with those 10k server caps am I right? 
---
I find it hilarious the things that players will tolerate from private servers but rage against blizzard for even considering 
---
"Is stolen silver bugged?"
---
They are a lot more common than you might think, but no where near as common as in BfA. They frequently contain greens and sometimes (rarer) blues.
---
That said, it's not the reason to pick dwarf. I say this because if you choose herbalism or mining as a profession, do you really want to switch between Find Treasure and Find Herbs / Minerals every 5 minutes?
---
It's a fun bonus to being a dwarf, for sure, but don't be a dwarf just for this racial skill.
---
Pitfalls to be aware of:
---
-	Some can be locked requiring a rogue with the Pick Lock skill to open.
---
-	You can only have one "Track" will active at a time, e.g. Track Humanoids. Find Treasure counts as a tracking skill.
---
-	Herbs / Minerals do not auto track, you must switch on Find Herbs or Find Minerals, so Find Treasure gets bumped off.
---
-	You will find a lot of barrels of milk.
---
It could be great for roleplaying I suppose.
---
Start small my good friend! 
---
Try getting a job that has limited interactions with people. Maybe something that only involves a small team like working in a warehouse, no customers giving you grief, you'll get close to your small workforce, make friends, learn how to interact with people face to face with confidence!
---
I was like you a good few years ago. The thought of working with loads of people and having to perform to a certain level scared the crap out of me haha. I forced myself into a job and now I work in a hospital that requires me to interact with people face to face 12 hours a day with  extremely high expectations of me.
---
Sorry I went on a bit there!
---
I wish you the best of luck! Just take it slow and don't worry about it, what's the rush!? 
---
Peace.
---
Oh, I wasn't talking about the overall increase in players' skill or their expanded game knowledge; I'm talking more about the authentic Blizzard experience, the old names, the nostalgia, and the sort of chaos of playing video games pre-Twitch/Youtube. For me, I don't think there will be any getting used to classic as my video gaming days are all but over aside from the occasional podcast appearance.
---
Oh, I didn't even think of all the new addons... yeah, I guess nerfed shadow meld aimed shot wouldn't work unless the enemy was already target locked elsewhere.
---
Horde hands down want priests more.  As a horde priest you will be the main tank healer in raids (because no paladins obviously) and in PvP you are the only healer with an all-around defensive dispell.  Basically horde priests are the MVP healers.  Sure you probably want more shamans because totems are only groupwide but priests will be topping the healing meters.
---
I didnt play alliance priest and honestly I dont think I ever would due to being largely relegated to a group healer because paladins are better at tanking healing.  Also undead can break mind control (which having played an undead priest made for funny times mind controlling enemy priests off lumber mill and watching them try to do it to me in revenge).
---
Enchanting... you think you do but you don’t 
---
yeah pretty much if I remember correctly having an arrow/bullet bag gave a buff to attack power or something, so really you had your main bag and 3 bag slots and than your arrow/bullet bag
---
Thanks for your input.
---
I know combat is more efficient while leveling, but I like to PVP a lot while leveling, so hemo fits me better. I also feel it is worth opening from stealth using sub spec cause you have faster movement speed when in stealth and dont need ages so sneak up to a mob plus you get more CP by opening form stealth. So I know its not optimal, I just like the playstyle and PVP potential.
---
All the downvotes are the retards. I upvoted you because this is exactly what's happening. There is now for some reason this gang of pserver haters raging at made up stuff. It's kind of baffeling.
---
I keybound in 2005, I can't be the only one?? I had to go kite as a hunter 
---
Some people are just bad.
---
Why bother with herbalism when you could just buy the herbs from the AH? It’s more efficient then gathering them yourself.  Just take engineering/alchemy
---
I'm pretty sure you could fry an egg on mine after 30 mins on rainbow 6, it was great in the winter.
---
Maybe you should make a new thread regarding this.
---
thanks man! i'll see what I can get and go from there, appreciate that!
---
Is it BiS for rogue in PVP in vanilla? I remember using dark moon card death in early WotLK on my rogue.
---
You may be right(technically) but in vanilla devouring plague was by far the best horde racial spell.  Less people were dwarves(?) which meant less stoneforms and having SWP/DP basically guaranteed a win for an undead priest while leveling.  Also most people back then the average player didn't even realize stoneform removed devouring plague.  So if you asked what the two most popular racial priest spells in vanilla were they would be fear ward for alliance and devouring plague for horde.
---
I actually did upgrade to 512mb for raiding, but the 64mb graphics card was a beast. Still have this Pc now and still runs.
---
I think it's attack speed, not sure tho. 
---
Human: awful, boring mount to be stuck with
---
&gt; I see this argument a lot. I do agree that the raids get demystified when you can just see it all in a stupid easy version of it. If anything, LFR isn't the worst offender for me. Normals and to a certain extent, heroics, are. Blazing through the raid in normal mode, then going through heroic mode with a little difficulty but nothing too crazy, and then getting your face bashed in by the same boss over and over again in mythic. That's the worst part, imo. Even in WotLK when they introduced normal/heroic raids, it felt wrong. I never wanted to have to progress through the same raid more than once. A guild will usually one shot bosses once it gets the first kill, or at least get subsequent kills in a few pulls. I don't want to progress on the same boss, and almost exact same mechanics more than once. I think I would have less of a problem with it if your average guild wasn't running all the modes and just went straight for mythic at release. Never been in a guild like that, though.
---
Yea for sure. Heroic isn't a good idea either. It's great for dungeons, especially to make the lower level dungeons relevant at max level. But for raids, it gets to be a drag. I'd rather the one raid be twice as difficult instead of having 4 total difficulties. This is probably the biggest reason raids feel more meh now.  You have to kill Jaina 3 times before you actually kill her for real. Just doesn't leave an impact like killing Kael'Thas for the first time did.
---
&gt; However, I will never understand why people care so much that lower tier gear looks similar to higher tier gear. It doesn't matter. The stats on it matter. Your dps/hps output matters. Your damage mitigation and health pool matters. Whether it takes you 15 tries or not to get the boss mechanics down or not. The people that I remember the most aren't the guys looking cool in SW, it's the guys topping the meters consistently.
---
Gear isn't a status symbol for those you are raiding with, it's to show off to the guilds/casuals who don't see your damage meters. Back in vanilla, I remember seeing the server's top guild's main tank, Kold, in Dreadnaught helm and shoulders and being in sheer wonder of his gear. I nearly immediately went off and rolled a night elf warrior so my character could possibly look that bad ass. I also remember seeing Awake from Nihilum (in a video) in full T6 on his pally, and remember how jealous I was when my pally was in half t4. Now that casual warrior #57232 has easy access to the same gear that is colored slightly differently, you might as well run around naked, you'll probably be more distinguished that way. 
---
I don't even know what ANY sets were/are since WoTLK. Seeing everyone run around in the same gear set that's just colored differently makes that mythic gear a lot less memorable, even though it's arguably more difficult to acquire.
---
&gt; I don't know, maybe I'm weird, but I've never really paid much attention to people's gear unless I have a good reason to. I look at what they do, not what they wear. It's also pretty funny how some of you guys will argue that gear is a status symbol but at the same time screech autistically at the mention of gearscore.
---
Did you play in vanilla or bc? There is no way you could say that in those games. Especially when the tier sets were designed a million times more aesthetically pleasing than any pre-bis item. Those items were truly epic.  Nowadays, gear is indistinguishable from others.  They are all designed more aesthetically, but the difference between top sets and random world drops is very minor. Also, since it seems like 50% of the population is just transmog'd out anyways, you couldn't even tell what their gear is from just looking at their character.
---
A significant portion of the value is in the herbs. The smart people that need engi and gold go engi/herb, never engi/alch.
---
Abandoning it for alchemy?  I understand engineering but why alchemy? Isn’t alchemy the same as blacksmithing? It doesn’t give any benefits to the player so why take it? If you want an alchemist just make a left 35 warlock so it acts as a summoner and a transmuter so you can take a more worthwhile profession 
---
Attack speed yeah. Plus it was a good idea to stock up on arrows when you're going on a big grinding/questing session, which in turn took up "regular" bag space. So big bags as early as possible is big for hunters :)
---
You’re implying that herbalism is a good money maker then? You think the time invested gathering herbs is worth more than doing Dire Maul grinding or BRD grinding?  If I can make 70g hour or whatever doing a dungeon grind and you can make 40g an hour doing herbalism then I would actually be farming more herbs than you since I’m essentially grinding 70g worth of herbs and you’re only grinding 40g worth of herbs.
---
Yes, one of the bags is full of arrows, which also gives inc attack speed + you always must have at least 1 stack of food for your pet. If you don't want to catch a new one again.
---
This really made me laugh, also hunters are perhaps more so
---
Yes, GS was becomming a thing late in BC. I remember this because I changed faction on my server (transfered my main to another realm) to play with friends who were Alliance. But I couldn't pug shit, not even Karazhan with half epic gear, because I didn't have enough gear score.
---
It was a pest, I had to explain who I was (the guild I played for in The Horde was quite known and I was the only ret pally, so people on the server knew me) and "prove it" before I could even do heroic dungeons or Karazhan.
---
Gearscore is fucking shit.
---
And if it was 1.8 or 1.4, it was still in the game in 1.12.
---
Glimmering Smithfield Insignia
---
This. Being proactive &gt; standing doing nothing
---
Yeah we got you covered.
---
This is the opposite of true- unflagged aoe will not flag people.
---
Oh yeah, never did AV again after the NPC nerfs and zergfest started, so I didn't remember this :D
---
Fishing - because that's the only profession I won't have to deal/compete with other players for resources. The respawns of all those resources are slow. The number of players on endgame zones will be too much. Farmers will ruin things. Un'goro Mafia destroys fun with Dinos. So yeah - fishing mate. Fishing keeps you calm.
---
Reinforcements were indeed in vanilla. 
---
&gt;You’re implying that herbalism is a good money maker then? 
---
Yes, absolutely.
---
&gt;so I can get the robe of the arch mage
---
BoP items and engi are the only professions worth taking for those reasons.
---
The ideal profession combo for most classes that want to high end raid is engineering (for sappers and chicken) + flex (usually herb for gold, or other professions with BoP items)
---
You only go hemo around 35 and that is only if you are rushing past people doing instances or on a PVP server. Before that improved sprint is actually decent in PvP (mage frostnova), so you level as combat after putting 2 points in Remorseless attacks.
---

---
This would be the spec. Next point go in sap then you finish off assass. PvP builds SUCK before you get dirty deeds which is why you wait. Dirty deeds allows you to do the stunlocks. In PVE the opener is usually Garrote, hemo rupture ghostly and then slice and dice. Mobs melt from the bleeds and poisons. You would only cheapshot in PvP or if the mob is bleed immune. Stealth is REALLY bad in vanilla which is why I take Master of Deception while leveling. Distract is good for openers, but being able to stealth around hard quests that save 30 minutes of clearing mobs is very nice.
---
The one good thing about hemo is you don't really need gear at all and ghostly strike makes you pretty tanky. I leveled on Nost with a 20 green weapon with a slow speed on it all the way to 60 cus I was in a rush. 
---
In pvp the spec doesn't work right without relentless strikes so you slam thistle teas if you want to 100-0 someone in a stun lock. They are pretty much f'd if you have teas though. Rogues are pretty broken with tea till probably mid 40's 50's when plate classes get some decent gear and when casters get their defensive stuff. 
---
For mages, they simply beat you if they are good as hemo after around 40. You can beat the bad ones opening with CS gouged front the front. A lot panic and blink the cheapshot and end up gouged and you are a step ahead and can win. Engineering iron grenades if they don't have them can also win the fight.
---
Have fun. :)
---
I think I still have mine! I'm my mums filling cabinet I'll try and find it for you guys next time I'm there
---
Yea I’m hoping someone doesn’t make gs for classic. It ruins the experience for me, it’ll probably be a dealbreaker for me 
---
Good money because of the herbs you just happen to come across every now and then? Or good money for people who actively go looking for herbs? I’ve never known herbalism to be better gold per hour then the more well known grinds 
---
It starts with 'Chief Engineer Scooty' in Orgrimmar and all you have to do is go to Booty Bay to get the transporter. And the quest gives great leather pants!
---
Oh. Shit.
---
Well good to know
---
thanks for the input. my next point will definetally go into dirty deeds and prep. i just couldnt resist changing to hemo on lvl 30. i waited to long xD
---
the thing i dont understand is that in your skilltree you have hemo and improved ss. why you do that? i have currently the same sub tree, but without ghostly strike. (therefore 5/5 camouflage)
---
Glimmering Mithril insignia makes you immune to fear for 30 seconds, on a cooldown of 10 minutes. While the whopping 30 second immunity will still be useful for warrior, it is of course less useful than it might be for other classes that have more trouble breaking fear. 
---
Seems like it would be especially useful for hunter, which is the only class besides shaman that does not break fear with pvp trinket (shaman might at least break with tremor?). Plus hunter and shaman can’t possibly be undead.
---
Ofc the 30 second immunity is still good for anyone and surpasses a lone wotf or trinket or Zerk rage.
---
Good god paladin, might/kings, they are buttons. It's like he only knows sacrifice.
---
Depending on the class, the second one. Of course if you're one of the classes with the solo farming options you allude to, those farming methods are the most GPH.
---
Otherwise, you want herbalism.
---
Even if you can solo farm instances, gathering Dreamfoil you come across, and even the odd Black Lotus (which you will come across now and again effortlessly if you're not on a 10k pop server) still adds a significant amount of additional gold.
---
Of course if you're a hunter doing DM:N runs, etc, that will be your main gold making method assuming /camp and lockouts aren't changed drastically.
---
Tailoring + Engi is the absolute ideal tryhard profession combo for a mage, but that's because you need BoP items (or engi items) from both professions.
---
Mages especially when they spec fire will go into melee range more often and benefit greatly from sappers. Regardless, you generally want as many people as feasible to pop sappers for AoE clears anyway. And of course chickens and dragonlings.
---
Amazing. Can't wait to do this.
---
Does anything change if you duo level with another physical damage dealer? Should I still go combat swords to 35? Hemo seems to be reallly good with another phys damage dealer.
---
Well, man. Solution for working under Windows10 may be googled in 10 minutes.
---
I've this one + BC keyset, and drivers aren't an sufficient trouble.
---
Game profiles it's a BIG annoying and still UNRESOLVED problem.

---
There are various professions that benefit you in different styles of play.
---
Skinning if you grind a lot of UBRS and claim all dragon scales.
---
Engineering for die hard PvPing and moderate money making on the side with sappers.
---
However if you are a diehard guild member, core raider, probably even officer and you get enchanting or blacksmithing plans the second they drop and you are the main provider, you can make serious bank.
---
The blacksmith who got titanic leggings as the first player on a pserver made 15.000g the first two days. You could /who him and he was 24/7 at the Orgrimmar forge making them for people with their mats, taking 100-150g fee or he bought ingredients and made them wholly and selling them on the AH and tradechat.
---
The same with enchanting. Be one of the very first people who get +30 spell damage, crusader or other rarely enchants? Couple thousand gold incoming.
---
As a conclusion, these two professions need you to be no casual and be a highranking member of your guild  to make serious bank. 
---
yep, that's the only thing i wasn't a fan of about tbc. other than that, 10/10 xpac.
---
Good story - i was almost expecting that a Hunter ninja-ed the helmet from you by rolling need on it but this was good :D
---
2 spells being different per race, obtained through quest at 10 and 20.
---
Trolls get shadow guard (shadow variant of shaman's lightning shield) and hex of weakness (-damage inflicted -healing received ST debuff).
---
UDs get DP (shadow-based health drain disease) and touch of weakness (-inflicted damage debuff and shadow damage  on next received melee hit).
---
NElves get starshards (channeled arcane-based AoE damage spell) and Elune's grace (+10% dodge, -ranged damage received self buff).  
---
Dwarf gets desperate prayer (instant self-heal on a cd) and fear ward (protection vs 1 fear effect for 10 mins on ally target).
---
Human also gets desperate prayer and then, feedback (self buff, spells that strike you burn the enemy's mana and deal some shadow damage, much like the casted mana burn spell).
---
Overall Alliance wise dwarf is the most valued one. Horde wise it isn't as clear, both UD and trolls have their benefits.  
---
Because I'm planning on running a Tank Druid, I'll be going Enchanting first to get [Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811), with Herbalism on the side. I'll bank the herbs and then switch to Alchemy once I have the Heart. Alchemy was always my go-to profession back in the day, so I want to have it again. Plus I feel more comfortable selling pots on the AH than standing around in Org advertising Enchanting services in Trade chat (Frankly the ability to sell enchants on the AH would be one change I'd be completely ok with. Just make it a kit or something). 
---
My Shaman alt will go Herbalism and Skinning purely for money and funnelling herbs back to my main. 
---
Mongoose doesnt work on druids, same with most other on-hit effects.
---
Try play classic on it 
---
Many of these rolling warriors are wannabe furies. 
---
But, on the other hand, it's usually the same issue: too many raid tanks, just not enough for dungeons. 
---
I think drivers it's not a real problem. Last and working Z-Engine (not Steetlseries engine) still may be found on steelseries site.
---
If you're unique owner of any original .zmd profile file (for any additional keyset or at least for default batterfly keyset), please share it. It will be really useful.
---
Love screenshots like these.
---
Getting past the Core Hounds without messing up is indeed impressive if you consider the circumstances.
---
Near 40 people in the raid
---
WoW might be their first MMORPG or game in general
---
No Voice comms, all comms done in chat
---
Huge FPS drops and server lags
---
Unoptimized gear, people went for D1 instead of the actual good blues that you could find in dungeons
---
Old talents (?)
---
all in all, that's a lot of obstacles. So what seems so easy today must have been like a near impossible obstacle to get past. It's like the first raid team to beat ragnaros would be the first guys to go to the moon or something.
---
But standing on IF bridge advertising your enchanting for 8 hours a day is such engaging gameplay!
---
Currently the one I'm playing, warrior. Leveling one makes me want to cut myself or castrate myself with a spoon. But when you're a 60 warrior, you're a complete monster in pve and pvp.
---
I cry F
---
I'm in the military and have learned to hate unexplained acronyms with a seething passion. No clue what that first one is either. This reddit post was in the top 10 results when I googled it. Urghhh
---
After crafting these you can drop it. The only stuff that requires keeping it is bloodvine's set bonus. 
---
It's not really going to make a difference, it's a very very small buff.
---
And that IANAL thing?
---
Congratulations! Prepare to be the most casual of players possible! You have been warned!
---
First let me say that you can gave a GREAT time as a ele shaman if you plan everything well. You can raid up to AQ depending on the guild as 30/0/21 and Elemental. You still heal though. As to if you will be allowed to run the spec, it depends. If the healers are newer or not experienced people are going to want/need mana tide. If you are in a guild that rushes they are gonna want it.
---
When I have played ele and I usually main warrior now I run this after getting BIS as full resto. I look for a middle progress guild and tell them to stick me in a melee group and melee are so abundant you are pretty much guaranteed a spot doing that. It's perfectly fine raidhealing with chain heal and dropping totems and the spec works fine in pvp.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVcIz0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVcIz0xo)
---
Naxx is hard and Naxx takes a lot of money. You probably aren't getting a raid spot as elemental when people are spending a fortune there and private Naxx is not Classic Naxx. It's complete guesswork on resists and armor count on the bosses and not really accurate. Now the good news is the best Ele gear is in AQ, so Naxx really isn't important. AQ is when Ele Shamans hit their peak.
---
Even the weapon on ele isn't that important. If you like to 1 v 1 a lot the ZG weapon is actually one of the best because combined with searing totem casters can't get much off. For nuking the BWL mace is fine and for trinkets you have the Shaman class trinket and ZG spell trinket. 
---
The only time I would ever bother dpsing as an ele shaman is ZG if you still need the spellpower trinket and outgear it. No one can really say anything at that point and just being there is doing people a favor often anyways because it will be undergeared alts etc.
---
If you still want to clear Naxx though you can. Just accept that you are almost certainly going to be healing. Ele Shamans can farm DM trash to respec like other casters so it's doable. Personally though I would take an alt there if you plan on running it every week and spending that much gold. Caster in bloodvine can be geared really fast as an example. 
---
I will probably seek out or start an random-hours guild on my own server. I work 3 shifts and it rotates every couple of months. Still thinking of a cool guild name. Something in the vein of The Night Watch.
---
&gt;just pick your profession based on what will benefit you the most
---
That's a funny way of saying pick herbalism. :P
---
So much gold, you can easily buy *everything* you'd ever make as a blacksmith and have gold left over.
---
Of course you can't get the Mithril Insignia trinket.
---
This is a man of my own heart. 
---
This. Devouring Plague is amazing against classes/races that cannot remove it. It does a lot of damage, while also healing you, making it incredible for Shadow PvP.    
---
 As far as I know, Shadowguard is only good in combination with the talent Blackout and is considered inferior in PvP situations by most players. I'm sure everyone will have different opinions on this though.
---
Yo this keyboard brings back so many memories I remember every time I wanted to game I’d switch out the keys for the gaming ones and I have never felt cooler lmao
---
Yeah always good to stretch every once in awhile. :)
---
I won one at BlizzCon for doing a Murloc impersonation.
---
I think I tried it once, hated it, and put it on a shelf for years before eventually donating it.
---
Look at that, total fuck fest good old days
---
NE Feral is amazing, especially if you are somewhat inclined to do world PvP. That sweet shadowmeld+eat/drink combination while you look for your next target. Also as a druid getting into 5man groups is really easy provided you are comfortable flexing and filling the role that the group needs. 
---
Good luck in your travels! 
---
Right at start i expect it to be toxic with lots of people expecting the same easy mode as in retail ranting and leaving... after a few weeks it will get better with only people that actually play and enjoy classic will have meaningful discussions here :D
---
D1 and D2 is also very much acceptable.
---
You do realize that world chat is just a universally used regular channel right? Right? You can make a channel with any name you want and other people can join it
---
I'd expected hunter to be quicker, even though 1-10 is a bit more painfull wthout pet.
---
I would suggest going elem if you want to lvl as a caster, you'll be able to heal dungeon as easily as if you were resto and you won't have to keep a second set of gear in your bag
---
Just to be clear I don't have the model that hope he put a picture of. I have the zboard Merc stealth. There are no drivers for the Merc stealth on the steelseries website.
---
Druid was my favourite and only class I would consider playing in vanilla. Ranked to 12 on private servers and spent many many many hours learning the tricks of this versatile class. Arguably the strongest class in 1 v 1 open world combat. 
---
I am going Rogue/Shaman. I like the dichotomy of having a sneakyboi melee class with a big, bombastic Tauren caster shaman who's throwing chain lightnings and leaving totems everywhere. They're as two different experiences as I could find. When I tire of being suble I hope on the shaman and blow some shit up and when I get tired of being killed in WPVP I go rogue mode and get some sweet revenge. I'm playing ele shaman and sub rogue on pserver so I might change up the specs a bit when classic drops.
---
You know its vanilla because he has bre.
---
Shadowmeld can still be very strong mind you. 
---
Defending in WSG or AB, denying warriors their charge, feigndeath + shadowmeld in dungeons and make feign death go off CD etc.
---
It has a lot of applications.
---
Hard to estimate, but take 30 minutes-1 hour as average for a pug depending on time of day or even day. And thats without the travelling to the instance (and praying it wont fall apart).
---
Problem with pugs is that once you have a group going or are still assembling, one of the puggies might get a request from friends/guildies to join their group and leave... and you start all over again.
---
Good thread Youko, thanks for the link.
---
Great guide! i'm just worried will your work hold up to blizzard's classic wow version in all accuracy, basing it on the private server's minmaxing. I mean there are so many micro mechanics, being played out differently which would alter the guide, the suggestion and conclusions (some minor effects, but some could be more major we don't know yet). no everything ofc, but some things for sure. i expect the baseline gameplay be about the same.
---
At least i wouldn't expect blizzard's classic be exactly the same in all details as private server's, right? So when you go in such details and micromechanics you risk at unintentionally misguiding ppl which would look for the guide on youtube for the blizzard's classic when it released. 
---
guess you don't/won't mind doing the updated guides and doing another versions of it for the actual blizzard's classic.
---
not trying to be negative or something, just the worry i have, aswell as work (at least partly) wasted. as private server classic will mostlikely die out and ppl move to blizzard's legion client backported version.
---
&gt; like Hunters all of a sudden switching to DEEP Survival
---
I'm curious about this one. I've never actually seen *any*  reliable math to support it. Not saying it's wrong, obviously LR will win out at some point against TSA, but do you have any post / guide / whatever to actually support whether it happens with vanilla gear?
---
Most guides I see just do things like calculating how much agility to gain more AP from LR, the good ones also might look a bit into the difference in crit. But you also have RWS and I've never seen anyone look into the fact that AP from TSA translates into different DPS because it's AP given to other classes. For example a warrior will scale better, so even if LR gives more total AP to the raid it does not necessarily mean more DPS to the raid.
---
Just curious if someone actually did extended analysis of this (as I'm currently doing it myself).
---
&gt; play well in dungeons and make lots of friends
---
Indeed, your reputation on servers is going to be a thing again. Unless they keep the sharding.
---
Even if being forced to pick a race sucks, I dont like shaman, just to many buttons for totem:)
---
Agreed, next issue.
---
Once I get the opportunity (and if it's still possible with the modern client), I want to wallglitch back into Mount Hyjal. I've done this a couple of times in Vanilla and TBC, and I was always in awe of how much of the zone was already designed for. I've never fully explored the zone because of its size, so I'd like to do that again.
---
I do remember taking my permanent hiatus from WoW during TBC by logging out of the game in front of the World Tree. Sometimes I still wonder what would happen if I log into retail again (I assume I would've been moved to SW or something like that).
---
On my current server, my guild has 1 MAYBE 2 warlock each raid day (MC / Ony / BWL) They just hang out and share loot between em lol, meanwhile we are like 6-8 pallies fighting over scraps each time. 
---
On ally side warlocks really are rare, and rogues &amp; warriors truely a dime a dusin. 
---
Fraps, the most common tool used in vanilla for recording, would have their raw files be about 5 gigs per 30 seconds, what you're asking for doesn't exist.
---
General consensus is human for PVE due to swords and, but dwarf is great for PVP especially against other rogues and bleed heavy classes like warrior which rogues already struggle with. The human stealth detection will only help you against another rogue if you already know its there. Personally I'd go dwarf all around as I don't like swords that much anyway.
---
Was a mistake fixed it. So 33 is the best time  you can go hemo not 35 :). It's around the time you get to STV, which works out well. You never use SS as hemo, can take that right off your bars. Also ghostly is awesome for pvp and leveling. Get that asap :). Ghostly hits hard after the opener with hemo and the dodge saves you a lot on food. You actually have very limited downtime leveling as hemo. 
---
This is the usual Hemo pvp spec endgame. Last 5 points are preference. You can also drop master of deception once you get a decent dagger to weapon swap and put points in ambush. Improved kidney is nice for ranking due to utility in a premade. Heightened senses is obviously good for finding other stealth. Those 2 talents are where the 5 points usually go as a fresh 60. It's also one of the best rogue vs rogue builds.
---

---
As far as dagger builds, this is the anti-mage build. Requires much more gear and is fun once you get a really GOOD dagger. Don't touch it for awhile. This is the build you see people like Perplexity run. In duels they grab ruthlessness, for world pvp remorseless attacks is better so that you can burst more reliably when outnumbered.

How are you going to manage herb and mining at the same time since you cannot "find herbs" and "find mines" at the same time. Swap around every fee sec with a macro?
---
He
---
Llui
---
Thankfully I will play with a lot of friends, and since vanilla is VERY community driven, you'll get around the GS-factor by joining a guild and making friends  :) So I don't think it'll have as much impact as it had in TBC and later expansions.
---
lol i know theres like 20 fucking totems. you need a good mouse with buttons to play them well and still half the totems are useless. oh and having to buff lighting shield and windfury all the time sucks but i still love them first class i got to 60 with back in the day.
---
Feralas always seemed super mysterious to me, but I never spend much time there, due to a perceived lack of quests. I'm itching to go back and explore that zone in-depth.
---
I would've loved to.  I started playing in the burning crusade and this expansion sparked my love for this game for over 13 years. It would've been amazing to try to recreate this first time with the game, journey experience.
---
My roommate, who got me into WoW in the first place, played a bybrid type hunter and regularly punked on melee dudes after they closed. I remember watching in awe as people flipped out when they got smanged by a "melee hunter". I ended up rolling my own to mirror him but went MM instead. Still I'll always be jealous of those duels he had.
---
The exact nature of sharding. How many hours, which zones, will it effect servers that come out after launch day?
---
Think i will start with a hunter just like my very first character, but then ill roll something that i never played in vanilla - either shaman or warrior (horde side - also new for me) as main not yet decided yet.
---
i saw a good tip, to level your "farmer" and keep it about 10 levels+ of your real main so you can offload green BoEs to your main and swap regularly to "rest" the other toon gaining rested XP.
---
I can't wait to start farming for my banana gear. Thunderfury does seem a bit of a stretch though for paladins...
---
Shaman because only evil horde players could be shaman!
---
Oh wait, you said ”played"...
---
Maybe hunter? Wasn't a fan of them.
---
Do you remember Newo? He is one of my mates IRL from school and got Field Marshall, pretty sure him and a few others joined Aventura.
---
Hunter it bored the shit out of me, i tried in vanilla made it to 40 deleted it, tried on pservers cant seem to make it past 40, its just to booring auto shotting and playing the sims with pets.
---
There are many problems with SV. One is how much you loose. BM is obviously the strongest leveling spec because it honestly got everything. It is the highest damage by far, it makes your pet way stronger at tanking and you gain a stun.
---
Alternatively, whenever you gain a strong (and slow) ranged weapon, you could go MM for Aimed Shot. At least it is viable, but it is a big problem that your damage will fall a lot whenever your weapon isn't really strong, and there are just not enough strong ranged weapons throughout leveling for it to be worth it.
---
Then we have SV. So, you loose both a lot of survivability for your pet and a lot of damage for your pet. Also, you loose the stun. Now, what do you get? Well, overall the dmg is worse, so you need to look for utility differences. at 31 you get a Wyvern Sting and you get more health yourself. The health is useless compared to buffing your pets health and Wyvern Sting is useless too. Sure, you can CC someone for 12 seconds if you pull too many, but with BM your pet is so much stronger that it can survive an additional enemy *and* shred the enemies way faster. Also, BM gets things like improved revive pet.
---
TL:DR; BM grants more dmg and is more defensive with more QoL - all around a win. MM grants more dmg, so better. SV grants nothing useful.
---
Weeeeeell so far they have added sharding and Loot Trading to save money, on a 14y old game that will cost 160+ usd/year to play, while a handfull of enthusiasts did their best and did it for free on p-servers while Blizzard said "you think you do but you dont" for 10 years. So its not strange that people have different expectations and will tolerate different things.
---
Be in touch please, if you'll found any .zmd Mod profile fitting for this keyboard
---
I got some files from Zboard Merc, but they're not working totally.
---
Will try to spent a time in March to customize them, maybe it may help finally, I don't know.
---
I only need to know one thing.  
---
Will things I unlock in Classic be available in the collections in Retail?
---
Chests tend to be in predictable and visible places.
---
Why do I feel like the 9 minutes 30 seconds at the bottom of your screenshot is actually your latency with all them addons... just had flashbacks to half a screen with every heal downrank possible and the upper half was maybe half grid half and corehound that I pulled since I couldn’t see where I was walking... 
---
As long as I can type Thunderfury and Anal, I'm good
---
&gt;Lots of people paid zero attention to how long leveling took
---
Well, yes and no - i did not rush but i did keep an eye on some other guildies leveling their first toon at the same time so i could keep up and we could do dungeons together. Made things more enjoyable and also you had time to go exploring instead of trying to push for another level. The world was so big then.
---
Tyr's Hand in EPL.
---
I was close to being level capped but didnt reached it. So Ive never seen that famous world pvp/ farming spot.
---
Winterspring.
---
Never seen that place when vanilla was current. It got a far away relexing fibe to it. Seems like a chill place to farm.
---
Lots of zones, I sort of fell into a pattern of leveling alts and never really deviated that much.
---
Badlands, Desolace, stone talon, searing gorge, burning step. More obvious ones like deadwind pass etc of course.
---
Nothing. TBC was by far my most favorite expansion, but I would love if Classic was the "end" of the road. Keep it there for as long as possible, to allow people to enjoy the MMO as it was.
---
Nah, watching him blindly kite a warrior for 5 minutes only to it to die to a spider respawn was just riveting.
---
Nah don't worry about hemo as a buff. It's a PVP spec. If you are leveling with a group of friends you can stay combat the whole time. Combat is in no way bad leveling, but if you leveling alone on a pvp server hemo is a nice option. One thing to remember is that on some of these private servers we had 10-15,000 people compared to real Vanilla 3000 on a single server, so STV was complete AIDS, which is why hemo was so nice in STV.
---
Combat is the raid and dungeon spec. It isn't until post AQ gear anything else is really decent. 
---
The reason swords are so good in 1.12 is in patch 1.8 or 1.9 they buffed the sword proc to work with Sinister Strike. In real Vanilla WoW daggers wasn't that bad. Thrash blade is actually REALLY good as combat when you first get it. It's borderline broken for pve/dungeon dps and you are going to destroy instances as a rogue with it in the 40's.
---
Now there is one thing we don't know. In real vanilla WoW and on private you don't want to clip the autoswing with SS because it can proc a sword swing. In TBC that was done away with. It will be interesting to see if the modern client does away with that min/max or not. It's probably like 5-10 percent more dmg on any given fight that you can lose out on.
---
&gt; "- authenticity of private servers"
---
Wrong boss scaling, you can abuse reset camp out of dngs, that was not a thing in vanilla, lets bring up lupos here, to early honorsystem.
---
there is so much that the private servers have wrong about "vanilla" we could discuss this for a long time.
---
That was a completely different kind of product.
---
Hahaha. My younger brother was so eager to be involved and so terrible that when frequently gave him rudimentary instructions on how to farm ore or mobs and left him to his devices. I also told him to give brief replies to whispers so people didn't think I was botting. Hey he was happy and so was I but I still feel a bit bad about it.
---
The Orc campaign was really cool! To see the old places like The Swamp of Sorrows, Grand Hamlet, and even Dead Mines!!
---
Im looking forward for the Human campaign. And after that its gonna be Warcraft 2!

I haven't found any good videos explaining hunter pvp, but I have been playing a 60 hunter and PvPing alot. I watched PvP videos to learn from. The best ones are definatly these two players: Myskillkills: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCN6OClqDNY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCN6OClqDNY)
---
and Corossity:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4gsk4MNn0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4gsk4MNn0k)
---
They have abit differnet playing styles, but alot to learn from both of them.
---
PS: Hunters are insane in vanilla PvP if you can play them.
---
They should be in Z-engine directory, I think.
---
Because old working way lying in downloading through Z-engine prepared by Ideazon keybindings  files .zmd for long list of games.
---
Zboard Merc may working by default, as I understood, without this files, it may be called like extended functionality.
---
But for keyboard from description, these files are strictly necessary for using second default keyset from the package (battefly-like keyset) and for EVERY additionaly bought game-specific keysets, like for WoW.
---
Another expect and upset thing, that zmd files from Zboard Merc doesn't fit to this keyboard (keyboard has name ZBD101). These files may be keeps the same file structure, but doesn't working as is and Z-Engine doesn't load them.
---
By looking at the retail content over the years I'd say no. I don't want to see anything new. Let me play an old game I love to play. 
---
Sneak around like a true crack head rogue and pick pocket all your quail lol
---
Found the Tauren!
---
Hunter got the most complex pve rotation 😂 have fun spamming frostbolts 
---
Blacksmithing requires a lot of investment, both in time and gold. You are right, and everyone knows that.
---
However, to say that Blacksmithing in Vanilla is not rewarding...it is short-sighted.
---
My first character created in WoW was a Warrior (who was my main since) and I chose Mining / Blacksmithing as professions. I never dropped Blacksmithing on it.
---
There are LOADS of plans in Vanilla that make Blacksmithing a good gold making profession, second to Alchemy. 
---
&gt; What made blacksmithing a worth while proffesion, especially considering i can just get somebody to craft the items i need as there is no *blacksmith only* requirements? 
---
And you, and MANY others like you, will surprisingly realize that Blacksmiths in Vanilla, will NOT reply to your "LF BS, need X craft", and those that will, will ask a hefty fee in gold.
---
Vanilla Blacksmiths sell their crafts in AH, and most people will BUY those crafts from AH. There are very slim chances that you will find a Blacksmith (or one of its alts) in a city when you are asking for a craft, because most (if not ALL) Blacksmiths are also Miners and Warriors.
---
They will be most likely MINING and farming stuff, and not linger in a city. They will have their crafted stuff in AH, exceptions are high-end BS recipes (like Lionheart Helm, Titanic Leggings, FR gear, Nightfall, etc.), but contrary to popular opinion (which helped me making heaps of gold in WoW) high-end BS recipes do  not make as much gold as mid-tier BS recipes.
---
I am not going to tell you how to make gold with BS in Vanilla, because, well, competition.
---
But trust me on this : after Alchemy, BS is the most profitable profession in Vanilla.
---
better than beeing a tranq and aurabot, in raids haha
---
I think they should see how successful it is and if it's a huge success they should soft reboot the modern game/do WoW 2. TBC is not Vanilla WoW. They are completely different games. Vanilla is a game about the world and crafting and world pvp and space and BG's and time between everything with slow progression. TBC is about two minigames. Arena and Raiding and they even have different gear with different stats. Nothing else really matters. The modern game IS TBC. It's what evolved from TBC and that's because Brack was brought in on TBC. It's balanced around 3 v 3 Arena and Hardcore raiding and nothing else works right. TBC is when AV died and WPVP, not modern WoW. A lot of people just started in TBC so they still have fond memories of the VANILLA leveling experience and maybe raiding Kara, which was just a really good raid.
---
Making TBC Classic just competes with the same product they already have. With Classic they have a chance to see what people want. Do they want a game focused around raiding and a small pvp esport or do they want a game with a lot of old school MMO design still left in it, where the world was the main feature. 
---
They can take group finder and add attunements to the modern game right now. They have done that with Mythic dungeons **The game still sucks.**
---
Don't worry, after a few weeks/months the LFR mentality will weed itself out.
---
I’m levelling a mage first and my alt will be a warrior. That way I can just buy heirloom gear (white and grey gear with big enchants) along with epic/rare boe items at certain levels to make the whole thing a breeze 
---
NO!
---
This has been answered so many times.
---
i still dont enjoy it, its not complex when leveling, you send pet, start auto attack go get a coffey, while you check on how your "sims" are doing on happiness, then you go and grab a new pet to get next ability. its not enjoyable to me, spamming frostbolt is more 
---
but Naxxramas was in the game in 1.12. And it's almost certain that it won't be upon release. They were even considering making non-connected flight paths.
---
I think Paladin can be quite fast comparatively because early game most classes don't have many abilities yet, so the "full ability suite" of Seal + Judge from the Paladin doesn't really slow it down in comparison. Additionally, the Paladin is quite tanky with mail armor and has good sustain with a heal, so downtime is minimal compared to a Rogue for example.
---
What spec so you play
---
Sure personal choice is personal choice. Just found it funny that you specifically pointed out the attack rotation as boring while it’s the most complex in the game. 
---
I have one, stole it from some chump who left it in a bathroom.
---
Shaman. Too many spells. I like a clean up. Totems are annoying and the class fantasy is inferior to druid.
---
This was probably in vanilla the reason for so many raid-alliances. Guilds that could not get 40 man together reached out to each other and formed a 40-man raid group made up out of several guilds. I remember this was working quite  well actually.
---
Really?  
---
Then I have missed the memo.  
---
Seriously, I haven't find any info about it. What was the answer?  
---
(Not trying to flame or anything, believe me!)

---
Bad undertuned privat servers dont count.....
---
Sad times man :(
---
Once Classic is out for like 1.5 years, ALL TBC babies will no longer ask for TBC.
---
They are asking it now, because they didn't got "infected" with the Vanilla virus back in the day, but once they play Classic for a good while, they will realize WHY 90% of Vanilla veterans reject TBC.
---
They will get the "virus".
---
It’s probably fair to say that over all aspects mage got an edge in pvp. Open world is where I would hunters ahead 
---
That's true, but I'm quite sure we can't really mix lvling and quest content with end game progression release schedule. I'm quite certain that all quests that were avalible in 1.12 will be there, they've not said anything that would disprove of that.
---
And keeping up "content progression" for single quests etc will be quite a hard and unnecessary task.
---
But I do understand your point, more information on exactly how the gameplay, patch, progression, itemization etc will be would make all the players happier and more contempt. If you know, you can prepare for it (or accept it, if it wasn't something you liked).
---
The communication from Blizzard  can be a bit better, but it's a part of their marketing style. Always have been. Keep people guessing and creating hype without putting a dime into it.
---
This is so true, oh the nostalgia with the "run while kneeling after loot" lag/bug/whatevs.
---
&gt;meta
---
Nothing. Eternal Classic ftw.
---
A bug that trancends language.
---
Yes, you could equip normal weapons and a ranged one - you could not shoot anything within 5 yeards or so - so as soon as something/one closed in you had to sable it down instead :D 
---
LOOK!! People were OOM!!! What a sign to see.
---
well most things are complex when you bring it to that level. hamstring kite between auto attacks as warrior, Juggle fear as warlock, /sit stack when reckoning pala, Priest mana conservation rotatation, every class has deph to it. Just because you need to "time" your autoshots between attacks dont mean its the most complex thing.
---
Right, each of WoW keysets had an all regular alphabetical buttons.
---
Methodology aside, I have never once been in a serious guild that afforded a debuff slot to S:WP, SM/Ruin using corruption would be very much superior to having SWP because of the 4% for instant SB, which can proc ISB (which is a decent raid dps increase) and of course get the 100% crit bonus from ruin.
---
Always played nelf hunter but going to roll horde probably this time.. I love the shadowmeld, it helped me sooo many times to hide or ambush.. Will I be disappointed rolling horde with this in mind?!
---
Send pics
---
You know anyone that had this keyboard back in the day was a complete noob. Love it
---
I really want to play a warrior, my only problem with it is that I don't like to be dependant on others. For almost everything you need a healer to excel. I like to be able to do things alone. For me the challenge of, say, getting my MC attunement solo is fun. Or downing an instance boss solo, etc. 
---
But still, Fury warrior is what I really want to play in PvE
---
Ugh they removed dwarf mage in beta because horde had less combos. It was dumb. Just let orcs be mages too.
---
Ehh ... yes, brainlag -_-
---
Well it doesnt work on raidbosses sadly. Also I wouldnt be sure if its worth it. Prolly would be if you stack on physical DPS
---
Seems like it's only an issue post-vanilla (nether rays etc). Not sure if there's any caster pet in vanilla at all.
---
Going from 1-10 on my warrior I died probs like 30 times. Mostly due to 2 mobs attacking, other times I pulled a mob train or two.
---
So he's playing like he should then? Or do you expect him to waste his mana on throwing in might between freedom and sacrfice?
---
Need a 400 iq to aim and multishot between autos.
---
I hope they emulate this bug too for authentic experience, or else is gon be unplayable /s
---
You underestimate the amount of single men floating around these parts.
---
I'd prefer it. 
---
In fact, I would not put time into Classic if I knew there was going to be a TBC server down the line. 
---
Just because the models were cartoony (which I like, its WoW's shtick)
---
The thing I am still saying is that what they made it up with was more realistic and not playdoughy. Its difficult to explain, its not how the bodies are made to look (huge forearms) its what they chose to make it look like. 
---
Probably mage. I've leveled every class to 60 (some with regular XP rates and some with higher), and for me mage had the most boring leveling experience, especially on a server where it's too populated to AoE grind successfully. And also definitely the most boring in raids. 
---
The only thing I like about them is being able to teleport all over the world. Worth having a mage alt just for the portals
---
Sadly mongoose and stuff doesnt proc for ferals.
---
Also the damage/threat gain is so minimal in TBC, if you do an area pull with prehot yourself + Hurricane and having thorns active ... will do more than enough for dungeons. And for raids ... well Paladins will be prioritized heavily.
---
But well, if you dont have any one to give / sell it to, just Keep it then - its your decision in the end.
---
then maybe rouge or hunter is your choice, its kinda the "solo" classes of vanilla
---
Yeah warrior leveling certainly requires a lot of caution with your pulls and placement in order to not aggro more than one at a time
---
Instead of writing everything I suggest you watch this https://youtu.be/KgC9Tb2g6Kc
---
It's more focused around PvP but the same mentality can be followed by pve too.
---
As an example I'm currently playing a mage which is pve focused on a TBC server, my rotation pretty much consists of fireball and scorch plus a macro that has my trinkets/cooldowns but I've still keybind everything I need to use even occasionally so when I need them I don't have to go "oh shit", I just press my button. In modern wow you have a lot less to keybind so it should be even easier for you to find your binds. Here's some screenshots in and out of raid to see what I'm talking about. http://imgur.com/a/r1k8zEx
---
Thats sort of my hangup, I like to pvp, but I also want a interesting class to raid with( IE not one button classes like warlock and mage, even though they are fun in pvp I don't know if I can raid for 2 years as one)  so that pve isn't boring, so I kinda want to do a melee dps, rogues aren't so hot in premade pvp, and warriors aren't great solo.
---
&gt;This is not a business-oriented project though, but a passion-oriented project
---
Exactly, everyone knows if you brand a project as 'passion', fiduciary responsibility ceases to be a legal factor.  
---
When I first started it I learned that quick. I've since gotten pretty good at knowing distance for aggro just eyeballing it, but there's always miscalculation without aggro addons
---
you need eyes or an addon. not IQ
---
Thought about it, also leaning towards Hunter and Druid. Like the idea of being a HoTW specced druid, and be able to heal raids, tank dungeons, farm solo, do PVP, etc. 
---
It is during the leveling phase when the true warriors are separated from the weak ones 👀💀
---
No idea about pvp, but I think HoJ and Blackhands is still better or equal.
---
The weak shall reroll, the strong will raid.
---
For raiding yeah, leveling though getting frostbite procs + shatter crits is way more satisfying imo
---
I got one for Christmas when I was like 16, loved it, what a piece of shit mine was though, keys where clunky af.
---
Not true, since these changes fundamentally change the game.
---
Pruned abilities, forced personal loot completely changes the game and is not what so ever player burnout driven, neither is flying or anything which I mentioned in this post.
---
Warriors and Rogues have no competition when it comes to dps. All top end private server guilds stack wars and Rogues. If you want to be the strongest raid possible it's simply the only way. They scale more than any other class and benefit more from potions and world buffs than any other class. Plus their gear is just better. They don't want to tank because it's frustrating and usually the group member that gets blamed for everything that goes wrong. People don't want that responsibility.
---
So yes, I fully expect 40% of every server to be Warriors and Rogues, and only a small percentage will be tanks.
---
Can’t wait to watch. I’m between lock, hunter, mags myself. I would be a lock in a heartbeat if they didn’t require all of the extra work before raiding :( I don’t have enough free time to raid hardly, let alone gather soulstones for everyone and be one of the first to log in and summon everyone you know :/ and I keep reading their rotation is literally like shadow bolt only?
---
well if you think its that hard, im happy you "figured" it out. i cant keep haveing this discussion if you are hellbent on this beeing the "hardest" thing ever.
---
for some of us, it is not. other things are harder
---
For me the problem recently has become the internal struggle between "I want what I had" and "I want to try what I wanted instead back then" .....
---
Well you left out the most important part, what spec! Resto your pretty much gonna be limited to jump runs with a warrior or herbing/mining etc. Feral you can solo some stuff, same with moonkin.
---
damn this gets me amped to play, old vids like this inspiration as fuck
---
I was at a bar a while ago and started talking with a chick. When I admitted I used to be  a gamer, she asked which game. When I said I was hooked to WoW, her eyes went wide. "No shit!!! Me too!". Then I said I was going to play it again, she went "WAITING FOR CLASSIC!!! VANILLA WAS THE BEST!" 
---
They do exist! (I'm 45, she's 36)... Will soon see her again in another bar \^\^
---
Hunters have an interesting PvE rotation, and are great solo and in PVP :) Could be an option?
---
Uh thanks for reminding me to check for some mechanical keyboards and a new mouse. 
---
When it is our summer (NA), it is SA's winter. 
---
All rotations in vanilla are in modern standards very easy. Just in comparison hunter has the most complex as you have to weave in aimed shots and multishots on cd in between your autoshots without clipping them by bad timing while for something like mages you spam 1 button.
---
Again, I’m not questioning your distaste for hunters I just found it funny that you based it on their attack rotation. 
---
It was sarcasm, I was on your side, regrettably.
---
Ima go skinning + engi from start, then switch skinning to herb (or maybe tailoring first cuz I’m maining a mage)
---
There are at least 1000 threads  and polls about this and counting. People want tbc obviously. Cant you guys just do some research if there is already a post existing about this?
---
Warlock, I genuinely enjoy the interactions they have from portals to greater demon summons soulstones healthstones hellfire curses fears drains, love it all to bits and I genuinely feel they have one of the most underrated aesthetics in vanilla.
---
Except for the feeling that I am always stuck in mud while everyone zips about the world like ninjas and that was a massive deal breaker for me same with paladin and even warrior (Though it's not so bad in combat)
---
Interestingly I dont experience this with mage even though movement wise blink isn't anything special I find it immensely enjoyable and as sad as it is I am actively looking forward to hitting shift space every single blink cooldown. 
---
ow no i dont base hunters beeing boring because of rotation, you did that asumtion, i just think its overall booring, with all the pet stuff and playing "sims" with it. and the fact that mobs die from you just attacking and afk:ing. Sure we can weave in rotation in it, to make it more intressting, but it dont "tickle my bone" even with focusing on it.
---
Don't forget the helm and Titanic Leggings. Every Fury will sell their left nut for these.
---
I'll be a Tauren shaman, so I'll do herbalism and skinning until a higher level, then eventually switch over to alchemy when I have enough monies. 
---
So I think I’ve landed on being a Healer for Classic. 
---
I’ll have more limited time to play than I did back in the day and I’d like to be able to find groups quickly. 
---
I’m probably mostly going to be doing dungeons and battlegrounds, with a little raiding here and there. Nothing super serious, just kind of casual and having a good time. 
---
Out of all of the healing classes, which ones would suite the best for me? (Including both pally and shaman)
---
Paladin. Horrible class during vanilla. Powerful, and nearly unlikable in PVP with Naxx gear, but god awful to level and was relegated to healbot like Druids, but unlike Druids their other specs had no merit. Other than Kings. Druid has 3% crit for spells or melee at the bottom of its offspec trees.
---
I feel like all other classes were for ahead of Paladins at every stage of vanilla in terms of class design and fun. They relied on dumb mechanics to be useful...I'm sorry but Blessing of Light is just terrible game design.
---
I have thought about it, but they have always felt clunky to me, feeding pets, arrows, deadzone, fd/trap, shots triggering other shots cooldowns, mana dependant etc.
---
Not that they are bad by any means, just not sure they are for me.
---
You are not alone. I don’t think Ill ever get one char to 60 because I really want to play: warrior, hunter, paladin, druid, shaman and warlock :(
---
same lol
---
Wasn't Cash shop confirmed to not be in classic? I could be wrong, but I seem to remember it 
---
Hey thanks man! Really enjoyed your episode! By the time I hit 60 in Vanilla, BC had already been announced so I didn’t get to do much raiding other than Ony, MC, and first few bosses of BWL in pugs. It was cool to hear want being a cutting edge raider was like back in the day. 
---
haha im sorry, i dont "read" sarcasm good,  but it feels good knowing im not alone, haha
---
Mining/Blacksmithing
---
Some would say it is just lik in the real military. 
---
Yea right... "prevent" ganking..
---
I had one, tried it for a week, then went back to a normal keyboard lol
---
The 2 LED USB lights you could plug into were cool tho
---
Gonna make a Pala for tf and druid for the mace, just to trigger people 
---
I had to buy a new mmorpg mouse because the wow mouse I had stopped working after 10 yrs, sadly they stopped making the wow mouse and the only ones I could find were very expensive sold by people on eBay. 
---
I am not a lawyer, google is your friend 
---
It is especially good on a (horde) tank warrior for fights like Mandolin,  Nefarian, Onyxia and bug trio that can fear you more often (or unpredictably than your berserker rage allows for.  
---
Granted, that will also depend a lot on tuning and pserver timers may end up being different from classic ones.
---
😔
---
:(
---
" - For example i like stealth, but i also love healing and big number crits or dots ticking away their hp."
---
thats druid for you :)
---
Why don't they just kill his pally? xD
---
My first job out of university was in a management position where I had contact with every employee, some customers, suppliers, certification agencies.. helped me immensely to develop. But I hated every day of it. 
---
There a holy/ret Paly build where you won’t have to respec (often). For holy Priest you gonna need a group to complete high level quests. Maybe farm dungeons instead of herbs if you’re on a PVP server.
---
Where is Mankriks wife??
---
Dualwielding sword and axes with those green shiny agility enchands looks so damn good!
---
There is always a Thunderfury in the banana stand. 
---
Yeah exactly the same here. I'm pretty set on living my bizarre dream of playing resto druid, cos I always wanted to, I shouldn't pass up the chance.
---
I forget which patch buffed druids but after that warrior/druid was pretty ridiculous too (but you needed the druid to be really damned good at the game). I did most of my PvPing on horde and was mostly PvE when I went to alliance so I don't have a good comparison for playing with Paladins.
---
Chests can be very good, if you get lucky you can get some decent blue/green items, gold and vendor trash plus health/mana pots. Always worth it.
---
Glorious to behold  :D
---
I’m in the same boat I’ve always played both since launch (hence why I never raided in vanilla, I ran out of time).  I’m leaning Dwarf Priest leveling to 60 w/ tailoring and enchanting. I might level an alt Paly just for the fun of it, maybe to 35 for max herbalism if tailoring on my Priest isn’t making me any money and I switch to herbalism.
---
Oh look we have edgelord "bludgeonedkittens" who's upset he can't spam racist and homophobic shit in world chat without impunity. Quel surprise.
---
But aren't they all like nature and happiness? I also like darker themes and i don't really see them as such or am i wrong.
---
Ofc you can't have it all, but i guess i should try druid since it can do most of those things?
---
We might actually see this. Every casual guild should be able to farm the first bosses in MC. Or like Ramsay said: I don´t need an army, I need 20 good men. 
---
Summer in Northen Hemisphere means it will be winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season
---
**Season**
---
A season is a division of the year marked by changes in weather, ecology, and amount of daylight. On Earth, seasons result from Earth's orbit around the Sun and Earth's axial tilt relative to the ecliptic plane. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant. Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations.

Would it be worth going daggers/backstab since they would be able to hold aggro or is sword combat still way better?
---
That's what everyone does 
---
You can always play NE, some class with dot/heavy crits.
---
Better off going mining/skinning or herb skinning.
---
And enchanting isn't even that profitable.
---
fucking milk and cheese. What shitty pirate thinks this qualifies as a treasure? 
---
Is this a GoT reference? I Literally *just* saw this scene for the first time today. That is weird.
---
I have the wotlk one. Pretty shitty keyboard tbh, but it's pretty cool
---
This why you dont see many hunter videos
---
Yeah - it's Summer in Aus/NZ/BR etc right now -- and will be 'Winter' when classic launches. I doubt there is much else to read into.
---
You want gold? Take herbalism, same for every class.
---
The single most gold producing profession, especially for the average player.
---
Costs absolutely no gold to level up (aside from negligible training), doesn't require rare raid or world drops, is in demand from the very beginning to very end of server life, etc.
---
Truth be told, I think what most people will want after Classic is:
---
F R E S H   (Servers)
---
And they'll get it either via new servers or private servers. 
---
Personally? I dunno. I'm not sure I'll even be around at that point. I'll tell you in a year or two. 
---
Yeah, that's going to be a no. 
---
I envy you. Next season soon!
---
Warrior/priest and warrior/shaman are both incredible. I’d personally say warrior/priest will do you a lot of good. 
---
Tailoring can atleast make bags
---
Feral is super under-rated and can really shred in the right hands.
---
I’ve been leveling a Dwarf Priest on PS with tailoring and enchanting and the treasure tracker has been a lot of fun.
---
Yeah no point in buffing might when you're spamming freedom and sac on cd. 
---
It's not really that simple. Not having a snare means you have to react perfectly to their movements or they can run out of your range and you'll never catch them.
---
Details are here https://insuranceforcarrental.net/do-you-need-a-non-owner-car-insurance-policy
---
&gt;But aren't they all like nature and happiness?
---
Fantasy-wise, you're looking at a wild animal tearing a person to shreds with its fangs and claws for Feral. 
---
Reality is somewhat disappointing with the tuning of Vanilla, but the mental picture is not one that evokes "happiness" unless you got some really weird fetish. 
---
Feral tanking is old news, prot paladin tanking is where its at or even shaman tanking to some extent.
---
Stick with classic, opening up Pandora’s Box to BC-Wrath will give us WoD and BfA “classic” servers one day. 
---
Maybe you should go herbalism and skinning then drop skinning for alchemy past level 60 when you can afford to level it up?
---
I'm starting to panic about it to be honest. Priest, Warrior, Hunter, Rogue or Shaman.  I've got it narrowed down to those. Very much enjoy them all.
---
I know one thing for sure, if I start messing around with alts before I get my main (whichever that is) to max level I'm fooked in endless altaholic mode.
---
I really hope they implement some minor QoL stuff to weed out the hardcore nochange classic purists.  
---
My dealbreaker would be LFR, and an automated dungeon finder, or flying mounts. Basicly what you've already stated. Aside from that, nothing really bothers me tbh.  
---
But I'm probably opposite on the spectrum, as I don't really see myself playing too long if they don't change stuff haha, so leaving classic as the kinda unbalanced mess it was would be too annoying at some point, but I'll just wait and see :)
---
but WHAT DOES IT MEAAAAN???
---
I always did mining and engineering on my warlock. The spell goggles that can give +36 shadow damage was amazing! Plus one time I one hit KO'd a level 60 with the death ray and I was at level 48
---
I would be happy to discuss this further if you are still interested.
---
So isnt Vanilla WoW! Nice user name :P
---
Flying that killed World PvP, continent that is worse than EK and Kalimdor, arena, insanely linear dungeons, blood elves, draenei, daily quests, etc. TBC is the reason why WoW became as bad as it is. Expand from Classic itself, don't go to an expansion and kill the old world again.
---
I still have my WotLK version in my drawer. Back then i never got it to work, so it was basically a waste of money for me, lol
---
OP I remember obtaining the lightforge helmet. It looked so cool, like a scarlet crusader piece. 
---
I still remember the disappointment when they turned it into a turban a couple of patches later .... :(
---
 &gt; It would have to be this way, character copy would be too open to abuse
---
Exactly. 
---
Ex. Whole guild gives me all their money, i now have 500,000 gold. I use character copy to BC. My character on BC now has 500,000 gold. On classic, I give back all the money to my guild. The next guildy does the same thing.
---
Infinite money???
---
Outside of the few try hard guilds on each server, most guilds will be taking any warm body to make a 40 man raid. Just make sure when you show up you don't embarrass yourself. Because you will end up embarrassing half the other DPS.
---
„It’s just too boring Auto shooting“
---
tearing person to shreds can also be a form of happiness in a way. 
---
Im starting to warm up to the druid more now
---
Everybody calm down. There’s plenty of time to decide and no one says you have to have just one 60.
---
In fact, back in Vanilla i had a guildie who had three 60s.
---
They were all warriors, now that i remember it.
---
All arms.
---
Ok. Not the best example; still we will have plenty of time to screw around in vanilla,
---
same for me. i would definetally use an ah app, but i dont think it would be healthy for the game if there would be one.
---
If anything this shows that herbs are sold under value. 
---
Shaman. I love the idea of it but playing it is an absolute pain.
---
Well we got about 3+ months to decide what class to main since then its summer.
---
You could also go shaman as main, because they can heal and do some melee things too.
---
For me it was receiving the single-shoulder piece from Scarlet Monastery. Can't remember the name or which boss it was but holy crap i felt like i finally made it.
---
~~I mean i was a total noob and even had intellect gear on~~
---
I WAS A WARRIOR
---
&gt;forum
---
&lt;3
---
There is telling. It won't work.
---
Maybe AH would be too much for me but guild communication/calendar/armory/ sounds good.
---
Did you have to post this again. It was asked 7 times yesterday.
---
I’ve heard it’s extremely good for Druid flag carriers. 
---
If all fails you can give yourself an innervate. 
---
I had it, but I threw it out last year cus the roof leaked and trashed it. Man that thing was sucky to actually use, looked great though.  
---
Filthy whor.. de
---
I think 3000 is fine honestly.  
---
I can either play a class i want and accept the massive amount of deaths (because i want to play on RP/PVP) or play a class i don't want and be able to have fun with opvp. 
---
And you could always RP to be a druid who is looking to learn more into the path of the worgen. Looking to become maybe the next Alpha Prime. 
---
Can't wait to roll a warrior in vanilla mannnnnn
---
Hunter could have been somewhat slower than expected due to the taming thing, getting food, putting in all kind of new bindings for the pet and having to run to the vendors more often because bags are full. It requires more micromanagement in early stages.
---
Orc is the superior pvp race no matter which class. Nothing beats hardiness period
---
Because it’s such a time investment choices will matter again 😃
---
This. I also take riposte while leveling. Does a lot of damage and disarms the mob. Even if they don’t have a wep it still does the damage. Tbh I don’t use SnD unless I have a few mobs at once.
---
You can 3 man kill mandokir to farm the mount right when the Raid launches. 
---
None. Give me classic
---
EPIC blue poster DUNKS ON and EVISCERATES dumb toxic PRIVATE SERVER BABBY
---
Mythix are TBC mhm /s
---
I'm guessing you mean on retail. 
---
Just what the old Armory app was...
---
That's a lot of work.
---
Retail classic yes
---
We had an enhancement shaman on a private server we played on, he even had the advantage of WF being bugged, adding attack power to your character sheet for a second rather than adding the extra AP onto the attacks, which meant he could get WF level stormstrikes as well if he timed it right.
---
He used potions, jujus, flasks, runes, anything you can think of, on a tank n spank like 3 drakes in BWL he'd be peaking at 450-500 DPS, and then drop towards 350-400 at the end of it. My fury warrior would be threat limited, but usually in the 1000-1200 range. 
---
Luckily vanilla isn't designed to be edge of the knife hard and you can indeed get away with those numbers. However this is also the difference between raiding 19:00-23:00 3 nights a week to clear MC, BWL and maybe a ZG, or raiding 20:00-23:00 one night and clear MC BWL and ZG. 
---
On the aforementioned private server we'd generally be done with MC in 40 minutes, BWL in 35, and ZG in 30. This meant that even as Naxx was released we could clear all content while spending less scheduled time in raids than the guild who's still progressing BWL, leaving time for alt-raids and BG premades and general consumable farming.
---
I'm not saying fuck all hybrid DPS players, i simply ask for the introspection to understand why a portion of the community wants nothing to do with them in a raid enviornment, because it's like everyone training and bringing all their equipment for that grand important hockey game, and Timmy the goalie decides that he'll play that game blindfolded because he would find it more fun, others might agree and all put on a blindfold and have a laugh, whilst some would want Timmy off the bloody team as he's not remotely trying to do his best.
---
TBC fixed to make Azeroth still relevant thx.
---
Agreed but Hammer of Wrath, Divine Shield and Repentance are awesome
---
I would highly doubt they are gonna put heirlooms in classic. Unless this has been posted for sure. Heirlooms we're not introduced til later in TBC
---
You can also root+wrath any elite mob you wouldn't be handle in bear (some same-level elites just hit too hard for your furry butt to switch/heal). So I just root. Wait till 6 seconds left, wrath twice, root again, repeat for a couple of minutes until mob is at 25% health, then go bear and finish.
---
Urgh. No I don have phonez
---
Nost used very different server architecture. Blizzards use of microservers scares me for Classic open world raids
---
Shaman seemed nice but turned out to be not fun. For me.
---
Lemme get her number
---
I think it was, they just added maybe it will come later on like back in the day with server transfers and stuff.
---
#nochange
---
That was my dream as a pala who didn’t get past 43 in vanilla ( started in AQ, but was in med school at the time and couldn’t invest much time), when they added an NPC at SW gates wearing that armour... just made me want to do more and seemed so out of reach and so elite. Now I know it’s not even BiS for any spec and I’ll be better off wearing Druid leather shoulders to heal better.  This time around I will be making a run for the dungeon set no matter what though, while wearing clown healing gear 
---
I know that... I’m saying the white gear with enchants on it such as the skinning knife with fiery weapon will act as the heirloom gear 
---
They mentioned they don't want people to play classic just to get transmog and that's why there is no transfer over to retail for anything. The 2 games will be seperate with no connection.
---
I had one of these bad boys must of been 2005. Think I still have one or two of the interchangeable innards somewhere 
---
Gotcha :)
---
Yep hemo is fine for levelling, especially on a PVP server (where you'll be hiding from hunters a lot while moving between places) or if you want to PVP as well. If it's a higher level mob I use kidney strike to avoid damage and occasionally kite with crippling while waiting for my energy to regen. Rupture often does more damage than eviscerate (time how long it takes to kill a mob so you don't waste any) so I often like to use it as the last few ticks can help kill a mob while it runs away and stop it from pulling others.
---
I only open from stealth once I learn Distract and if I was playing combat I wouldn't bother. The 4th tier sub talents make it too good to miss, the spec is based around stealth so would be silly to take without constantly using cheap shots.
---
Guys!
---
Owners of particularly this model is looking for any working keybindings profile file (.zbd xml-like file) Ideazon also called them MODs)
---
If you have any of them please write me here/private and upload file wherever.
---
I'd love a classic loot lookup app man
---
Don't care about the rest
---
Found mine 2 weeks ago, i was gonna post it too! 
---
Remember, whining retards are what destroyed the game. We can't let it happen a second time.
---
They can be a nice source of greens but most of the time they contain a piece of cheddar or a grey pair of gloves because the last person to find them didn't empty them.
---
I've never played dwarf in vanilla though so who knows, there may be many more I could have looted that I didn't notice.
---
:'( 
---
I feel you. Been thinking about that quite a bit.   
---
I used to main a shaman and a rogue back in the day. I kinda want to go shaman again but unless spec'd resto, he kinda sucks (13 year old me wasn't too aware of the meta back in the day).  
---
I'm always more the underdog / prove them wrong person, but classic is really limited, and a lot has been done on PServers that show, closing the gap isn't really a thing. But I dislike rolling FOTM...which excludes quite some classes as well.  
---
So I'm constantly stuck in the loop of, do I want to be really useful, but don't want to heal, also being the underdog and in best case, have an interesting rotation, and suddenly, no class is left haha.  
---
Only class that fits the role kinda is druid. If you want to farm 15 crowd pummelers in gnomeregan every week in addition to every other consumable known to mankind. And that's probably just too much effort for the output.  
---
I'll probably go rogue again, casters are a snooze fest in PvE (Hello frostbolt my old frieeend) and rogues rock in pvp.  
---
But who knows, I might torment myself with shaman again, just for the sake of it and find something hidden OP, while enjoying auto hits + frost shock every 5 seconds.  
---
Hunter can farm anything pretty much afk with 2 macros, hunters mark + send pet + auto attack as the first macro then a second shift macro for memd pet/ dps rotation
---
Mage is pretty braindead once you get into the AoE rotation, whether it's DM runs or out in the wild. I mained a Warlock back in vanilla, and always found the farming very efficient and braindead. I'd often farm Felcloth of satyrs in Felwood, and it'd basically just be running around, DoTing everything around me and draining them down. Easy and efficient
---
We need oscars for Gifs.
---
An app that shows one shitty fact about retail everyday. 
---
He said grey/white gear with end-game enchants, basically acting like heirloom...
---
I'd say hunter. If you or your pet accidentally overpulls, the pet can live a while while you take in the situation and decide what to do, whereas as a mage, you'll have to react a bit faster with sheeping to not get mauled. 
---
Once you're geared enough, easier mobs can be done on autopilot with just dot, autoattack and the pet. So that's a plus for "minimal attention" as well. 
---
So as a paladin you are guaranteed two things: that you have access to BoF, and that nobody you ever fight will have access to BoF. BoF combined with an engineering net launcher makes you immune to snares, meanwhile they are not. My case and point: Paladins don't have the same problem against other engineers, because they can negate another engineer's net.
---
dude people are fucked up
---
I hit 60 with a played time of around 15 days (paladin autohit....) , started on launch day back in 2004. I remember to grind undeads in eastern plaquelands for like 5 whole lvls. I was in top 100 to hit 60 of my whole server. I was playing 12+ hours every day, because I was 19 and on a point in my life where I just didn't know what to do in future, so I hardcore played. I also remember playing with my older brother and took my pc for like 2 month to his house, so that we can hardcore play together. He always was like 2 lvls higher then me even as a warrior but I just slept longer :D. It's fun to remember back, cause it was the best lvling experience in gaming history for me regarding game lvling and the social aspects at my brother or TeamSpeak with ppl we have formed our guild with (moved from another game as a whole guild). I don't want to miss that memories even though it was a bit too nerdy, when I look on it now (wife, 2 kids, job etc). Just my 2 cents :)
---
Arbeit Arbeit
---
bereit für Arbeit
---
Some dude brought it to a lan, he left for the bathroom and some other guy deadass stole it.
---
I have the TBC one in a box somewhere, I'm going to go find that bitch now. Thank you for reminding me! :)
---
I had a Zboard Merc.  Bought it in 2006 and was still using it up until about a year ago.  Still worked fine, but the software hasn't been supported in years.  I really hated having to retire it.
---
Aren’t the warlocks and mages then fighting over the same gear?
---
Still my current keyboard. I got a Razor Blackwidow but I still prefer the ZBoard... 
---
I felt lost after that bug was removed.
---
I still use mine on windows 7. The main aspect of it was simply that it had the default keys marked right on the keys themselves. At least for the custom ones like the Wow keyset. The gaming one was differently shaped but it was a simple bit of key mapping IIRC. And it's owned by steelseries now, they put out one version before killing it completely. I had both a ps/2 version and then a USB version, the USB version is convenient to use for my living room pc so I can plug my mouse into it. 
---
Fair enough!
---
Regarding Benediction, I remember seeing a priest with it in Vanilla and being in awe — strange how memory works. But looking at it now, isn’t it relatively short lived? You get it at the end of MC and replace it in BWL, right?
---
Drain the pallies mana, fight over
---
I remember buying this as a kid, but it was just the overlay and my mom was so pissed because game spot wouldn't take it back.
---
Damn, that sucks...  
---
Yeah still got mine. I was a mouse clicker back in the day and the macro keys on it are what really got me into using my keyboard fully. The DPS meter after each encounter thanked me. Even ended up naming an alt Z-Surfer. Because I was using the Z-Board. I Got it back in the day when I some idiot left it unattended on at a LAN event. Nicked that shit and immediately began asking about [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] in barrens chat. 
---
While wondering over the same questions I found [this extremely detailed guide](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=1043#whyblacksmithing), of which the "Why Blacksmithing" part was very convincing.
---
Except that by being able to remove the keys, it made it infinitely easier to clean. 
---
Need a 10 minute video right now. 
---
Ooh you say druid with sulfuras hand of ragnaros? How about a druid lady taking it and then crying because her guild got mad? The one and only [Retrodruid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvMK5KkLlZc)
---
Now that I think of it, were there any recipes back in the day that needed fish ? What was it used for ? I really can't recall anything haha.
---
If you're fighting mobs that die quickly, just SS and finish with Evis. If you're fights last longer, use SnD after the first or second combo point. In longer fights your white hits do the majority of your damage, so SnD is important.
---
Forget about stealth unless you actually need it to avoid mobs/enemies. It's just a waste of time, and you don't need stealth to SS. Also don't use daggers. Combat Sword spec is best for leveling, IMO.
---
&gt; Opening from Stealth is not worth it.
---
q u e s t i o n a b l e
---
garrote is 100% worth it imo. It takes off like 40% of the mobs health. You can usually stealth right next to the mob so it takes only like ~2 more seconds per mob.
---
I would go arms warrior + shaman just for the windfury totem synergy. 
---
There is few bosses that druids **CAN'T** tank, not the opposite. Like Maexxna and Huhuran. Bosses that truly need defensive CDs. They can do something else as OT anyway (Tank Adds, DPS as Kitty, Decurse/Remove Poison, build great secondary threat on the boss, serves as NR tank in Huhuran case), that's why you they are optimal as off-tank and not as main tank.
---
Quite too expensive for the quality.
---
I'd buy it if it had less retarded and more practical keysets, and illumination.
---
They only said "no in-game chash shop". But it can always be in the account management...
---
Is that because of how much they have already invested in the pserver or because of the *differences* between the pservers and classic?
---
It's actually Autumn in Australia. We follow the meteorological calendar. 
---
Blizzcon classic panel, and some other blizzcon panel too I believe.
---
"send nudes"
---
Hi eboe!
---
Glad to hear news from another still-user of this keyboard. I'm also using it under Win7, but with the default keyset only.
---
2 my others doesn't working due to lack of keybinding profiles.
---
Maybe you still have any .zmd profile file?
---
Thanks
---
I'll have two please
---
I've never had problems for finding groups. I'd say you should be fine unless you plan on playing a meme spec. 
---
&gt;I'm quite certain that all quests that were avalible in 1.12 will be there
---
including the hopeful Light (death to /u/AutoModerator!) and cloth collection?
---
No, please...
---
&gt;keeping up "content progression" for single quests etc will be quite a hard and unnecessary task.
---
not necessarily, they almost certainly have quests sorted by "date added", just like demon summoning spells.
---
&gt;The communication from Blizzard can be a bit better, but it's a part of their marketing style.
---
was definitely better before WoW released for the first time.
---
Flip phones and AIM back then pal. This gate must be kept 
---
Ahhh I totally had this! It was awesome!
---
It was a joke lol
---
Obviously mages should decurse when they need to. We have that problem in our guild where one of them is the unspoken designated decurser, and every time he’s not in the raid we’re in trouble because the other mages aren’t too keen on picking up the slack. 
---
Well for one you would need two paid accounts to have alliance and horde characters on the same server. While that alone wouldn't make this impossible, it would make it a bit more hardcore.
---
Was planning on playing discipline tanking priest or melee firestone warlock. Haven't decided 
---
Swords are steady and not a problem with aggro. Daggers are actually worse. They can be pretty good in 5 mans but the aggro is just a pain in the arse. In raiding you vanish and don't even need feint. In dungeons you can use feint.
---
I've said this to everybody that posts these kinds of queries. 
---
Play what YOU want to play. Unless you're going for hard core raiding or a world first, you WILL get a spot in raids. 
---
As far as soloing goes, who knows. I guess that'll depend on your tolerance for downtime and kill times. 
---
That would be fine for me, only bc I have a busy real life and to hit 60 with the amount of time I play will take  6-8 months if not longer. I also never got to experience end game raid content (I had one level 60 and a handful of lvl 30-40 alts in 2005 ish). So that would give me plenty of time to actually get to do the raids or high level PvP. However, don’t you think classic would die in a few years once the hardcores complete everything and stop playing? People will say, just reroll a diff class! Well, some will do that, but it would get old I’d imagine. 
---
Don't use the C-word!
---
Play what you enjoy mate. Classic doesn't need to be min maxd that much. The people who push min max are usually the people who have already done it all, including taking forever to level multiple times, and are just looking for a new way to play the game. If you're new or haven't played in over a decade, just play what you want. People in general won't care what spec a Rogue is, since they all do reasonable damage anyway. 
---
Yes of course, or make a deal with an alliance guild of say "Hey put those felheart bracers on goblin AH for 2k gold, we'll buy it, you supply us with pally buffs for X amount of raids"
---
I realize it's not quite as easily done in classic as on a private server, but the power spike I gained was absolutely insane, generally speaking vanilla's content isn't balanced around 2k DPS.
---
Hunter is the most brain dead but you're limited to one mob at a time, mage takes some practise but is the best gold farming class in the game.
---
That's good to hear, because low-level Stealth on the current pserver dujour is absolute trash. I might even roll a rogue if this turns out to be true.
---
None of that. A PC game does not need to be supported by mobile crap.
---
Probably Mining and Herbalism, gathering my ass off, later switching out mining for Engi and keep herbalism for future pots ( gotta find an alchemist).  
---
I might as well farm enough mats for engi to push into high level at once.  
---
I recently found an old piece of paper, where I've written down everything I needed to get engi 300 haha, not sure why it was still flying around :D Now that I think about it, it would've come in handy, but threw it away.
---
Remember that if they force progress vanilla to TBC they will be in the same boat they are today with people complaining and demanding vanilla. The whole point was to have vanilla forever (As long as the game servers were up) so It seems out of character for them to force progress anyone. 
---
Agree with everything except loot trading. This will mess things up, 100%.
---
What's more scary is the fact that someone can play this long without thinking "maybe i shouldn't click my spells that is kinda annoying".
---
What's the problem with playing multiple classes if it is so hard for you people to decide?
---
I also don't know for sure what i will play, but it really doesn't even bother me.
---
My experience as a healer were that Warriors had such spiky damage once they failed to land a Block, while Druids damage intake were smooth and constant.
---
Was only 15 when WoW was released so wasn't really paying attention to their marketing style before that, but afterwards they've done it like that for as long as I can remember. Stirr up hype, and when it's close to release they throw out information (and on Blizzcons since that started).
---
Well, there are thousands of quests and there's no need to try to filter them, especially since there is a good margin of error. There always is. And this is something so uncecessary it's no use to even discuss tbh :o
---
Barrens chat so I can make chuck norris jokes at work.
---
At least on 1.12 there's really nothing that can compete with a paladins mana effiency, tankiness and cc removal. 
---
Oh right! Was this before or after 1.12? Will we have dishonorable kills in Classic?
---
&gt; Stirr up hype, and when it's close to release they throw out information
---
that's how it works for all AAA games in 2019. Just look at Elder Scrolls 6...
---
The problem part is at least for me that if i want to become good with something, i can't constantly switch and get gear for every single class.
---
I think you're confusing that topic with something else honestly. The classic devs themselves told us at Blizzcon that it was thanks to the servers being very limited back in the days were the reason for the old cap and now they claim that they can increase the population cap if people wanted it.
---
We haven't heard anything else after that about the population cap, but I wouldn't be surprised if they increased it since they told us they can without issues.
---
I thought Druid was the best farmer
---
Engineering/Mining swapped to herbalism at 60.
---
Need Engineering for autoblocker, want herbalism for gold.
---
Only thing you need to do as a rogue  is to max your first aid and cooking skills, it'll save you so much time.
---
I think what you've missed is some of the interactions in that forum that actually had to be deleted because they were so hostile towards Blizzard and towards Kaivex. Someone even went out of his way to make a screechy rage thread filled with all caps and exclamation marks claiming that the desummoning thing was proof that Blizzard couldn't get Classic right. that thread did not stay up long.
---
This is gold
---
Ahh the good old blood/high elf model. Those were the days.
---
Me and my bro had one each, we had a selection of board inserts to go with them.
---
They were rubbish lol. 
---
I don't know about WHorde, since I'll play Undead I guess I'm an "Eastern Horde" aka Ehorde.
---
But I will :D
---
r/therewasanattempt
---
All? No, almost none. And ES6 is a bad example, they pushed out a small trailer to announce they're actually working on the game.
---
Look at Ubisoft, EA, Bioware etc. They throw out content, videos, gameplay, information at you. Look at Fallout 78, the entire game was a book before it was released.
---
 Blizzard concentrate all that marketing into a shorter campaign closer to release.
---
Yeah, like another touch to this brilliant MMORPG
---
I've felt the same
---
I want to say this was before Naxxramas ever came out, but it's been too long and I can't remember exactly anymore.
---
Here's hoping for those sweet sweet mini-rewinds for that truly authentic vanilla experience!
---
This was the burning crusade prepatch so after and sorry to brake it to you but dishonourable kills are still recorded in achievement statistics. 
---
&gt;However, don’t you think classic would die in a few years once the hardcores complete everything and stop playing?
---
Truth be told, most of the hardcores probably already completed everything and now only vie for who can complete it the fastest. 
---
I wouldn't worry about those. 
---
Those things are unkillable.
---
That version is still listed on NewEgg
---
Awesome guide! I love your work. This, and your other videos, have answered a lot of my questions about how to play a hunter.
---
2.0 is removal of dishonorable kills. They were just a vanilla thing.
---
10 Agi food is one. I forget the name of the fish but it's in ashzara near the center.  I think a fish needed for tank flasks comes from the same spot too if my memory serves me.
---
&gt; I think you're confusing that topic with something else honestly.
---

---

---
I think Blizzard has the more "modern" approach. There are many games that I'm not aware of, and hear of them like a week or month after release.
---
What I remember is the classic server of RIFT. I've always wanted to play it, because I loved RIFT when it first came out. And, I learned about it only by accident, because I had problems with ArcheAge patcher, and looked up TRION's help page, and that's how I learned about the classic RIFT.
---
Nothing worse than stuff like this, scum of the earth.
---
Fast attack speed on a pet is king for pvp, so go for one with 1.2 or less ideally. As for talents, I wouldn't even bother, as you'll level so bloody fast with a BM spec that messing around with other specs seems like a waste of time.
---
Druid really didn't come into its own until later  arenas with LB and cyclone, freedom/sac/cleanse are such a force multiplier with warrior it's unreal in vanilla
---
Depends on the class I play.
---
If I go Warlock, for example, I’ll want to be Eng/Tailoring ultimately, so that would require an alt. I might just wait until I’m leveling an alt with mining before even picking up Eng, and start with skinning, or I might start with mining, who knows.
---
If I go Priest, I’d like to ultimately be Alch/Tailoring I think, but again, same problem, need and alt with herbalism to make that work, which means I’ll start with a different combo to save for my mount — perhaps skinning and Tailoring or skinning and herbalism.
---
So I will likely be attempting due to the Casual Status of my weekly play to try and play feral, I think that I'll enjoy that more with the option to OT as Bear, than I would switching between Resto and Feral on a regular Basis. 
---
The items I will need to farm weekly are as a baseline;
---
Major Mana Potions (Enough for the Current Highest Tier Content)
---
Dark Runes/Demonic Runes (Enough for the Current Highest Tier Content)
---
Flask of Titans/Distilled Wisdom (Enough for the Current Highest Tier Content)
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler (One Per Boss Minimum)
---
Enough Gold for Minimum of 2 Respec's Just Incase
---
Mara farm on hunter is the most chill thing ever (at worst you can't chat by text while kiting princess if mm spec) and rakes in solid gold per hour. Trib farm requires respeccing, consumables, and concentration on the other hand.
---
Congrats on finally becoming a man and not a NElf child ;) Jk man play what you want if you want to be an Alliance scum that is fine.
---
*laughs in mage*
---
Does that not mean that it is more competitive? Although I'm assuming no more/less competitive than Skinning for example.
---
honestly, warrior farming is one the most braindead. so do you even need an alt? especially once you get some gear. no need to track mana or health most of the time either, anything pretty much,  some healing from fury talents is enough to keep you up, just charge from mob to mob, spaming couple of buttons and autoattacks killing the mobs. for instance, farming fulborgs in winterspring. 
---
both mage and hunter (with their popular farming methods) require attention. especially mage, require a lot of precision. hunter require attention doing solo instances runs, but if you just farm mobs its super low attention aswell. but why do you need a hunter just to farm mobs, if you got your warrior.
---
On an older server with lots of gold they may be great money makers. Good luck making anything worth your time in the first six months of a server. I'd rather use two professions that help PVE or PVP and have my main or alt a spec capable of farming DM. 
---
Priest I can't stand. Every other class is fine but being a glass cannon with no damage is cancer.
---
I started playing a bit before exclamation points were seen on the minimap, and I almost never noticed anyone's gear. Even when I was a noob. I remember being in awe at the size and aesthetic of Orgrimmar when I first saw it, but once inside I didn't pay too much attention to the people. The only thing I noticed is how many there were and the lag lol. 
---
I just recently started playing on a tbc pserver and in the two months I've been playing I must have inspected maybe a total of 5 people. 
---
I think that's right ... I'll have to go check. It's been a while since he was in rotation and I move him so little during fights I don't remember for sure.
---
I am leveling as mm hunter right now. Its pretty fun. Still extremely easy to level, yea I will sometimes pull agro off pet if i get aimed shot crit but its not a big deal.  
---
And you get some good pvp talents in return, criting aimed shit on mages for 500 on lvl 33 is fun, its more then half their hp.
---
Classic is made because they expect to make money with it. I don't really believe 'we do it as a fan service'-reason they use. So their next step is thinking how to make more money with it. If having an eternal Classic vanilla makes less money than a progressing Classic, I do think they will move into TBC. 
---
Just my opinion/prediction. 
---
The rogue stuck in channeling pose after vanish was the best for me!
---
It is a forum
---
Engi + Tailoring for PVP and PVE benefits. 
---
Anything else comes to mind?
---
I think the best thing you can do is follow the BM tree all the way to get bestial wrath asap, then go down MM. Hunters are pretty nuts in PvP because their pet is insane, with bestial wrath your pet will munch on people. I don't think it's really worth going 
---
Cats are good for PvP due to their DPS and fast attack speed which will knockback casters, brokentooth rare has the fastest attack speed in the game. Boars are not bad for PvP either because of their immobilizing charge. I think certain Wind Serpents are also good.
---
Either way you will be taming multiple different pets throughout the leveling process to learn new ranks of bite, claw, prowl, etc. Just make sure to stable your main pet before doing it.
---
Blue dragon is awesome for restos! I can’t wait!
---
&gt; Well, I thought you excluded the run from leveling time.
---
I'm going more for actual "play time". I want to know how many real-world hours it's going to involve so I can see about fitting it into work, etc.
---
They even nailed the fps/connection speed of 2004 simulation.
---
They’re better. 
---
Mage... nova, blink blizzard kite repeat... so easy lol
---
Words of wisdom, from u/FatWhiteBitch.
---
I wasn't ever a priest but from what I remember most priests were rocking benediction even past BWL.
---
Whether they were recorded or not never bothered me, this was just some fun before I couldn't get them anymore.
---
Ah, thanks. That makes sense.
---
Build a preraid feral tanking set in addition to your restore set. Who knows you might just get lucky and end up off tanking in raids and getting high priority on some decent feral gear.
---
Yep it's a struggle but it's a good thing that decissions like these matter again. On retail it's like brb I'll reroll to class x because of fotm.
---
I was a priest in vanilla and was never able to get my hands on Benediction. For that reason alone I'm thinking about going priest again. But during vanilla I always thought damn I should have rolled warlock or mage....so yeh a struggle. 
---
My plan as a Warlock:
---
- Leveling --&gt; Skinning only
---
- fresh lvl60 --&gt; power level Tailoring
---
- endgame lvl60 --&gt; Tailoring/Engineering
---
Just stick to BM.
---
During leveling the only shot most classes got at taking down a hunter is by catching him off guard or in a low hp/mana situation. BM is best for preventing those situations in the first place.
---
Sure, Deterrence could be nice against a rogue opening up on you, but when he does it, a mob will most likely also be attacking you, since your pet will regularly struggle keeping threat.
---
Not to mention that your pet will be more dangerous to some classes than yourself.  
---
In terms of low lvl PvP Pets, attack speed is key.
---
Potions and grenades will be much more important than specc and pet though.  
---
  "I remember the first time I fired multishot with that sucker. A gnome warlock and a gnome mage both died to it."
---
LOL
---
The Demo client was SOOOO unfinished that the datamining isnt very reliable. They stated themselves it was incredibly barebones so Id take that with a pinch of salt :) Thanks for the answer!
---
I don't know about braindead per se, but farming as a prot warrior was painful. So much so that even my guild that required everybody to farm told the warriors not to worry about it.
---
Back when BWL just came out we had a bit of fun with the only horde guild on progression with us, we mind controlled them and I was casting blessing of salvation on them. I believe they reported to me that once mind control was over the buff disappeared. I might be remembering. That said in AB when we were 5 capping alliance we mind controlled them and I gave them water walking and that buff stayed after MC was over because we danced on the water as they lost. 
---
&gt; Sure the blessings lasts 30 minutes only
---
You mean 5 minutes, right? 
---
I played a Paladin on Alliance in vanilla, but I’m looking at Horde this time.
---
Because I was a Paladin, I know that Retribution suffered from the “hybrid tax” and never came close to as much damage as a pure DPS class.
---
But what about Shamans? I know Elemental and Enhancement are both going to be good at PvP, but can I actually raid as one of those? Or will I be forced to go Resto just like Rets were forced to go Holy?
---
On one pserver a few years ago, stealth was basically completely unusable. On a more recent one, it's significantly better, but still feels like you are detected to easily.
---
My memory may of course be wrong, but I recall that you could reliably walk to an equal-level mob _from the front_ and land a Cheap Shot as a non-NE Rogue without any stealth talents. And that's with 2000s era internet to boot.
---
Today you're increasing the quest log limit, tommorow you're selling your Motherland to the enemy.
---
I mained an Alliance shaman for 8 years. At least I won't be able to fall back into old habits :)
---
x) have my upvote !
---
&gt; also I don’t read that as vanilla is permanent. 
---
ok man, you seem to want to believe whatever you want. I gave you a literal quote from J. Allen Brack himself after you thought you were calling my bluff with "cite your source" and you still want to twist it into what you want to believe.
---
&gt;  Next time you quote something please include the entire quote not just a piece of it.
---
go fuck yourself. I am tired of wasting my time with you and your disproven point.
---
Hi, /u/Dabugar
---
😂😂
---
I have one from Burning Crusade, still on his package, never find how to use it because i don't have a matching keyboard.
---
Even now i still don't understand how to use this, is there some tutorial ?  
---
Well there you go. The pre-launch plan was to have the cap thanks to a design decision but later on it turned into a technical problem and that technical problem to go above the old cap is not a problem anymore.
---
Like Kern said when talking about Nostalrius, even with a massive population you will have a sense of community. Obviously the 12k cap or whatever Nostalrius had is a bit extreme if you ask me, I played on the server before it got shut down and you always recognized players and guilds even with such a large population.. even though the problem was that you 90% of the times fought over quest items/mobs with someone else thanks to the overpopulation. 
---
But I don't think a 5k cap instead of a 2.5k cap for example would hurt the community at all, I think it would rather help it out and I think personally that's what the classic team will go for.
---
&gt; can really shred
---
Not to mention rake, rip, and claw!

I don't know, I haven't looked as I'm not really using it for gaming either. 
---
Pretty sure this is what made my reddit app crash 😂
---
Thanks for this piece of art :-) It reminds me some of my bests days.
---
I can still see it being really good with the right positioning. If someone goes to cap a flag they may not be swivelling their camera constantly to look out for a hunter. At least not he first encounter. 
---
Your 100% hidden so tab target run won’t give you away. 
---
Whenever I see links to the wow forum referencing a blue post I get excited. 
---
This one was rather disappointing.
---
Bobs and vagene
---
Of course I'll play that I want. Determining what I want involves answering these questions. Also, what else do we have to talk about in here while we wait for the game to release?
---
I mean, if people want to go through all that trouble to play the game on easy mode, what's the problem?
---

---
Ya no one is going to claim blizzard is wrong about anything they have the old code. People who do are just stupid, it is sad but true. Also I am sure blizzard will change a couple small things no way around that.
---
depends what style of healing you want.
---
priests have a big toolkit and lots of utility, shield is instant damage reduction which is great in PvP, they probably have the highest skill cap
---
paladins have the lowest skill cap but dish out serious heals, they have good mana efficiency due to refunds on crits
---
druids are not bad in PvP due to their mobility, learn to love healing touch as it is your main spell
---
shaman healers are not that good in PvP, most people play 30/0/21 hybrid so they can do a bit of both. They are great support and their playstyle is all about totems. In raids they spam chain heal and use totems.
---
I never claimed that it would be great DPS, but its a funky build.  I have tested on my pserv's PTR and with spell dmg gear and some debuffs, the shadow oil's shadow bolts are hitting for 900-1300.  I imagine this guy could improve on that by stacking all world buffs with every +shadow dmg debuff, etc etc.
---
YES!  LOL
---
Alchemy has good pots if you don't want to buy them tho.
---
Heresey.
---
Engi + BS at once. I hate alting (and won't have any) so this is the only way to go for me.
---
You gotta remember though, as someone else said:  a lot of people will form groups that have the least competing rolls for gear.  So they'll look for DPS that doesn't compete.  This often means that if you're a Warrior+Priest looking for 3 DPS, they'll most likely eschew another warrior (as DPS) in favor of a non-plate class.
---
Leveling as enhancement, I never had a problem getting groups, and could both tank and heal groups in a pinch.  (I always carried a 1h+shield around, and would usually try to keep 1-3 pieces of updated healing/spirit/int gear on me.)
---
I think this comes down to the fact that the choice is meaningful. Each class has some great pros and some pretty apparent cons while fulfilling a truly unique class fantasy which makes the decision that much harder.
---
I have enough gold for a year of game time stacked from bfa release, and last I checked gold price of tokens is going down so might last even longer. 
---
m8 rate = better price for friends?
---
Nice expression
---
Moonwalking needs to be in the game. 
---
Hunter, grab an owl from nelf starter place at level 10, learn claw/dive/screech when ever possible. Growl+claw for single target, screech for 2-3 mobs, owl will hold aggro fine and save mana for multi shot-mend pet. Don't even bother with arcane shot after level 30 give or take, it's a waste of mana tbh.
---
Owls man, you won't regret it, you have to grab one at telderassil though otherwise you have to wait till late 40s felwood to see the next one. 
---
You burn through mobs, if you are low on mana pull one mob and let your mana regen to full, once its topped up take 2-3 mobs, rinse and repeat. Avoid drinking too much to save a bit of gold, auto attack and pet damage is fine while regenerating. All this while watching Netflix on the other screen. 
---
Level boost was the biggest insult to the game
---
I have one with the Wrath of the Lich King keys.   
---
Not sure if it still works, would have to find it. 
---
PvP rank point tracker
---
That argument makes no sense, by making them yourself you’re still buying them since you could have sold them on the AH.  Therefore why waste time making the pot when you could do the most efficient gold grind then buy more pots for the same time invested?
---
You can go even further with mind control. You can use Mindcontrol cap from engineering on an alliance warrior inside Orgrimmar and he gets the Warchief Blessing resulting in huge dps boost. High effort but I know some top guilds did it and are doing it on private servers
---
I would prefer something new over TBC.
---
I think staying at 60max is a key element to vanilla
---
elemental is especially bad because it is super mana inefficient. Even if you are chugging mana pots and using demonic runes you will still not come close to the DPS of a mage. They are great in PvP though, insane burst.
---
enhance is sort of a meme in PvP, people remember unbreakable but the truth is they are just not that good compared to Ele or 30/0/21 hybrid. They are also not that good in PvE, the only viable way of playing them is to use the Nightfall axe and simply provide a debuff for spellcasters, but even then there are other people who could probably wield it more efficiently (hunters, offtank warriors).
---
Well if you are into min/maxing there are other options available, yes. Depending on your gear Benediction can be BiS throughout T2 (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReZeaPM6oKVvdBB3v1kFQUZdAHeBs3-Ri4stOd8zM-U/edit#gid=225272596).
---
I've explained way for using it here
---
Hi!
---
Any chance that you still have a keybindings file?
---
/agreed
---
&gt; you go. The pre-launch plan was to have the cap thanks to a design decision but later on it turned into a technical problem and that technical problem to go above the old cap is not a problem anymore.
---
4k-5k would be perfect imo.
---
I understand about indecision but I don't care about getting behind. Some people live in competition but all I want is to have my peace of mind.
---
&gt;We will eventually be like every other game subreddit
---
God I hope not. Most game subreddits end up filling up with so much hate at launch from the vocal minority that I end up unsubscribing. 
---

The real authentic vanilla release experience.
---
It's possible, I won't say that it isn't. But I am not in the "Fan service who cares how much money it makes" camp either. It just seems that they are trying to do two things here. They are bringing back a group that will be paying customers, and they are killing pirate servers. The minute they announce they plan to force progress people those pirate servers get an influx of new people and it goes back to how it is now with people pissed at blizzard, plus the downside of TBC people not being able to trust they will still have a server in 2 years. They would be killing their TBC classic in the crib because nobody is going to come back when they think they might be force progressed to lich king.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Nah Bene is even used into Naxx
---
If moonkin would be a thing and feral wouldn't rely on crowd pummeler abuse, I'd try one despite hating the old druid forms. Also consumable farm is real.
---
Embriel is right thuogh. I play on pservers aswell and there are some people adamant about that blizzard is gonna fuck up classic, even after I have presented statements that came from classic panels, dev coolers, these people still refuse to listen and narrow-mindedly focus on their own disproven arguments. They are in the minority, but the extremelty vocal with their dislike and distrust of Blizzard making classic :/
---
Night elf heads or riot!
---
different classes probably a healer + warrior. If you wanted a truly fast combo for leveling/grinding it would probs be mage/mage. You could aoe stuff down so quickly.
---
Idk why ur getting downvoted, this is 100% accurate. People who think a shop will not be implemented are delusional.
---
Lots of paid character service were available in Vanilla, through the website.
---
Now if they add gold sales &amp; mounts it will be a problem. 
---
Simple, not everyone likes to grind purely for gold. I like chilling and farming mats for myself for example.
---
Swedish Hand-EU comes to mind
---
That’s fine but the purpose of my argument was trying to pick professions that actually add value to your character.  Engineering is the clearest example of a profession that actually adds value since it’s a requirement to use the items.
---
....on private servers.
---
Shaman probably. It was my main, all the way till BFA, but it's almost always lacking. In Vanilla it was rather dull, and weak, unless you were resto or a nightfall bot. Enh hat top quality gameplay with autohits + shocks every 5 seconds. Ele went oom ASAP.  
---
I still might roll one again, just crushing my fond memories of the past haha. 
---
I guess i should really check druid then. 
---
Personally.. I would like to see some kind of Diablo 3 season system... Although I could imagine the seasons would be really long...
---
That way everyone could experience the launch again, and having to level up and all that when everyone is fresh.. 
---
But also have a non-season where you could port your old season characters when the season ends. 
---
No idea how to balance the seasons tho.. 
---
A life outside of WoW.
---
&gt;the top endgame class on PSs. This means a lot of tryhards will play them specifically on Classic for the edge. If it turns out they're not so OP in the Vanilla endgame, then a lot of those players will definitely be pissed.
---
I would love to see how the meta regarding DPS changes.
---
the sad truth. Wish elemental shaman had some support resto doesn't offer to at least justify bringing one who is stacked to the teeth with consumables.
---
My first level 60, a paladin ... A human one. 
---
I just threw up a little in my mouth.
---
What a waste of time, rolled hunter after that, loved every second of it, that was the gateway drug to my life as a warrior/rogue/mage in the following 2 expansions.
---
Yeah, that's a choice I'm struggling with too.  Maybe try making both and levelling them to ~20 and make a decision from there?
---
Well the Barrens are just so miserable and vast plus factor for a very long and confusing Wailing Caverns... Westfall + VC are much more linear. 
---
Druids become absolute beasts with AQ40 and R13/14 gear. 
---
Came here during my loading screens in the WoD release
---
You have to make a group. You have to go to the instance. It's the same thing. No one actually PVP's because there is no point though. HK's have no point. Graveyards every 10 feet make PVP pointless, just like flying made PVP pointless in TBC. Modern WoW is Arena and PVE instances. It just has leveling that sucks. TBC had good leveling because you used vanilla for most of it. Everything good about TBC was from vanilla. Everything bad in modern WoW is from TBC including the LFG system which had a primitive start in TBC. Even stupid dailies started in TBC to replace real content. 
---
I had one of these a long time ago. I remember how the keys felt. Cheap and loose. Not tight and crisp like mechanical keyboards feel. The extra keys were mostly useless, it was faster to just type /r then to move your hand over the to reply key to the far right. 
---
Back when I moved using the arrow keys ( yes I was 12 and played runescape so I was used to the arrow keys for the camera.) it was useful to have those buttons closer to the movement. But when a friend told me about WASD and when I started to become a faster typer, it became more of a show off thing to my friends, rather than a connivence tool.
---
Looks like the min max mentality got to you a bit too much.
---
I can't do that yet!
---
Wow this is exactly what I needed. I’ve been having the hardest time deciding between Hunter, Warrior, and Shaman. My main worries with picking hunter is 1. When leveling I won’t be able to get in dungeons because it will be hard to find groups and 2. I have no clue what happens at level 60 for hunters. All I know it that they are a blast to level to 60.
---
On another note, props to Kargoz. Your guides are amazing. I just started watching a few weeks ago and man they really help for waiting for launch. Thanks for everything!
---
The night elf aimed shot in stealth shouldn’t work in 1.12.1 it was fixed before so when classic releases, you will be taken out of stealth at the start of aimed shot cast bar, rather at the end.
---
Still my preferred pick for hunters on alliance due to being able to defend flags in ab and wsg better.
---
And being able to fit the fantasy of ambushing someone in world Pvp.
---
Not at all.  A lot of people are very interested in getting the most out of their character though.  The thing is, we need people like you making the pots otherwise we wouldn’t be able to take advantage of it. So thanks for that buddy 
---
Woof. Painful to watch that these days 
---
Hey are you that guy from that classic podcast? Was really cool to hear the stories from drama/death by taxes.
---
We'll see. I'll probably just pick one when the game launches and stick with it
---
I think it also comes down to how much you want each specific item. Stealth drills it down to basically 2 classes outside of consumables so it limits things quite a bit.
---
If you leave that out and focus on the healing and DoT aspect, a Priest falls perfectly in there. Great all-around healer and Shadow is a killer in PvP.
---
Wouldn’t you lose trust in someone who made bad changes that you tried to stop?
---
Let’s apply this to another example.
---
You vote for President X, because he ran with the promises to lower your taxes, shorten the queues for chemo-therapy patients and give more money to the military.
---
But then all of a sudden, because a majority were crying out against this, he decided against doing those things and instead increase taxes etc and only you and a small minority were vocal against it.
---
Wouldn’t you lose trust in said president?
---
Losing trust has nothing to do with entitlement. You can still lose trust in someone without feeling that you were entitled to have it your way.
---
Like me. I dont trust Activision Blizzard, because I have lost in that they can make decisions that I agree with. But I dont feel entitled to have it my way. Their company, their decision. 
---
If your horde and speed leveling to 60 grabbing an owl is a waste of time. However if your up to the task, grabbing an owl at an early level is worth the journey. You will be unique to be able to have so early, and it is op.
---
Three Warriors? They should be sectioned..
---
You want deep BM for leveling and pre 60 PvP [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ct0GdxxottVohx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ct0GdxxottVohx), your pet is so much stronger than everyone else as no one has any real gear to challenge its high base stats, Once you hit 60 you can respec to [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cx0GzxLoZtVohthZc](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cx0GzxLoZtVohthZc) with 3 points left over to go wherever you want for PvP
---
DPS is where we are most likely to see meta changes because so much PS work on mob armor is estimated and it only takes a few pct difference to start reordering the dps rankings.
---
I'm probably in the extreme minority here, but I really loved the tbc prepatch, there were so many cool talents but you really had to pick and choose what was important to you and there were some hard choices to get what you wanted. They added some very iconic class defining spells.
---
The most accurate thing yet to be posted about classic wow.
---
But is priest fun in pvp? I would think they have problems against warriors and rogues.
---
Especially rogues must be annoying. 
---
I would feel like the armor helps the shamen and paladin and the druid could at least run away. Lol
---
Don't see WotLK, but they're really selling Starcraft version. 10 $
---
Extremely cheap, sad that further buyers will see that steelseries screwed up support of keyboard owners.
---
I have them bound to left and right scroll wheel click. Works fine.

That hotw ns spec is the all rounder but bad at all role spec. It allows you to heal/tank/dps/Pvp/ and grind without respeccing. But if your raiding, your guild will most likely require you to respec to deep restro.
---
Druids are a good class for someone that doesn’t have time to level a warrior, priest, mage, and rogue/ gear they all up to 60 to try out different roles.  You will be hundred in being sub optional in all roles, but sense druids are a rare class at 60, you will find spots in raids and in Pvp. 
---
His name is Shadestalker, Shadestalker the Ferocious, and he started his be awakened when the world tree was besieged by archimonde. Connected through the Emerald Dream he lent almost all his power to the whisps that set the trap for Archimonde, draining Shadestalker of his powers. Now finally, 5 years later he is awoke from his deep slumber, more ferocius then ever, and he hungers for demons to rip to shreds even as it was thousands of years ago since he was this weak, a time he barely remembers, just the same with the spells he had wielded as he was brought up as a druid of the claw in a time few remembers, before even the world was shattered. 
---
He is quick to anger and is often one of the first druids to shift into bearform in rage, but when kept calm he stalks his prey until its weakest point, rarely playing with his victim, often finishing them quickly with a ferocious [ravage](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=6785) from stealth when they are at their weakest. If a longer battle is predicted, being at a numberical disadvantage, he'll [pounce](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=9823), [rake](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=1824) and  [rip](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=9752) his enemies and slowly bleed them to death utilizing his superior tactical knowledge and exceptional heavy healing power. Usually by [Elune's grace](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=8926) he'll have outlasted them. Bleeding them dry, always making sure to vandalize the enemy casualties of war if his hunt was lucky enough to find a warlock.
---
He'll go out of his way to kill warlocks and their friends and allies, he generally dont like getting summons but understands their importance for the war. This is not much of a problem since he is such a good kitten, he's always on time and only seeks groups when he is already on his way to the dungeon. 
---
They found out that a technical limitation existed after they had already decided on a server size that's correct.

SAME. I was so sad I couldn't play in Teldrassil during the demo but it got me so excited. The nostalgia feels hit me hard.

The only thing I'm sad isn't in there, honestly, is the different riding specialisations (tiger riding, horse riding, etc).

Skinning and enchanting until I get Smoking Heart of the Mountain then dropping enchanting leathercrafting. Herbalism and mining on my alt.

Felwood. I’ve never quested there before so I want to experience what it was like.

Time invested on a pserver means nothing.  You should be ready to lose it all at a moments notice.  At any time that pserver can just disappear without notice.

Wow this is me.  Played mostly a paladin in vanilla and loved it.  But am torn to try something totally different like rogue.
---
Man I completely forgot about doing that as I was building an UD rogue twink... 
---
Ahhh the fond memories of having to dodge the annoying crocodiles near the shore of STV!
---
either way there will always be addons that can ignore people for you, so it doesn't matter what the game has in it.
---
I don’t think it’s really all that far fetched to explain how it’s a horrible business model. It’s not really twisting his words around when he also said in the same interview that they are waiting to see how popular it is to decide if they should continue to tbc and beyond.
---
I joined mid 2005 and remember hitting 60 not too long before the Naxxramas world event (so probably a year). I was sack of potatoes dumb, 12-13 years old, and I levelled as a prot warrior. I was in scraps of random mail and leather until 45 or so, I was always broke as hell begging for money rather than figuring out how to get it myself. I was basically Topper McNabb. XD
---
It’s sad that it’s true. 
---
Hunter no contest
---
Left and right scroll click are keybinds I never ever tought about. Might test it out, thanks.
---
Priests are overall the best healer in pvp. Sure paladins are great but priests have the largest healing toolkit, and an aoe fear as well as mana burn and an offensive dispel. Its close but I would take a priest over paladin healer for every class except maybe a warrior. 
---
In that same quote he says they aren’t going to give up in 3 months.  Also maintaining severs is vastly different than saying they will forever be vanilla. I honestly think you are reading into it to much.
---
Nah man. Sharding means when you think you are letting go a silent fart but it comes out with a little brown. Or was that sharting?
---
Level a dwarf priest first. You'll make a lot of friends and then work on your mage second. You'll get a priority spot in a raid then you can farm on your mage if you need.
---
Once my warrior was geared I still ran dungeons occasionally, mostly to help guildies gear up. There are always reasons. Some tanks sell their time  
---
What about opening from stealth so you can get that pickpocket, to stash more money for better leveling weapons
---
Late game as a tank, you charge people for runs when they are gearing up alts. 
---
They still have inferior mobility/range compared to almost every other class and they are very vulnerable to Purge. This is why ret pallys are usually extremely good vs average players but mediocre or weak against good players. I mean this generally. In the end the better and more aware player still wins/has more impact. Healing pallies don't have this issue nearly as much.
---
So just saying "roll engineer" doesn't solve all your problems because the fights that are the toughest will be against players who have consumables, engineering and good mechanics as well. The class has its weaknesses/strengths and that doesn't go away by obtaining something everyone else can too.
---
Were you raiding MC often back in vanilla? How come you didn’t get the eye of Divinity?
---
I main’d hunter for a good while across a few expansions but not in vanilla so I’m being drawn to play hunter again in classic and having my main objective in obtaining the petrified leaf and proving myself. Also got mage and warlock whispering in my ear haha
---
There will always be people running dungeons.
---
Either helping guildies/friends, gearing alts, farming shards or just doing it for fun.
---
Most run dungeons will probably be the ones with rare drops, like the mount in Strat Undead and the book for the the 1h legendary sword from DM.
---
Also remember vanilla had books for each class teaching a spell/ability rank that was unavailable at trainers. A lot of people even while raiding will be hunting for those. IIRC they all dropes in various dungeons.
---
100%
---
Yup “owen” whe were the 3 top druids of the server with Dazeroth pvp wise whe played in the same premade that time haha
---
&gt; MCs mechanics
---
MC or mechanics, pick one.
---
&gt; tank and spank from the first raid
---
it is what it is.
---
&gt; Never seeing a Son of Flame on Rag?
---
unless you overfarm 5 mans before setting foot into MC you will definitely see sons of ragnaros. if that is of any importance to you.
---
Resto druids are so much fun! I was one in vanilla!
---
So during retail Vanilla, I played a Hunter as my first ever character before I knew anything about the game.  I played a few other classes as alts too, but I never had an interest in playing a Warlock.
---
Now on pservers since Nost launch, I've been playing Warlock and like it alot.  Was planning to play a Lock in Classic.
---
So I have no idea how Locks were in actual Vanilla.
---
Are you telling me that if I even touch the summon pet button and cast it for a second, my current pet will instantly disappear?  Then I will be without pet until I summon a new one?
---
If so, I will be putting all of my summon pet buttons far away from any keybinds lmao
---
.
---
I had one. It was terrible. I'd imagine it doesn't work on Windows 10 anymore because I'm like 87% sure it required proprietary software that may not even run on Windows 10 anymore.
---
Nothing was worse than my grandmother buying my 11-12 year old self the WoW keyset for the Z board for Christmas, just because it had World of Warcraft on it.....but I didn't own a Z Board, so I had to explain that to her.
---
It does help if the other guy doesn't have anything to avoid cc, no additional mobility trinkets, consumables etc. It helps against the unprepared/unaware. But the ret pallies inherent weakness is still there, it is just less apparent when fighting average players if you have engineering. Which is a good thing, but I personally wouldn't roll a pally if I wanted to swing a 2h at ppl in PvP. Just seems awkward to me to have so little mobilitz.
---
You're talking about voting someone into office for an explicit promised thing, and then them going back on that thing because of an outcry.
---
In this case Blizzard made a game and promised a thing. The majority of people liked and approved of the promise and they followed through, despite a minority who may not have wanted it.
---
So using your example's framework it'd be more like President X ran for office promising lower taxes. President X then delivers lower taxes. A minority of people raise concerns that lower taxes would result in program cuts. Key programs then lack funding and it becomes a worse overall experience as people see the impact of that lack of funding down the line.
---
Would it make sense for the minority who spoke out there to say that they've lost trust in that President? He promised a thing and then did that very thing, to the applause of the majority of people. Where is the trust being broken? You don't like his ideas maybe, but that doesn't mean you can't trust him.
---
If that same President then sees the issue and says he's going to deliver a "higher tax experience" which will make things a little harder in the short term (lower wages due to taxation) but with a better overall experience.
---
Why should we not trust President X here? So far the only thing we've seen from him is that he made a promise that aligned with the community's wishes and then delivered on it. So why should we not believe that he will not deliver on his new promise?
---
&gt;n stealth shouldn’t work in 1.12.1 it was fixed before so when classic releases, you will be taken out of stealth at the start of aimed shot cast bar, rather at the end.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Still my preferred pick for hunters on alliance due to being able to defend flags in ab and wsg better.  
---
&gt;And being able to fit the fantasy of ambushing someone in world Pvp
---
Yeah, you get taken out of stealth once you start shooting it(if that's what you meant), but the target wont get you on their frame until after it is shot unlike if you just shoot someone with aimed shot outside of stealth, they will get you as their target on the frame exactly when you start casting. That's at least how it works in pservers, might be wrong though. Just gotta wait and see.
---
Is it actually implemented that way on Private servers though? Or is it just used to portray pservers as being worse than they are.
---
If the SpellID for the summoning stun does not actually exist in the Client for 1.12.1, it seem to me that this would have been discovered as soon as someone attempted to implement it no?
---
There will always be people who enjoy it even if they dont need gear from it. Tanks sells runs, groups who gear friends, but you also have instance people are gonna farm because of buffs/enchants or raredrops like: Strat LIVE/UD, Dire Maul North/East, Scholo, BRD, UBRS dont die out.
---
One of the most stupid fucking videos ever from the crowd that brought you today's WoW shitshow.
---
No idea how it is on private servers, but in Vanilla, people generally stopped doing dungeons once they no longer got upgrades from them. 
---
That's an early phenomenon - it already started in scarlet monastery, where tanks didn't like doing library while casters didn't like doing armory due to the drops. 
---
Regardless, on the grand scale, dungeons will remain active for quite some time - First the more hardcore will populate them, then the casuals that reached 60 later, then the alts of the hardcores and finally the alts of the casuals. 
---
It will likely take several years to reach the point where dungeons dry up so much that a tank will have difficulty getting a dungeon group together. I would not worry about it. 
---
So I know for PvE Holy Paladins don't wear their tier, but in PvP would they want to since it's plate? May reduce heal throughput but make you way tougher to kill?
---
People will always farm righteous orbs for the crusader enchant.  
---
Flasks could only be made in scholomance or BWL. 
---
&gt; Also maintaining severs is vastly different than saying they will forever be vanilla. I honestly think you are reading into it to much.
---
When that quote was made, the only thing on the table was Classic Vanilla. It was literally the day after the initial announcement was made. No one from probably had remotely mentioned anything Classic BC, Classic+, or seasonal servers (note: they still haven't).
---
To suggest that the quote could mean anything BUT Classic Vanilla is a perfect example of "reading into it too much"
---
I didn't know about the manuals! I just looked them up and yeah, that's definitely an incentive to keep running dungeons!
---
As a druid, I think 2.0.1 would be a great patch. The talent tree for the class had really been improved.
---
However, 1.12 is still light-years better than anything on retail so I'm perfectly happy with that.
---
WoW tokens, server pop over 5K and a non-charity cash shop
---
Well I have them bound to Shift-Q and Shift-R which are bound to that on my scroll wheel.
---
This. Priest is probably best for consistency but shaman, if you're lucky, is better. Except, prolly want to level as fury until you can spec into mortal strike, then go arms. 
---
I'm actually reasonably okay with dungeons drying up. I'm not asking this for my love of dungeons, more asking if the advantage warriors have in finding groups is a long-term or short-term benefit. From your response and others it seems relatively long-term.
---
Played MT for a guild.  The amount of turn over in a 40 man raid can be ridiculous.  I found myself constantly having to gear up new recruits/ others alts so never had a shortage of dungeon runs.  Also farming DME (2-3 man)and live strat are good money makers so they are always being run. 
---
Shift Q and E are to handy to waste of it I think. But with the amound of tapping back and forth it might be good. Im thinking about shift+scroll up and down.
---
Is this a pretty good money-maker? Are people okay to pay for tanks?
---
Yep raided MC but not that often and then BC came so I missed my chance. Ah well, I'll get it this time ;-) Just love these class specific quests. That's why I'm also triggered to go lock.  
---
I have my binds setup differently as I use a Razer Orbweaver.
---
Very interresting.
---
I had one but replaced it with an Gembird x7g100 keypad that is much more ergonomic, and a mouse that has lots of buttons like a Razor Naga but was half the price and doesn't have so many issues. it's a great setup.
---
yeah, and when it comes to world pvp while leveling, priest will win you fights with just dispell alone.
---
The only time I have said this or will ever say this: 
---
They need to see how Jagex made/support Old School Runescape.
---
Start with the patch they want to, which it seems we know which patch it will be, and then moving forward listen closely to the players on what they want implemented. Take the vanilla world and style and add new content as we go with it to keep people invested into it. Classic has a big chance to blow up and if that is that case, we will need new content as we go forward.
---
However, what do we think will happen after 2-3 years? Do you think they will keep introducing new content or do you think they continue releasing expansions  with TBC and WotLK and cap 'Classic WoW' as vanilla and the first 2 xpacs (I think I would be ok with this honestly).
---
Either way, I think in today's day and age, we will need more content than just what Vanilla had to offer to keep.a big majority invested into classic 
---
Please pick shaman. There's never enough shamans. 
---
Basically summer just ended in the Southern Hemisphere so I imagine some people were meaning that class is now late as summer 2019 has been and gone there.
---
What is considered brain dead farming? No class experience or plenty of it?
---
Learning how to farm effectivly takes some time and practice. Sure, auto-attack farming is always considered easy and a geared warrior is pretty damn good at it. 
---
However, other type of farm are about learning how to do it. The first time I did Tribute runs on a hunter it took me 3 hrs before even reached the King but after that it goes quicker and quicker. Now a full run takes me 15 minutes including vendoring the items, running back thru it. I can pretty much auto-pilot it because you are doing the same thing over and over. 
---
Its the same with a mage. Sure first times you will have a hard time but after a couple of hours you will auto-pilot aoe-farm like a boss. 
---
If you mean ”easy” as in most gold per hours, its still mage and hunter on top. 
---
Kinda depends, if you happen to make pvp a lot -&gt; warrior priest (fear, dispell, instant heal/shields) ... if Focus is more on pve, shaman would prolly be better, simply because of windfury.
---
Druid is prolly the worst for warrior since you have to cast Balance stuff / go feral to make damage while shaman can do damage with meele+wpn enchant and priest with wand. Also doesnt really boost the warrior.
---
If you consider rogue however, druid would prolly be pretty strong because of double stealth. Priest can work there too as you have quite some pvp potential. As you can use poison, shaman isnt that much of a Support for you (although WF is stronger than poison of course).
---
Another Option would be some hybrid stuff like enha or feral. Compared to other melees, its falls off endgame though.
---
My brother and I are going Warrior / Shaman! WF totem and world pvp... adios anyone who tries to mess with us
---
I thought Vanilla Blessings only lasted 5 minutes?  How are you gonna opposite faction mind control from inside a raid every 5 minutes?  This is dumb.
---
Yep, especially against CC heavy enemies like warlocks or mages ... FROST MAGES GAWWWD
---
Careful Kaivax... They fire people who do good work. 
---
Nothing about the Priest class has ever appealed to me.  I get why they are valuable, I'm just not a fan.
---
Time, mostly.
---
For pvp priest would actually be better because of dispell.
---
Well if youre lucky, you can oneshot People with windfury lol
---
well, that was my case, with my:
---
1. Celeron 900MHz, single core ofcourse
---
2. Integrated graphics
---
3. Windows XP
---
4. 800x600
---
5. postage stamp mode (UI at full resolution, viewport shrunk to like 1/10 of the screen using CTmod)
---
6. CTmod action bars put in weird position all around the screen, because it's fun to play with them
---
7. 8fps during AQ opening event. I mean, I was in Moonglade, raid frames alone made it drop from 20fps to 8fps. When I went to Silithus, it dropped to 2fps...
---
8. And all that happened...
---
2 years ago, on a private server!
---
I have mained mage since vanilla and contact with this on a spiritual level.. I loved oldschool mage/talent trees and would enjoy playing it immensely. But, on the other hand, playing and leveling something I didn't get the chance to back then is very alluring.
---
So I'm maiming rogue and my alt will be mage
---
Rubber domes. Lacks n-key rollover.  
---
Marketing gimmicks work wonders.
---
All the Horde Hunter Races have racials that are comparable or straight up better than Shadowmeld.
---
Trolls have Bow spec, meaning they can invest more into raw damage instead of hit and they have Berserk which significantly increases their DPS especially if combined with engineering. They do additional damage to beasts which helps with a few bosses but primarily with leveling/grinding. They are objectively the best raw DPS Hunters in the game.
---
Tauren have high health but they are primarily strong because of War Stomp, which is an incredibly strong ability for both PvE and PvP. They are easily the most well rounded Hunter race.
---
Orcs have stun resistance and their pets deal more damage, which makes them both great for PvE and PvP alike. Their melee buff can edge out a tough fight as well. Primary choice for PvP focussed players.
---
Quite interesting. Thanks for the perspective.
---
&gt; cap 'Classic WoW' as vanilla and the first 2 xpacs (I think I would be ok with this honestly).
---
the first expansion OK, the second, with dungeon finder and removal of class quests, unacceptable. Unless they cap it on patch 3.1
---
But, honestly, I hated TBC too... though still way better than BfA.
---
100% troll post. 
---
I have one and it's still working ! 
---
Torn between Rogue and War, in what essentially boils down to how useful / fun Stealth is.
---
I've always wanted to play a vanilla War, as a role I like tanky dps, much more fun PvE rotation, I have a IRL pocket healer friend already, I don't mind / like having the option to tank - but a big part of my success is being tied to a healer / group.
---
Alternatively I'm a grade a dickhead who loves world PvP, I've played rogue extensively in vanilla and xpacs and have always been able to exploit rogue abilities in WPvP to steal stuff like devilsaur leather or lotuses, distract people off of cliffs, gank people in home cities, at dungeon entrances and the on zep/boat, vanish for neutral guard aggro etc, and I can do all of this solo (not limited to having friends online).
---
If rogue lost its stealth abilities like stealth, sap, vanish, distract, and became just a leather dps class even if it gained some dps or other utility to make up for it I never touch it.
---
It seems to me that if I wanted to be successful I'd play War, and if I want to have fun I'll play Rogue.
---
It's a comedy. Chill my dude.
---
Well i really love stealth things and backstabs in games, so there is that.
---
well, to me, it'S faster in Teldrassil, if you start there. In fact, Teldrassil quests are even easier...
---
ignoring the one with furbolgs to the east, which requires to be postoned by a few levels.
---
They have 2 options for longevity imo:
---
OSRS treatment where they keep adding new content, tiers, etc. To level 60 
---
OR
---
they release BC afterwards and a couple years after that, WotLK.
---
I'm 100% cool with either, but I think that if classic is to survive past 2 years they will need to do one of these 2 things. People will run out of content eventually, so it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out.
---
Both, I think. One of the things we do know is that by announcing this, we're in the WOW Classic business forever. Once that starts, there's a commitment on our end that we're going to continue maintaining those servers for as long as there is a World of Warcraft
---
Okay so let’s break this down. If you think that they haven’t thought about the next expac already your crazy, again it’s a business.
---
The only part of this you could really interpret as what your saying is when he says we are in the wow classic business forever. But I would argue that the other expacs would fall into that category if that is the route they choose. You even called it classic tbc and classic wotlk. 
---
Next when he talks about maintenance on the servers. Why in the world would he word it this way? It’s because he’s talking about shutting the servers down. That’s what he views what people are concerned about since you are correct when you said there was no mention of the other expacs. If you would like me to I can go grab a quote from when someone asked him if it’s amazingly successful what would be the plan then. He literally states that he wants to wait and see. This is classic of blizzard not giving the full answer. They have a plan they just don’t want to tell you Incase you have developed an idea of what you want this game to be. 
---
I don’t mean any of this as an insult I just think you are taking your hopes and applying them where you want. There is nothing wrong with that but I think you will end up disappointed at the end of vanilla
---
Platinium
---
BANana... but hey, \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]!
---
Yeah, LunarSphere! My favourite addon!
---
I think it's really situational. So many factors like the long stealth cd and incredibly slow movespeed make it questionable. Anything more than probably 1 wasted energy tick while stealthing to a mob is almost definitely beyond the point of being worth it. Missing out on 20 energy isn't too bad but past that you're losing SS/Evis casts.
---
Spec and gear play a big part of it too.
---
If you're rocking a good dagger for your level like the Meteor Shard from SFK obviously opening from stealth is a no-brainer but if you're combat and don't have a good dagger to switch to for ambush then your only options are an 18 second dot or a 60 energy stun that does no dmg but awards 2 CP. 
---
If the mob dies before garrote runs its full duration then you would have killed the mob faster just by running up to it and SS/Evis spamming. I also don't think the dmg prevented from a 4 sec stun will be the difference between getting an extra pull in between eating/bandaging. You might even have taken less damage had you just spent that 40 of that 60 energy on SS instead and just killed the mob faster, especially if that SS crits.
---
**TL;DR** Other than really tough pulls like elite/named mobs, the only time garroting is going to be faster is if you haven't had a main-hand weapon upgrade in a long time and your SS is hitting for shit.
---
Just counting uptime you have:
---
Naxxramas bis geared fury warrior&gt;hunter&gt;paladin&gt;fury warrior&gt;non fury warrior&gt;shaman.
---
Among these paladins do the most dps while using nightfall. BUt horde dont have paladins and fury warriors loses so much damage using nightfall instead of dual wielding you probably only want hunters on nightfall duty as horde.
---
Still lasted way shorter than Wsswsswsswss, Wsswsswsswsw and Wsswsswssws vs Stormwind.
---
[Quel'Serrar](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18348) is epic, not legendary.
---
The point of making them for myself is not selling them you know. I am not really interested in playing the AH game other than occasional rare item that's worth to sell anyway.
---
Man, you just seem to not be able to understand.
---
Its my hypothetical scenario without your own add... You know what, fuck it, there’s no point in doing this as you cant even accept a hypotethical seenario without adding your own what-ifs.
---
Take care mate :)
---
By making them yourself you aren’t buying, which means you aren’t increasing the demand and therefore not pushing the price up.  So again, I’ll say thanks. 
---
if you learn how to play retpaladin and use the insane amount of consumables they need every raid you will be able to pull your weight but it is a lot of commitment
---
That apostrophe tho 
---
Hardly, there will be many people pushing up the prices, some go crazy from gold you know. There always be that ONE guy who always pushes the prices up xD. 
---
There was a tool for keybinding? Didn’t remember that....  There is nothing on the steel series official website ? 
---
People are okay to pay for tanks if there is a shortage of tank.
---
I can be good money maker if you're well geared and can run dungeon quickly.
---
More often geared tank will come at the condition they can loot valuable (green &amp; blue items that no-one in the party need and white item that no one need).
---
Can apply the same logic to you though.
---
If you don’t like people suggesting changes, then tough titties.
---
This was not my experience, even at the very end of vanilla. It probably depends on your server and its population.
---
I was the first in my wow "friend group" to roll horde. got a 60 shaman and told everyone how awesome the pvp was, server imbalance meant we got instant queues and alliance was waiting 45 minutes a match. 
---
Of course that meant I had to run them all through DM and Gnomer and SM as a shaman. It was hell, but it was fun twinking out with them a little bit lol.
---
&gt; For example i like stealth,
---
[Prowl](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=5215)
---
&gt; but i also love healing
---
[Healing Touch](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=5188)
---
&gt; and big number crits
---
[Starfire](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25298)
---
&gt; or dots ticking away their hp.
---
[Insect Swarm](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=24977)
---
There has been absolutely zero mentions of any changes being done to class specs by Blizzard. 
---
You can moan all you want about blizzard changing the game to suit your nu-wow lifestyle but it won't help. 
---
Overall I agree that the gear jump was too much - personally, I would rather that BC had added 15-20 levels instead of 10, and ended up at the same gear level so that the Hellfire gear could have started at a lower level and everything could have scaled up slower.
---
But you're badly exaggerating here.  MC, ZG gear was replaced pretty much straight out of the gate, agreed.  BWL gear, some might have been, but other gear wasn't - show me where you'd replace a staff of the shadow flame or band of dark dominion with Hellfire greens, for example.  As for AQ40 or Naxx gear?    Even the best blue Hellfire quest rewards (from quests like Zeth'gor must burn) pale in comparison to the T2.5 and T3 sets.  Heck, in some cases Naxx gear would stay on you until 70 (tank boots immediately come to mind, where the dreadnaught boots were arguably better than anything until Kara).
---
Now, I personally was indeed someone who replaced all their gear almost immediately in Hellfire despite going through BWL and part of AQ40 in vanilla.  Why?  Because I was a paladin, and paladin itemization outside of healbotting in vanilla was total crap.  And it was much the same for druids and shamans so I imagine they replaced their whole kit pretty much right away as well.  But that's not the fault of BC.  That's the fault of vanilla wow having terrible itemization if you strayed from the prime raid spec.  And that got fixed in BC.
---
Of course nothing in vanilla is unusable so if you have tried it and it works for you, feel free to use hemo. But if you ask for what is the most efficient and the best, nothing really comes close to leveling as Combat all the way to 60. 
---
I would always do dungeons even when i was fully epic and raiding AQ40. It was something fun to do when there was no raiding going on, or before a raid, and as a healer I didnt have many options on my own. 
---
Plus even if you are fully geared, there will still always be a ton of people who just hit 60 and need the 5 mans. 
---
I never had trouble finding groups even towards the end of vanilla. 
---
Really, we should all be advocating for blizzard to start developing future xpacs with vanilla design philosophy 
---
They're not having anything useful.
---
It is possible to use Z-engine tool for your own customization. But a bottleneck that you need to have a file for your own keyboard.
---
No fitting file - no customization.
---
Yeah, that's stupid.
---
Even one fitting file may help to make these dead additional keysets alive.
---
I don't know how hardcore you plan to play but levelling 2-3 characters at the same time and maximizing rested XP is a decent way to go about it. That way you can play the different aspects you enjoy while mixing it up as you level.
---
Not sure how you feel about *servers that shall not be named*, but you could try out some of these classes ahead of launch to see how each plays. On paper and in play are sometimes polar opposites.
---
&gt;You could argue that you can just make every class
---
This is exactly the thing you *can't*, and probably the main reason why it's so much harder than on retail. No one will have time for it - most people will struggle with more than 2 classes, and even then only one will have great current gear. 
---
So it's hard because you will be locked into that one or two classes.
---
I don't think they will really "die" because most of the casuals won't ever set foot in raids whereas dungeons are still easily accessible even to them.
---
You mean like Burning Crusade? 
---
There are a few, mainly wind serpents, and some rare spawn wolf and maybe a few others iirc. 
---
No
---
 Things got less viable as some classes were made way better. I played way more 1.7 than 1.12 and most classes were equally bad. How is that less vanilla than them overtuning a couple specs and making most things useless?
---
I'm honestly sick of seeing posts that are just bitching about "bitching". You aren't the solution, and saying "it is what it is" at the end doesn't make you sound any less petulant
---
honestly by the time your level 60 and grinding away any class should be autopilot for you.
---
Wow, can you share any .zmd keybindings file then?
---
just play warrior, anyone who says otherwise have never play one
---
That is interesting. Thanks
---
Ahah mine is working but I keep it in the garage with ths fps/wow/teso clips. I had those files in my old old computer but I dont have them anymore  :(
---
I did and will. Gear up newbies to the guild or alts. Get some money, some novel items, attunements, just out of boredom.
---
Dungeons run from beginning to end.

There will be more competition for rank 14 this go around, I agree. But it might actually not be much more difficult, because Rank14 is like a science now. It's set up to churn out rank14 rogues/warriors like clockwork, as long as you don't have some huge emo dbag on your server that tries to mess with the brackets, or as long as the other premades don't dodge you every game like they did on Nost.
---
If you're sick of seeing posts like mine, why bother coming into the thread and writing a sob story about your patch playtime? 
---
&gt;I still doubt that Classic will have the authenticity of private servers
---
This won't be hard considering pservers doesn't have authenticity to begin with. They are guesswork that players have come to accept, that is not the definition of authentic.
---
Thanks, updated.
---
I just can’t wait to be in the original Azshara again. Beautiful zone, and I despise what they did to it in Cataclysm. 
---
Also the original Feralas. The Isle of Dread I believe it was called. Chimaeroks and the kickin Chimaerok  chops!
---
My bad. Keep confusing it with Thunderfury.
---
I woudn't say so. Yes the principle of forming a group is what TBC has in common with Mythix, but the simple fact is that you are taking a small slice near the end of TBC and saying that that was all of it, which is far fetched. Gameplay wise, gearing wise, the world, leveling in outland, caves, world farming, attunements, etc. were all quite different and way better in TBC.
---
Aww how upset!
---
Look like nobody did a backups, so these keysets are totally dead without these files.
---
Are you able to see there the stats of pet families as well? Like each pet have -10% to +10% in each category of armor, health and dps. I remember i used to have an awesome resource that showed this as well as pet speeds/ability locations, but can't seem to find any site showing all three anymore. 
---
I'm sure you can still find them somewhere on the internet ! 
---
Why are you on this sub if you're sick of the "constant" whining? Explain how me saying for MOST of vanilla all classes were equal and so you saying those spec are dogshit in vanilla is wrong. They were equally viable for 90% of vanilla. Troll more subtlely, it's pretty clear you are like 14.
---
zug zug
---
They still wouldn't be happy and TBC balance was actually worse. Mages were kicked for locks in Sunwell. Hybrid DPS still sucked and resilience made them lose their burst so they sucked at pvp to. In vanilla you healed instances but the dps specs were awesome at pvp.
---
The people screaming they want TBC are the same people that ruined the modern game, yet don't want to play it. Classic TBC will be a huge failure, just like every TBC private server is.
---
Alchemy has transmute cooldown that is basically very low effort money making.
---
Why fucking post this stupid shit incessantly. No one here like flying mounts making the world feel empty and killing world PvP and welfare epics and arena making bgs irrelevant and resilience making healers unkillable, or all their achievements and the overworld being redundant.
---
Sure there's a BC sub you can circle jerk in.
---
Relax. 
---
In vanilla i did LW and Skinning till i was 60 and had crafted all the gear i needed, then dropped skinning for Enchanting so i could do Large Brilliant Shard runs in BRD. This was great money at the time. I cant remember if you could always DE anything with enchanting lvl 1, or if this was changed at some point. I know eventually they changed it so you had to have a higher Enchanting lvl in order to DE things at higher levels, which really sucked. I was druid btw, this would also be a good option for rogue, as you needed stealth to do the shard runs. 
---
This is a prime example of why there should not be changes - people haven't thought it through.
---
Changing the quest log limit will change leveling. Now, you might think "if you want authentic leveling you can just limit yourself to 25". This in it self is a poor solution, but it also means other people without that personal limit might level faster than you, thus impacting the game.
---
Is it a small impact? Yes. But why would we make a small impact that changes the game? The quest log limit is not a problem. You having to drop quests sometimes are not a bug, it's a feature. 
---
BC added too many things that made the game worse. Class balance is nice but I agree they can't go around buffing specs or it wont be the same game. 
---
No thanks I prefer a 6000 cap
---
Sad but no.
---
Really, there is totally nothing, for more fresh keyboard is it possible, but for this one there is only zero.
---
Honestly, the only reason I'm going to hardcore classic WoW is because I hope they'll see the response and make a BC server.  
---
&gt; it's pretty clear you are like 14
---
It would be ironic that Vanilla would be older than him.
---
I just love the sets, animations, spells, class fantasy and quality of life.
---
Pretty much this, TBC was the pinnacle of PvP, everything else? Not so much.
---
I'm playing mage on pserver to scratch the itch but it means I'm still desperately excited for real classic and healing
---
One has to be rogue tho... I don't know, still some time to see.
---
No like...future expansions of retail wow. So the game isn’t terrible but new
---
Just be a druid.  Do it all!
---
Like what? 
---
&gt;For example i like stealth, but i also love healing and big number crits or dots ticking away their hp.
---
Play druid!^^^just ^^^dont ^^^expect ^^^to ^^^be ^^^topping ^^^charts.
---
"Overall I am a little concerned that this will be used as some strawman argument intended to discredit the input of those who played on private servers"
---
Uh.. how is that a bad thing? If several aspects pserver players have been complaining about / asking for no change is bullshit, we should better know it yeah?
---
Pservers players don't need any legitimacy. If anything I would be much happier if there wasn't any pserver around to dictate other people what is the meta / what should be done or whatever.
---
Maybe one day, people will learn to focus down the healers.
---
Also, seems to be a lot of people not caring while mid 50's try to attack him.  Seems like mostly guards attacking him.
---
Good times.
---
Overfarm? Lol.  
---
I'll be surprised if we see Sons with 1.12 itemization including DM, 1.12 talents, on top of things we'll already be doing different than vanilla such as every consume and world buff. Raids need to be buffed, it's the only real solution. 
---
Ion has been pretty clear that they're going to do the absolute best they can do within the limitations they have. If Classic was a multi-year development project its possible they wouldn't have gotten funding at all. 
---
The question is whether you still have trust in Ion's word, which I do, because he seems pretty damn passionate about it. 
---
Just add new raid tiers. 
---
Excuse me sir, but these characters are clearly equipped with helms.  As I recall vanilla starting zones do not have helms.  I know because as a certified internet genius with a very high IQ and an active listener to jordan b peterson and ben shapiro, I can tell when someone is creating fake news.  
---
In fact if you pay even closer attention, the particle resolution is much higher than vanilla, because it came out almost 15 years ago on windows xp and wasn't capable of such high quality renderings.
---
In fact if you pay even closer attention this appears to be a gif of two individuals fighting in the woods for fun and play and not actual game footage.
---
Thanks.
---
(/s obviously)
---
How does the class fantasy exclude those weapons and include the others?
---
A marksman is (from the real world back in the medieval age) part of the military. They were proficient with a bow, but had a sword as well. So that is arguably part of their class fantasy.
---
As for survivalist, things like daggers and axes fit well, it's things a survivalist would use. But staves? What kind of survivalist would bring a staff for anything but walking with? And *fist weapons*? Those have got to be the least fitting. Polarms are also a mid-range two handed melee weapon, honestly it fits a knight more than a marksman, survivalist or beast master. As for the beast master, hard to pinpoint without them being much of a thing in real life, so it's more fantasy. Personally I think a staff fits well, same with 1H axes.
---
And then there is races. They impact it a lot, different races have different traditional weapons. Orcs have tradition of learning to use two hand axes, and marksman are not some lonely ranger, they are military style archer - would make sense they also learned to use other weapons that are often used by their race.
---
Of course, class fantasy is subjective, but that would render the whole point of this thread useless, that's why I bring up those things.
---
He seems to at least not be clicking his 1-5 skills, and seems to have keybinded swapping from action bar 1 to 2/3/4 etc. Also he doesn't really keyboard turn much from what I can see, seems to mostly be mouse turning. Still terrible of course, but for a player in 2005 era? Probably above average lol
---
We had a rogue priest combo that was pretty strong until the rogue pally combo became unstoppable, of course not the greatest healing but the problem was who do you try to kill first.  Couldnt bring the pally down without a concerted effort and while the rogue was a softer target, we werent running around unprepared (at the time I ad the 6th highest ranked character on all of the servers, so yeah gear made all the difference way back then) so if you turned your back on the pally then the dps dropped but not enough to let you escape.  Of course the hunter and pet combo with a  shaman gave us competition, but it wasnt anything we couldnt overcome most times. 
---
Good bot
---
No reason for it not to be correct, you just have to ignore the TBC stuff pets tamed from TBC zones and the lvl 64+ abilities ranks. For example, Bite(Rank 8) is only available from the LBRS wolves in Vanilla. 
---
Can we make these threads against the rules until Classic has released?
---
We know nothing as of now, unfortunately.
---
&gt; I don’t mean any of this as an insult I just think you are taking your hopes and applying them where you want.
---
No, I'm not. I loved TBC. My best wow experiences were during that expansion. I have no particular bias towards Vanilla or TBC.
---
But no one at Blizzard is talking about Classic TBC. It's incredibly presumptuous to assume that Classic TBC servers are inevitable when we don't even know how popular Classic servers will be. Let's just all chill out, enjoy Classic, and worry about what comes after when it looks like Classic is going to struggle. 
---
I realized pservers weren't an exact replica the second I got to the Barrens and got good drop rates on zhevra hooves.  
---
I'm so excited for real Classic!!
---
Ok, thanks for fast answer :)
---
While I can't speak for most people, I'd like to say that I definitely did run dungeons after getting raid gear on my Rogue and Paladin back in "vanilla" times.
---
While it wasn't for me specifically, I certainly loved most of the dungeons with the exception of Maraudon and Gnomeregan, and would run with either new guild members trying to gear up, random people in cities looking for more, and the occasional other Paladins looking to do the Charger quest as having more than one Paladin was helpful for the Seals.
---
It won't benefit you gear wise, and is essentially a time sink because you're getting little out of it; however, I loved being helpful and since the Elune (NA) community was a real thing in those days, it never hurt being on people's "good list."
---
I don’t know what they would do about Pally taunt. If you give them the one they had in BC, then they have a 3-target taunt, which would just not be right in Vanilla. And if they go with the single target taunt, then they’re ripping it all the way from Wrath. Hell, If we ever get BC and pallies have both taunts already, that makes them quite OP.
---
Ok, I believe you, it's just that I'm a bit more skeptical about post-2.0.1 stuff since seeing that whole demon summoning thing from classic demo, it seems there may have been a lot of small undocumented changes happening in 2.0.1. 
---
A super quick off-the-top-of-my-head list of reasons why people keep running dungeons:
---
Scholomance: Skins of Shadow, Supreme Power Flask Recipe, AD rep
---
Stratholme UD: Frayed Abom Stitchings, Epic Mount, AD rep, some NR gear
---
Stratholme Live: Orbs, Wisdom Flask Recipe, priest robe recipe, some AD rep
---
UBRS: Ace of Beasts, Titans Flask Recipe, Felstriker
---
LBRS: This is kinda the odd one out since it doesn't have a lot of stuff that you still want after being raid geared. GFPP recipe is a must-have, but someone in your guild usually gets it way before you start raiding seriously.
---
DM: Books, tribute buffs
---
Even BRD has a place on this list: Ironfoe, dark iron ore, smelting/crafting with dark iron, purchasing stuff from the Thorium Brotherhood guy in the bar
---
-
---
I probably missed tons of stuff, but this should illustrate how people keep doing dungeons even after being raid geared. 
---
Hardcore players leveled in instances in TBC and never saw other players outside the group. It's all we did. Instances over and over and over with stupid rep grinds that weren't fun. It sucked. At endgame I farmed gold on my rogue in a instance in TBC. I actually see more people farming gold in modern WoW doing herbalism than I did in TBC. The game is still bad though. I kill people doing herbalism and they res in 10 seconds. Modern WoW is what happens when you let Brack and TBC superfan "elitist jerk" Ion be in charge of the game. The funny thing is that the "TBC fans" don't want to play the game they ruined. You all wanted raiding to be the primary focus of WoW. Now it is. You wanted a failed esport (ARENA)  that ruined all other pvp due to everyone having to get strong defensives, CC and healers having to survive that CC. You got it. Then you don't play it and thing boring rep grinds would fix modern WoW. They added boring rep grinds to the game. Like I said, the game still sucks. TBC ruined ALL MMO's btw. They all focused on raiding and not the world and they have all been bad since. 
---
Whoa! They dropped gear?! That's so cool
---
No, I did not ignore this. I addressed it with posting a video that showed different(I'm still totally open to this video being wrong), but like most religious people facts always gets dismissed.
---
Nah, BC sucks and the people who want their special snowflake build buffed need to go pound sand.
---
Says me, the elemental shaman looking to mostly PvP and occasional instance as a healer.
---
If you want to tank in a raid or DPs, don't pick a spec that sucks in raids. Its not hard. You have the freedom of choice, not the freedom from consequence. The game does not need to cater around you, you need to learn to play the game as it stands in vanilla.
---
You are making a ton of assumptions of what the class fantasy is, and a lot of it is objectively *wrong* when compared to what Blizzard have done (and after all, they are the one that decide things in the game).
---
&gt;hermit or lonely survivalist in the wild, who's only friend is his pet.
---
Who says they are like this? Rexxar is, but he is a BM hunter. An orc SV could fit that as well. But how do you explain night elf MM hunters? They are the majority of the night elves *military* force. Waaaay different class fantasy.
---
&gt;I want to say that 2H Axes and 2H Swords are more fit to be used at battlefields, when hunters should avoid (Class fantasy) any battles with more than like 3-4-5 enemies - "thats not my war" - he should say.
---
But this is not how WoW is. As I already mentioned, a night elf hunter is in Warcraft exactly that - someone at a battlefield. And night elves are in the Warcraft lore quite aggressive about their territory - they most certainly wouldn't say "that's not my war". No, they would start the freaking war and kill the enemies on sight.
---
&gt;Sorry, but (IMO) MM hunters is more like Robin Hood than some kind of high elven hunters.
---
But they are not just that. It's fine if that's how you like to look at your character, but there are established *lore* about different things, yet you question it? 
---
So yes, you are wrong. Not trying to sound rude (which I guess I somewhat do). The thing is, you are trying to deny the *established lore*. It's fine to envision your on characters class fantasy, but not allowing hunters to use 2H weapons would directly go against the games own lore. That doesn't make any sense.
---
Well with most, you have an argument. Your Average time to form a pug in a 10k pop server is going to be way lower than in a 3k server.
---
Yes, but it's mostly for farming, helping out friends, and BoEs. Running dungeons can be okay money, and if you ever get to a point where you can run them by yourself, they can be really helpful for gold. I'd say that once you cap, raids become the most rewarding experience, and your interest in dungeons will probably go down. 
---
That is probably the only region I have never quested in, so I go with this as well.
---
For me, the hard part about choosing a main character class is the fact that there is still so much time until I can actually play the game.
---
With all that time, I'm able to continue watching YouTube content, fiddle around with Talent Calculators, second guess myself, etc. and I'm sure that I will continue to flip-flop until I finish installing the game and create my character(s).
---
From that point on, there is too much time in leveling that I'll most certainly stick with whichever one that I start playing first. I mained a Rogue, then leveled a Paladin and Priest to 60 before TBC came out. As much as I've told myself that I want to play something different this time around, I still love those three classes and are kind of leaning (in the back of my mind) towards playing them. I'd love to play a Druid this go around, and I'm also interested in Hunters, but again there is a lingering feeling of playing the first three classes too. It is tough, but I'm convinced that when the game launches, I'll know by then.
---
I am making 4 gnomes and 2 dwarves. My first to 60 will be a gnome warlock. Free mount/caster/gnome=win/win/win 😊😊😊
---
Lol nice take
---
Same here.  I fully intend to enjoy my leveling to 60.  So much so that I, as a dedicated Horde player for my entire WoW career, have decided to roll Alliance, just to enjoy the "view from the car window" on the journey to cap.
---
F'N STOKED
---
Yes but you have nigh infinite resources, so many of your abilities are instant cast but based on melee damage (so good weapons kick ass) plus you get your avoidance abilities pretty early (like evasion, sprint), stealth gives you a strong opener with daggers, slice and dice is a way of increasing your damage consistently, etc.
---
I remember leveling rogues to 10 in like..... an hour in vanilla if i really really tried. You just have convenient and quick damage so early no. You don't even wait for weapon swings.
---
If you have 3 or 4 drunk buddies running instances can still be fun.
---
In general, instances don't become irrelevant as some have things that are mandatory for high end crafts, like aclhenists in scholo, brd black anvil and occasional rare or profitable farming.
---
The only instance that I know becomes more rare to run is DM east and LBRS
---
Exactly this. The premise that retail WoW is completely dead and we all want relaunches of previous expansions is absurd. The vast majority of players will still be running retail regardless of how many vintage servers Blizzard creates. Not ot mention, as a company, Blizz obviously wants to create fully-realized additions to WoW. 
---
The problem is moving away from conviencene and instant gratification will always have a backlash -- just look at what is happening with portals right now.
---
This forum wants the grind back because they enjoy the reward and the longterm goal. I think it's important for Blizz to finds lots of ways to insert that back into retail. Give us goals for legendaries or hard to acheive epics; give us crafting recipes that are relevant and interesting to persue; give us reputation grinds that matter! There are so many levers that can be pulled to satisfy the classic crowd that don't involve relaunching every previous expansion.
---
&gt; I considered it was a error in the game at the time of its release.
---
Yeeeeah, it was totally an error. After release they were just like "wait, Bob? Why can't humans be hunters?" \*Bob eating a doughnut with a drop of sweat rolling down his forehead\* "woops", Bob said.
---
&gt;Do you believe there will be hunters accessable option for humans within wow classic?
---
This is not even a question, there 100% wil *not*. Blizzard is doing things like making sure the exact time a warlock demon pet unsummons is right, no chance they do such things and then goes like "oh, but how about new class / race combos?!".
---
I actually think that the imbalance of specs in Vanilla is nice. People often talk about class imbalance, but it's just the specs that are heavily inbalanced. Druids are excellent classes, they just can't compete in PvE DPS. Same with Paladins, etc. 
---
If hybrids could at the top level of all aspects of the game, why would anyone choose a non-hybrid class? Isn't it kind've unfair towards the pure DPS classes if the healers can also DPS as well as them and at the same time excel in healing and even tanking?
---
Every class in vanilla plays an important role in both PvE and PvP. And people who roll a druid and start whining when they reach 60 and don't DPS as well as a fury warrior only have themselves to blame for choosing a druid.
---
I will most likely be playing as a druid myself, and although I'll mess around with different specs quite a bit, I know that the only way I'm going to be competitive in PvE is by healing. I can still have tonnes of fun with feral and balance specs in a more casual environment though.
---
Stratholme is so fun.
---
Honestly, I think class balance is worse now. Ret, boomkin, enhance, elemental, etc. were all hybrid specs. Them underperforming as DPS never felt strange as those classes had utility and other ways to contribute to a raid. It'd have been nice if some of those were given a slight boost, but it was far from a critical issue. I tihnk it's worse now when you have those specs outperforming all three mage specs. The drive to make everyone "viable" just created more problems.
---
If I decide on Druid it'll be Skinning/Enchanting. If I decide on Rogue, it'll be Skinning/Engineering.
---
I am super ready. I know the faction, class and race. Alliance, gnome, mage. I know the spec I'm gonna level (single target frost).
---
I've messed around with other classes and the class that I'm gonna play. There's no doubts left in my mind. I hope classic doesn't take forever to come out so I don't start having second thoughts :P
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cxZxqoht
---
This is how I leveled. Starting in MM until scatter And then in BM. I played in a highly active PvP envoirement And I found this to be very good. It does need careful planning and you always have to prep for potential ganks.
---
Like so: https://youtu.be/X5YxK0xg8_A these guys were stalking me and I knew they would try eventually.
---
I expect to get things done, not to top charts
---
I think there is a rare flesh golem that spawns in the ruins of Anderhol with like a 76 hour respawn timer. Drops a corruption's scourge stone.

Play a PvP/RPvP server in Vanilla. It's half the game and you will make friends in zones like STV that may last the rest of your life. Past Vanilla world pvp really isn't an organic part of the game and it has no real reward. Server type really doesn't matter past Vanilla with flying and res points every 10 feet.
---
An example of why you play PVP even if PVE is the main thing you do. World Bosses. This isn't going to happen on a PVE server. These kinds of fights will give you memories that last years. 
---

---
Did you not also need LBRS to get a gem or something in order to get the key for UBRS eventually? Or was it for the Onyxia access? 
---
I remember attempting Simone, without having done any research beforehand, I thought it'd just be a normal tank and spank elite mob that i could nuke down. After that failed, I tried different things, and eventually succeeded in killing her. Or so I thought, turns out I had been attempting to kill her pet (the felhunter) instead of her. That was rather embarrasing to explain to my hunter class leader after I had spammed in gchat that I had defeated her only to see that it wasn't the case. That same hunter class leader did the burning steppes and winterspring demon for me, but I was able to do the silithus demon myself, which is considered the most difficult one. But Even on the silithus one I remember using a wireless mouse, and the battery running out on one attempt when he was at about 5-10% hp and a sure kill. 
---
Seriously, my instinct while watching this was that it was someone that bought the account.
---
Correct, lots of people farmed LBRS for UBRS key so they could make the 10-15g people usually pay for key service.
---
I also forgot about Scholomance for crafting flasks, and NR helm off Gyth in UBRS. Probably lots and lots of other things too :)
---
Pretending you had a counterpoint, but you're just too *exasperated* by my apparent stupidity to write it out doesn't make you look more intelligent.
---
I didn't add my own hypothetical. Your analogy didn't make sense because it was literally the opposite of what Blizzard did. I took your framework and applied it to what Blizzard did. I didn't add anything. I'm afraid I'm not the one here who isn't able to understand.
---
My first 60 was a human paladin too. Then I entered MC and realized if I didn't want to heal, I was useless. Speed leveled a mage and never looked back.
---
Bu it's all about what you want to do. The key is rolling a character that meets your expectations endgame.
---
How can horde get an owl at early level though?
---
I am going complete opposite of Vodka with this one.  The Drooler \[i mean Druid\] was the worst for me. Boring as poo imo and i felt like my safety helmet was on backwards when I would try to lick the windows whenever i tried to play it. I know people love them but i just couldnt get into it no matter how many times i tried.  I must have deleted at least 5 druids over my time in WoW, never could make it to beyond level 30 because it was not my thing.
---
If you use the racial ability and receive 15% increased cast speed you'll be able to cast 5 frost bolts in 10.625 seconds, compared to a cast time of 12.5 seconds. This is less than 1 extra frost bolt per usage. 
---
If you use this in a perfect scenario you might get two extra frost bolts per fight but in most cases it would only contribute towards one extra frost bolt. 
---
It's not terrible but it's really not that great either. If you do any pvp at all the undead would be the preferred race. This literally only matters if you are in a top racing guild where min maxing is required. 
---
&gt; No idea how it is on private servers, but in Vanilla, people generally stopped doing dungeons once they no longer got upgrades from them.
---
That wasn't my experience from Vanilla at all. Dungeons still drop things other than gear that are valuable throughout the entire Vanilla (recipes, books, other mats, etc.) which people farmed regularly. You also had ores in dungeons that people liked to farm, lab runs for alchemists, reputation farming, etc. I ran plenty of 5 man dungeons with guildies, even when we were progressing through AQ40 and Naxx. None of us needed upgrades (except if someone brought their alt), but there were other reasons to do those runs. 
---
And now I'm thinking of 2005-2006 vanilla, not pservers
---
What.. ?
---
The 10 fps is pretty spot on, too
---
Druid.
---
Slim I got herb and in the end drop herb for alch
---
&gt; Be consistent - either be equally butthurt about noggenfogger and mogging, or accept both as something that has always been part of the game.
---
If I ever meet you in game, I owe you a stack of Noggenfogger. Brilliant. 
---
yes i still have one somewhere! 
---
Fresh start. Solo / Self-Found kind of run. No enchants, and the only non-self buffs I used were scrolls from random drops.
---
True story. Ele's are awesome in Vanilla. Who cares if you have to heal raids. Pures have to spec to PVE specs that suck at PVP to raid to. These people are basically delusional/lazy and the same people that ruined the modern game but don't play it. If you can't press chain heal and drop some totems for this payoff as a ele shaman? You shouldn't be playing a MMO period. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZapYnHSSsQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZapYnHSSsQ)
---
I don't even understand these people. They want to not heal or use their utility and press one dps spell and only PVE. Uh? Play a lock or mage then? Why do they want to play shaman anyways? No one is forcing them to play a hybrid class and all they want to do is dps. 
---
They make a long journey to teldressal and they tame the lv 7 owls.
---
Those books drop in aq20 exclusively, which isn't a dungeon...
---
&gt;If hybrids could at the top level of all aspects of the game, why would anyone choose a non-hybrid class? Isn't it kind've unfair towards the pure DPS classes if the healers can also DPS as well as them and at the same time excel in healing and **even tanking?**
---
...
---
&gt;they reach 60 and don't DPS as well as a fury **warrior** only have themselves to blame for choosing a druid.
---
really makes you think
---
The answer is that it is situational.
---
"Opening with stealth isn't worth it" ---&gt; Bullshit, its situational.  If you are fighting difficult mobs (equal or higher to your level) opening from stealth gives you a huge advantage.  Cheapshot is excellent because it lets you wail on a mob for 4 seconds without taking any damage AND starts you with 2 CP.  Garrote is good against high armor targets (bleeds are not reduced by armor) and is good for longer fights where you know you will take advantage of the full effect.  Sure, opening from stealth makes you move slower and adds some time to the overall grind, but so does having to sit down and eat food every 2-3 pulls.
---
If opening from stealth with CS, follow up with a SnD, and then spam SS.  If you are close proximity to another mob you are going to pull, try and get another SnD off before the mob dies with CP on it.
---
Just experiment with different combinations and you will quickly find out what keeps you in a consistent groove, and what has you sitting down and eating too frequently.  It totally depends on what mobs you are fighting and what their level is compared to yours.  
---
&gt;that's part of the experience
---
\^
---
I gotta say, it was infuriating watching all those people standing around not capping the flags. Typical fucking alliance.
---
Sure. That's exactly it.
---
Nah man, its all about having the resources (energy) and not needing any time to get revved up. As a rogue you can just go and go and go and only stop to heal, no building rage, no regenerating mana, most dps skill have very short cooldowns, etc. as a miner I heal enough in the time it takes me to mine ore. Once you get blade flurry you can start taking groups 2 at a time every 2 minutes. Ive played every class in the game and I can't outpace rogue in vanilla.
---
When I said "top charts" it was more in a sense of "compete". Like you can be going ham on a druid and your still bottom of the charts. So in that regard, you do still aid the raid in getting things done, such as keeping your priest going with innervate, brezzing the guy that dies, or bear forming a loose add. 
---
Most people want to "top" charts for w/e reason, and since you were asking, I made sure to add the ^^note .
---
Once the spread happened (meaning once you started a brand new character after there were level 60s in the world) people really lost track IMO. Its like..... you knew if you were trying to really bust your balls to raid, but otherwise would focus on a few friends (like you're saying) but even then, as a collective group I saw guilds that would vaguely stay similar in level (cliques within)..... but otherwise we all just sorta drifted up the levels.
---
Never saw that guy! 
---
&gt;According to the official World of Warcraft Atlas this guy is an Uber Rare elite mob and he has somewhere between 48 to 72 hour spawn time. So trying to wait for him to spawn can be a pain.
---
Damn that's a long respawn time
---
Something to keep in mind is that it isn’t easy to gear up a healing class alt in raids with dps pvp gear. Since you’re gearing against your spec so it’s not all green pastures just because you don’t roll two primary dps classes. If your aspirations on your alt are to heal then by all means the answer is obvious here. But classes like hunter and shadow priest can pull of decent pvp action with just some lower tier pvp gear and shaman, while very good as resto all the time needs decent raiding and pvp gear to be an effective ele shaman.
---
This, made A LOT of gold and leveled up lock picking via pickpocket, there's no way I'm NOT doing that while leveling. 
---
Well crap, gonna edit that bit out.
---
Interested in possibly healing.. what healer could I raid on and eventually respec to have a fun, maybe broken time in pvp? I am thinking priest --&gt; spriest
---
Is there a dps class that can raid and pvp as the same spec and have an enjoyable time? Thanks
---
Hunter or mage for sure aoe farm dm for gold from the dogs in North then go to the lasher packs in East. Make all the moneys.
---
I still have the Merc Stealth, too! 
---
Eh? How do you split-pull a pack in WoW?
---
Yeah I hope they do something to prevent queue dodging, it could ruin the AV scene
---
Except you would use it during Icy veins. Just icy veins makes your frostbolt go from 2.5s to 2s. So in 10s, that's 5 casts. Icy veins+Berzerking means the cast time goes down to 1.625, meaning that you'll be casting 7 frostbolts instead of 5, the last one starting to cast at 0.25s before the buff expires. So that's one entire free frostbolt and some change. 
---
Again, this is absolutely broken on shorter fights, and still very good on longer fights. 
---
Wanting to do big dps doesn't necessarily mean that you're in a top guild. I've actually only been in a hardcore guild once in my life, for a total of one month. I like the more casual pacing of progression content, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try and blow up the meters as much as I can. 
---
Btw, this is assuming that the haste % is additive, if it isn't then it lowers the cast time to 1.7s instead of 1.625, either way, free frostbolt.
---
Play what you wanted to have. You'll enjoy it. For me in vanilla i had a mage after the fact with private servers I've played warrior which is what i wanted. And I will never play anyother class. I have played them all via private and the one i wanted the most in vanilla is the one I call bae.
---
I hope you're ready for loot overload because druids get showered with loot because of how few of you there are.
---
Sounds like you need to play druid. Stealth, can heal, big crits on sitting targets with ravage and dots! Literally all the things you mentioned you liked!
---
Refreshing to see someone agree with me for once. Thanks
---
Just add new raid tiers.
---
Damn that’s a good sum up. What would you choose? War stomp might be a good idea actually :)...
---
Retail will be good by just adding new raid tiers?????????
---
Flying. Ruined the entire game
---
If I do Rogue, I'll probably choose Human. Only because I like their looks more than other races. I was on the fence about being a gnome though, because breaking snares on a 1min cd is pretty insane. Dwarf is good too, especially against warriors and rogues (able to remove their blind with stoneform).
---
oh my god... double rainbow
---
those changes *do* fundamentally change the game
---
sadly it's impossible to separate your frustration at game changes, with your own burnout or fatigue or whatever you want to call it
---
they are all affecting your experience, my experience
---
wrong
---
Personally I think Thick Hide and Improved Revive offers far more value than Endurance training.
---
Yes and and negligible.
---
This is needed so much, there is alot of ignorance out there. 
---
They can just remove flying in BC. Simple
---
I hated BC PvP (resilience can burn), and much prefer Classic as a whole. I'm perfectly fine with all of the quirks and weirdness of Vanilla. I agree, if people want things to change in classic then too bad.
---
Lol no. Shedo is in a hardcore guild. They all have world buffs. They all do huge dps and clear BWL in under an hour. When he loses wbuffs, his dps falls so low that hes hardly contributing. They have enough geared and skiled healers.  People hardly die in the raid. Him "using his utility" and tossing out some innervates isnt going to have much impact at all. It certainly isnt going to make him MVP of the raid while he is doing peasant dps. Maybe the stars align and he can save a wipe with a clutch battle res. But as I said , the raid is getting stomped in under an hour. They rarely die never kind wipe.
---
You just seem like an armchair player who thinks feral utility 
---
lol, no u dont want to unless you hate rage.
---
The guy wanted to add new expansions to classic, I replied with just new raid tiers instead 
---
Oh god a paladin. Good luck with your seals
---
Cool you guys can be dungeon heros. 
---
undead also have waaaaaay cooler casting animations
---
He literally said future expansions of retail WoW, not classic.
---
Yep as much as people complain about raid specs, they don't seem to acknowledge that pure dis raid specs are pretty shitty as well. Ever try to do anything outside of raid as combat daggers or ds/ruin? You'll be longing for holy spec.
---
1.12 is some of the worst mechanics in all of vanilla, change my mind.
---
Esfand &lt;3
---
Never even said the word 'retail'.  
---
I’m sure there are plenty, especially on Reddit, but I doubt most of the population of the actual game will be. My buddy and I are both in long term relationships (I’m actually engaged) and we are both hyped to go back to Classic, and we will both hit 60 and raid. It’s not that unrealistic, even in my raiding days in my teens and early 20’s, I recall there being plenty of people in my guild that had families and still raided. Besides, it will give my fiancé time to catch up on Grey’s Anatomy or Handmaids Tale or whatever else while I’m raiding. Everyone wins.
---
I agree with you, but the point of my runthroughs is to compare and contrast the leveling experience for different classes. To do that, I needed to keep the leveling environment as close as possible. Leveling up a character in a completely different area from the rest sort of defeats that purpose.
---
They leveled up 9 extra characters for a 15 minute buff. Having 2 accounts isn't what makes this hardcore.
---
I thought about speccing into fire power as well, seems like a nice bonus to damage, but I couldn't justify it because of all the utility in frost, as well as the big crit CoC talents. I wonder if it balances out. Also vs certain classes more sustained fire damage is better than bursty CoC damage. 
---
The guy you replied to with "Just add new raid tiers", literally said "future expansions of RETAIL wow".
---
and the op of this comment chain was surely refering to retail aswell.
---
&gt;Really, we should all be advocating for blizzard to start developing future xpacs with vanilla design philosophy
---
Hmm, yes I too see the word 'retail'. 
---
Yes, some of them were in dungeons exclusively. Examples for mage :
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22890/tome-of-frost-ward-v
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18600/tome-of-arcane-brilliance
---
And some others, exclusively in AQ20.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21280/tome-of-arcane-missiles-viii
---
&gt; to compare and contrast the leveling experience for different classes. To do that, I needed to keep the leveling environment as close as possible. 
---
so it's not possible with Druids, unless you just make the run to Northshire, and cut from there. That starting with level 2 won't quite affect the time.
---
Yeah watch pad264 reply to that comment, and see how the op replied to it. He meant retail.
---
This is where wow handled strength weirdly. A level 60 warrior (say in all greens/blues) could kill like...... 100 level 30 mages, simply because he would resist 99% of their spells. Now, if you had 10 naked level 60 mages all shooting the one warrior he'd go down pretty fast.
---
Being stronger was one thing, but the chance to hit/miss/dodge/crit/parry/resist/block mechanics were odd in that they made certain types of fights impossible. So, if you're level 20 and you see a level 60 player and they want you dead......... you just die, really. You're slower, can't do anything to them and will almost certainly die in one hit.
---
I often wished they would tweak the game in a manner where lower level players wouldn't feel totally inconsequential. I can't beat up Mike Tyson but if I had a knife or something I could stab him (he'd probably still win but you see my point).
---
This guy being geared should make him a formidable opponent for 2 or 3 enemies...... not 15. Just my opinion, though.
---
i still use my Zboard Merc Stealth Keyboard, to bad W10 broke the Software, and i can no longer macro the keys. but i still use it cause i like the left extra keys when gaming
---
We used to summon him all the time in our premade AV groups. The key was to buff him and let him be the tank. He was also healable. Epic times.
---
Yeah I should clarify. I'm definitely not someone who tried to be toxic to get a rise out of someone else. I'm more of the friendly banter type while poking fun at people when they say something ridiculous. I'm not about that toxic life!
---
Stockades is going to be one hell of a corpse run
---
Go deep bm for intimidation and beastial fury. Your pet will destroy your enemies in pvp, and mobs. Also get the 2 point talent that regene 2% health every 10 seconds, pays off over the long run.
---
I think people are confusing viable, optimal, usable and garbage.
---
Tank be farming ironfoe for ever
---
True but they are  an overplayed race
---
Thats a weird thought to me. I was 16 when wow came out and i played a ton but..... Rank 14 seems almost like a badge of "i dont have anything else going on outside wow" and i couldn't ever be jealous. WoW has become the kind of game that i almost can't derive pride out of, and the thing i am proud of are more performance based, not commitment based (like trying to top dps charts consistently in 5man dungeons for 40 levels).
---
I ran scholo every day with full best in slot priest gear. Dark runes are great. There is also strat-live farm groups that farm the pearls. 
---
The original experience was addicting. I expect this go through, albeit less awe inspiring than the first, will also be addicting. It's a slow reward-based game and I feel empathizing the community aspect, which this sub can help do, will make it still fun.

yes.

Wasn't there some sort of hunter pet (gnome knight) in Stormwind wich was possible to tame for horde players only or was it in a later expansion?
---
It truly depends on what you would find most enjoyable. I've struggled with a similar problem where I wasn't sure if i would main a Mage first like i did when i started, or main a Warrior which eventually became my main and i had a blast in both PvE and PvP.
---
So far i've decided to main a Mage first in order to get to a higher level with much more ease, then use it to farm gold to make the leveling/gearing of my warrior a bit less of a pain, and eventually make that my main. 
---
It's a struggle and as much as people can give you advice, in the end it's all up to you. You're the one that will be putting in all the hours, so make sure you enjoy every second of it!
---
I ran SFK approximately three million times back in my day and never saw the Deathsworn Captain spawn, so I'm pretty sure he's just a myth.
---
I will also turn up on time, know the fights and have 0 interest in playing feral or balance.
---
&gt; No like...future expansions of retail wow. So the game isn’t terrible but new
---
Stop being blind.
---
Yes Wotf is significant for pvp, op in fact. But berserking is very strong in pve for damage, and could maybe help in pvp a little bit but very difficult. Although Wotf is also good in pve because of the amount of raid fears.
---
It's not terrible but Icy Veins doesn't exist in vanilla by the way.
---
huntard.

Or demonology warlock

It's shit. And I'm not your dude buddy.
---
Is the peon smiling very awkardly or is it wearing green bandana? We will never know.
---
Damn, you just changed my plans. 
---
Appreciate it! It's such a no-brainer for me to main mage because it was my first character and the play-style fits me so well. Deciding on an alt is so brain-rattling lol 
---
Fucking Bingle’s tools.
---
Yes. And I think it's a bigger deal than people realize.
---
I remember feeling overwhelmed a lot during Vanilla. I was never quite sure how to do something and was not confident that I'd ever have the time/skill/connections to do it. I wouldn't say this was "fun," but it made WoW feel enigmatic. I was amazed when I finally got a mount, hit 60, participated in a successful raid, etc.
---
With our collective knowledge (and, more importantly, a wiser internet with much more readily available content), it's just so simple to look up *exactly* how to get from A to B. I'm sure Classic will be fun, but without the mystery, I know it won't be magical anymore.
---
Of course when your rotation is literally spamming frostbolts, negligible differences is all you have. Assuming everyone has similar gear and is using the same consumables, the damage meter ordering is determined by who has berserking and who squeezes in one extra frost bolt by risking pulling agro at the beginning of the fight.
---
If you still haven't decided by the time classic comes out, you will surely have your answer as you're leveling your main! :D
---
TBC also did a lot wrong:
---
\- butchered worldPvP that could occur in any zone.
---
\- started the atrocity that is easy and hardmode by introducing normal and heroic mode
---
\- flying in general
---
\- mini game PvP, the first step taking the massive out of MMO being pitching you with 2 others against 3 foes instead of having at the very least 20 people invested into the premade fight (WSG)
---
Vanilla with TBC class balancing would've shat all over TBC to be honest.
---
Yes, but in exchange.... they cannot actually kill anything themselves. Its a strange trade.
---
The UBRS key was also a resistance ring that was somewhat useful in late game raiding.
---
There were certain pulls that where if you timed your feign death perfectly half the pull would reset and the other half would aggro onto your tanks. It was all about positioning / timing. Just made some of those pulls a little easier for us 
---
I feel your pain! I played a rouge in classic. Switch to main a hunter from BC to retail. Played a lot of mage in cata, and have been playing priest lately. At least you know what you’re gonna main! Haha. I have no clue yet! 
---
thx guys :)
---
Undead have a horrid mount and you'll be a clone of 1000000s of others

oily blackmouth -&gt; black mouth oil -&gt; free action potions, a pvp and wpvp staple

---
deviate fish -&gt; savory deviate deligh, huge money in those
---
night fin for a +mp5 food buff, squid for the +agi food buff.
---
Also, they might have the sage fish recipes in, which are fishable food that gives both +hp and +mana simultaneously, awesome for leveling your hybrid class.
---
And then you need fishing to do an optional boss in ZG.
---
So yeah fishing is pretty useful
---

There's no point in trying to argue with someone with the username "Atheist_n_fkn_proud". People who loudly inform everyone they're atheist and need everyone to know are just as annoying as religious zealots. Just look at his comment history too. Dude's the dregs of reddit.
---
It is working, but I don't think there is any software going on (can't see any in task manager), it's just like having two USB keyboards connected at the same time. I like the layout of it because 5678 are above 1234 so I can reach them quicker.
---
hot biscuits, i haven't seen that page in over a decade. can't believe it's still up.
---
Totally agree on Master of the Elements. Sometimes the need to Evocate at the end of the fight can totally suck, where an extra scorch or fireblast would have meant surviving.
---
It sounds like whichever way you go, it's hard to estimate how much damage you are pumping out depending on which skills you are able to use and how often. Like it would be nice to use math to see how much damage 3-4 scorches, 2 FB, 1 CoC  would do using a crit differential and comparing each talent build. Or I guess you could just duel a lot with a damage meter running. Hmm. 
---
Warrior is also a hybrid class, yet as it stands is the only viable tank and the best dps class in the game. 
---
It really depends on you. I personally prefer healing classes because I enjoy and tend to do well in that aspect of the game. It's also easy to find groups. Rogue is the most fun to level imo (albeit I've never liked playing range DPS). Stealth can make be a big help in questing and WPvP encounters (or avoiding such).
---
Our Paladin class officer for my guild had Thunderfury. I think he'd got the pieces early on in another guild, but that always seemed shady to me. Maybe that was before people knew how important it was to give those bindings to a rogue or a warrior.
---
locks and mages mad at me cause I got me some clothey drops
---
Who cares? If you're min maxing then it's UD for PvP or Troll for PvE.
---
With todays knowledge that could be a valid argument, but when I rolled a druid in vanilla I had no idea I was gonna only be brought to raids for innervate, (when it was a talent and feral/moonkin was even worse)
---
Another one of "waaah people say my favorite game is bad upboat me"
---
Vanilla compared to BC is a steaming pile of unbalanced dogshit and the only reason why there is so much interest in Classic is because retail is an even more stinking pile of dogshit. And I only support and will play  Classic precisely because I want blizz to make an BC option, so I piss right the very second of BC release off.
---
Smash that downvote button to vent, my dudes.
---
I sure hope so!
---
Just put 2 points into improved sinister strike as combat daggers, and keep your best blue sword for farming, or pick up a  Brutality Blade when MC is on farm and nobody needs it. You don’t lose any dps as the other option is 2 points into the dodge talent. Still kind of sucks at pvp, but you can farm just fine, definitely much faster than a heal spec can. That said, actually trying to farm with a dagger mainhand and having to gouge and circle around for every backstab takes forever and is not worth it other than for the novelty.
---
I wonder how many semi-hardcore and hardcore raid guilds in Classic are going to require pserver experience or will actually pserver guilds who jumped servers as a unit.
---
Not really. AFAIK it gives +10 to all resistances, and it's _real_ easy to find more resistance than that on a ring. Unless you need more than one resistance in a single fight, of which I can't think of any examples. 
---
Yeah I guess it is true that I'm lucky to at least know what I'm gonna main.. hopefully you can decide soon. There are a lot of guides on YouTube about what classes to choose, although they haven't helped me choose my alt yet :P
---
Highly depends on what you want to achieve with your Hunter or what your toons role is.
---
Last Hunter I rolled is an Orc but the next one (when classic comes out) will be a Troll. This toon will really just be a farmer/gatherer for my main and will be BM specced. Troll is a good choice for this because they constantly regenerate their health, they can pop berserk to speed up the farming, they have beast slaying which is great if you want to farm leather and their bow spec is good to reach the hit cap w/o much gear.
---
What I recommend: If you are a min-maxer you already made your choice. If not: Choose the one you like the flavor of the most. In the end it will come down how you play and what you do much more than the race you picked. Hunters are very easy to learn but hard to master, so your ability will have a much bigger impact than the racials in just about any situation.
---
Yeah but the healer dont go oom when the ele shaman burst down the mobs so fast.
---
I think you guys are expecting pserver launch of 15k population...but it's not going to be that.
---
Process of elimination. I would say majorly switch it up so that your alt really is a different character - that rules out the other pure ranged DPS, so not a Warlock or Hunter.
---
You're probably going to want to easily mail stuff back and forth, so that rules the Paladin out.
---
Here's where it gets trickier. Are you interested in healing? If not, and you want to ever raid on your alt, you should probably rule out the Shaman, Druid and Priest.
---
That leaves Warriors and Rogues. Again, depends on what you want to do, but both would be solid choices as they're so unlike Mages. Obviously this is just a rough guide, but hopefully it helps a little.
---
He wasn't the rarest spawn (i.e., long spawn timer or rare chance to spawn in instance), but Humar the Pridelord was incredibly difficult for me to tame as Alliance in Vanilla.
---
He's a rare black lion stealthed under a tree outside Ratchet with an 8-12hr timer. Anyone with business in Kalimdor would swing by and troll the hunters in wait. I think I camped there for 2 weeks IRL. 
---
Never responded to that my man. 
---
That's why you got flying at 70...because you needed flying to fucking level in Draenor
---
What are the most fun healers to play while leveling in your opinion? I plan on leveling my alt with my brother so he will likely be the DPS. Maybe healer will be the way to go for me alt-wise
---
i honestly think Blizzard will try to balance the game more and make all specs viable or atleast somewhat viable. 
---
Do you think theyre just going to release vanilla and not touch it?
---
I would fight tooth and nail against curse of elements including nature damage and elementals replenishing mana in raids efficiently, because that would mean their LB and CL would 100% be nerfed, because with their current vanilla damage and these buffs they would blow mages and warlocks right out of the water damage wise. Combine that with totems and you would only take as many mages as you need for AoE and stack the rest with elemental shamans.
---
But I want my elemental to wreck face in PvP, therefore I dont want him changed. 
---

---
Wrexx elemental shaman nuking Rank14 warriors losing 10% health himself. 
---
pewpew.
---
(͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Feralas always seemed huuuuge to me. Way bigger than other zones, even though it probably wasn't.
---
Why don’t you go back to your home on Whorde Island. 
---
Full holy raid spec is actually 35 points in holy tree.
---
The biggest difference is the 5% crit obvously, not only does this give you bigger heals but also remember any heal that crits costs no mana.
---
 It's more important if you are a tank healer, if you are a raid healer not so much. 
---
For farmed content you can definitely get away with not being full holy but for progression you should be at least 30 points in holy. 
---
&gt;Do you think theyre just going to release vanilla and not touch it?
---
 They said already they are not going to balance anything out for people wanting it. 
---
Eh, arena destroyed awesome full fletched group PvP. 3v3 is a pitiful shadow of 10v10 or 15v15 premade PvP.
---
ratedBGs shouldve been the way to go to actually keep the massive in MMO.
---
I legit thought it was a spell from the beginning of the game. My bad. Also fuck, I was really counting on that one. 
---
I definitely prefer to level with a decent pvp spec. Kicking that guys ass who trys to kill you while you are questing definitely outweighs killing mobs 15%faster imo
---
20 to 30 points holy (31's fairly useless) isn't too big of a difference, but it does affect mana regen.
---
Pally healing effectiveness comes from free heals from crits. Going from 20 points to 30, you're losing out on a) a guaranteed, on-demand crit from Divine Favor (a good oh shit button) and b) 5% crit from Holy Power.
---
Early in progression, that 5% extra crit is important to avoid going OOM on fights. Less important as you get more crit on gear later, but still good to have.
---
So slightly less powerful healing, and less mana regen.
---
I'd rate the specs "mostly fine, probably" for raiding.
---
You're the fucking man. Thank you for your service! I'll be the ex-girlfriend's friend who is trying to get you two back together. You don't have to take things too fast, just have fun with out with the time that you have available. Nothing wrong with doing things that make you happy right? ;)
---
It's not the number of roles that matters but the number of players willing to run it. A vanilla server would sometimes struggle to find anyone of certain roles interested in doing a specific dungeon. You often just did something else if you couldnt find it.
---
Abandoning Azeroth was also very sad. You got couple cute zones, reducing the game world to a pittance of what it had been before. 
---
In vanilla 60s were out and about pretty much  everywhere in the world.
---
STV to go to ZG, doing the sunday fishing bonanza, Desolace to look for Rexxar for 20minutes, Gnomeregan to farm Crowd Pummelers for druids, killing lvl 12murlocs for PvP nets etc. etc.
---
By abandoning the huge game world, they reduced it to what Outlands offered which was like 20% of the vanilla game world.
---
Fair, but posting this doesnt help anyone.
---
I'm more surprised by the fact your cousin let you play for that long. 
---
I would've let you level to 3 or 4 then kicked you off to continue my own grind hahaha
---
For me it was my friend letting me level a Tauren Warrior. I only saw him once every weekend but we had already worked out a schedule for both of us to level on our separate characters. One of few times where watching someone else play the game was equally enjoyable!
---
Thorium
---
I still use my merc stealth stealseries today!  I even bought a backup one before the prices got too high (still in the box) Incase this one dies on me. 
---
Yes. Considering thats exactly what they said they are doing. They might make a TBC server too, but they were clear, they dont want to manage 2 or more mmos. So classic gets released and thats it. No more balancing after the fact.
---
&gt; really makes you think
---
It makes me think he's playing a warrior
---
Yikes
---
I had no idea this was a thing back then. Probably makes sense to implement the change you're talking about so it's no longer possible to do this!
---
DID SOMEONE SAY 
---
no.

This is whats weird about the game. You be a blacksmith because you want to make stuff, not because it benefits you in some economic way in game. I'd try and keep my blacksmithing as high as possible because I wanted to make items that i could use. I could find items and I could buy them but i wanted to make them as often as i could. 
---
Do it because its fun.
---
&gt;The most notable "there is no way this build happened in vanilla" thing that comes to mind is some of the feral druid stuff where you **abuse** several low level effect items with power shifting to suddenly become a top dps
---
Using an item to give you the intended buff given by that item is not abuse. We know how the item works from videos. It gives 50% melee haste and that is fact. We also know that haste enchants are supposed to work for feral druids, and we know that items with on use effects are usable in forms.
---
So what is your actual goal here?
---
Ele/Resto Shaman can fit that role fairly well without having to pay the cost to respec. You wont be a great healer as 30/0/21 but you should be fine to heal through most of the early content
---
&gt; There has been absolutely zero mentions of any changes being done to class specs by Blizzard.
---
Dude, the VERY FIRST panic on this subreddit was about a Blue post suggesting that Blizzard would be open to class balancing.
---
Short memories.
---
I defo think Blizzard will fuck up, ofc i hope i'm proven wrong. Some of the people i've talked to sound like they hope Blizz fucks up. 
---
&gt;Mechanics under the hood were a ton of guess work. Things like scripting for encounters and hidden values like boss armor were just done with some real sketchy things like old raid videos in 144p  and for boss armor a screen shot of maxeana from vanilla with beast lore used.
---
I hate this armor argument. It's completely irrelevant because you can always reduce the boss armor to 0 with the debuffs currently being used on private servers.
---
&gt;Fast forward to 2019 and I'm an adult, a captain in the military with multiple deployments, have my own condo, a strict gym routine, a pretty serious girlfriend...and the urge to throw it all away and give in to the dark thoughts of pulling all-nighters with my cousins/brother running dungeons and pvping while eating pizza pockets and neglecting the rules of basic hygiene.
---
It's weird to relate so much to someone on a web forum 
---
I've got 2 bests.

The best feeling of accomplishment was when my guild downed Anub'rekhan after wiping 4-5 times with the MT and hunter class lead doing the aspect of pack kiting. We were about to give up for the night, last attempt, they decided to change it up and use the off-tank ( wassup Varos) and myself for the aspect kiting and we got him on our first attempt, holy damn I felt like the hunter king that day. Nothing quite like being the hero for 39 other people, one of my fondest gaming memories to this day.
---
The best troll moment was when my lvl 58 warlock alt won the roll for t2 helm during a PuG ony my guild was running. I remember going out of my way to do the attunment quest for the xp and hoping that would happen. Oh the salty salty tears of the other 2 locks. I felt like a troll God whilst linking it all over IF. It was certainly incentive to hit 60. it was great going from random green crap helm to t2 instantly when I got there.
---
yes, of course they do.
---
There are essentially two sets of books: One "set" drops in aq20, while the other drops in various dungeons.

Completely agree. If you wan't reworked classes in Classic then you don't want Classic. Very simple.
---
Wait, do you live in inner mongolia?   I can't think of any place in the world where two years ago you couldn't find  a 2900 Mhz Dual core for like $20-$50 
---
&gt; Never responded to that my man.

I don't remember that, did all classes have that?  (I was an orc warlock)

I'm just waiting for one thing:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bupagiROLV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bupagiROLV8)
---
Certainly not, but it felt more spread out who did back then. PvEers were generally the worst, while organized PvPers mostly knew the importance of binds and movement. I think this Warrior ultimately became too comfortable being pocketed for so long that he didn't fully develop from trial and error.
---
Won’t be on a pvp server so they won’t have to sneak.
---
Good point. I wonder what % it would take it to make it good.
---
Waste of time. These people know they are wrong, so they will never engage with your request.
---
IDK man, I know macros for stance dancing were a thing back in Vanilla, I used a macro for weapon swapping as well.
---
But things like the "hamstring method" of leveling and a real intense focus on maximizing APM through keybinds is more of a modern optimization of the system.
---
I'm surprised everyone is saying you need these things to be good, cause we certainly didn't back t hen.
---
speak for yourself ud mounts are my favorite besides an orc on a kodo. if you like Raptors over glowing horses with skull armor ally seems like the place for you
---
Almost no buffs!  This guy is a caster and he only has a druid buff, imp buff (which does nothing) and a couple of paladin buffs.  
---
No Mage buff   
---
No Priest buff  
---
No alchemy pot used

etc

Do what the smart people do, 'downgrade' back to Windows 7. MS is going to support is for 2-7 more years. I used win10 for about a year and am so happy to be back with 7, the last good Windows version.
---
i have one still in my closet with the wow set, the F key no longer works on it, no clue why it went out.
---
It wasn’t design in there, so anyone could do it. 
---
When the game was first released, the global cooldown trigger for looting was AFTER the loot was opened, not before. So it you turned on autoloot, you could walk past something and right click to loot it and your character would animate you kneeling down to pick it up, but you let walking and got the loot without stopping. 
---
It was more of an animation bug than a designed function. 
---
Later, they frontloaded the GCD so that you’d right click, GCD, then the loot window would open. 
---
&gt;correct Armor
---
That means 0 armor, because thats what you get with debuff. All data points to bosses in vanilla having lower armor than they do on private servers anyway.
---
Couldn't agree more, however, I would still be curious as to the individuals in question's choice to not play classic over a pserver.
---
No, and that's part of the allure. Vanilla didn't have dailies, once you made it you earned the right to chill and raid log and play some other games.
---
depends on what you want to do. if you like to do all three things (leveling/dungeons, pvp, raiding) then priest is king.
---
personally i think that priest is the best vanilla class. it is fun as hell to level as any spec, pvp and do dungeons with. in addition to that all 3 specs are useful for end game so it largely comes down to personal choice unlike for majority of other classes where you're pigeonholed in a single spec.
---
druids and warlocks are close to priests and also fun due to their diverse talent trees and play styles.
---
&gt;   I can't think of any place in the world where two years ago you couldn't find  a 2900 Mhz Dual core for like $20-$50
---
Iceland, $20 is like the possibly cheapest tablet. You won't get anything capable to run WOW for this price.
---
PLUS, the main point, electronic stores are closed at 1 AM. :Ð

But, that's the prices for most of Europe, Africa and America. The only place I can imagine, where it could be cheaper, is China...

---
&gt;I just wish pserver players weren't so invested in the notion that pservers are a perfect recreation of vanilla and that they're innovating on some kind of changing meta in order to validate their accomplishments.
---
Are you kidding me? This subreddit constantly jump on every opportunity to tell pserver players their servers are broken beyond belief while refusing to ever list any specific instance of something that are broken, or by listing some mechanic that can be proven to work correctly.
---
I'm sure there are private server players that actually believe everything is working perfectly, but you cant honestly expect pserver players to not get defensive when this subreddit seem to spew nothing but hate and lies our way?
---
I'm nearly finished making a comprehensive paladin healing spreadsheet so here's a mathematical answer:
---
In pre-raid BiS a standard full holy spec paladin, using all relevant consumables except demonic runes and without being world buffed, can spam max rank flash of light for 72% of a 6 minute fight and does about 161.4k total raw healing during the fight. Without divine favor and 5% extra crit they can use it for 68% of the fight and their raw healing drops to 148.6k. In this case whether or not the paladin actually will be required to finish their heals often enough to make this matter is questionable.
---
Basically if mana is an issue a paladin gets a bit less than 10% extra total healing from those talents. If mana isn't an issue then it's worth less than 2.5% extra healing due to the extra healing from crits, which is often overheal.
---
&gt; What's going to be the difference between these Paladins 
---
The difference is that one paladin is to lazy and greedy to respec for raids on the expense of his guild friends.
---
Thank you! I will definitely consider priest. I need to do some more research on them. I considered warlock also
---
Being 15 and swimming naked in Darnassus on my female NE priest during the beta for classic. The...uhhhh...animations...... &lt;_&lt; were gorgeous and the game felt so liquid smooth compared to DAoC. At first I didn't like WoE cartoony look and color palette but those.....animations..... &gt;_&gt; quickly grew on me.
---
Yeah warriors are a massive hole in that logic. Top tanks, top DPS, top PvP class. Being "hard to level" does not remotely offset their endgame advantages. 
---
I just accept that Vanilla is imperfect, but fun as hell. I don't pretend that Vanilla class balance was some perfectly designed, logical, intentional state of affairs by the dev team. But I do enjoy it more than any expansion. 
---
&gt; If it isn't there then it wasn't there.
---
Except that is objectively false. The Classic demo demonstrated that Blizzard themselves got plenty of things wrong. Spell crit damage, enemy mobs parry/dodge percentages, various skill scaling and behaviour. It's was a pretty long list.
---
The thing is that Blizzard are not copy pasting the 1.12.1 mechanics. They are just adapting the modern server/client to behave like the old game, which means it's unreasonable to expect them to get everything right. Their main advantage is having the ability to go on the 1.12.1 server and check the correct behaviour if something is off, but it's naive to think Classic is going to behave 100% correctly from the get-go.
---
I think what you are describing is a restoration druid lol
---
rock, paper, scissors design is the whole point of a MMORPG. diverse and unique classes that fill gaps and cover other classes weaknesses were the reason why people enjoyed it in addition to great story.
---
i don't want to play a class that does the same shit as others do under different spell name and effect. i want to be brought into group for something unique that people want (see WF totem).
---
that's the whole point of playing a MMORPG.
---
You should definitely play the one you wanted instead. I think for classic to succeed, people need to avoid getting stuck in the "this doesn't measure up to exactly how I had it before" and focus on making new experiences. 
---
Why do you presume to think Joana was some god tier players whose leveling times can never be improved upon? He was fast alright, but you can always improve upon a record. You can improve even more upon a record set over a decade ago.

I know Iceland had a rough period after the banking crisis, but surely you would have been able to find such systems in any recycling store or even the local junkyard (I am not saying people throw these in the trash, but in a modern country like Iceland they would bring them to the recycling yard, or whatever the equivalent is in Iceland,. 
---
&gt;Pservers players don't need any legitimacy.
---
The arrogance displayed by some of you retailers is astonishing.
---
I love this post.  Reading how people got into WoW is my favorite.
---
She's not toxic. You're lashing out because you're afraid of commitment.
---
Also, rolling healer or tank will net you some friends. Being a team player will make you friends. Being a rogue or mage and just killing everything that stands before you is great...... but it doesn't help make you friends.
---
A lesson that took me years to learn.
---
Received one on my birthday from my parents back in BC. Was the first and last time they ever seemed to supported my gaming. Never got used to it. Unless my father has sold it second-hand (a lot of stuff has disappeared that way), it should be pristine in a box somewhere.
---
Adding on to this slightly-
---
From having mp/5 on gear, you can reach a point where you're basically guaranteed a nonstop FOL spam assuming you have blessing of wisdom, and around 20% spell crit
---
At some point you have so much passive mp/5, flash of light spam max rank = (3*140) = 420 mana per 5 seconds.  
---
So let's say 20% holy crit = one out of 5 spells are free mana = 20% less overall mana used per 5 seconds = (420 * .8) = 336 mana used per 5 seconds
---
Max rank blessing of wisdom = 33 mana/5 = basically exactly 300 mana/5 seconds used with endless FOL spam after 20% crit and BOW.   So basically 60 mana per second
---
So let's say you have a mana pool of 6k mana which seems about right for a healy paladin somewhere around BWL with raid buffs.  That means that it'd take roughly 100 seconds to completely deplete your mana pool not wasting ANY GCD on anything besides flash spam.   If you want you could even downrank FOL but then you start to get to a point where being super efficient means you aren't actually doing as much raw healing.  With enough +heal on your gear this is probably best though and with downranking you can sustain casting WAY longer. 
---
Divine favor means a crit holy light as well- so two fewer flash casts (takes 3 sec for the holy light of course) + 4kish holy light crit heal if the guy actually gets low. 
---
It's easy for ret to heal in dungeons with this attitude IF the group isn't making bad plays and having DPS pull aggro etc.  Blessing of light on the tank, BOW on yourself, and FOL spam is easy and very efficient single target. 
---
Back to downranking- if you use rank 5 FOL it is 60 less base healing for 25 less mana, rank 4 is about 100 less base healing for 50 less mana.  
---
Rank 4 FOL could be sustained for ((90*3)270 mana per 5 sec to cast, -20% spell crit = 216 mana used per 5 - 33 BOW = 183 mana used per 5 sec= 31 per second = 6000mana /31 mana per sec =  193 seconds = *a bit over 3 minutes!!*   
---
Blizzard can say all the right things in their dev panels and I'll still think they will fuck it up. I just don't trust them anymore.
---
Stealth sucks without MoD. You wont be able to get it most of the time. It feels clunky and is not worth the time investment. Upgrading bags and skinning is enough.
---
Priest &gt; Spriest sounds like a good fit for that. Spriest is easy and very strong 1v1 while you have mana, but you OOM quickly, so prepare to drink a lot and not be able to contribute very long in long team engagements. Though you could always just heal in those team scenarios.
---
As mentioned, 30/0/21 Ele Resto is a spec that lets you heal in PvE while playing a support spec of DPS/Healing/Dispelling/Utility in PvP, as well as solo capability. It's versatile, but you won't see huge damage from it unless you're hella geared in BWL+ gear.
---
SM/Ruin Warlocks and MM Hunters are both specs that are viable in PvP and PvE. I think there is a Druid and Frost Mage spec too, but not 100%
---
That's why the whole #nochanges thing is a joke. They could have used this opportunity to start from zero and try to evolve the game into something different from the joke that retail is now. A second chance to take every mistake made in 15 years and go a different path. #nochanges is like going back in time and choosing to the same fucking mistakes because of the nostalgia factor.
---
This is someone who actually knows things about Vanilla, not some content creator looking for a cash grab like Tips
---
tBC deserves a "full" fleshed out time period just as much as Vanilla does.  It felt like it was hardly out for very long before WOTLK came out.
---
Vanilla was available for 26 months.  BC came out in Jan 2007, and then Wotlk in Nov 2008, for a total of 22 months, but Wotlk was announced on Aug 3, 2007, just 7 months after BC came out!  Wotlk lasted from then until December 2010 (25 months).  
---
I'll admit, I just looked this numbers up, and fully expected BC to have much less time available than the others.  It felt like we had such a short amount of time to do the endgame content, and then boom, Wotlk was upon us.  I remember being so hyped for Wotlk, and remembering how obsolete my T2, T2.5, T3 gear had became at TBC launch, that it really killed any desire I had to push endgame content beyond Kara, Gruuls, and Mag (I think I got into SSC, but not far).
---
Anyways, I'm playing a tbc server now on the side and really enjoying the class balance, to your point OP.  Every spec is viable, yet the 1-60 world is still so vanilla! I have 2 *major* problems with TBC though: separation of 60+ world from the vanilla world, and the introduction of flying.  These both had a major detrimental effect on WPvP.  
---
So edgy
---
Haha yeah I will play ally man. I was surprised to see in the mount thread so many people enamoured with them to be fair
---
Stick around, you'll find this whole sub for the most part agrees with this sentiment.
---
In a vacuum. Where mobs are just sitting there alone, waiting for you crawl to them in stealth and garrote them.  
---
SS costs less energy than garrote, you don't waste time crawling in stealth, it can also crit and proc sword specc.  
---
The only q u e s t i o n a b l e thing here is your logic.
---
&gt;Classic will simply be better if min/maxing and BiS lists are reset
---
Do you honestly believe we wont get new BiS lists after one week? Most of the PreBIS items are super obvious choices that you will use regardless of what happens.
---
I think it depends on how much you plan on raiding and how much you plan on playing with your pocket healer friend. If your friend is going to level with you and/or play with you a lot and/or you're going to raid a lot, a warrior with a pocket healer is the bees' knees. If you aren't planning on raiding a lot or want more lone wolf capability, then definitely rogue since they're easier to level and don't lean on gear as much as warriors do, and are way stronger in world PvP if you don't have a healer.
---
As a Paladin player. Seeing those 5min Blessings makes my skin crawl
---
Call me crazy, but it shall be fun...at least for a little while :)
---
That addon was actually called Necrosis, not LunarSphere.
---
But you were kill High Elves as Alliance?! Before BC they were not Horde allies
---
with every tier of raid gear I could try to solo more  in dungeons. That was just a nice single player game experience.
---
With others I kept going for reasons others already listed in detail,  gold making, recipes and helping friends.  But it did slow down. At first you do a dungeon every time you play.   Come home from school / work -&gt; log in -&gt; join dungeon group.    Later it became more a 'once a week, let's do a dungeon' thing.  
---
I totally expect Blizzard to rework things tho
---
but maybe like a year after release
---
There's so much wrong about this... getting into it all is not worth my time. You're free to play the game in any way you want. Just don't whine when your /played to 60 turns out to be 20 days. 
---
He did address these disadvantages. He calls out that a DW warrior will have higher max threat than him, at the expense of survivability. He talks about the crushing blow myth. Honestly, crushing blows only matter on a few bosses and don't matter on the bosses shown in the video.  Naxx might be on farm status but he is still tanking it fine with no Naxx gear.  
---
"Druid tanks benefit more from world buffs and gear scaling in general due to their threat being based on multiplying damage rather than mostly flat threat modifiers. Similarly threat is more likely to be an issue for warrior tanks when world buffs are up because it boosts their raid's DPS more than their threat. Druid's survivability and mitigation is also improved much more by world buffs than warriors. "  
---
This entire paragraph is very, very questionable. I think you need to provide some proof for these claims. Why would druids benefit more from world buffs? Warriors are the big winners from world buffs because of their scaling. The vast majority of their threat comes from damage, not flat threat modifiers. Thats the whole reason DW fury warriors pull ahead of druids in terms of threat. Their damage gets massively multiplied when they are wearing stats gear.  Why is threat a bigger issue with world buffs for warriors than druids? That makes no sense, warriors scale harder off world buffs than druids do, especially when DW fury.  Why is a druid's survivability more improved by world buffs than warriors? Another claim that makes very little sense.
---
Problem is the things that make the Classic crowd happy would likely alienate the Retail crowd. The changes they can realistically make are pretty limited. For example, the #1 issue I have with modern WoW is LFG. Never going to get removed.
---
aah yes, the one that inspired LunarSphere
---
I actually think that works out ok. You would need a lot of warrs even if they sucked at DPS. They’re also melee, so not ideal for every boss. 
---
thank you for your service, Captain! 
---
So you say that posts need to help people? You realize that this is a forum, a place for people to exchange their THOUGHTS. 
---
Something that can play the game for me while i'm at work. Maybe have it set so i can raid every 12 hours or so by clicking a button. I can look at my character and change his gear or maybe even just reroll his race/class/faction/server.
---
Definitely have a feature where I could pay to skip that 12 hour timer, just in case I need to spam AQ40 runs again and again until something decent drops. Actually, could they incorporate a feature where I can just buy the loot directly? I dont know why retail doesn't have that yet, now that I think about it.
---
Plus, leveling is a pain so maybe there could also be a thing I could click on every 30 minutes to gain a level? I'm almost never at my computer and my phone doesn't leave my right hand ever so the app would actually be my only way of playing.
---
Professions would need to be worked in too, maybe i can click on a picture of a mine and then maybe click on a (large)  forge and it levels my blacksmithing? Blizzard has pictures of anvils at HQ, right?
---
Could it have little icons to represent raid encounters, maybe a little kel'thuzad sprite? Ooooh that'd be cute. 
---
There are other features i'm sure but this all would be a good start. Maybe throw in an opening cinematic that would help me understand what's going on in-game, though. Something pretty long, maybe 90 seconds, but with very little dialogue. I tend to zone out when people talk for longer than a sentence or two, but WoW has a super simple plot so that should work nicely.
---
Good question, OP!
---
&gt; you would have been able to find such systems in any recycling store or even the local junkyard (I am not saying people throw these in the trash, but in a modern country like Iceland they would bring them to the recycling yard, or whatever the equivalent is in Iceland
---
yes, for 300$ at least.
---
Because if they'd get less than 100$ for junking it, nobody would even care to deliver it.
---
I take that Malfurion was taken huh :)
---
Maybe it's just me but something I find to be underrated is how each class looks when shooting their weapon.  I tend to choose NE Female because they actually look like an archer versus the sidearm style of the Male.  Same goes for Troll, etc.  Seems silly but to me that always played a factor.
---
Bring back extended weekly maintenance and server queues!
---
That’s fair, and I agree with you entirely. Still, there’s a lot that could be done to make retail better. I’m all for taking the ride in Classic, but my hope is that I can return to retail for its next expansion.
---
Anal [Thunderfury blessed blade of the Windseeker]!
---
Hmm, weird.
---
Never called you stupid, those are your own words.
---
Its an example of how you can lose trust in someone, not even supposed to be an exact copy of the example.
---
Let’s try again then: Your favorite tv-show makes changes which you dont like, you’re being vocal about how you don’t like these changes but season after season they make changes you dislike.
---
Do you not lose trust in the producers?
---
Now there’s an example that’s exactly the same.
---
I bet you have stopped watching something because you feel the direction is wrong. And considering your lenghty posts here I bet you were vocal about it.
---
I hope this cleared things up for you as I think this is something most people can relate to.
---
Probably Priest. I plan on leveling with my brother as well and we're planning on a Priest/Paladin duo (not exciting but we can heal/tank dungeons up to 60 and switch to both heal for end game content) or Paladin/Warrior.
---
Stratholme will never not be running all the time because of the farming mats and undead side for the mount 
---
Mostly because they're the same person.
---
This is awesome thanks! Do priest or warlock next!

Tank is bae for druid go rank 13 gear the banging gear and tank all the things. Get to be the sacrifice on vael.

I see what you’re saying, he worded that awkwardly. He wants future expansions of retail with vanilla Philosophy in mind￼

this is the only question you need to ask yourself - Is she hot?

What about the bag of marbles [https://www.wowhead.com/item=1191/bag-of-marbles#comments](https://www.wowhead.com/item=1191/bag-of-marbles#comments) 
---
Basically everything you listed can be part of "pre-raid" or BiS farming. None of what you listed is a constant thing you'll need, like tokens and modern things that modern dailies reward. 
---
* Scholo: Skins of Shadow - You can generally get enough for your enchant in 1 run. Also, people who need skins specifically will really only want to clear to Rattlegore and kill Risen Constructs. 
---
Supreme Power Flask Recipe - Unless you're farming it to sell over and over (which isn't even close to the best way to make gold), you'll only need to get this once. 
---
AD rep comes pretty easy and once you hit exalted (if that's your goal) then you're done. AD rep can also be farmed in the open world but not as efficiently.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
* Strat UD: Frayed Abom Stitching - Same as Skin of Shadow.
---
Baron Mount - Sure, I can see this as a legit reason for people to continuously run Strat UD. However, once you get it (lol), you're done. 
---
NR gear is in the same boat as pre-raid bis farming.
---
* UBRS: Ace of Beasts - Same thing as pre-raid bis farming. 
---
Titans Flask - same as Supreme Power farming. 
---
Felstriker - again, same boat as pre-raid or BiS farming.
---
* Dire Maul (DM is Deadmines btw): Books is a one time thing as well. 
---
Tribute buffs aren't dungeon runs. Guilds very quickly clear the king and leave the dungeon open for raiders to zone in, run for their buff, then head to the raid.
---
* BRD: Ironfoe is clumped in with pre-raid or bis farming. 
---
Dark Iron Ore farming can be done in open world or even solo inside the dungeon. People won't form a traditional dungeon run just to farm Dark Iron Ore or talk to the TB reputation vendor.
---
&amp;nbsp; 
---
As you can see, there really isn't anything from dungeons that will have people continuously running them after they've attained full raid BiS, or pre-raid BiS. A lot of what is listed here can be attained DURING the pre-raid BiS dungeon spam as well.
---
Yeah. I loved vanilla but to me BC was when the game saw so many much needed improvements.
---
Because clicking always mean you react slower to everything you do, since you have to physically move your mouse before being able to hit the abilities. It doesnt matter in a supercasual guild, but if you intend to play a higher level it absolutely does.
---
warrior like yourself!
---
just outside ashenvale (i think)at level 15 I discovered the PVP vendor to get a cloak bracers and a Trinket!! i didn't have any trinkets !
---
starting doing more and more BG's paying more attention to better gear and seeing twinks with awesome gear!
---
I forget the best level 19 twink 2h a two handed axe starting with Night I believe?
---
anyway second best is the glorious prospectors axe! both of these godly weapons were way out of my reach being a newbie on his first character with very little gold. 
---
reach level 19 and I decide I'm just going to BG 19 - 20. going into Orgrimmar auction house which I still remember being impossible to understand! but I knew how to search for weapons. with just 15g to my name i clicked on two handed axes, and would you believe it, prospectors axe buyout 15g.. (normally like 50-100 if i remember rightly). so i spent all my money and back into BG's.
---
last WSG finishes with a strong win I ding level 20 and bang top of the leaderboard 'Watershard' (yes i called my orc warrior watershard) and bang that was it for the next 2-3 years of my life I was addicted to BG's.
---
Bracket BG's used to be so so strong and so much fun. (bar the night elf hunters and dwarf paladins) haha.
---
The skins / stitchings aren't needed as much if they are doing the 1.12.1 ZG enchants idols rather than the old way.  Still needed for focus pre-zg and rockfury etc.
---
Well said. Also, fuck flying.
---
I personally love the place. I find the scenery amazing and the music is so tranquil. 
---
started playing as Vanilla was closing never got to 60 before TBC release. great times
---
I was pretty sad to hear you say you'll main Warlock when I was viewing (nearly all) your YouTube videos. Have you changed your mind? I would love your reasoning for switching (if you are) since I am also torn between the two classes. Thanks for your efforts!!
---
I was actually leveling a Tauren Sham on a pserver to get ready for Classic, but will be going Orc at release. The stun resist is just too good.
---
I bought exactly that when WOW first dropped..... aaaand it was already way out of date the day the game came out. Paladins has different talent specs in the guide vs in game and tons of numbers were wrong. It was useless.
---
So how much are they worth today?  I think I have to start looking into exporting them.  (I can easily fill a sea container of dual core desktop machines, for free, so it would just be the shipping costs and the local transport cost gathering all those systems from business that throw them away)  They usually are given to some charity organization if they are not scrapped for the metal parts  here 
---
Unlikely. Unless you are filthy rich. And I'm not talking about a couple of hundreds of gold, I mean really rich.
---
The High Tier Enchantments will always create a demand for running Dungeons for materials.
---
Not even counting the rare drops people will hunt for glory, vanity or just gold.
---
And for this demand, there are never enough Tanks it seems.
---
You don’t like the kamahamaha troll?!?
---
Its definitely that way on my pserver, and a quick google suggests moving autoshot was added in 2011 (but maybe I misread)
---
This man's logic is too powerful.
---
I kinda like it, it’s more of a love hate relationship though. I mostly make dwarves as they’re just my favorite race but after my 2nd one, the story is really boring, frustrating, and just not fun to play through. It’s very generic and nothing that stands out and leaves a positive impression. The quests are all either kill or collect quests with nothing unique besides the brief moment you fly in the helicopter which in itself isn’t that amazing. I love the atmosphere though, the music is great and the artwork is awesome. The wintertime style is amongst my favorite zones and have no complaints. I love Ironforge  and it’s probably my favorite city. It really fits the theme of the race and looks fantastic. Overall I’d rate Dun Morogh a 7/10 just for the looks and feel. Not very fun to actively quest and level in, but very fun to BE in.
---
My horde character will definitely be a tauren shaman.
---
Pal ret have the same speed (doesn't stack) in talents.
---
I guess you could argue for feral druid too.
---
Other than that, i agree with you.
---
Dude who are you talking to?
---
Leveling only in instances seems avsolutely horendeous - far from the engaging experience I had in the world. And I never raided in TBC, yeah Gruuls lair. Once. Aside Karazan.
---
I see a LOT of problems with TBC - dailies, tokens, too much instances, flying, the world shrinking. I even give you that pvp/arenas/resilience started to become rediculous and I prefer vanilla. So remove flying or change it fundamentally. 
---
I was a casual / MC raider at the end of vanilla, and I remember how that fealt, not fun at all. Pvp was dead for me, due to naxx epics etc. and the world was becoming one big alt fest.
---
TBC, early on, was so awesome and I absolutely loved it, in spite of its many sad flaws. I simply had a great time. I want TBC after vanilla, becayse I want to relive parts of it. I don’t buy that a gane can be perfect for hardcore and casual players, nor that if you want the absolute most hardcore experience, you should have that. Sorry. 
---
Yes you also want another boots with mithril Spurs for chasing on mount.
---
Yeah, that was me. Glad you enjoyed the old stories/history.
---
Honestly having 4 other friends to run 5 mans with is way more fun than running raids. So we would farm together and were very casual about it after raids/gearing. 
---
I used to run dungeons as a means of passing the time and making money, whether it be selling the materials on the AH or being contracted by lowbies for easy runs. That and my guild just like doing dungeon runs for a fun guild event.
---
On top of that, I've always been a set collector so I wind up running dungeons regardless.. Still disappointed I never completed my Devout set before it was made unavailable.
---
I can't really see what people liked so much about BC and at this point  I'm sure there's just a lot of people rehearsing what they heard other people say.
---
To me BC was already the beginning of the end and the game got exponentially worse after each x-pac.
---
The old world got invalidated
---
The new world was ugly af, smaller and except for a few zones and the cholor scheme was very aggressive and tiring.
---
Raids were tuned down from 40 to 25
---
The introduction of "baseline cookiecutter" materials like Primal XYZ. Vanilla had some of those in the form of Elemental XYZ, but there was much variety and the need for lower lvl materials as well.
---
Introduction of dailies. Some people like this, but I found it to be tedious and the beginning of timegating people out of content and rewards.
---
The dungeons were tuned down in size as well, boring and much less creative than before. (Caverns of time anyone?)
---
The only good things about BC to me are the class balance and some raids like Karazhan and BT, but I wouldn't want to trade Vanilla for it. 
---
Vanilla feels more thought out and connected. The only thing people can really bash it for is class balance and rotations.
---
Yup. 1/8 classes being the best at 2/3 roles is ludicrously stupid.
---
Yes, all of my paladin healers ran around in plate. Even the few ret paladins that existed back in the day wore plate.
---
"As a level 5-6ish warrior"..... "A few hours later around level 8" .. haha, leveler slow you are ^_^
---
Full Berserking + MQG is pretty absurd.
---
You're conflating the issue. I didn't say that *every* item was replaced at the first quest hub. You might as well say the holocaust never happened because not *every* Jew was killed.
---
Flair does not check out.
---
Flasks, Righteous Orbs, Pristine Hide, Aces, Stichings, Skin of Shadows, Librams. You also need to visit certain dungeons to craft things, such as the Black Anvil/Forge in BRD and Alchemy Table inside scholo (unless you can get a cleared BWL ID)
---
And where do you think they got the idea? From launch servers.
---
Brother I am the same way E-5 in the military and I am going to take two weeks of leave to power quest my warrior to 60 in my two weeks lol.
---
Honestly back in the day it was pretty damn rare
---
If solo Trib runs are a thing, isn't hunter is objectively the fastest gold per hour method possible?
---
I would add flying as #2, even devs mentioned several times it was a mistake they can't get rid of nowadays, just delay it because people is so used to it.
---
Not to mention the zones in BC looked like ass with only a few exceptions. 
---
I think a lot of people simply started in BC or were still lvl 20 before BC hit so they have a stronger connection with it. I cant see how you would trade 40 man raiding, a connected big world and all the good dungeons for the coke light version of the base game which is also much uglier overall.
---
People give too much emphasis on "balance" imo. They constant crave for balancing was what ruined the game in the first place.
---
A significant amount of even a dual wield fury warrior's threat comes from flat threat from heroic strike and sunder armor. While all of a druid's threat comes from multiplying their raw damage by their threat multiplier. Since all of this threat is from maul and swipe, which have an additional 75% threat multiplier, which is also multiplied with the baseline from bear form and threat talent which is equivalent to warrior's multiplier, that means a dual wielding fury/prot warrior tank needs to get 75% more DPS from world buffs than a druid tank does to benefit as much from them.
---
[Info on threat if you're curious.](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=16499)
---
Druid's survability benefits more from world buffs because many of them boost stamina by a lot, which druids get more benefit out of than warriors.
---
&gt; Hardcore players leveled in instances in TBC
---
Bro, what? Dungeons give absolute trash exp/hour and the rep grinds are easier in lvl 70 dungeons anyway? Some people like to try to get revered before 70 but honestly it's just slower. Hardcore players would not do that. 
---
How does a warrior heal?  They are not a hybrid
---
Then you didn't want classic in the first place. Why are you even in this sub when you have no interest in the vanilla-vanilla game in the first place?
---
Anal [Raw Meat]
---
***T-t-t-tilted***
---
What does the title have anything to do with what you wrote 
---
Why does trib farm require respeccing?
---
If I recall correctly the design idea behind hybrid classes was that they're worse than pure classes but they provide buffs to compensate. If Hybrid classes were as good as Pure classes they would probably have to turn all that on its head. The pure classes would need the buffs to compensate for their lack of flexibility.
---
Link? To either the blue post or the reddit thread. I am in here every day and have never seen any blizzard statements regarding being open to balance changes
---
Now let's see the evolution from 2019-2006.
---
Outland has so much content that requires flying. So, not so simple. Also the continent disconnect from the &lt;60 world kinda sucks too
---
They said they only want to release it and then "maintain" it. Literally no other resources for it other than the ones needed to keep it running.
---
But who knows if they'll actually stick to it. They said they would never officially sell gold either and look at it now...
---
They were all over Azshara and Winterspring on the Frostwolf server.
---
Just because a bear gets 2000 HP from world buffs and a warrior only gets say 1000 doesn't mean the bear got more survivability from wbuffs. The warrior has more mitigation from Defense, Armor and possibly a shield. Never mind all their defensive cds. Last Stand, Lifegiving Gem, and Shield wall all make the 1000 HP more effective. It is not clear to me that a % increase in stamina is more beneficial to a druid, at all. 
---
I'll read your source before I reply on threat.
---
A rogue? What?
---
I know, I’ve watched them all which has made it worse😂  I want a rouge mage and priest at max. But I really need to put all my time into one😂
---
Your thought process is actually identical to mine. I had to check to make sure I hadn't actually written the post!
---
Hi, /u/Shibalgnome
---
100% Correct - listen to this post^^
---
Had some people arguing against this yesterday, absolute madness.
---
PvP and World PvP specifically is an integral part of the vanilla experience and you would be doing yourself a huge disservice to roll a PvE realm.
---
That video is excellent haha
---
Awesome post haha
---
Yeah, raid-geared people will rarely run a dungeon for any single one of these reason. It's the sum of all of it that can make it worth it. 
---
You made some mistakes:
---
&gt; Skins of Shadow - You can generally get enough for your enchant in 1 run.
---
&gt; Strat UD: Frayed Abom Stitching - Same as Skin of Shadow.
---
You need 2 enchants (head and legs) and you'll need a new one every time you replace one of those items. It's also very possible that you're not the only one in your group who needs it.
---
&gt; NR gear is in the same boat as pre-raid bis farming.
---
In my experience, people tend to ramp up their NR gearing as AQ gets closer. Which means MC/BWL geared people will be running dungeons more often. I guess you have a different experience. 
---
&gt; UBRS: Ace of Beasts - Same thing as pre-raid bis farming.
---
1) Beasts deck doesn't get good until you have a pretty massive amount of spirit, which you don't get until you've raided for a while. 
---
2) Depending on patch progression, it might not even be in the game for a while. 
---
3) The Ace can be sold for lots of money even if you don't care about the trinket. 
---
&gt; Dire Maul (DM is Deadmines btw)
---
sigh
---
&gt; Books is a one time thing as well.
---
The good ones sell really well. 
---
&gt; Tribute buffs aren't dungeon runs.
---
What are they, then?
---
&gt; BRD: Ironfoe is clumped in with pre-raid or bis farming.
---
Ironfoe is rare enough that a lot of people will be pretty damn geared before they get one. 
---
&gt; Dark Iron Ore farming can be done in open world or even solo inside the dungeon. People won't form a traditional dungeon run just to farm Dark Iron Ore or talk to the TB reputation vendor.
---
Yeah, they won't run BRD for _only_ these reasons. They're just more reasons to go there in the first place. 
---
The difference between hemo and combat isn't nearly that large. I leveled a rogue with hemo about a year ago in 6-8 days /played. I was focused on making progress most of the time, but not racing or using a leveling guide. I even did lock picking, herbalism, and alchemy while leveling. Those tips sound about right to me.
---
To be honest people are shitting on these old "pros" a bit too much.
---
If you take into account that this was not the hyper information era like today and the thought of "getting pro" in a video game wasn't really a thing for 99% of people like it is now, the guy is decent.
---
He found a clever way to not have to use as many different keybinds by keybinding his action bars, so he has like 3x 1-5 bound which is pretty much covering most of the warrior skills anyway.
---
You have to see these things in relation to how players were BACK THEN, not with how they are right now. You can say the same thing about League Pros from Season 1 and compare it to now and you'd think the same thing.
---
Compared to the average player back then, this guy is decent, and his holy pally seems to be aswell.
---
It's easy to look back on old footage of players and judge them for it but some people are getting a bit respectless. 
---
&gt; Your favorite tv-show makes changes which you dont like, you’re being vocal about how you don’t like these changes but season after season they make changes you dislike.
---
&gt; Do you not lose trust in the producers?
---
Were those changes asked for by most of the viewing audience? Did they state they were going to be making the changes and then follow through?
---
Then no, I'm not losing trust in the producers.
---
The problem here is you're confusing not having trust in someone, and not having faith that they'll go in a direction you personally want. Those aren't the same thing.
---
In Blizzards case they have stated very clearly that they want to make Classic a genuine Vanilla experience. They want to bring back what the original feel of the game was.
---
So no, I don't think there's a legitimate reason to question this. Not trusting them doesn't make sense because they've followed through with what they've been promising all along regardless of whether it was what you personally wanted. Not having faith in them to come to the right choices doesn't make sense either, because they're openly describing exactly what we as a community want. So at that point it's just cynicism to assume they'll fuck it up, not a legitimate loss of trust.
---
The problem is people trying to dress up their cynicism as a demonstrable loss of trust between the player and developer. That's bullshit.
---
&gt;I bet you have stopped watching something because you feel the direction is wrong. And considering your lenghty posts here I bet you were vocal about it.
---
I'm not sure why you keep feeling the need to try and subtly jab at me. It's pretty transparent, and it doesn't make you look clever. Just makes you look like kind of a dick.
---
But no, though. If a show or game or something isn't going in the direction I want I just move on. I don't go crying on internet forums because they didn't follow the direction I individually wanted, the masses be damned.
---
It's gonna be rough but fun! :)
---
Good point man! Deffo will go on a PvP server! Free content and epic moments for sure :))
---
For me, it was my dad.  I was about 10 years old when WoW came out. I was in to video games, as was my dad. When I was really young, I mostly just watched him play games. Then one day he told me about this new game we could play together. It had a big open world, tons of quests and different lands to travel to. There were all these different classes we could play. He played a night elf hunter and told me about pets, which I thought was such a cool mechanic. So I also made a night elf hunter, and we started on this amazing, epic adventure together. Honestly, if it weren't for WoW, I don't think I'd have the relationship I have with my dad. We have this history of such incredible adventures, from hours and hours of Alterac Valley, to travelling through the Dark Portal for the first time together in BC. Gosh, man. It was the best. We were truly best friends (still are, but I am an adult now so it's a bit different). I am super excited for Classic, but I know it won't recapture \*that\* part of my WoW experience, which is a bit of a bummer.
---
I mostly agree, but heroic mode dungeons were very well received and still are today by most people. I understand you're likely trying to call this a slippery slope to 4 raid difficulties we have now. If you want to consider that the game existing is a slippery slope.
---
Current iterations of "hard modes" is definitely not great. Heroic dungeons in BC were not over the top and added more, good, high level content instead of only a couple relevant dungeons at Max level. It allowed the team to not bench new dungeons and keep the content relevant, especially with the attunement requirements.
---
If I had to stop the hard modes at a point, I'd say wrath nailed it perfectly through Ulduar. After that is when it failed. I would also say multiple raid sizes was a failure, but reducing the raid size to 25 was positive.
---
Just because you have a 75% threat multiplier doesn't mean you are getting 75% increased threat from world buffs? It seems all you are saying is that a druid gets 175% threat from the damage they do before modifiers from talents and bear form. 
---
I don't follow your logic.
---
It wasn't my first mmo or even my second. However After the extent I have played it I would say it might be my favorite (tough to replace UO during that time of my life). I got really good at PvP early on with my mage, it kept me interested but I failed for the longest time to push to 60 on a single character because it felt so grindy. I finally got past that point and as I have aged I prefer the pace of play of vanilla to ANY expansion after that.
---
The sense of achievement in vanilla and discovery of warcraft lore ( I was an AoE player not WC) is probably what hooked me. It helped that for the first year I had about 6 real life friends on my home server, and a bunch of other friends spread out on other servers that I would half-heartily play alts on.
---
By far, yes. Though the scripting on private servers isn't necessarily 100% accurate, I've seen people get that run down to sub-12 minutes from entry to exit. The hard limit on dungeon resetting is the only slowing factor at that point.
---
Now that's great hunter PvP.
---
No, it isn't objectively false. That statement is talking about the reference client. Which should have been pretty clear I would've thought, considering the context is a discussion about how people are still trying to argue the warlock pet thing *even though Blizzard already confirmed it in the reference client.*
---
I'm well aware that they're making Classic in the modern architecture. But you do know they have the original code/data in a reference client so they can verify things when they're reported, right?
---
Right?! It won't be though since they're starting with the 7.1.5 client =(
---
For what it's worth: [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5613/staff-of-the-purifier](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5613/staff-of-the-purifier)
---
It's okay. The quests there don't tie into a broader storyline like the Elwynn quests though -- you never fight frost trolls again. The captstone quest related to the trolls involves you delivering a note to a senator saying that the trolls aren't a threat.
---
The main benefit to leveling in Dun Morogh is that the quests grant a lot of IF rep. IF rep is the best because at 60 you end up buying most of your supplies and repairing your gear in IF. The discount helps.
---
They are speaking the language of Gods
---
&gt;  the brief moment you fly in the helicopter
---
The what now?
---
I didn't think I'd have to ask on one of these threads but recently I decided (against my better judgement, oof) to trust that my brother and I will be able to play frequently enough to duo level with each other.  This poses two issues...
---
1) I wanted to play Paladin and he wants to play Horde (I love Horde, I was just really jonesing for Pally life)
---
2) He wants to play Hunter
---
What can I possibly play that will compliment a Hunter? I know the standard advice is "the best class to play is the one you enjoy" but I want to have SOME amount of synergy with him. The only synergy that is coming to mind is...to be honest, just another Hunter. I wouldn't mind doing that, but can anyone broaden my perspective and maybe give me some feedback?
---
To help paint the picture of the grand scheme, I think what we're most looking forward to is doing PVP pretty casually at max and taking the leveling process for all its worth. We're REALLY looking forward to the grind with little consideration for what comes after.
---
It doesn't. It only requires being an engineer with searforium charges and a lesser invis pot, which are well worth it.
---
Viable but not optimal hurrrr hurrr durrr
---
I expect it to be basically the same as when I rolled alts during vanilla.  Of course the thrill of the unknown is going to be gone but then I'm not expecting it.
---
What if I don't want to change your mind?? Huh, what then!?
---
Army E4 here. I started during my weekends in AIT when BC came out. My first toon was an undead warlock. I got to 70 right after Black Temple and remember raiding Kara with my guild also made of people from my AIT. 
---
Do you know what hybrid means? It means multiple roles. It doesn't just mean being able to heal. Warriors can dps and tank. That makes them hybrid. Shamans can heal and dps that makes them hybrid.
---
Haha same
---
I miss the time when games were so good that they would destroy your life. I'm one of those fuckheads that flunked out of my freshman year of college because TBC was in full stride. I *needed* to get Exalted with the Cenarion Expedition for Earthwarden in order to tank at all on my Druid. I *needed* to get more arena rating to get those shoulders. I *needed* all of those badges of justice to help transition from a shitty Karazhan guild to join my friends in their SSC/TK guilds.
---
It took me **years** of working my ass off to unfuck that part of my life by going through community college, part time jobs, then finally another university but I'd be a liar if I didn't say that part of me feels like the entire ordeal was worth it somehow.
---
I know it won't be the same the second time around but if I'm able to recapture a fraction of that sense of wonder I felt by leaving Darnassus and looking behind me to see this massive tree out in the middle of the ocean that could be seen in the distance. That's the stuff that dreams are made of.
---
Where are all these posts whining?
---
All I see is posts complaining about this issue...
---
WotF gives you a huge advantage over priests since their fear has a long cooldown, and of course is still useful against warlocks. UD also gets underwater breathing which can actually be a nice quality of life passive when doing water-based quests or when trying to escape from someone who can't follow you underwater for long. Cannibalize doesn't do much for a mage since you make your own food, but let's be honest, there is no better BM in this game than cannibalizing the corpse of a player you just killed. Try to change my mind, but you won't. Also I think they just look way cooler, they do that little cast dance of theirs whereas trolls cast animation is pretty meh. Berserking isn't bad if used correctly (when your health is lower so you get more haste), but if I were to play a mage I would go UD hands down over troll. 
---
Yes it will! Where are you summer 19! :)
---
The thing is, while current retail players may also be crying super hard right now, they're crying for stuff that is completely different than your average Classic fan. Trying to apply vanilla design philosophies on retail will just burn them hard. The existing playerbase won't like it, and Classic fans still have trust issues right now due to Blizzard's history. At best they could capitalise on the end of Naxxramas and release the next expansion around then, but given Blizzard's release schedule there should be another expansion between now and then. Moreover, it's still a huge gamble.
---
If Blizzard really wants a return to the vanilla design philosophy, they're best off doing so with Classic. Rather than just relaunch TBC, they should overhaul it to not diverge from vanilla philosophies and not add huge mistakes like flying mounts. While I liked TBC for sure, and wouldn't mind replaying it (albeit not over vanilla), I really feel like just relaunching old expansions is a dead end. I for sure won't be playing WotLK again, and it's practically unanimously agreed upon that anything after that is garbage. So why even start with perfect replica's beyond vanilla? Just go with the flow and make a new WoW history.
---
Tldr this game took my teenage years and early 20s and I regret nothing
---
75 mana
---
Understandable 
---
Try taunting a boss 
---
Not even viable
---
Hybrid just means multi-role
---
And a rogue can tank any instance outside a raid but you don’t call them a tank. A warrior is either a tank or a FPS. A lock can tank instanced and also make healing cookies does that make them a hybrid. Warriors are simply a tough dps class and as such are called warrior NOT a tank in the class description. 
---
I know this would never happen, but I would love to see a massive revamp and re-release of vanilla WoW as a new game, with the intention of bringing back some if the things that made classics great, but adding in some of the good things the game has done (The biggest being spec viability). Then start redoing all the expansions with the same goal. I would love to see TBC and Wrath with a new coat of paint and designer more like Vanilla.
---
Smal and marginal
---
People say warriors are hybrid because they can spec for DPS or tanking. I find it disingenuous personally, and never considered that hybrid
---
Mage/Mage is hands down the nuts. Insane kite, cc, aoe, very strong in most PvP situations as well. 
---
Taunt not found.  Please delete your toon and reroll warrior.
---
That's fine, as long as people are also willing to accept just how bad class balance was in a lot of cases.  So sure 1.12 balance means we're getting 1.12 balance but don't pretend there weren't serious issues with it.
---
It's not as bad as you making it out to be. Also I don't see anyone saying that.
---
the lore. 
---
i played a few mmos before (though not so seriously) and was wondering why my friends/fam were getting so hooked and invested in the game. then i played it. the way you are immersed into the world (...of warcraft) was simply unlike anything else i had played up until that point. the in depth character stories, the music and grand  cities, the quests and community. everything was so enjoyably put together i was hooked..
---
and to this day, though i've taken a few breaks here and there, ive never been able to stop playing or loving WoW.
---
&gt; Hybrid DPS still sucked
---
Their chart #s sucked, but you wanted 1 enh shaman, 1 ele shaman, 1 ret paladin, 1 feral druid, 1 shadow priest in every single 25-man raid. That's 20% of the raid being dedicated to mandatory hybrids.
---
&gt; In vanilla you healed instances but the dps specs were awesome at pvp.
---
Lol, ret paladins and enh shamans were not awesome at pvp.
---
That is my point there are 4 hybrids shaman priest Druid and pally. They are hybrids because they “can” heal. A warrior can never fill a healer part of the trinity so is not a hybrid
---
So what we like about TBC is arena / raids / class rework
---
What we don't like about TBC is obsolete content (azeroth, raids, gear), flying
---
how could we get both? OSWoW - .... add raids to vanilla (after 24-30 months) new gear drops minimal stat increase or just rather stat redistribution, new set pieces make "bad" specs viable... add arena... you would still farm old raids for buffs and materials  
---
Agreed, that is what Joana (the famous one who made th guide) says as well in her guide.
---
Same thing for Effective HP for a tank in raids. Basically your extra health on your pet only ever matters if that pet gets nearly 1 shotted and needs that extra health down at the last percentage points, which is not often.
---
Having more armor mitigates more damage and effectively increases your Mend Pet spell as well, since the points of healing are worth more when the pet takes less damage.
---
That's what I thought.
---
+8% speed to boots is the best boot enchant for PvE as well.   You'll save more time grinding/avoiding the fire by moving faster than you will from the extra damage from +7 agi to boots.
---
E4 about to hit my first summer back from tech school, and I can't wait to throw away my social life for a few weeks. 
---
I think they should make it to where they release vanilla, then remaster BC, then Wrath.
---
Your character starts in vanilla and you can keep them there. If you get max level and want to move on, you transition them to BC and they cant go back. Same for Wrath.
---
Dont know if this would work on account of the player base being incredibly split between all three. But it's something I think is cool to think about.

The assumption that warrior threat comes from flat threat modifiers is pretty weak. The majority of their threat is coming from damage, not the flat modifiers. Their damage is amplified by world buffs. It is then further increased massively by popping CDs like Death Wish, Diamond Flask, and Recklessness. I don't think druids can compare to that level of damage scaling. All of that scaling is multiplied when you get world buffs. Critting procs your flurry more, getting crit gives you 25% damage increase, popping death wish is another 20%, recklessness is something like 75% on top of that. So you have something like 45%  dmg increase when enraged and death wished, then all that damage crits if you pop reck.  
---
Which one do you like better?
---
I said nothing of the sort.  If anyone's doing that, it's you taking the fact that MC gear got outclassed fast and using it to claim Naxx gear was replaced by Hellfire quest rewards.  
---
So, go ahead.  Prove your point.  Name 1 piece of gear from AQ40 or Naxx that actually got used in Vanilla which was replaced by a green Hellfire quest reward.  Just one.
---
I had the same issue  --  Tauren or Orc?
---
I plan on going prot at 60, and the deciding factor for me was the Tauren's battle stance.  Upright, shield in front looks like a much better animation for a Prot Warrior than the way Orcs hunch over in combat.  So Tauren it is.
---
Ignoring the defensive stance/bear form and talented threat multiplier because they are the same for warriors and druids:
---
If a warrior does 1 extra DPS with world buffs he gets 1 extra TPS.
---
If a druid does 1 extra DPS then due to the additional 75% multiplier they get 1.75 extra TPS.
---
So a warrior needs to get 75% additional DPS from world buffs than druid to get as much threat from them.
---
I like its peacefulness and especially calm and relaxing music, but the terrain is horrible.
---
Same. I only reached lvl 54 in Vanilla back in the day, and did all of my first-time end game content in BC. What an era. I'm definitely looking forward to experiencing Classic, but BC was what molded me and is what I really remember most fondly.
---
You can clear raids with 39 players.  Therefore, you can clear raids with 39 players +1 prot Paladin.  Therefore they are viable.
---
This is truly heartwarming.
---
I had a very similar experience with my father - but replace encouraging me to play and sharing in my exploration of the world with shutting off the computer and telling me to cut the grass, or calling my soccer coach to find out if practice was actually "cancelled"
---
Trolls regen 5 hp every 5 seconds and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

I mean, put the rest of the points into holy, put on a dress and anything goes? 
---
That's the authentic Vanilla experience right there! 
---
I enjoyed the joke, but it would have been better without the implied political jab. Part of the reason I enjoy gaming is to escape that shit.
---
If you resonate most with hunter but the only thing holding you back is difficulty then I advice you play it and get better along the way.
---
Looking at it after playing countless other games, WoW's lore or world isn't THAT breath-taking for me. But what really got me initially was how many references there were to Warcraft 3, which I was addicted to. For a child like me seeing a freakin ziggurat, maybe the SAME ziggurat I've built in the WC3 undead campain in eastern plaguelands was pure nerdgasm.
---
I like the zone but hate the quests
---
Thank you for the answer mate, you make a very good point! What will you play?
---
Ret is good in PvP, druid doesn't need 4 top tier specs.
---
Stop bein a bitch bruf
---
Lol, no worries, there was plenty of that, too.
---
How do you have Full Tier1 when its your first MC Raid???
---
I believe this is referencing post Cataclysm Dun Morogh where the end quest in Coldridge Valley sends you into a helicopter straight to Kharanos. I dislike how they made it so you don't have to brave the trogg-tunnel.
---
You LIKE arenas? I don't think anyone likes arenas besides current retail players, keep that shit out of the game. I mean even the developer who added arenas said it was one of their biggest mistakes.
---
They completely remove hybrids in TBC which is ass.
---
TBC/WOTLK are bad versions of WoW.
---
Today OP Learned: about hemispheres
---
I’ve got a call coming on this one on the pod soon, just a solid run down on how to take on each class as a hunter from a former vanilla r14 player who was a part of Death and Taxes.
---
Prot pally is viable as an off tank. OT only needs to keep the first burn target busy for 30 seconds and a pally can certainly build and maintain threat for that length of time, the issue is the duration they can stay ahead of the dps, and if your dps actually look at the threat meter there will never be a need for a taunt on a boss add.
---
While this could be done by a warrior or Druid it can also be done by a pally
---
Is it optimal? No. Is it viable? Yes
---
Exactly how it should be. Then comes along TBC and forces you into 41 holy to heal...fun.
---
Pretty sure there was a Glove-Enchant for Riding-Speed too. Thats why some people wanted a 2nd pair of T1/T2 Gloves just to enchant them with Riding-Speed ._.
---
After a couple years of pure vanilla they should do what Runescape does and let changes and additions to the game be put up in-game for a vote by the players
---
Epic question.
---
 
---
I was hooked on Warcraft since Orcs &amp; Humans. The lore drew me in. Huge Warhammer fan.
---
However.
---
Undercity was my Stormwind. 100% with you on that from all the same perspectives, except I didn't have anyone forcing me to pick the lesser faction ;)
---
I met a rogue in Silverpine. Hung out, remained friends. He ended up becoming the server's best geared rogue. I ended up being pretty casual (always have been) but always had superb friendships online. It comes natural to me.
---
So natural, that I met girlfriend 1 on Unreal Tournament. After 5 years broke up, and met number 2 on World of Warcraft.
---
She's Australian, I'm Dutch. Moved to the other side of the world for her. Since broke up, but it was a pretty good relationship for 6 years! Still friends too.
---
So that. :]
---
For dual wielding tank warriors the opposite is true, druids get even more effective hp point for point than their superior stamina modifier would suggest. For example based on the armor values shown in the character sheet comparison section of the video, a dual wielding warrior is taking 50% more physical damage than the druid due to having lower armor. While the druid takes 9% more damage on average due to lower avoidance, and 10% more damage on average due to not having defensive stance.
---
Funnily enough i found that in pvp paladins work really well with hunters.
---
Paladin heals and buffs and gets whaled on while the hunter is mobile and plinks everyone down
---
i meant in comparison to other games i had played as a kid up until that point \^\_\^ now, many years and games later, i can say there are a lot that are comparable to the lore in WoW (though to be honest not many i look at with such fondness)
---
but i agree about the Warcraft references 100%
---
The worst thing about this is that you KNOW the toxic ex-girlfriend is going to be sleeping with your cousin and brother again, just like last time, and yet your going to go back to her anyway.
---
That website is rad! I could never find my first character on the armory so it's nice to find a record of him. That's pretty cool to see.
---
people are so excited thinking they can play whatever spec they want but they need to realize it’s a rerelease, everyone will be playing with an optimal raid come endgame and it probably doesn’t include your ele shaman and feral druid.
---
cute
---
Same FPS back in the day, too.
---
Feign death walking was my favorite, just a flat corpse moving around on the ground.
---
TBC arena was tons of fun. I am sure there are others like you who don't like it but there are plenty of non-retail and retail players who would agree with me. I will say I played nearly every expansion when it was current but only TBC arena was fun to me. By the time WOTLK came about class rework was when class identity became so blurred that every class had some form of the same spell as another class. Like every class had a super instant heal, every class had cc, every class had a way to break cc.
---
Warriors can pop stoneshield potions and other protection potions mid fight, changing these numbers a bit.
---
Anyhow, this still doesn't show that a druid is getting more survivability from world buffs, or that they would die faster than a DW fury warrior if they lose world buffs.
---
Sh, just cut your losses man. It's ok to be wrong sometimes
---
Dude you're like 14 years old and a rampant racist. Leave.
---
Lots of shit added to OSRS was put in the game without players consent like a huge homosexual pride festival with new items and such 
---
Warlock and hunter are good in pve
---
Take my upvote sir!
---
In case you play retail, remember too that in classic, Shadowmeld is not usable in combat. Really makes the racial unimpactful.
---
Except I am not wrong. I been playing vanilla since the original beta and have only heard of warrior being called a hybrid in the last few years. It’s crap. A hybrid means a character can be in ANY of the trinity rolls. A warrior does not fulfill this requirement 
---
Get out of my head, I'm having this exact discussion with a buddy right now. I can't decide between the two races. I may have to make both on a pserver and let their animations decide. Anyone have a preference as to which animations are better?
---
Yes, you will always run 5 men dungeons, doesn't matter the gear.
---
Vanilla is not retail, where all content, except the current one, is useless.
---
Reasons to run 5 men dungeons, ESPECIALLY when your are very well geared :
---
1. Gold farming. 3 men party stomping any 5 men dungeons, making nice gold, especially if one is an Enchanter.
---
2. Reputation farm. 
---
3. Helping guild mates alts / new members to gear up.
---
One of the reasons why I, personally, still run dungeons even after being T2+ geared, was to simply help newbies. And to have them look at me in awe tanking 2-3 packs of mobs.
---
Yeah, there are plenty of reasons to run dungeons, no matter how good your gear is.
---
Played warcraft 2 and 3 a whole lot. 
---
Super excited for WoW. Played a druid in the open beta. 
---
Didn't sit well with me to keep paying for a game I already bought so I didn't get it right away.  
---
Played around on my roommates account when he was asleep. Got to around 30 hunter before I figured out if I got my own account I could play during the day AND night! 
---
Found some friends at college that played. Raided all the way into WotLK.
---
I’m actually even referring to the turban which will be probably the best piece of gear for warlocks beyond some raids. I’m not super knowledgeable on bis lists but I know warlocks need a lot of hit gear and this is one of the few head pieces that has hit gear, a lot of sp and intellect. 
---
Dm gear I’m okay with but there’s several pieces of gear that came out in much later patches that served almost as a catch-up to enter the more difficult raids easier. I mean tell me what gear is better than the turban for warlocks for raiding? 
---
Classic kept high level and even lowbie dungeons relevant by other measures than simple gear.   
---
I just brainstorm now for 2minutes and write down why each dungeon was ran even by highly geared players:  
---
LBRS: grinding people through for Ony attunement for new high value guild joiners like healer joining the ranks.
---
Scholomance: flask laboratory and skins of shadow which is needed for +sp/healing enchants and Silithus trinket quests.
---
Stratholme: farming orbs
---
Maraudon: good gold for hunters who can also sell the ring to newbies
---
DM:E: grinding gold for warrior + healer
---
DM:N: buffs
---
ZG: heart and enchantments for head and legs
---
UBRS: some alchemist quit and you need more flask recipes for your guild
---
I would agree that dungeons were run less later in the expansion but they never were wholly abandoned. I got a shaman to level 57 and got invited into a guild. A T2 warrior with fury tank build and 2 1handers took it upon himself to grind preBiS with me.
---
I liked how vanilla dungeons were kept relevant throughout the expansion by various aspects that made each dungeon important and unique to complete often or atleast once in a while.
---
"Raid logging" wasn't coined until TBC and it's why DnT disbanded. Vanilla was designed to keep everyone doing everything. Naxxramas raiders were still clearing MC for Thunderfurys, ZG/Onyxia for buffs, Scholo for flasks, I think Strath for Crusader, and probably other things that I can't think of. 
---
Many bosses are taunt immune.
---
That is awesome news! I have listened to many hours of your content and I look forward to this episode.
---
Also I don't understand how you say the completely remove hybrids in TBC... if you care to elaborate. 
---
The way I see it a hybrid character is one that can effectively heal, spell damage, and melee damage. All of them could still do that in TBC. The only thing that I hated hybrid related was that an enhance shaman become pretty much dual wield exclusive there was no reason to run a 2H enhance shaman.
---
Now if you take the game today with its no talent trees and specs are singular focused on one aspect of the class then yes they have completely removed hybrids.
---
The Dun Morogh music is probably the most nostalgic in all of vanilla for me (with the possible exception of the barrens). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2SZuqyjKtA
---
Though I mostly associate it with arathi since I mostly play horde.
---
I saw some a while ago and the end result of it was that if you were going to be in a melee group then there is no gearing you could do where raid dps goes up when you switch. Even personal dps really only went up significantly on fights like saph where your pet just can't survive.
---
&gt;Horde
---
I would if I could, buddy.
---
hunter compliments... well, everything. druid and shaman are somewhat better when leveling, since both got extra movement speed from level 20 or so, but they have gear issues with leather/mail armor. but seriously, anything works, the squishier the better, since you already have a "tank". for example, rogue in particular allows you to backstab to your hearts content iirc.
---
On retail i use scrollwheel for targeting arena 1, 2 and 3. with alt modifier for zoom.
---
In classic I think I'm gonna use pet attack, move, follow for the wheel and alt modifier for zoom again
---
Christ you're fragile. 
---
Everyone says priests and warriors go together perfectly, why would you take a paladin healer over a priest for a warrior?
---
I'm kind of upset but this wow classic release is making me confront that im not 18 anymore. Kids, career, gym, wife, etc... Ill try and have as much fun as I can casually but I'm just not going to be able to play all night and stay ahead of the curve like id like to.
---
Says the guy whining over other people complaining?
---
I see what you are saying now.  If the warrior lose world buffs, he may lose so much survivability that he has to take off some of his threat gear and stats gear and put on a shield. This could easily get up to the 75% dps number you are looking for. Especially when you consider he may also not be able to pop cds that increase his dmg taken/dealt like Recklessness or Deathwish. 
---
I don't have time to math it all out but I don't think the answer is as cut and dry as you are making it out to be.
---
I feel like part of this is about extending the current world. Adding a whole new section every time just feels empty. It's like "here, start over".
---
Look at H1Z1.
---
That game was killed by itself. They removed the map people had such intricate memories with. They didn't just change a map though. They lobotomised a community. This doesn't get talked about often enough.
---
What they tried with Cataclysm wasn't half bad. They just executed it wrongly, altering the entire map again.
---
I think they'd be more successful if they'd add content slowly. Found a different way to make the money work (subscription +$5/month?) and add smaller bits and pieces more often.
---
Do that, and you're enriching the experience. Continuously keeping players excited. Add a single player level to the level cap every x months. Stop doing huge reworks, focus more on tweaks.
---
Build slowly. This is 2019. Everyone's working in Agile sprints for a reason. Move/fail fast. Deliver quality in small portions. Don't go waterfall and bite off huge chunks that become impossible to predict.
---
Just my 2 cents, after working in software design and user experience for 15 years :p
---
...they can just balance specs in vanilla. Simple
---
Oh my god this sent me down nostalgia lane. I had one of these and I’ll never forget my mom took me to gamestop to get it, and I paid for like half of it in quarters. The employee hated me but I walked out with a smile on my face. 
---
\&gt; The reason that fifty million people player Vanilla was not because they were excited to eventually farm Naxx for weeks on end. It was because there was a big, seamless, magical world to explore. 
---
Perfectly put.  Its like the saying "Its not about the destination, but the journey."
---
First boss you try to tank &amp; rest of the raid will change your mind. 
---
Ah, I must have forgotten the famous priest tanks back then.
---
I get your point ... Somewhat. But gold farming isn't exactly keeping something relevant. You can always run old things to make gold.
---
You're also referencing max level intended dungeons which Heroics served as in BC. Also ZG is very much a raid and had comparable or better loot than MC. 
---
Just do it Capt. You know you want to.
---
You can clear raids with 39 players. So an empty raidspot is also viable and preferable to a prot paladin because he doesn't try to tank thus wiping the raid.
---
You just told me you're incredibly uncomfortable and want me to leave because i'm a "rampant racist".
---
Go suck on an egg. 
---
Elwen Forr&gt;Dun Mor&gt;Tedrasscil for me.
---
Amen! Going to be a glorious couple of weeks going to make a couple play lists of all the popular music back in 2004-2006 and just blast it all on my twitch channel while streaming my grind to 60.
---
I mean, I think it's pretty normal to be uncomfortable about racists, but you do you.
---
I let my wife play the game on the game until she was 60 and raided while I was leveling her other mage on her account...worst mistake I made!
---
And many bossfights require tanks to be able to taunt
---
I used Necrosis on my mage, was super useful. 
---
Maybe!  Still doesn't mean the Pally isn't viable.
---
Just play Cataclysm bro
---
&gt;With the come of cataclysm he is now a level 40 rare mob that spawns in front of the instance door to scholomance.
---
Everyone gets a shot !
---
For your first character, it’s not that surprising, + it’s difficult as a warrior to do 1-10 il less than 4 hours
---
I wasn't going to play Rogue, but it could be a consideration. Shaman could be very fun. Might end up going with that. Druid was my old main in Vanilla so I could always go with a return to form. Hmmmmmmmm....got some thinking to do.
---
Probably a warlock but [who knows, right?](https://i.imgur.com/8sutQbw.png) I like the way they can juggle mobs, dot people down, shadowbolt crits. Level easy. Also gold farming maraudon like hunters and DME like mages.
---
&gt; If hybrids could at the top level of all aspects of the game, why would anyone choose a non-hybrid class?   
---
&gt; Isn't it kind've unfair towards the pure DPS classes if the healers can also DPS as well as them and at the same time excel in healing and even tanking? 
---
There is a big difference between *top* and *reasonable.* Personally I love the tbc approach: *pures* still rocking the meters but dps hybrids having a spot, being valuable. For instance 1.12 paladin is unfair to the originally advertised *holy warrior.* 
---
All hybrids have it unfair: multiple roles but hey, you'll barely get to play one (and that's because only *you* can do it...) in most cases and gear for that one unless you take the effort of picking any scraps you can from raids. You need two, three or more gear sets compared to them but you'll struggle getting any other than your healing stuff. 
---
Blessing of Freedom mostly.
---
Lol the 10k pop private servers made that quest impossible
---
So please tell me if a single encounter a warrior can heal because I can think of several dungeon bosses that a priest can tank namely ras frostwhisper in scholo or indeed most caster based bosses. I know this as I have done flask runs with just two other priests not to mention farming brd arena farm. It’s not optimal but it’s possible if you have capable players, a warrior can never heal anything. 
---
You think you won't, but you will
---
BC private servers always died shortly after opening, simply because not even 1/4th of the Classic players would play that abomination called The Burning Crusade, the expansion that started the downfall of WoW.
---
Nobody stops anyone to raid as any spec. Except top raiding guilds, which is 100% logical.
---
ALL SPECS in Vanilla are VIABLE...just not for everything, because this would be just DUMB. 
---
BC servers will NEVER be successful. Longer lifespan than Vanilla? You MUST be kidding :)
---
&gt; Some specs being dog-shit 
---
There isn't a SINGLE spec in Vanilla that is dog-shit. 
---
Vanilla is not ONLY raiding. In fact, raiding is the LEAST popular activity in Vanilla. And ANY spec you want to label as dog-shit in raids, will be a TOP SPEC in other part of the game, being leveling, PvP , farming, etc.
---
&gt; trolls cast animation is pretty meh.
---
*how dare you.*
---
While this is true, this doesn't happen until tbc. Vanilla hybrids have most of their buffing stuff being baseline so even when full healing have it. And the few out aren't worth enough. 
---
Nice blog post.
---
Legit my fondest memories are Strat45 and UBRS.
---
Just, hands down. With Scholo being a nice snack on the side. (And good for runes on ma priestie.)
---
Does a boot enchant stack with the defilers boots run speed increase?
---
I wanna be like the sonic live action movie and gotta go fast.
---
Also I don’t believe those buffs stack with animal forms :(
---
T1 set is awful for Paladins though. It sucks as healing gear and it sucks as dps/tanking gear. Its only use is for super niche things like Loatheb, or memeing in world PvP.
---
You need to be 41 points in a tree as nearly every spec, as talent trees are much more powerful.
---
This impacts pvp a lot. There's a few exceptions like sl/sl and dreamstate but overall 41 point trees are ass.
---
Yeah I don't see too many people bitching that Balance sucks. Or wants it buffed. Most of the time when I see Hybrids bring up builds myself included, they are aware of them being less optimal and are OK with that. 
---
I will be playing a Druid I 100% know I won't tank, dps, or heal as well as the other classes. And that is ok, as I get a HUGE advantage IMO. I get to do  those 3 things with 1 spec. I Don't care if I can't DPS as well as a fury warrior, Or Heal as good as a Priest. I will have a blast in PvE and PvP with one spec, it will be FUN
---
Once Classic is out for a while, and popular enough, the voices that now ask for TBC will change, asking for Vanilla design philosophy new content.
---
And when this will happen (not if) , Blizzard will do it.
---
Why?
---
Because TBC is not even nearly as popular as Vanilla. We know it, Blizzard knows it...only TBC babies don't know it.
---
But they will know it, once they will experience Vanilla, because they haven't before, and if they did, they did it in a very limited manner (most TBC babies never hit 60, and the ones that hit 60, did it when TBC was already announced, and most guilds stopped raiding).
---
TBC babies believe that TBC was the better version of the game. Well, they can believe whatever they want.
---
Still doesn't make it right.
---
That’s crazy to me but I guess it just comes down to our different personalities. I’ll never forget that moment seeing Kold sitting on the IF bridge in front of the ah. I’m like you are now in that I’ve never noticed anyone’s gear, but I couldn’t imagine feeling that indifferent in vanilla. 
---
Are hunters &amp; warlocks hybrids because they have a laughably niche "potential" to be dps, tank, and healer in one?
---
Mate, you are the only one that takes "hybrid = 3 roles" seriously...
---
How do you know no one is talking about it?
---
&gt; Really, we should all be advocating for blizzard to start developing future xpacs with vanilla design philosophy
---
Problem with that is MMOs are not as popular as they used to be, especially not super grindy ones like Vanilla.
---
There's just not enough profit to be made pandering to such a small audience.
---
Being able to re-progress through vanilla, BC, and WotLK copying character to new realm for each after they finish development would be a dream come true.
---
I want the current untalented uncreative developers at Blizzard to NEVER touch vanillas balance.
---
They will completely ruin it. PvP is nearly perfectly balanced, FUCK raids. If you want to raid as every spec go play retail.
---
I don't want hybrids buffed, I just want dual spec or reduced respec costs so that I don't have to use a half-assed hybrid spec to tank and heal.
---
No I am not the only one friend 
---
Why isnt gold farming keeping something relevant? Some dungeons and parts of them are good for it, others arent.
---
I would even say that vanilla did a marvelous job at keeping even lowbie dungeons important.
---
RFD and BRD are good for rogue pickpocketing.   
---
Mage farms in DM:E and N.
---
Warrior in DM:E jump runs. 
---
Cath you could attack the endboss as mage, iceblock and all come to you, and you then AoE them down.
---
Druids can farm Crowd Pummelers in Gnomeregan.
---
Maraudon is the go to spot for budget AQ40 nature resist gear.
---
These are all bits and pieces that keep even lowbie content relevant for different classes and even specs like Blizzard slow spec by mage or preparation for rogue for double vanish. 
---
It is relevant for endgame content, because you can farm gold that is desperately needed in vanilla WoW (and other expansions obviously). 
---
I like that vanilla didnt have one metric only for dungeons which is gear. They had various important aspects to each dungeon which made it unique, so you didnt watch your iLevel go up and nothing else mattered.
---
I can see that but really I am not advocating for 10 more levels or 41 point talents. Just alternate ways to bring in new content(no outlands) and buff under used specs through items rather than tweaking talents and core play.
---
It was so hard because people shared characters. We had a pre-made PVP group on my server and some of the rank 12/13s were on 24/7.
---
In order to compete you'd either need to wait for them to hit R14 and stop the grind or get others to play your account also.
---
&gt;  I only reached lvl 54 in Vanilla back in the day, and did all of my first-time end game content in BC. 
---
Most people that ask for TBC are like you. They NEVER actually played Vanilla. But, worry not, you will stop asking for TBC once you will play Classic.
---
You missed like 80% of what Vanilla actually is. You and most people like you.
---
Main reason WHY you believe TBC actually is "better" : you missed most Vanilla content.

I keep wishing people would mention this more. WoW was not the 1.12 private server game that Classic is going to be. The weapon normalization change alone is very different from the majority of the original WoW experience. Obviously all the gearing changes and easy(er) and better pvp rewards are different too. People are very quick to say who care about Prot-pally or Balance-druid being crap, but forget the buffs that were handed to Warriors and Rogues (who weren't bad to begin with)
---
its ok in retail the past 4-5 expacs druids constantly had 3-4 top tier specs because whining entitled babies catered to by mommy blizzard
---
I played druid and mage to 60 back in the first time around with vanilla. I struggled with a warrior (prot spec), warlock, and a priest (holy) until i found mage and loved it to bits.
---
I want to give priest a try again because it was my first class in the beta and i love the class fantasy.
---
I know that i loved playing druid and mage more, probably because of self reliance, mobility, and rotations. I am wondering if it will be better doing something new (priest at 60)? Will it be too frustrating to just grind for the same tier sets and accomplishments that i already achieved with mage the first time?
---
And don't forget the level 55 mage food book! 
---
Well, you probably don't know what WARRIOR CLASS actually mean in a PROPER MMORPG.
---
It is the most powerful class...because this is the PROPER MMORPG game design philosophy.
---
The word "WARRIOR" should be enough for you to understand WHY it is a powerful class.

For Fun - EU - Horde - PvE - Casual Raiding Guild
---
Wednesday and Saturday: 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET)
---
For Fun is going to be a more casually and social orientated raiding guild as Horde on a PvE server. This means we will raid and aim to clear all content, but on a more relaxed schedule and mindset. The social aspect of the guild is also very important to us. For too long on retail the sense of community has died in the game and it is a shame. We hope to remake the original sense of community within our guild so even if you don’t raid, you have a home where you can have fun and make friends. There will be social events like hide and seek, fashion competitions, catfish dules and also a Stormwind streaking competition, all with prizes! We also have set up a retail guild on Emeriss Horde if you would like to come and hang there! Most of us rerolled without heirlooms and hope to get to know each other before Classic comes out.

I love it! My first character was a dwarf hunter, and the idea that this short burly guy was living off the land was something my 10 year-old mind fell in love with. Whether I was killing troggs, trolls or Wendigos, I felt like I was making a name for myself amongst my drunken dearven bretheren. 
---
Heroics kept group content relevant. Soloing dungeons for gold does not. Yes making gold is content, but grinding is rarely seen as good content. People cherish vanilla for the community not solo farming dungeons. Building groups for heroic dungeons kept the community together and extended into Karazhan later in the expansion.
---
I'm not saying your points aren't valid, but they're largely not the reason why people think vanilla dungeons are so good and BC heroic dungeons are bad. People will find anything to farm that's easy for them. The old dungeons being good sources was unintended by developers and was simply brought on by people finding the lowest common denominator.
---
I'm worried that the standard in modern multiplayer games of following and sticking to the meta will make Classic WoW feel less diverse.
---
Most of the builds, specs and race/class combinations are viable and useful, regardless of whether or not they are the *best*. I'm worried that people are still going to chew each other out for choosing something they like vs choosing the optimal choice for the meta.
---
For me, WoW has never been about being the best or getting to the top. There are sponsored guilds that dedicate themselves to that. It's a giant game that originally just wanted to be a giant game. Considering any of the content 'useless' or 'unviable' is just a waste of what the game could be.
---
They do not stack. You are free to use another enchant on the AB boots.
---
&gt;Nobody stops anyone to raid as any spec.
---
Imagine being this delusional. 
---
They don't stack with animal forms, but druids can get an extra 15% movespeed while shapeshifted from their PvP set bonus.  Shamans get 15% for ghost wolf from their PvP boots.
---
Problem you get is if you're having to look at threat and stop DPS, you lose raid damage, increasing kill times, increasing overall damage taken, healer mana used (and even dps mana used, lowering damage further), and with longer kills comes more opportunities for people to mess up and die/wipe.
---
Not saying it isn't viable, just pointing out even in non world first guilds hindering the raid "just because it's viable" isn't always a great idea. Making it harder for the rest of the raid isn't a good thing. 
---
It's not about "balance" it's about completeness. Vanilla class mechanics were launched half baked. Has any other version of the game actually had entire patches dedicated to a single class (occasionally 2) overhaul the way vanilla did? Vanilla was very much a work in progress and TBC launched too soon.
---
I'd recommend heading to a safe space then. 
---
You posted a video of somebody flasked and fully buffed doing mediocre dps, which is exactly what the other guy said happens. If that person were not flasked and fully buffed they would be getting out dpsed by the tank. 
---
Exactly, TBC is a fucking horrible expansion and started everything bad about the MMO genre.
---
Gear resets, expansion invalidating all old content, arenas, flying, "Balanced" specs, huge focus on raiding(the worst and least played content in vanilla, btw) just to name a few.
---
I totally agree! Diversity drives a lot of things, and for this reason I’m not going to be a hardcore raider- rather a casual raider who plays the class and specialization that fits me the best. 
---
Tell you what man, you have yourself a nice day.
---
You can’t look at a threat meter in the gcd?
---
I don't want those things.
---
Those were not in Vanilla, and I don't want them in classic.
---
Though I wouldn't put it past blizzard to add dual spec
---
See me at launch? I’ve played plenty of vanilla private servers to the point where the way they release everything looks to be the most popular and reasonable way to emulste the original vanilla experience. We can’t go back in patches when it comes to talent trees and spell bugs with private servers, but they do an AMAZING job releasing gear the way it should. There’s no reason a piece of gear that is better than mc/ony gear from a just a dungeon is available. It was not intended to be there prior to certain content being released.
---
 I could live without classic. They really missed the boat by a few years too many. If it’s not how I believe the game should be then I’m not wasting my money on what looks like an unfinished lazy thrown together game that was created almost 15 years ago and is emulated by random ppl around the world for free. We shouldn’t just be okay with this kind of joke of an effort if they want to capture us as subscribers. 
---
DME stealth farm runs with 2 druids and 3 rogues anyone?
---
Cheers, I love your user name btw!!
---
Variety is the spice of life. Those norsewomen in Midgard looked great in leather.
---
I’m really shocked someone downvoted this when this is so true. You cannot find a better example. 
---
Yeah probably won't happen unfortuantely. I think the most likely scenario, long term, is a new MMO, whether its Blizzard or someone else, that takes design cues from Classic's popularity. There's other trends in modern gaming that make me hopeful for future MMOs - the popularity of sandbox survival games, and tolerance for higher levels of difficulty. People are starting to get tired of easy, ultra polished, games on rails.
---
Thing is, before WoW we would take turns to play on rhe Nintendo or Playstation. That's how we did it. Sure, some games like Halo had splitscreen, but we still enjoyed single player games as a group.
---
Yeah i agree
---
I've not played wow since WotLK. Nice try.
---
And you are arrogant.
---
And I'd recommend going to some of them, as they include schools.
---
Do you even read this thread? The dps was so high in the perspective of this person that they even suggested that the person cheated. If you just gonna troll, please move on.
---
I would, but then there is other software that no longer works with 7! Seems I can't have it all. And honestly, I don't really like Windows 10, it's odd. Obviously they were trying to make your PC feel more like a mobile device and I don't care for it, for the way things are rearranged and relabeled.
---
I found myself running dungeons long after i needed them for gear reasons were helping new guild members get BIS helping get people attuned. Also as a enchanter it helped me stockpile mats alchemists will need to go make flask. Farming strat dreaming for a mount drop. 
---
Do lock!!! This guide was so good.
---
My plan is to play a Hunter but I want to make sure I've got the reasoning right, or if you would suggest a different class:
---
* class that's both easy to level and fun to level.
---
* class that can farm very well.
---
* class that performs well in all aspects of PvP.
---
* class that wears tier gear.
---
Specifically to a Hunter:
---
* I like the pet system and class fantasy.
---
* Excited to do ancient leaf quest (heard its awesome).
---
* Easy to gear as few hunters are in raid groups.
---
Now I know the drawback to hunters is their DPS falls off and aren't competitive on meters, are mostly brought for their trueshot aura and tranquilizing shot, and are largely for pulling and kiting. This I'm okay with because I really don't mind playing utility roles in raid, I'm confident I kite no problem, and I'm not even sure I'll go beyond BWL. At the end of the day, the gear is for PvP, not topping PvE damage charts.
---
All-in, does this sound like a hunter would fit me?
---
You can of course, but like I said if you're having to watch it and more importantly stop damage you're still losing damage. If you don't have to stop damage (because warrior), then you won't lose damage.
---
I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding your first comment though, are you suggesting the pally tanks something for 30s that isn't the kill target so they have time to get threat - or the opposite, where they are tanking something for the first 30s that is the kill target? In the latter case that would be a bigger issue. 
---
Not enough, no that’s wrong. Not as much, I think this is what you mean. 
---
here's a thread explaining it a little better 
---

lolol... she was pretty tough too!

I thought the Silithus one was definitely the hardest though, all that damn shadow damage 
---
Satirical brilliance. 
---
Gold farmers were far from rare in Vanilla, there were documentaries made at the time about them because it was such a big industry. 
---
Warriors are technically hybrid since they can be a tank and also a very viable DPS, sometimes the top.
---
Not enough to satisfy stakeholders.
---
Hybrid is all 3 and a priest isn’t a hybrid it can’t tank. Shammy Druid and pally are the hybrids. 
---
BoP loot trading wasn't in vanilla. 7.3.5 client and all of its graphical options wasn't in vanilla. Modern addons weren't in vanilla. Players with 15 years experience playing vanilla weren't in vanilla.

Your data is based off there only being 4 Lasher packs to kill per run. Others say that's incorrect on pservers and there's like 9 packs per run, plus an extra you can do at high levels in actual vanilla or blizzlike pservers. I'm not sure what's is correct, as I never did it during vanilla. Also, you'd never bother with stuff once you hit the instance cap. You can just logout for the time needed, maybe start on an alt or go do something outside the game, then login when you're able to enter new instances, keeping your /played time low, and your XP per hour high.

It was not at all uncommon for rogues to get TF in vanilla. On my realm it was probably 70% warriors, 30% rogues, with one oddball hunter who was in a guild that gave it to him for the lols.
---
I understand. Doesnt mean i dont love BC though
---
***Cries in rogue***^^or ^^druid ^^I ^^cant ^^decide ^^ok ^^back-off
---
hybrid are classes that can perform more than one role. shaman is a hybrid because it can spec into dps or heals. warlock is not a hybrid because it can only spec into dps.
---
Having Naxxramas available for more than three months, with its unique gear itemization, will be like a new expansion.
---
The latter. Pally tanks the primary dps target as the threat is not the issue it’s the mana dependence that prevents them tanking much beyond a minute. 
---
1 role = pure dps, more roles = hybrid
---
I don't know why that person doubted those numbers as it probably was done on an Elysium/Lights Hope core which are pretty accurate. But just for perspective a fully bis Warrior/Mage/Warlock does over 2,000 dps on similar tests, a Feral druid does about 1700, Hunters do about 1500 if speced for max damage and about 1200 if they are using True Shot aura. 
---
800 dps in full Naxx bis is mediocre damage. And that isn't even considering the fact that your dots will be getting pushed off in a normal raid. 
---
Looter shooters feel like the new MMOs to me, but all have fallen short so far. They have the leveling, the loot, the dungeons and raids, the daily quests, etc. None actually embrace being an MMO though, and they’re too tied down by the DLC and sequel model. Plus they’re all far too short on content, with tiny game worlds.
---
I find the layout of Dun Morogh far more interesting than the other starter zones,  and the quests are good as well.  It is my favourite starter zone
---
I’m right there with you dude. I mean, almost to a T. I’m a Staff Sergeant, working a side job, very strict workout routine, married (no kids), working my BA, studying for my personal training certificate, and trying to start a podcast. And all I really can see in the future is Classic Release. Oh, and I haven’t played since TBC in which I had 3 different mains with over 150 days played on each. 
---
Has to be Paladin.
---
Everyone complains about their Pala buffs in Raids and you have to rebuff them so much and you are a 1 button healer. I healed everyone with one hand in my pants and crushed the healing meters with ease. I think the only guy who beat me, was another Paladin, who didn't even try to be mana efficient he just straight up spammed his 1 healing spell.
---
It's by far the most efficient healer in the game and an incredible powerful buff bot.
---
But my lord, is this class so dull. 
---
Fair point. I'm not familiar with their initial threat to see how it fairs vs opening damage, I do know mana is the issue though. 
---
Yep, if this was 2006 all these people in the comments would have been be getting mowed over by a player like Namishin.
---
Was my experience also yes i ran them less towards the end of vanilla and it usually was not something i needed to do but there were always some reason or another to draw me back.
---
A hybrid is a combination of two or more different things. Like mules are hybrids of donkeys and horses. Or a hybrid drive combines solid state and hard disk drives. 
---
In fact, in the common usage of the word, hybrid typically refers to a combination of only two things, but may also be used for more than that. 
---
Therefore, as far as classes are concerned, any class that can fill more than one role would be a hybrid. Although I am not sure how the consensus on that is. 
---
Yeah, Cap! Come onnnnn. *It's just a game. Come have some funnnn*
---
My condolences to the barracks' hallways.
---
Tank, Hybrid-Tank, DPS, Hybrid-DPS, Healer.
---
I'd say that layout makes more sense, except you run into the issue that Hunters are Tranq-bots in raids and their “pure” DPS is pointless. So what roles exist, and what specs fill each role, is raid-dependant as well.
---
Dun Morogh is by far my favorite starter zone, both for atmosphere and questing, and is one of the only two I can stomach doing more than once. Teldrassil and Durotar are awful for questing/leveling and they tend to feel overbearingly dull after a bit. Elwynn is just always boring. Tirisfall and Mulgore are pretty neat.
---
This is a lengthy one, but I feel like I need to set the stage:
---
Back in late 2005, I was 15 and already an avid video game player. I loved all kinds of games and played on various platforms but noticed that I had the most fun playing games if my friends were playing with me. Playing with friends mostly happened on consoles as offline co-op since the only exposure I had to online gaming was playing custom games in Worms: Armageddon, partly because that was the type of game my PC was able to run smoothly. 
---
My now brother-in-law had at the time proposed to my sister, she said yes, and he had moved in to my parents house before they could get a place of their own. He brought with him a $3,000 Alienware laptop - a laptop that could run circles around my borderline shitty DESKTOP. Being a gamer myself, I was curious about the game he was playing on it. I was watching him play a mid-30 human mage, and though the game didn't look "groundbreaking" to me at the time, but it peaked my interest because I wanted to find out what you could DO in the game (at the time, I was most impressed by games like True Crime: Streets of LA and GTA: San Andreas, for the size of their maps and the number of things you could do in the game, down to sleep and eat). I noticed his player icon BARELY moved on the map whenever he would pull it up, so I was already satisfied with the map size, then he zoomed out and showed me it was just one zone - there are 2 continents worth. As I was watching my brother-in-law play, he was explaining things to me, how you can do trivial things like /wave and /dance for emotes, how you have to kill things to pass missions/quests to get experience and level, and how there are 2 factions that are at war with each other and he is currently on a continent dominated by the enemy faction and is trying to find his way back to the eastern one (my thoughts ALREADY were "Wow! Massive world, plenty of things to do, AND it's populated by other PEOPLE, not just AI, and those people are split into factions that are at conflict with each other? Sign me up!). I asked him if there was a faster way to get around, he told me that there are horses you can get, but only at level 40. Then he spotted an undead mage and decided to attack him to show me the game. Midway through the battle, it was clear that the other mage was going to lose, so he started to run away via blinking and my bro-in-law was on his tail with his blinks. They were essentially blink racing for about 3-5 minutes before he said "Oh shit, I think he is going to one of the Horde towns". "What does that mean?" "Well, there are guards in that town that can kill me, but more importantly, he will probably get other players to help him out". Exactly that happened, and WHOA, the friend that came out to help him was this HUGE MINOTAUR looking thing that was riding some rhino looking thing - needless to say I was intimidated just by the look, but on top of that, he was level 40+, so my mountless bro-in-law was in trouble. The mage came back with his tauren friend and messed him up, killed him and camped his corpse - this is where I learned the death mechanics and corpse running AND body camping and the sly ways you can try to escape body campers by rezzing behind a tree or something and hope they don't see you.
---
Seeing as I was intrigued by the game and was a broke 15 year old boy with no allowance, let alone income, he offered to get me the game and pay for my account until I was able to pay for it myself O.0 Of course, I was on board. I rolled a human rogue.
---
Just knowing that there were 2 factions of players and a conflict between them was enough to get me hooked, but fast forward to Westfall and my quest to kill VanCleef. I asked my bro-in-law about it and he told me that I need to get a group together for it. Ok, he helps me out with that and helps my group run the dungeon as a 35+ mage. We go to Moonbrook and enter a house as we wait for other people to get to us. I walk toward the back and... "uh, you guys! there's like a secret passage back here!". No one responds to my noobness, too busy getting ready for the dungeon. Once everyone shows up we go down that secret passage - "Whoa! Is this where VanCleef is?" "Yes". We keep going through this long mine/tunnel and get to the instance entrance "Holy shit! There's a portal here! Where does it take us?". Again, everyone just goes in ignoring my noobness. After multiple noob fails on my part through the dungeon (including seeing that Smite chest, not knowing it's a boss, running to it before my group was ready and getting jumped by the ninjas). Anyway, my first dungeon run story was posted on Reddit somewhere along with all the hilarious noob fails, but the point is that THAT is the moment I realized the true SCOPE of the game and was absolutely hooked. 
---
Sounds good as long as you are aware that Hunters have a high skill cap in PvE and PvP. Timing abilities in between auto-shot casts while moving and/or kiting, managing the dead zone, intricate CC that breaks on damage while managing your pet. It's a lot to juggle. If you can, you will be a force to be reckoned with. If not, you'll be preyed on by many other classes who have lower skill caps. Definitely a class where your skill will be measured IMO. Hunters also start off super strong but scale poorly with gear as more patches and raids come out. It won't make you obsolete by any means, but other classes will have bigger power gains than you. If you're good with that, sounds like a solid choice!
---
Ummm a quest to go out and collect some weed? Yedpls
---
They already have lol. The sharding arguement we have about it not being an authentic experience is ridiculous. When Vanilla came out there were like 10-20 people in a starting area on launch day due to shitty PCs, shitty internet, shitty servers shitty everything... People think the launch of Nost was the real vanilla experience and not the shit we actual experienced day 1 of WoW...  
---
We're going to get a much more authentic experience on how it looked like back then because of sharding.

Thank God i don't live in the barracks.

Hey now don't say that shit cuz at lvl 14 I got my RED DIFAIS MASK xD
---
This is your last "hurrah".  If you dont have kids yet, indulge yourself in MMO madness one last time.
---
Ok 
---
Think of all the online training you can get done while grinding though! Dual-monitors is the next step for you, SSG.
---
Here is the simple fact: the vast majority of players during vanilla were NOT focused on end game raid content. A lot more people did MC and ZG while the 1%ers were doing their thing in Naxx, and even that amount of raiding was more than 50% of the pop actually took part in. We nerds vastly underestimate the amount of super casual players this game had. This meant that these "horrible specs" we're actually cool and fun to many players. Hardcore raiders are just one small audience within the grand vision of all MMOs. Are they going to be more strongly represented in the classic servers like they are on private servers? Yes and no. I'm sure we will all be surprised by the amount of "retail tourists" that find the classic aesthetic and simplicity appealing.
---
Yeah cap join us.
---
And yet some people get and stay married all the time. 
---
The answer:
---
It's you. It's always just been you. The power to enjoy the same experience in a different light, entirely exists within your own mind.
---
&gt; I'm just trying to get some insight to how this game is when you don't have friends to play with.
---
Make friends then, do instances as you level, and do group quests, be talkative and friendly with the people you group with and add them to your friends list.
---
Typically, people level at similar rates - so those friends you made running Gnomeregan at level 28 will probably be available and willing to clear SM at level 38. This applies to finding groups at 60 too.
---
Final point I wanted to make, "queue times" can also vary depending on your initiative, while spamming in guild/world/trade/general might take a long time to find group , I can usually find group far quicker by using /who. Just search "/who c-"priest" 59-60" and go down the list asking nicely if they will heal for you, and you'll likely find someone much faster than the usual "LFM X need healer" spam.
---
You’re a grownup now, and with your military discipline, I’m not worried that you’ll moderate your WoW playing.  
---
I’m going to take my time.   I’m sure that I’ll “crack out” on WoW Classic after release, but after a few weeks, I’m going to play it regularly but moderately.   I liked raiding one night per week, and that will for my lifestyle.  
---
Protadins saying they're the AoE tanks, except even Warriors are better at AoE because Demoralizing Shout generates AoE threat, has no CD (unlike Consecration which has an 8s CD) and only costs 10 Rage.
---
I like this guys spirit but their initial threat is somewhat an issue too
---
Story of my rogue life. Being the experienced rogue that I am I expect I can shave some time off.
---
Yup the high skill caps I'm well aware of and actual welcome! And as you mentioned, Hunters start off strong, but other classes catch up and surpass hunters, but not to an obsolete level. This I'm fine with, as from what I've seen, a skilled hunter will do fine in PvP with late game gear if they know what they're doing.
---
this would be the smart thing, always have a handful of classic servers that never get expansions, but then give players the option to copy their character onto one of the "expansions servers". Honestly I don't see why they wouldn't do it this way.
---
It’s a place that looks like heaven

As of 1.12, which classic will supposedly exist in for the life of the game, all but tier 3 is garbage for anything but specific hybrid PvP specs. Judgement used to be a pure healing set, but had all of it's healing changed to spell power. Given that the set bonuses aren't all that special, off-set cloth and leather are still BiS until tier 3.

&gt;Name 1 piece of gear from AQ40 or Naxx that actually got used in Vanilla which was replaced by a green Hellfire quest reward. Just one.

For me it was Dun Murogh starting out as a Dwarf Warrior. I actually hate snow in real life but I always liked the aesthetic in games. Being able to be a Dwarf, the master race as it's commonly known, was an absolute joy for me. The world felt so new and alive. Leveling a warrior was difficult but I didnt mind. It wasnt until the end of Vanilla when a group of RL friends of mine rolled horde on a separate server and I rolled a priest that I got to witness, first hand, how truly terrible it is to level a warrior . Leveling a priest is so much easier than leveling a warrior it's borderline ridiculous. 
---
This time around I'm rolling either a Dwarf Pally or  Priest. Now if I can only figure out how to run on no sleep in my 40's...
---
Honestly, I like it more than when I have to go to Loch Modan. Out of all of the starting zones, there's something that I really enjoy about Dun Morogh. Once you get past the 1-6 portion, it is quite a pain though. 
---
What if there are PvE servers? 
---

Epics have been known to drop there as well as crusader enchant.

I enjoyed TBC quite a bit the first time, when it was new, but have little desire to revisit it. All it has going for it is raiding and arena. Leveling was forgettable, neutered world PvP, the zones are uninspiring, and it started the awful token and daily quest systems. 
---
As time-consuming as it is, Vanilla feels like an adventure - TBC is where it started feeling like a job. There was a very straightforward path to getting better gear, and there was always something you should be doing to further that goal. You spend a LOT of time in the same places doing the same things. It doesn't feel like an open world in the same way. 10 years later I have some good memories, but I still don't want to look at Shattrath ever again. 
---
That’s when you pop bubble and hearthstone out homie. Later bitches y’all wish you were a pally like me.
---
Definition of Viable:  Capable of working successfully; feasible 
---
Definiton of Feasible:  possible to do easily or conveniently.  
---
Capable of working successfully? Sure get all your blues and greens adn random epics with + defense gear to be crit immune and let the paladin load up on threat before engage. Sure it can be done successfully... Is is possible to do easily or conveniently? 
---
Absolutely fucking not. 
---
Prot paladin will have to build threat initially for a much longer period than a warrior to hold threat through-out the whole fight. Meaning this isn't convenient at all.   
---
Prot paladin will be stuck in blues and greens through-out the course of classic while warriors will get epics that assist with health, defense, and mitigation skills. Making this again not convenient and quite impossible to do some later content. 
---
Bottom line is it is POSSIBLE to tank in Molten Core and maybe a fight or two in BWL (MAYBE), but to be "Raid Viable" through-out vanilla is definitely not the case. 
---
This whole no changes thing is a partisan purity test. There are parts of the game that are stupid as hell and everyone knows it. Feral druids have to farm a lvl 30 dungeon for hours every week for their BiS item.
---
What's the issue with iteration with a classic philosophy? 
---
*flashbacks*
---
I can suggest Survival leveling as an alternative. Works great if it's an alt you feed gear to. Most will level BM early due to it being superior with inferior gear.
---
The so called melee hunter is gear dependent and I prefer dipping other points into MM instead of BM, but it will force a hunter to learn their class far faster than leveling with BM so if lazy pet tanking is all they want, don't go survival.

---
look at the date... just about 10 days after Classic WoW was announced.
---
That one post created a huge shitstorm on this subreddit and sent the devs into hiding for months.
---
We all play down here. Join us friend
---
&gt; How do you know no one is talking about it?
---
Because they haven't said anything about it? That's generally how talking works.
---
Not being able to even get into raids without much, much more work (or luck) than the other specs qualifies as gargabe. 
---
Noice BB. It's still an "out-of-the-way" thing to do. Still fun!
---
ok. ):
---
Private server yes. Undertuned ? Prove it
---
Hahaha yeah, I know. Probably not worth. If you aren't caring about the end game, I guess it's fun!
---
&gt; Why do you presume to think Joana was some god tier players 
---
The general presumption is that someone who holds the "world record" at an activity is that they are upper-tier at that activity. Why would you presume otherwise?
---
Dun Morogh is a good example of how Alliance zones can often be pretty, but be dull to level in. Teldrassil falls in this area as well, prettier than Dun Morogh but even more annoying to quest in. Elwynn does flow better than both, but it does lead to Shitfall which i despise as a leveling zone
---
Durotar is a butt ugly zone, its brown and orange, but it flows well, it has great music and there is a sense that you are exploring new lands. The Barrens are slightly prettier to look at, but its quests flow well too.
---
Its a shame that Dun Morogh is so bland, because Loch Modan is a decent zone, far superior to Shitfall.

Druids can do DME lashers incredibly easily and hit the reset cap.

I’m so jelly
---
My dad introduced us all to games when we were young, first ever PC games to come out we had them
---
But he never played with us and never got into it himself. I would’ve loved to smash some levels with my dad. Treasure the memory you have of doing it!
---
I like this logic.  I prefer Tauren Warriors when for tanking and Orc Warriors for DPS, solely based on looks lol
---
&gt; Because TBC is not even nearly as popular as Vanilla.
---
So how come TBC had by far the bigger sub count that even kept growing? 
---
Yes where does it say blizzard intend to make changes? It says the topic is worthy of discussion nothing more, also worth mentioning a community manager will have zero involvement in the development as in zero. In this post all they mentioned was community feedback gathering not actually making any changes 
---
Wotlk was a great exp! Classic was okay ..
---
I wouldn't say underrated. It's well know to be in the top 3 levelers.
---
You can talk about any melee combo, but the real answer is: A feral will level faster and easier than ANY MELEE PERIOD. So the true answer is 2 ferals &gt; all other melee to 60.
---
By the time you are in Naxx, you have farmed all the other raids for a long time. Your tanks have all the gear and you probably have a resto druid with a full feral set just because they were there. Yoi dont have to have a bear constantly in your raid to use a feral in Naxx. Also the feral can kitty dps on some fights if they want to.
---
In vanilla?  Having healing spells make you a hybrid, which really just means it makes you a healer.
---
Plus the awe of first jumping into such a massive world.  I remember finding copper nodes for the first time then running about trying to find a skills trainer, for some reason this is a very fond memory for me.
---
Recent content can only come from private servers since Classic isn't out yet.
---
Either you wait or you can ask on /r/wowservers.
---
Classic doesn't necessarily mean only Vanilla Classic.
---
There could be a TBC or Wrath Classic down the road.
---
Imagine needing to respec for anything other than aq40 server first progression or naxx. YIKES
---
Warrior is the only class that can tank a raid, it is a tank and a dps. To not call it a tank because of the class description is dishonest, because Blizzard didn't intend for hybrid classes to be only viable in one of their roles. That was due to time constraints, hence why in later expansions they corrected it as it wasn't their intended vision.
---
Also you are completely wrong about the class descriptions.
---
https://imgur.com/a/32KXR
---
This is an image of the class descriptions provided by blizzard for vanilla where warrior is expressly stated to be tank. Despite this they have the highest dps in the game, which either was not intended, or it made them a hybrid.
---
FFS your an adult. Nothing wrong with pulling all nighters with my your brothers and gaming. I myself was a adult "married with three kids" when Vanilla came out and was raiding till 4am in the morning some days "not everyday". Now im divorced "Not due to gaming lol"and planning on doing the same. And im 45.
---
Dont feel shamed of pressured to do something you want to do. If your girlfirend dont like it. KICK HER TO THE CURB ASAP LOL.
---
Better yet get her to join in on the fun. Life too short. Alot of adults will be returning to Classic WOW when its released. Dont matter what job you have everyone in game is a character/class it will be great. 
---
Right, I thought this sub reddit seemed more active and would also be able to help. I will try there though.
---
You’re making me tear up! 
---
Oh so you know the player capacity that they're planning to use with sharding? Care to back up these claims?
---
&gt; If hybrids could at the top level of all aspects of the game, why would anyone choose a non-hybrid class?
---
No one is wishing hybrids were "at the top". 
---
But they are not only not at the top, they are so far at the bottom that hybrids in a non-healing spec usually don't even get raid spots.
---
&gt; And people who roll a druid and start whining when they reach 60 and don't DPS as well as a fury warrior only have themselves to blame for choosing a druid. 
---
Once again: people are not whining about "not DPSin as well as a fury warrior" but rather being so extremely garbage DPS that they're not even getting a raid spot as a DPS druid. 
---
&gt; I can still have tonnes of fun with feral and balance specs in a more casual environment though.
---
Not in raids though, except by "casual" you're thinking of not clearing any raids (except maybe MC after quite a while) in a reasonable amount of time . Since meme specs are so useless compared to the other specs they're essentially dead weight and need to be carried. Since casuals tend to perform not as well as hardcore players, they'll have less capacity to carry dead weight. Guilds consisting of hardcore players can easily make up for a few meme specs, casual guilds might very well struggle with that. 
---
Blizzard definition of a hybrid back in pre-BC is any class that can do 2 roles aka everything but Hunter, Mage, Rogue, Warlock. This definition does change depending on who you are talking to but the "official blue posts" on forums always referred to hybrids as any class that did more than 1 role. Warriors are technically a hybrid but they seem to be given a special exception. 
---
Classic does indeed provide many reasons for well geared players to still run dungeons. 
---
This drops off dramatically in TBC however. Some of the worst dungeon experiences I've had was due to having a well geared raid player in the party. They can eventually become entirely dependent on their raid rotation and become near useless in dungeons where dynamic and adaptive game player is required.
---
TBC was great as it's own thing, but truly was the first large step of the destruction of the Classic concept.
---
If you are gonna be on a (RP-)pve server with little to no intention of BGs... then Troll
---
In all other cases UD. WotF just too good for PvP on mages. Also actually cannibalize is good in 2v1 situations.... kill one player sheep the other and cannibalize back some health (also good for pve same reason)
---
On a PVP server the better your level of stealth the less time you waste corpse running. With +speed on boots plus 5/5 camouflage there's not much difference between my speed and someone's normal run speed so I'm spending less time getting ganked by higher levels while travelling dangerous routes. Putting 2 points in elusiveness means vanish is up more frequently and in the worst case I can prep/vanish when the two ally hunters try to gank me.
---
There's more factors than that, such as how efficient your movement is and even plainly how much the boss happens to target you. If we're talking actual vanilla, there's also how good you are at your stopcasting.
---
Honestly, outside of Fear Ward and weapon skill racials, there really aren't any racials that are that big of a deal. And even those racials, at the end of the day, factors such as skill or even just consistency as a raider weigh far heavier than those.
---
I think you're right. Looking back, it seems so obvious, but at the start, the expansion model made sense. Leaving Azeroth for Outlands was exciting, even though in retrospect it was probably poor design -- going throuhg all those new zones to level nad leaving behind such a well developed world was a mistake. The same concept for Northrend -- it was an adventire to go fight the Lich King. Even in Cata, the idea of bringing it all back to Azeroth I thought worked nicely; having Deathwing change the map (it turned me into an alt-aholic for that expansio as well).
---
I thikn MoP is where it settled in and I felt like the origional WoW was long gone. Cata changed the world for good and now all of a sudden we were thrust into this entirely strange and new atmosphere (with lots of pandas). It was the moment the game jumped the shark. I think the gameplay was still great, but the game seperated from what it was in Vanilla entirely. And ever since then, it' just ridden the path of releasing what amounts to an entirely new game every two years.
---
It might be too late to go home again. All the good tht's been done has been matched with a lot of bad and I don't thin it can be undone. At this point, I' love to learn about development on a WoW sequel, except I'm not sure where the story goes from here. But I'd love a game tht existed in Azeroth and built-content on gradually, like you suggest.
---
Factual information missing druids can tank, source being my guild ran a Druid main tank in retail right up to twin emperors and that was not the reason for not progressing further. 
---
You gave an opinion, that is wrong, not a fact
---
Bro. Gonna be honest.  With a story that long it  ends to be broken up into paragraphs more and parsed down a bit.
---
sadly on patch 1.12 no ones gonna aim for full T0 cause there will be better stuff (1.12 = upgraded items)
---
this is why its not full vanilla experience, just pretty much a pretbc patch.
---
**If you say "we need Classic" and then turn around and say "no TBC", you are worse than anyone who plays Retail and says "no Classic".**
---
At least the person who wants only retail isn't a hypocrite.  We have fought for over a decade against the retail-only crowd in order to get Classic to launch.
---
But guess what?  Some people like TBC.  Some people like WotLK.  I like all 3, but I like TBC and WotLK more than Classic.  So for you to sit there, after 10+ years of struggle, and say "No TBC"...yeah, you're a hypocrite.
---
Your story is EERILY similar to mine....gonna straddle FT job and GF and make it happen.
---
Amazing atmospheric zone, only downside is troll lore. Like blizzard holy shit I dont care about trolls and the fact that a primarily tropical-based race is in a cold climate for no reason just makes me hate them more. Dun morogh also houses two massive underground cities, which i love
---
XP: I'm rounding down on average mob level. They're 53-54, all math assumes 53, so numbers in practice might be ~2% higher. The number 325 would be accurate for a level 53 character killing a level 54 mob, though my number's 310 (53 vs 53) for math simplicity.
---
And i haven't heard the "as many as 9 packs" stories. Just the "pathers path faster" about the runs. If there's more, you're right... if you can manage to keep below the 5 reset / hr limit, it just gets better and better - but as a baseline, worst case scenario, it's still great.
---
Dewit
---
I've always thought of a hybrid as something that can perform 3+ of the 4 roles (meaning tank, healer, melee, ranged).
---
This basically makes Paladins, Druids, and Shamans the "hybrid" classes.
---
Warriors cannot heal or ranged, and priests cannot tank or melee.

It was actually pretty okay at midnight. I feel for them, because around midnight the starter areas were full but the game was running. When I went to sleep and woke up and logged on around 2pm though... by that point it was a freaking mess. Stuck kneeling, getting booted offline. Lag everywhere. Terrible.

hybrid to me just means viable damage (physical&amp;spell) and ability to heal.
---
so druid, shaman, paladin
---
basically for me this comes from Ultima Online where you are classless and you pick your skills. So hybrids would be mages + melee(skill) .
---
Lies. We brought you for MOTW as well ;)
---
You’re right. This cannot be overlooked 
---
Yes, this is the issue.
---
Someone made a post a few weeks ago asking for the game profiles and this problem really needs to have a higher profile on reddit (sorry for the pun)
---
If someone still has the game profiles please upload it and share.
---
I love druids but hate alliance and tauren... so yeah lol
---
If you summoned Lok or Ivus after WotLK, that would be a rare feat indeed. Reinforcements and the boss race mode introduced in BC made doing it nearly impossible (games would end before you had enough of the necessary resources to summon them).
---
35? What? If you go Lasting Judgement, you'll hit 33. If you're going to be giving Imp BoW, you'll hit 32. Are you saying take both of those and still take Holy Shock and Unyielding Faith? I guess if you only have two paladins in a raid you'd want one to do both seals/judgements and Imp BoW/BoM, but even so they'd only go 34 Holy to still have points for Imp Retribution Aura.
---
Where in the post did I say no TBC? I said no TBC *on this sub* which is devoted to vanilla. I'm tired of kids morons who didn't play vanilla thinking TBC was the best just because that's when they found out about it.
---
I concur, I’m bad at writing concisely, I feel like there are too many important details even though there truly aren’t 😅
---
You can go to the main wow reddit and blizzard forums to ask for those. But this sub-reddit is suppose to be for WoW Classic not BC or WoLK. 
---
&gt; you're a hypocrite.
---
You are just as much of a hypocrite coming to a sub-reddit for pre-BC classic and going but I want BC balance and etc..
---
Simply put this is not the sub-reddit for that. And yes the mods do remove posts that are directly about BC and later. 
---
No hit cap.. New one ive heard.  Missing 5% of your hits compared to SoR being immune to glancing blows and holy shield consecration BoS SoR having 100% hit chance kind of makes up for this. JoR yes is subject to 17% miss which sucks.  But if you look at the prot paladin dmg they dont scale well at all with getting hit capped.
---
You specific arguement of getting hit capped is not a factor.
---
Even back in the day I have only seen him summoned a handful of times. I did participate in some of the reinforcement quests, though mainly the wolf riders, because I could do that on my own. 
---
You can't reason someone out of an opinion they didn't reason themselves into.
---
To be fair, every starting zone outside of Elwynn is mostly self-contained. You could argue that Mulgore has a bit since you do fight an obnoxious amount of quillboars as a low-level horde player but they're mostly unrelated to eachother.
---
In vanilla they actually have a pretty in-depth playstyle. But everyone has their own preference. I love Hunters, they can do so many things other classes cannot
---
They did add a form of level difference scaling in BfA, what happened was twinked out low level characters would actually beat max levels consistently due to how their stats scaled. Pretty silly.. Tbh one great aspect of old wow was feeling tangibly stronger as you leveled up
---
&gt; No hit cap.. New one ive heard.
---
Then you haven't read a single prot paladin vanilla guide from the past fifteen years.
---
Sounds like a whole lot of feelycrafting alone in your bunkbed at night.
---
Esfand still has a lot of stream VODs from a certain undocumented server on his YouTube channel.
---
You said:
---
I linked a blue post ("Blizzard") in which a CM is opening up a discussion about class balancing in Classic WoW.
---
Instead of saying, "ok, I didn't know about that. thanks for the line", you decide to move the goalposts from "blizzard statements regarding being open to balance change" to this:
---
&gt; Yes where does it say **blizzard intend to make changes?**
---
I never said that. You never asked it. Go play internet debater with someone else.
---
This post is a prime example of a bad opinion.
---
1. You are a fan of druid lore.  Okay, that means that automatically only 2 of the starting zones will have anything to do with you, and even then only 1.  Out of 6.  This by itself is not necessarily a bad opinion, but it seems an odd thing to start with.
---
2. You blame Dun Morogh on the hassle of leveling a hunter to 10?  There are 6 other classes you can level in Dun Morogh.  Also, the same problem applies to leveling a hunter in Teldrassil, Durotar, or Mulgore.  This has nothing to do with Dun Morogh.
---
3. There are trolls in every starter zone.  Again, I don't see what this has to do with Dun Morogh.
---
I don't mind if you hate Dun Morogh.  But your reasons for hating it really don't have anything to do with the zone itself.
---
I completely understand that feeling, I was in the “Serious Girlfriend” stage with my now wife when we got the news of WoW Classic. Before I would let her even move in with me I told her she had to be alright with me going all out when Classic releases. Told her id spend 12+ hours a day playing sometimes and average 6-8, and if thats not cool then we have a problem. 
---
I was lucky that she liked the idea of the game and will most likely play a Hunter with me when classic comes out! The point is though, i set the expectation. That’s what you should do if you’re worried about gf aggro. 
---
&gt; Where in the post did I say no TBC? I said no TBC on this sub which is devoted to vanilla.
---
We're talking about Classic TBC, not the actual TBC that we played in 2006 or pirate server TBC.
---
&gt; I'm tired of kids and morons who didn't play vanilla thinking TBC was the best just because that's when they found out about it.
---
I played both, TBC was better. Which was why I'd personally like Classic TBC to come out, maybe in 2022, as an alternative option to Classic vanilla. I don't want to take away your thing, but I'd like my thing to come out eventually.
---
Respecs are more expensive (relatively) if you're on a class that doesn't have much solo killing power.
---
I did this with an ele shaman. You need the eye of the storm talent (no pushback after being crit), and then you basically just drop stoneskin, agil, fire nova, mana regen totems and stab them down with a dagger and heal or cast chain lightning when EotS procs. It’s not as fast as mage (I haven’t done it with priest or pally) but it definitely works. I leveled from 55 to 60 doing it.
---
Honesty I think of “classic” as just being the original form. Right now we are starting with vanilla. I agree, it’s the best. But that doesn’t mean we shut the door on classic tbc and classic wrath.
---
I think most people agree that cata is the undeniable cut off of the classic old wow and current Azeroth. 
---
I never really felt forced into a spec until dual-spec came online.  
---
Huh...and here I thought mods made the rules on this subreddit.  So FireConsumes, you're a moderator of this sub?  
---
If not you're just gatekeeping. 
---
People coming to classic sub and expressing their opinion/desire for a future TBC/WOTLK server at some point has ZERO impact on you and has ZERO negative connotations with it. So why are you so vehemently demanding that people stop talking about it?
---
People here need to grow up. This vitriolic, gatekeeping, abusive posting behavior is something I would expect of a very young teenager. Not an adult.  (which I'm assuming most of the sub here is since the demographic of classic fandom suggests late 20s to early 30s age range.)
---
So true! I remember doing some camp fire with a friend and doing some RP in khaz modan at lvl 6 or 7 and leveling food thinking we were masters while capped at 75...
---
Somewhat incorrect.  Once paladin s get AQ 40 gear their threat goes through the roof.  Also the increased agility with the spirits of zandalar world buff and the agility from the avengers gear gives them enough dodge to drop defense down to about +50 and be crit and crush immune.  The truth is the hardest jump is MC to BWL if a paladin can get BWL lair gear (styleens!) they can get themselves rdy for AQ 40 also the catch up gear in AQ 20 and ZG are sometimes better than BWL gear for paladins.  A tier 1 warrior is going to be a better progression tank than what a paladin can do.  When looking at trash clears however shield block will leave a warrior open to crushing blows more than a paladins holy shield.  
---
&gt; It’s not as fast as mage
---
Fast enough to do 5x an hour? That's all that really matters.
---
With mage water I was doing 5 per hour ;)
---
I would definitely opt for the 21/0/30 build over 20/0/31.  That's a huge button to have for healing.
---
With that said, builds in Vanilla for hybrids (especially Paladins and Druids) are often about tradeoffs.  Are you willing to sacrifice 5-10% of your healing, in order to be able to deal any realistic amount of damage?
---
The graveyard spawn for horde is near redridge, long run to maybe get another 30 yards lol 
---
Add it to the list, then! Any particular reason for 55 and not 52-54? Gear, abilities, etc?
---
And who is to say that "Classic" doesn't include TBC and WotLK?
---
You're the one bringing it up in this thread.  My response to you is not hypocritical, it's part of the conversation.  Even if it wasn't, I wouldn't be a hypocrite, I'd just be off-topic.
---
A stat such as move speed, where its sources are so limited makes it the obvious choice. Fully agree with you.
---
BoP trading was a thing with a GMs help. I don't like blizzard adding it as a default feature, but I understand why they are doing so (less GMs to pay)
---
New graphic options doesn't affect gameplay like dual spec would.
---
However if Dual spec is added, I agree it needs to be 1000g. At that point the average person really has to think about what they want first, an epic mount or dual spec, Might be a hard call for a lot of people. Myself included
---
Because the guy is an idiot.
---
Basically your entire post that says BC and WotLK sucked compared to classic and to F 'em both?  I mean, 80% of your post suggests you hate those expansions.
---
Paladins can def cap before MC but yes at the cost of losing threat.  Once paladins have ZG and AQ gear your looking at pushing crushing blows and crits off the attack table by going to 102.4% avoidance instead of 440 defense (this strategy is the same for warriors) ofc you can keep a heavy defense cap gear too for fights where your holy shield is eaten through quickly (same for warriors)
---
Take a deep breath or thirty. People can speculate about the future of Classic if they really want to. 
---
You don't know what Classic may become. That's like saying you can't talk about potential future changes to WoW on /r/wow because it's a subreddit for the present game only.
---
Also, I somewhat agree with you but being a annoying asshole about it doesn't help your cause.
---
Yes dungeons are done a lot. Alchemy flask recipes, dark runes, righteous orbs, trinkets, prebis on alts, skin of shadow, the beast hide, etc etce 
---
Were there any actually mechanically skilled players in Vanilla? Or was it just a time before players became that skilled at the game and PvP? Genuinely curious as I see tons of PvP highlight montages and every one the guy is backpedaling and clicking spells etc. Would be interested to see a video of someone actually good by modern day standards (if that exists?)
---
The Plaugelands. Scary zones that I always avoided. 10 y/o me wasn't the bravest. 
---
I agree with your post.  But isn't you telling people not to gatekeep...a form of gatekeeping itself?
---
Like the old vanilla saying
---
"How many rogues does it take to kill a pally?"
---
"Two! One to start the attack and one to finish it inside the Ironforge Inn..."
---
https://youtu.be/kSDSUhD4fv4
---
The struggle is real. I'm going back and forth between Priest and Warlock. And I also kinda want a Shaman. 
---
There is no generally accepted definition.
---
Some people claim "hybrid = all three roles". Druids and paladins can perform all three roles, but shamans can too, they have tanking talents, they just kind of suck at it. So by that definition druids, paladins and maybe shamans are hybrids.
---
Some people claim "hybrid = healer", and in game design terms in classic it does seem like the "hybrid tax" is code for "PvE healers suck at everything but healing". It's not code for "warriors suck at DPS".
---
Some people claim "hybrid = more than one role" which makes warriors hybrids too. Warrior players who think they ought to be best DPS and best tank forever because is was *so* hard to level a warrior will maintain until they are blue in the face that being the best DPS and best tank doesn't make them a hybrid, or if it does taking a couple dozen extra hours to level means they ought to be a hybrid who doesn't pay tax.
---
The fact that pirate servers are swarming with warriors means that it's obviously not hard enough to deter people playing them.
---
I think it's a controversial question because "what is a hybrid" is kind of a stealth way of raising the question "should warriors be nerfed", and the warriors and #nochanges partisans don't like you talking about that.
---
Nice try, you said viable damage with ability to heal. There are no vanilla hybrids by those perameters. If you have heal spells, you're a healer endgame.
---
Because they have already stated they have no intent on them at this point. "Classic" at this point solely refer to pre-BC World of Warcraft. 
---
The only descriptor I'm interested in is fun.
---
Yeah I'm avoiding reading up on 100% optimal talents, BIS lists, leveling guides, and any extreme min-maxing stuff. As tempting as it is to get totally absorbed to tide myself over until Classic, it would cheapen the experience for me. I already know more than enough to be a good player.
---
I'm all too aware that even for a new player, let alone a returning one, it won't have the same magic as it did in 2005 for numerous reasons. It's probably not going to be even half as good as it was then. But that's how amazing it is - it'll still be incredibly fun. 
---
Probably for the best, really - the game was legitimately like crack, and this time around I should be able to resist playing 24/7. 
---
Standard strategy in vanilla for anyone struggling in MC Rag or BWL Vael was to get the FR buff from LBRS for those fights. Pretty sure they lasted at least 40 mins or so.
---
Would be great if they created a new expansion pack that forked from vanilla. Continue from there, in a new timeline.
---
Does she want to fuck though?!
---
By that logic a naked gnome running around spamming /train emote is viable for raiding

Fuk yolo man get those dark thoughts happening
---
Big if true!
---
I can't decide between mage or warlock. I just did warlock a while ago and loved it, but don't want to just play the same thing again. However, I only leveled it to 60 and didn't do endgame content. Would it be worth it to go warlock through end game content or just give mage a try? I'm interested in both PVP, and PVE so I think both would work well, but having a mage for aoe farming would be nice. Also, I ran the warlock on horde, so maybe I could re-roll that but as alliance to give it a different feel.
---
Also was the /reset and /camp thing even possible in vanilla? Seems like a pserver thing to me that won't work in classic
---
Well I always ran dungeons over and over again. I just plain enjoyed tanking. 
---
The zone is very pretty, and I like most of the quest. However those mountains are located in the dumbest places. Like, wherever you want to go from Kharanos you have to run around mountains.
---
Oh, and the quest where you grab the lunch or whatever it is from the cave with the Yeti elite is fun!
---
That's like asking what difference between a really good blue item and a BIS epic. Minimum 30 in holy is optimal for a healer. To be a good raid healer, you have to sacrifice your solo play power. It's the trade off. It makes a difference, and in progression raiding every percentage matters.
---
Over the course of vanilla, I ran strat sooooo much for my three 60s and and buddies and guildies. I even lucked out and was one of only two Horse side on my server to get barons steed.
---
I remember so many times on my priest when bringing newish people on a run hearing "wait why is the priest pulling?" Little did they know how awesome shackle pulling by a geared and knowledgeable priest can be. Ah I miss the days of back to back to back strat speed runs.
---
You very clearly pointed out to me that this isn't the official Blizzard forums or Reddit.  Why should their current lack of plan for TBC disqualify discussing it here?
---
Just schedule band hold a super long FRG meeting when it comes out.
---
Only thing I can think is I am not a guild leader?
---
I think you're right having guides and people who have figured out every equation in the game does make it feel a lot smaller and less mythical but you're never gonna totally recreate that first hit when you were a kid because you're so much older and exposed to so many more games anyway. Having said that I've played some private servers and I was pleasantly surprised at the experience
---
Oh look. Another person who doesn't understand the true nature of Classic.
---
Not agreeing with the guy you're responding to, but that's not really a valid reason to say TBC is more popular. The quickest sub growth happened in 2005. TBC was still growing but much slower vanilla, and wotlk had most subs of all but growth completely stagnating. 
---
30. EU, PVP or RP-PVP A/H. I'm looking
---
 for a guild that raids 2 times a week, maybe 3. One day of raiding falling on Tuesday if possible. Not looking for super hardcore but I want to get shit done and don't want a guild that carries noobs who don't know how to play. Am going mage. Played a lot of vanilla back in the day. Give me a pm :) 
---
&gt; The dungeons were tuned down in size as well, boring and much less creative than before. (Caverns of time anyone?)
---
Interesting boss mechanics anyone?
---
I'd gladly trade the ability to get lost in an endless four-texture hole for boss mechanics which actually make the game interesting to play.
---
God, I just cant help but cringe when I see these posts, due to how insanely stupid crowder is.
---
Ah the naked female night elf, the bane of many a 15-year-old.
---
I don’t think she’s just asked for coffee. I think she’s asked to tie you up and have her way with you and control your life completely for at least the next year.
---
The quality of game subreddits peak in the waiting period. Afterwards, it's not even remotely close.
---
While questing the vast majority of the time mob density or power isn't enough to warrant people go healer/tank 'mode'. I mean you can if you want, but it's not efficient. Warriors should be dps, pallies should be ret, druids should be feral etc... regardless of group makeup. If everyone is in their solo levelling spec you'll just plow through everything you pull, anything else will just slow you down.
---
Maybe the guy who stole yours is the guy up thread who said he nicked the zboard from some idiot who left it unattended at a LAN party? Wouldn't that be something?
---
I'd gladly take dual spec over slightly faster mount any day. Being able to have a proper tank spec and proper heal spec and swap between them is infinitely more useful.
---
Easy solution bro, just get her to play as well.
---
&gt; This is a subreddit for the discussion of anything related to Classic World of Warcraft. More specifically, the new Classic servers that Blizzard has announced to launch.
---
Because this about Classic WoW not Head Fantasy WoW. I repeat myself... The mods do remove stuff that are not dealing with preBC content. Just yesterday a thread about flying (a BC item) was removed because it violated rule 1. 
---
I think the Arcanite Reaper recipe dropped off a guy in LBRS as well, I plan on trying to get that on my Blacksmith for sure.
---
Hydrogen?
---
I tried this on a pserver. While it totally works. It is dangerous if you mess up at all. And I am not sure a none 60 Druid would have the mana, HP, and armor needed to not die doing this
---
I just don't see any better use of the points anywhere else. 
---
This is the spec I used in AQ progression https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgstxMuZx
---
I wasn't even buffing wisdom or might or kings either I always buff Salv but I didn't see benefit from putting more points into prot or ret
---
Hey that’s a valid point! That would be the life! 
---
Dungeons never seemed to dry up. There are always alts and guildies and guildies' alts and buddy's etc. Plus if you main a healing spec it's great gold and the chance for blue boes.
---
Its cold and irritable, and the snow gets everywhere.
---
Nope find a different game. Avoid her like the fucking plague. They call them the forsaken for a reason. 
---
I was a freshman in college, 2005. I had just returned to the US from being an exchange student in Ecuador. I had been an avid pc gamer my whole life and when I got back I had to get a new build for college. I saw this game Guild Wars and decided to pick it up. I was familiar with EQ, Runescape, etc. Played for a week and mentioned it to my buddy in class. He stops and says, got to Target and buy WoW today, it’s way better and on sale for $29.99. I wasn’t sold in the subscription but I figured 30 day free trial, what the heck. 
---
I made an UD female rogue on started. 1-10 was meh, then my buddy came to Undercity after I got lost, and took me to the Zepplin. That was the moment I realized the scale of the world. We we t over to Durotar so I could level with him, a troll mage. Barrens sold me forever! At about level 42 and 2 months of playing between class and such I met a guy who wanted to trade accounts with me. I swapped my rogue for a 60 mage. Joined a guild, got keyed, started MC that week. I had no idea what I was doing.
---
After 6 weeks of raiding I had my tier 1 gloves, boots, shoulders, and chest. We started AQ and I got a few more lucky drops primarily my main weapon and a trinket. This was about 6 months after account switching. I wanted to change the email address to mine which triggered an unfortunate series of events. The guy I had switched account with, saw the email, changed my password and logged in. He saw my Mage with great gear, and my 24 shaman alt and 52 warrior alt. Took the account back.
---
My main tank, Leatherneck, got on vent and talked to him. The guy decided he wanted to play his mage again and claimed I stole the rogue account back( I didn’t.) Some how Leatherneck got him to agree to giving me the Shaman, but I lost Hexibus( Mage) and Whilemilk(warrior). 
---
I start furiously leveling Shamzilla, TBC was a week away. I skipped class and blew off everyone for 2 weeks straight to get to 60. Then I I started through TBC took my time. My guild was in Kara and I was still grinding dungeons for resto gear. My main tank would log on my account to play my shaman for gear while I was in class. One day I tried to log in while he was on, I was excited to get back to the grind. Account for banned for account sharing. Blizzcon told me they would never give it back to me. I was heartbroken, never even thought to try and get it back. 
---
Years pass, some colleagues of mine are all hyped on cataclysm. I missed most of TBC and all of Lich. They convince me to resub. I call blizzcon and they give me the original rogue account back. Level up and smash face to 2K 3’s and RBG. 
---
Swore off WoW when pandas was announced, wtf!?
---
But came back for every xpac after, not wholly satisfied.
---
So stoked for classic!
---
Being a dps feral can work really well, your biggest problem will be getting great items for that that don't requite being a rogue and talk into your rogue mates that you are much more in need of these items. 
---
Imho, playing a hybrid is only valuable in PvP. For PvP the game is so much easier with a 100% tank, dps or heal. 
---
Flying, Resilience gear, Arena making BG's obsolete, no 40 man raids, dailies, heroic 5 mans, Incremental nerfs of content, trivializing the experience of your character progressing, the beginning of the homogenization of classes. No point in going BC over Vanilla when BC was the inferior game especially since the classes weren't even balanced in BC.
---
I just didn’t try it that low. It’s potentially possible. At that point, talent wise you’re just filling out resto (you’re getting some good ones tho, spell crit for lightning spells and then NS). Gear wise there isn’t anything notable that I made sure to have. I had the mp5 shield from Mara and some guildies had run me through DME before hand which helped get a couple blues. Obviously it would’ve helped to get some gear from DMW at level of use for the item, but I never got around to that pre-60.
---
If I was someone having doubts like these, what I could probably do is play on a Blizz-like Nostcore Private server, just so I could make sure I genuinely like Vanilla and not just rose-tinted glasses clouding my vision. If I did this and found that I still love Vanilla, I would be very happy.
---
***Of course I'd never do something so highly illegal.***
---
Really miss Vanilla :S
---
Feral druid is the only exception because they have baked in movement speed, and even more with the 4 piece pvp set.
---
I mean, they can (and likely will) advance the servers to TBC in 1-1.5 years.
---
You don't need to stealth, you can kill all 3 bosses while skipping all trash other than 2 satyrs. 
---
I mean, when you put so much importance on raiding,  you can't complain that you are a cog in a 40-man endeavor.
---
So...if I made a subreddit devoted to "Classic Star Wars" would discussion be limited to episode IV? Or would, you know...the whole original trilogy be discussed?
---
Also since you gave your opinion, I will give mine...BC was WoW in its finest form, not OG vanilla.
---
Movement speed to boots is the only enchant worth having aside from a pair for a riding set with mithril spurs.
---
Dude, i just do any serious gaming about 9pm once everyone has gone to bed. Sleep in on weekends. House is quiet by that time and i can play in peace. 
---
Ya...keep talking dirty to us. 
---
I remember starting the game as soon as launch came around with a large group of friends. Previously, my older brother and I played a lot of Everquest (separate accounts, same PC) -- he showed no interest in WoW or another MMO until he saw a Night Elf Druid run by me. That night he rolled a new character on my account.   
---
It only took me 2 hours of walking him through the beginning of the game to realize that I no longer owned that account.   
---
RIP  
---
No joke, I would love it if every once in awhile for a day or two they threw in some of these old bugs for fun. I'd love to see corrupted blood ravage the world again for a day.
---
DM: North hyenas are still farmable either way, though that's still less than tribute runs.
---
My personal opinion - you're spot on. My motive for posting this was highlighting "warriors aren't hybrids" as a faithless argument, though I'm personally fine with the established class balance/unbalance &amp; don't see a need for nerfs.
---
You're right, just building incrementally on the existing world makes a lot more sense than having an 18 month development cycle that drops a ton of content. A minor patch cycle that introduces new quests, fleshes out existing zones, occasionally adds a dungeon or adds a couple of items to flesh out gear options without massively inflating item level is the way to keep things fresh and interesting without invalidating all of the development time you already put into the world. 
---
One of my favourite parts of Legion was going back to the old world for various legendaries, because it helped capture that sense of scale the old world used to have; that there was more to Azeroth that even a seasoned adventurer was aware of. Those kinds of vignettes sprinkled in on a fortnightly/monthly basis would help make the world feel more alive and responsive, without requiring massive projects and investments to push out expansions.
---
Oh my god, this. At least once a week, I try to find a file and can't find a search bar for my PC. The one that looks like it should be it, searches the internet not my PC. 
---
I can never find the files I want. Nothing is where I expect it to be if that makes sense. 
---
One of the reasons I love vanilla wow is that I actually really appreciate this part of the design.
---
I don't think hybrids should be as good as pure DPS classes. Take a druid as you say. There were times in retail wow where there were no reason to bring a mage over a boomkin(Not saying right now, but in past patches/expansions). They did the same damage (sometimes more) and had other advantages as well.
---
What's wrong with having support classes? They don't do the MAXIMUM healing or dps, but they provide utility in other ways. Buffs, combat rez, whatever! Support classes disappeared as a concept, even though they are such a fun part of RPG's
---
Are healing/DPS charts all that really matter? Nowadays seems like it.
---
I love paladins. I love ret. Been my main since ever pretty much. They only ever became good in WotLK, and it was great fun playing a ret in raids.
---
With all that said, should they do as much damage as a rogue? Absolutely NOT! They bring so much more than their damage. Buffs. Survivability. Off healing. You name it! They should not also be TOP damage when there are classes that are purely focused on just that.
---
If you ever saw vanilla videos, you know you can actually be whatever you feel like playing if you are willing to try hard enough. With that said, this is vanilla. Classes have weaknesses and strengths! REAL ONES! Not the watered down bullshit we have in retail where pretty much everyone is the same, it's just the color of their spells that's different.
---
Every single mob you pull, yes.  But it also enables you to go through groups.
---
The Barrens is a nice zone, a lot of variability actually.  The oases, large mountains (with relevant NPCs for a couple classes or WC quests), various quilboar camps, two different Horde cities and a neutral city, underutlized mine in the far northern edge, 2 alliance castle-type areas, and a beaten corpse.   I also like the flavor of the different 'tall grass' areas with the lions and the centaur invasion spot.  
---
If you want a truly 'boring' zone, let's do Desolace.  Very little variability, and just as huge as the barrens
---
As opposed to the majority deeming it an issue, I don't. 
---
See, many people never played Vanilla or just properly experienced it since they were unaware kids at the time, thus playing again will be a refreshing again. Obviously, there's people older and memorize everything, meaning nothing will be a surprise, but that doesn't necessarily mean the game is ruined whatsoever. I personally think Classic's the greatest game ever and yet has to be surpassed. 
---
This sub in indeed active but it's for official Classic, not the right place to ask about pservers.
---
Orc Hunter and enjoy the farm and flag room. 
---
This is awesome man, thanks so much. Can't wait to see more. 
---
Taming Humar as Alliance was such a cool achievement back in the day.
---
Not only was he the only black lion in the game, but he also had one of the fastest attack speeds making him perfect for terrorizing casters in PVP. I think it was like 1.5 attack speed?
---

I had the same fear back in Nov. when my old guildies started talking about getting the band back together. Less than a week later we all were playing BFA to kill time until Classic. Obviously you won't have the same time you had as a kid, but you'd be surprised at how much time you can fill on a weekend and the hours you can se aside a few nights a week.
---
I'm a cinephile and spend a lot of my free time watching movies, but I firmly believe people should do what they enjoy. So I'll just watch less movies for a bit a play Classic -- and cerainly a lot less crappy TV. No reason to sacrifce the gym though, at least for the longterm -- there's plenty of time in the day.

Dun Morogh was the first place I ever saw in WoW so because of that it holds a super special place in my heart. That being said tho I can't level in it after like level 7. Once I clear the yeti cave near Kharanos and kill the elite yeti near the ram trainer, I go to Elwynn and Westfall.  I find that place generally faster for me. Sometimes I return to Loch Modan if I'm feeling extra dwarfy but thats rare. The human zones are generally just easier for me. 
---
Absolutely. Sure, classic is nice but TBC is what I'd really want to relive. I have so many great memories about it. Vanilla just didn't click with me that much. 
---
However, I'm scared of what would happen to my time schedule if they really re-released TBC. 
---
Calm down.
---
Naked gnomes spamming /train is the best option for optimal dps.
---
All those trolls in the human and undead starting zones! 
---
I remember when I was playing back when classic was live, only shaman / paladin / druid were considered hybrids.
---
The claim that warriors / priests are also hybrids is a new phenomenon.
---
But If the commitment is unhealthy for him, that makes her toxic, doesn’t it?
---
Vurtne was pretty good. I'd check out a vid. Does a lot of stuff that's seen as common now, but back then it was still pretty rare to see someone use so many different tools.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Haha, guys i am so with you. Just turned 26, just split up with my gf 6 weeks ago and now classic is on its way. And hell yeah, I had a great time during TBC.
---
The only thing i know is, that i need a strict pattern for my day. Create, connect, consume. Which means, i will allow myself to play wow and i will definetly play alot, but before i start "consuming" i need to do things that matter, like creating (beeing creative, working on things i want to achive in my (real-)life etc.) and connecting (having real talks with real people that help me run my businesses).
---
If i can manage it that way i will have a great time in vanilla.
---
My guild had Illidan on farm for about a year before Sunwell Plateau came out, so I'm not sure TBC's lifespan was too short. I agree that class balance was miles better than Vanilla, but I really felt bad for Mages in BT/Sunwell. Karazhan was the only real reason other than the AH to go to Azeroth and that was a little sad. I actually liked both Vanilla and TBC a ton. They were different, but you could easily find enjoyment in both versions of the game.
---
Either Pursuit of Justice and Imp Ret Aura or get BoSanc? If you're not buffing Kings, every point you have in the Prot tree is useless if someone else is buffing Kings because they can do Imp Devo Aura, as well. 
---
Umm...what?
---
Internet trolls, not the race.
---
I used this exact board when i started playing back in the day. I think i still have it on a box somewhere. 
---
Even playing all night is not sufficient to stay ahead of the curve that the live at home people will set
---
For min max probably orc tbh but you seem like you are more about the attachment to your character and visuals play an important role. Sounds like to me your mind is made on tauren. 
---
Hinterlands and winterspring!
---
Darkshore. I don't plan on rolling Night Elf but that zone always stuck with me. It was actually dark and eerie. The ambiance of that zone is just amazing.
---
I have movement speed on all my boots and sanc is out of the question because I like having holy shock for progression. Imp ret aura also seems entirely useless. 
---
Viable - capable of working successfully; feasible
---
Feasible - possible to do easily or conveniently
---
Druid, Paladin, Shaman, Priest do not do viable/feasible damage. It was a gallows humor joke, because there genuinely aren't hybrids in vanilla. They are healers or they are sub-optimal, poorly performing, and easily replaced.
---
Silverpine Forest.  If I got a character high enough to run SFK, odds were good that I was going to level them a good ways further.  It really helps that somewhere in the early 20s is when any given class fantasy really starts to come to life.  And then it culminates in grouping up for SFK.
---
This right here. 
---
Does anyone know if it does indeed stack with Cheetah for hunters?
---
tauren female shaman is just as awesome as a dwarf female hunter Sir
---
But now her ovaries are all dried up so you can raw-dog her and not worry about being on the hook for 18 years.
---
No real talk, me too. What we forget is most of us nostalgic people had limitations to playing back in the day due to commitments too. That urge made them want to play more. If you’re unemployed and play wow all day, you’ll hate yourself and be bored pretty swiftly. Wow is fun when it compliments elements of life. Not when it is life. 
---
That being said it’ll be fun. 
---
Its 100g/week we are talking about here...
---
Thi is the right naswer, though I suspect Alch won't be profitable for a few months. I might start Herb/Tailor, get my fill of bags and BoP end-game items, then just drop tailoring for Alch. The only other question is if I should start with skinning, grind for mount money, then drop skinning for Tailoring at 40\~. My guess is the gold made from skinning won't be worth that hassel though.
---
Winterspring and EPL! Two zones that got me to 60 ;)
---
I will doing much the same.
---
How difficult will gearing be with this plan? It won;t be, as you'll likely be tanking to build your gear sets, so you can find groups much faster than just as a healer
---
How gear dependent is HotW/NS? Very Gear dependent. You need all the prebis in order to heal well. Slightly less dependent for Tanking imo.
---
How viable is that spec in healing early raids and PvP for a casual player? It is viable, you miss out on Improved Mark of the Wild, which isn't too major. You miss out on 10% healing, which is a bigger deal but not the worst thing ever, Id say the biggest issue is missing out on Swiftmend, as it is your 2nd "OH Shit" button for heals. You also have to remember, you now have ~20% more mana vs not being HotW that goes a long way to help you keep casting.
---
And the lil squeek they made when they got hit.... mmmmm MMMMM. Albion 4 life and dont forget it!
---
Right instead we should use knowledge from 13 years(at minimum) where people were clicking abilities didn't know how the game worked and played with 10 fps.
---
Same here. I feel so silly wanting to roll a NE female but their animations are amazing. Especially the staff styles! 
---
&gt;Fun tip: You can enchant a white item with it and then trade it to your alts while leveling to speed up the first 20-40 levels of not having a mount.
---
That is genius, I might even get some boe green boots and send them to an alt w/ this enchant!
---
You're right. 
---
So your holy pally is picking up consecrate?
---
100g/week if you respec back and forth once a week.
---
and all you need is tank/healer
---
Wow, great video! Awesome to see some in debth analysis and not just "THIS IS BEST, CAUSE I SAY SO!" Even though i mained hunter at a relatively high level back in vanilla, I learned a lot from this. Will definately share this with friends.
---
Keep up the good work man, would love to see this for other classes as well!
---
That doesn't make sense though. Why call them hybrids if healing is what defines the group? Just call them healers. If it's the trinity thing, then why are shamans and priests hybrids, since they don't fulfill the tanking part of your trinity. 
---
One of the very early quests in Tirisfal is called "The Scarlet Crusade" and is your first introduction to them. The quest giver describes them as "a despicable organization that hunts us," or something to that effect. You're also fighting the Scourge from minute one in Tirisfal. The quests feel important immediately, which is part of why it's a top tier starting zone imo.
---
However having imp cheetah+imp feign helps a lot if you are doing multiple runs, because to do it fast you want to use one invis potion per run as well, and getting a FD resist is in most places a death, so want to minimize having those
---
I love Shimmering Flats in 1K Needles. Enjoyed seeing the race car parts laying everywhere and the mobs that were roaming the area. 
---
Thanks for the great guide, and for sharing the presentation in the comments. I'll be rolling hunter, but still curious to see what you have in store for other classes. 
---
Teldrassil. I think I’d be happy to just play a NE lvl 1-10 over and over again until I’m an old man. 
---
The talent gives you mounted and unmounted speed, which is better than the enchant and frees up a slot for extra Stam or Spirit or Defense Rating or anything at all. And one paladin using Ret Aura is better than no paladins using Ret Aura. It's certainly better than speccing for Kings w/o using it. I guess I won't argue the Sanctuary point other than to say your tank would probably like to take less damage and get additional free threat during progression. If you and your guild are good enough that none of this matters, good for you. But it's certainly not optimal.
---
Maybe, but you do get introduced to Dark Iron Dwarves and Troggs at Dun Morogh, both which obviously have overarching plots.
---
I will concede that Loch Modan does this much better tough.
---
All that keyboard turning hurt my head. 
---
I bought one of these took it home and the E key didn't work. Took it back to the shop and they replaced it for me. I asked if they could test it before I took it home just in case a key didn't work again. More than 5 keys didn't work on the second board fml. 
---
So I bought a wireless Microsoft KB instead :S
---
Nah I had no school, no work and played probably 100 hours a week for a year. It was amazing. Raided MC full time and was #1 pvp on server lol. There were people that were fully addicted to the game. 
---
WoW isn't toxic.  You just don't have enough self control to practice moderation.  Hate the player not the game.
---
Damn the music is so good.
---
Classic coming makes me glad I never had kids 😂 I can no life it even with a full time job because fuck it I never sleep anyway hahaha. When my brother talked me into playing my early teenage years we only had one computer and would play in shifts sometimes only getting a few hours of sleep for school but it was worth it lmao. Thank you for your service! 
---
You could say that for any class. You didn't actually give a reason. I mean: 
---
Well, you probably don't know what MAGE CLASS actually mean in a PROPER MMORPG.
---
The word "MAGE" should be enough for you to understand WHY it is a powerful class.
---
I’d have to say Elwynn, Westfall and Redridge. Spent a lot of time in those zones with alt-itis. And I am looking forward to doing so again.
---
minor movement speed is the same thing as poj, I have gloves/boots/carrot for when I need mounted speed which isn't applicable in raid. All it would allow me to do is get 7 stamina enchant which is negligible especially when I'm already popping full stamina consumes for progression. And again I buff salvation we have another pally who buffs sanctuary who stays 30/21 full time. 
---
Dun Morogh usually hits me in the nostalgia every time. It's actually one of my least favorite zones, but also the zone where my first try out characters originated.  
---
First every character I created was a male dwarf paladin, I got him to level TWO. Then I made a male gnome warlock and got him to 8!  
---
To be fair, all the Alliance starter zones are super nostalgic to me because I was making new characters everyday and I tried them all.  
---
Funny then, that I ended up maxing my first character on horde.  
---
take my upvote i legit watched this episode this week 
---
More like "Y'all go more of them troll's bloods?"
---
Would be a funny April fool's one time (just not every loot, only 1/10 or something)
---
I was one of the few who got (nearly) full t3 before BC hit.  I still spent a lot of time in older dungeons, mostly running friends through stuff because I just enjoy the content.  
---
Fuck you. If they don't add in deathknight's I'm quitting.
---
"Someone else buffs BoSanc" would have been a better argument the first time around than "I like Holy Shock." And I still maintain that pushing for Improved Retribution Aura would make your points do SOMETHING instead of nothing. 
---
T'was the open Beta! I was playing a well known US version of a Korean MMO at the time called Helbreath, people started talking bout this World of Warcraft game and I had already played WC2, 3 and Frozen Throne so was really into the idea.   
---
I did some research, applied for the open Beta and got sent a login. I downloaded the whole game over 2 days (Australian Internet...) capped my parents data-limit and got my arse handed to me because Dad worked from home and relied on the internet. He had to call up the ISP and pay some stupid amount to get more data lol.  
---
I remember logging in on my beast of a Pentium 4, Windows 2000. The game wasn't too choppy, but I had to run everything on low. I made an Orc Shaman, got him to about level 20 because of spirit wolf... and then the Beta ended.  
---
Fast forward a few weeks and I've convinced a handful of school friends to play, but we have to wait a few more months because It hadn't release yet but we had heaps of fun going on the WoW website during school IT class and looking at all the classes, zones - all that.  
---
The game finally releases, It's the same day of a school swimming carnival - only 2 of us have the balls to skip the carnival and go down to what was then "Electronics Boutique" (EB Games). There is no queue. My friend had saved his birthday cash and got the Collectors' edition, I can only afford the normal one :(  
---
We started on the Alliance, I made a human female warlock - played all day and by the time everybody else had come home from school and bought the game... they all rolled horde. I remember being pissed off that I had to start again but oh well, I ended up rolling my main. Orc Warrior  
---
There were about 9 of us who played together all the way to the barrens, then 5 of them got bored and quit. The rest of us had the most fun we've had in a video game that we've ever had, and this lasted for a good 3 months. We'd take the boat to Booty Bay while we were way underleveled, spent too much time exploring new areas and trying to kill things higher level than us. So getting to 60 took a while. STV, Arathi and getting my whirlwind sword, Farming SM, Shimmering Flat &lt;3 &lt;3, Tanaris... and finally Winterspring.  
---
When we hit 60 T1 and T2 still had 'place holder' graphics, they didn't look anything special but you could still pick them out on geared raiders. (at this time t2 dropped from MC)  
---
The 4 of us in the same guilds, played all the way till patch 2.0 without a break really, and then TBC
---
TBC is King. I dare you to downvote me, sluts.
---
The game is not the same as it was before, you are not the same as you were before.  
---
Take the new experience but don't throw all your shit in the fan lol
---
Shimmering Flats.  Best quest hub ever designed! :D
---
There you were quitting WoTLK when you joined the army.  Meanwhile guys like me where raiding ICC25 from OIF 07-09.
---
No one likes a quitter.
---
Warriors is the only true hybrid. All trees are optimal and its the only raid hybrid ;)
---
This is wrong on so many levels, but different strokes for different folks.
---
I played both Vanilla and TBC. TBC arguably had the better end-game content, class balancing, music, art, and definitely the best expansion ever released. It even had a somewhat meaningful grind with PVP, Crafting, and the Epic Flying Mounts. 
---
The only thing that TBC failed, was keeping Vanilla world relevant. Outside of that, it was still a great expansion. 
---
The only reason WHY Vanilla has been relevant all these years is the amount of effort people put in to pirate and work and support the platform.
---
EQ has done staggered legacy releases, and you can believe that Blizzard will do the same with TBC/WOTLK/Mists/Cata ETC. It is just more money they can make by legitimately having people come back and play their favorite expansions during a timed period.
---
I'm only excited for Vanilla and also the prospect of TBC, and going back and MAIN TANKING ILLIDAN as a Protection Paladin.
---
I will play Vanilla just as I did on release too. I have no doubt in my mind I'll have just as much fun as I did 14 years ago. Suboptimal spec, non-viable, whatever. I'll have my fun, and my niche.
---
The video that gets funnier the more you listen to it
---
IF we get something after Vanilla it will be TBC.
---
&gt;Don't like it? tough titties. 
---
BTW #No changes is not compatible with vanilla with progress. 
---
I don't see anyone complaining either. And those of us who do plan on playing "sub optimal" specs know what we are getting into, and will do it anyway. We know the risks we will run into.
---
&gt;  What got you hooked?
---
this:
---
&gt; pulling all-nighters with my cousins/brother running dungeons and pvping while eating pizza pockets and neglecting the rules of basic hygiene.
---
:-)
---
that frame rate is way too high
---
Does the mace even proc shape-shifted, do druids even get weapon damage in forms or stats only. I don't play a druid. 
---
we know nothing, Jon snow. 
---
Feral Resto hybrid 
---
Felwood, I love it. I finally get the “home stretch” feeling of the 50-60 bracket. Pumps me up every time I get to hit Felwood.
---
Thanks for posting this!
---
&gt;"everything except absolute BIS is garbage"
---
not exactly what I meant, but okay
---
Enh shaman is a fun spec for making crit oneshot compilations. 
---
If you did mean getting r13 by "If I dedicate a lot of time" then you are pretty much good to go. If not, then... Well, personally I would reconsider my class choice because I want to rely on something more than just RNG.
---
I can buy that for sure. I would have loved bleeding of freedom.
---
Brill and Silverpine Forest are fantastic, really somber and spooky kind of feel to it, perfect atmosphere. 
---
If you have no other tracking it is nice. I'm planning Dwarf Priest/Enchanting/Tailoring so it will be a nice bonus. Pretty much any combination of a class without tracking and no professions makes it nice.
---
Feel ya bro. Moving through the ranks of the fire department, serious GF whom I plan on making my wife, a son, gym routine, side job. 
---
BUT,  gaming has always been a hobby/passion. I was lucky enough to find someone who accepts that. She openly admits she doesn’t understand a even a little bit but, she sees how happy it makes me. Be honest. Yesterday I had to do was sit her down and explain how serious this launch will be to me lol! I explained real life comes first, always. I also went on to explain raid times, what a guild is, how I’m a class lead. Oh the confusion in her face. “We will make it work,” she said.  
---
#blesst
---
Ditto
---
farm fishing for stonescale eels is legit a full-time way to make money endgame. 
---
&gt;Problem is the things that make the Classic crowd happy would likely alienate the Retail crowd.
---
May I ask why you think that? My logic is, the people who like classic are going to play classic, the people who like retail are going to play retail and there's going to be a few that play both (I don't think that number is going to be big in the long run, sure a bunch of retail tourists will show up the first few days but I don't expect them to last long because if they like retail I imagine they won't like the vanilla version of the game, but could be wrong, we'll see) and the games are entirely separate entities. 
---
A prot paladin can also wear a skirt and heal just fine so yes, they are raid viable.
---
both races are good, it's hard to min/max this one. just pick whichever model you think looks cooler.
---
personally, I think undead look better in robes than trolls, but that's just personal preference.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion, but pre-Cata Durutar for me. Yeah it's not the best looking zone, but I don't care. Also it has amazing soundtrack and during night it's atmosphere is just awesome. 
---
I can't wait to create my orc warlock just like in vanilla back in the day and level trough it.
---
doesn't  the 4set and movement speed stack ?
---
It's still the best enchant because you are not always in travel form or cat form anyway.
---
I remember waiting for general fangferror to spawn forever. I really wanted joonho's mercy
---
Lets see. As enhance you have:
---
1.5 sec heals that almost replenishes 30% of your hp but costs a big chunk of your mana
---
Insane yet uncontrollable burst
---
Movement speed
---
Slows
---
Spell interrupt on a very short cooldown
---
The ability to give your warrior buddies the same insane burst as you have.
---
Totem buffs
---
Can shield and 1h turtle if shit goes south
---
25% stun resist (pls tell me you are rolling orc if you are going shaman)
---
Fear immunity
---
Purge
---
To be honest a geared and skilled enhance shaman is one of the deadliest foes of classic wow.. in my humble opinion
---
This ~~pussy~~ warcraft got you hooked, *hell naw*
---
You can change that with a few tweaks, there's probably a control panel way of doing it but with gpedit one of the options is to block win10 from searching the web.
---
I'll try and pull it up at work tomorrow if you can't find it.
---
As others mentioned druids, paladins and shamans were considered hybrids back in vanilla idk where this comes from calling priests and warriors hybrids.
---
&gt;though I suspect Alch won't be profitable for a few months.
---
The good guilds will want to get MC on fast farm as soon as possible, literally within the week. There will be a market for consumes.
---
But you're right in the sense that consumes and herbs will only get more expensive as time goes on.
---
Yeah and it stack. Same reason you should get and keep carrot on a stick. You can get up to +12% riding speed with all of that (bis for AB).
---
I ETSed and took a one year contract job. My year is up just in time for summer so ima bout to be taking an extended vacation boi
---
Replaced by what?  Compared to the leather bracers of finesse which drop in Hellfire Ramparts (and you earlier said dungeon drops would be fine for replacing), Bonescythe appears to give you 1.3% more crit, 27 armor and the set bonus over the blue (plus an extra 8 AGI for purposes of buff/talent scaling), while the blue gives you 20 AP and 2 sta.
---
Admittedly, I'm not super familiar with balancing stats for rogues at 60, but online guides I'm seeing at a quick search seem to put 1 crit at around the same value as 23/24 AP in terms of value at level 60 pre-raid BIS, and more AP as you get closer to BIS vanilla gear.  So, Bonescythe is still probably better than those.  What's the green Hellfire quest reward which is better than the blue dungeon drop in the same zone?
---
i don't think it does but you won't be always in cheetah.
---
Skilled is always relative. Compared to today everyone in Vanilla was "bad." You would have been too. Literally everyone clicked at least a little bit except for Vurtne. Tons of people will claim to have been mechanical gods who clicked nothing back in 2005 yet none of them have videos of their gameplay. These people are bullshitters. If they were really as good as they thought they were then they would have recorded it because t hey would have been literal gods stomping PvP, winning essentially every duel, teaching their guildmates and taking down World first raid boss kills in PvE. They did none of this. 
---
I know, I have committed the greatest sin...telling the truth. Seriously though the UD cast animation is way better.
---
DPS factor? Troll
---
PvP, Utility, and cool factor? Undead all day baby. 
---
The problem with giving sulfurous to a druid is that you can't see it in bear or Kitty form, ... which is why you need to use it as a boomkin
---
&gt;I'm more of the friendly banter type while poking fun at people when they say something ridiculous.
---
*Right click reported.*
---
A new challenger approaches!
---
We love vanilla partly because all of those little "stupid thing".  I'm currently playing a feral druid, loving it and don't want any change.
---
edgy, but cute.
---
Any good guild's guild bank gold is going straight to consumes.
---
Any good raider who is actually progressing will be buying many many many consumes.
---
Any good PvPer will be buying FAPs and LIPs by the dozen.
---
I'm personally sick of playing fun games that end up restricted to a meta. I understand balancing issues and everything but it ends up feeling like I have to read a manual to learn how to be the best, or not play at all. It's especially frustrating when I really enjoy the game, but I only have the time to play casually. Sometimes you can't keep up to the progression and sometimes you just don't have time to watch all the youtube videos or read all the strategy guides.
---
If Activision Blizzard releases the servers with "blizzlike" populations you should have no problem at all.
---
Of course there is competition but you'll still be making boatloads of gold. Only on pservers with ~10k pop have they had to increase Black Lotus spawns because there weren't enough.
---
Awesome zone.
---
Very well designed art-wise with the dwarven aesthetics, and I love snowy zones. Quite the peaceful atmosphere.
---
That's it. 
---
For me its Dun Morogh(played dwarf alot), Westfall and Redridge Mountains. Been playing alliance for the most part. These early zones really brings out memories.
---
I know and that sounds dope. But like that won’t make me happy right now and I know that. Gaming is the goat don’t get me wrong but atm in my life it’s not worth it to no life wow. I’ve played every expansion for at minimum two full patches and I’ll play classic. But balance is key. Lots of people get depressed playing that much without other things on the go too. Too much of anything fucks you up
---
There is no spoon?
---
I'd much rather have 20 days enjoyed than rush to 60 when the game gets boring. 
---
They are not only hard to level but hard to gear. Warrior is the most gear dependable dps, if you put ALOT of effort you will be at the top, if you don't you will be at the bottom. Warrior is one of the worse class for farming gold and they got bis gear like lionheart helmet, titanic leggings, edge master handguards that cost thousands of gold.
---
I expect alot of people that try to play warrior because "best tank best dps" will give up because the time investment to be good is also lot bigger than other classes.
---
how did you afford to do that?
---
There are way too many...  
---
From Ratchet, where you first find the boats that take you to Booty Bay while you're too low level to enjoy it.  
---
To STV where you first got the proper PVP experience while levelling as it was a popular shared zone.  
---
As a warrior, Arathi Highlands to do your lvl \~30 weapon quest for whirly axe boi.
---
I have no interest in PvP (besides world PvP) but I'm still rolling an undead mage. If I'm going to be be looking at my dude for hundreds of hours i don't want him to be a big nosed gangly ugly ass rhasta. Besides priest, racial bonuses are negligible. Play what you're into. 
---
Hey guys. So to the point, Deadmines is an iconic dungeon and i felt compelled to make this video. It has a place in every Alliance players heart not just because its your first real test in the game, but because of how well substantiated it is lore/gameplay wise. 
---
You spend much of levels 3-18 fighting this group of bandits, and it finally culminates in your infiltration of their hideout. But they arent some generic enemy. They are a the direct result of Stormwind's corruption and complete dismissal of the very people that brought the city back from ruin. 
---
Back in vanilla this mostly went over my head, but looking back its clear Vancleef was no villain. Not in a world with nuance. Stormwind noblemen can gtfo.
---
Do they always tell us exactly what they are considering at all times? If they are waiting to see how vanilla does before telling us would it not make sense to keep quiet about it Incase it doesn’t do as well and you back out of it all together? Companies very rarely let people know everything they are doing and especially in the video game industry they keep quiet until they are ready. 
---
do you already have a twitch channel or are you going to start streaming with classic?
---
With a good 2 hander you can smash noobs easily. However, you will be shut down by anyone who knows their class well, ranged classes can kite you to death easily and rogues with evasion...you won't really get any hits on them with that slow 2 hander unless you're lucky. 30/0/21 is the one and only PvP spec for shamans when it comes to competitive PvP really. And rightfully so, it's a really strong and OP spec once you get gear for it. 
---
Well said
---
I'm undecided between Hunter or Warlock. Hrm, or maybe Priest or Druid. But man Paladin and Warriors look so nice in that plate. 
---
What exactly is endgame wPvP? What is the benchmark for viability in this endgame wPvP?
---
Troll for pve, orc 110% for pvp. 25% chance to resist a kidney shot, cheap shot, charge or intercept is and auto win, along with other good racials.
---
Dwarf if alliance.
---
I was talking specifically about paladin sets. And they're bad for the same reason tier 1 is bad - they're itemized for some awkward form of hybrid that Blizzard never followed through on. If you want to heal, there's at least two or three cloth or leather non-set pieces for each tier of gear that are better than paladin sets. If you're ret and want to PvP, you're better off using fury/arms gear. 
---
ret paladins were good, but its just a waste to play as one because of how good holy is (i have seen a single skilled holy paladin carry a whole AB by himself against a premade, we got from 1 cap to 5 cap just because of him, just to say how strong holy can be).
---
Enhance shamans are fine when server is fresh but ele is just miles better. (deep resto shaman suck for pvp also).
---
Hybrid = more than 1. Warrior is a hybrid class. 
---
The bigger question is:
---
If a certain class can only properly fulfill one role in PvE, can it even be considered a hybrid (in PvE)? Well, you can say that those classes are still hybrids in theory, but they're not working as hybrids. At least in PvE I'd say the warrior is the only true working hybrid. 
---
To expand on what adlai said... (No) no it's not. 
---
Calling out something (whatever it is) and having people attempt to discredit you based on premise of the discussion is called the "tu quoque" fallacy (otherwise known as the 'appeal to hypocrisy' .)
---
Its largely a deflection took used to derail the arguement and turn it back upon the accuser.
---
(Not that I think you're doing this, just explaining it though)
---
STV due to the world pvp going on there, the adrenalin that you have because odds arent low that any time a rogue or two might appear behind you especially when you are turning in the hemet nesingwary quests
---
You spend much of levels 3-18 fighting this group of bandits, and it finally culminates in your infiltration of their hideout. But they arent some generic enemy. They are a direct result of Stormwind's corruption and complete dismissal of the very people that brought the city back from ruin.

Yes, he did he lost.

This is the kind of content I want! Well played, I might just have to roll Tauren now '-_-'

&gt; Here is a general discussion on Druid vs Warrior tanking:
---
&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGo5SMeqgo
---
&gt;Here is a general description and guide on deep fury Warrior tanking, the most effective and efficient way to tank as a Warrior (with many nuances, such as when to swap to shield, explained):
---
You linked the same video twice here.
---
I'm so glad I a ten times bigger loser now than I was 15 years ago, and I was a MASSIVE loser back then too.
---
I can play essentially as much as I want, hell, I could die in front of the computer, and nobody would notice unless it happened during grouped content, or someone IRL noticed the smell after a while.
---
Classic is gonna be great, I might even feel slightly alive again for a time!
---
Ashenvale
---
The Zerg tactic doesn't really apply to duos though, the whole point of a Zerg is to overwhelm the enemy by mindlessly throwing bodies are them until they break. Two people aren't exactly overwhelming numbers.
---
Are you sure its 8% ? My paladin with 8% runspeed seems way faster then my warrior with the boots enchant.
---
Alright, exactly what I had to hear. I'm not really interested in ele/hybrid, the only reason I want to play Shaman is basically Enhance. The problem is that it's annoying for me if I fight someone equally skilled and only lose due to the fact that my class is very subpar unless I play it to utter perfection. I assume the closest thing I'll get to WF Enhance is Warrior.
---
While not my favorite, certainly the most Nostalgic for me is the Barrens. When done properly you spend like 15 levels there, with access to 3 dungeons. The horrible chat, Mankriks wife, Crossroads under attack, just so many memories.
---
Haha, good question. I guess by viability I mean not being completely shut down fighting an equally skilled player just because my class is very subpar. I mean sure all classes can own bad players but I guess I'm just putting myself at an insane disadvantage by rolling Enhance.
---
Yeah man don't want to smash your WF dreams like that but it's the honest truth. I would actually say it's reckoning paladins! If you're fine with going alliance. 
---
"Need" is a strong word. But I think it's clearly a failure of game design if the pure DPS classes can't keep up on DPS with warriors who, whether or not you accept them as "hybrids", are definitely not a pure DPS class.
---
One class being the best at PvP and the best at tanking and the best at DPS, so much so that competitive guilds want to stack ten+ of them, is just problematic.
---
(In before "on pirate servers MC is ezmode so it doesn't matter if serious guilds want twelve warriors and two druids per raid, everything is fine, if you don't like it go play Candy Crush because WoW IS NOT FOR YOU!".)
---
After two mana burns, a ret paladin is a shittier version of a hunter pet.
---
Enhance gets kited for days. It's like a warrior, without anything that makes a warrior good.
---
Reddit existed in Vanilla?
---
Hm, we'll see. My buddies are still not entirely set on what faction to roll yet. I appreciate the input though! :D
---
Try getting to 60 And realize that you do nothing but healing in raids and getting nothing but healing gear. It was a big letdown. Never again
---
Can't wait for Classic to hit, and shit on all those private server players that argue that BOTH Fury Warriors and Feral Druids are actually better tanks than a proper speced PROTECTION Warrior.
---
You people are assuming so many STUPID things, first being that in Vanilla, players were dumb, they had no idea what they did, etc. etc. Second one being that 13 years of "Vanilla" experience from private servers (ALL of which were built on TBC, and that built GREATLY reduced all NPC damage, armor, crit, HP values).
---
I for one, will laugh at every player dumb enough to actually HOPE to be a raid tank, and do it as a Druid or Fury Warrior.
---
Because dumb people deserve to be laughed at.
---
10/10 A fun watch!
---
I member!
---
I bet you watch, and get, Rick and Morty. WE'RE NOT WORTHY
---
You wont be at disadvantage. Like any class it just needs mastering, and with engineering and couple anti-kite gadgets you’ll melt faces.
---
I vaguely remember it being like that for honor gains until blizzard realized that healers got shafted if they were actually healing people instead of trying to get the KB
---
Yeah mana burn is ret worse counter and it was still the case in wotlk (idk about after stopped playing), having a counter doesn't mean they are bad.
---
Enhance can slow by spamming frost shock to get closer. When there is one on the other side i always see mages complaining. They sure prefer to fight against a warrior.
---
I hope you enjoy the ride too!!! Now I just need to figure out how I can run on no sleep in my 40's
---
I have absolutely no desire to play Modern WoW ever again. But I will probably end up alternating between Classic WoW and FFXIV.
---
Wintersping, darkshore,ashenvale
---
I feel sorry you missed out in WotLK when it was live. That time was WoW’s zenith and it was never as good as it was then, sans Vanilla itself.
---
Alterac Valley
---
Are you familiar with Ultralisks?
---
I used to preach this all the damn time but no the damn casters in my guild would always get stupid spell hit on their boots. Bitch, get that stat elsewhere. Basically any time one of them died from standing in fire and they didn't have speed on their boots I'd shame them in vent. 
---
I remember being strangely obsessed with getting killing blows for a short period of time while leveling. Can’t remember exactly why, but this sounds like the best explanation I’ve seen. I didn’t start right at launch so 2005-2006 sounds about right.
---
Without a doubt it would have to be Barrens.
---
From Chuck Norris jokes to trying to figure out why the Zhevra hooves weren't dropping. So much in such a barren place.
---
You won't get pestered for water/food/ports as a hunter.
---
You will likely have a harder time getting into pugs for leveling dungeons as a hunter. I recall the biggest hurdle leveling a hunter alt when dealing strangers was overcoming the "huntard" bias.
---
I leveled a few toons in vanilla and distinctly remember the classism against the hunter. I don't recall any other class being so reviled. 
---
I can confirm that the boot speed enchant stacks with the 4 pc PvP set bonus in travel form.  I used to pop dartrols rod of transformation and out run lvl 40s with their mounts in stranglethorn beating them with my will of arlokk.  So it’s even useful for druids.
---
40 + 15 + 8 = 63% &gt; 60%
---
It might not work with cat form 30% movement talent as ret talent didn’t stack either.  I never tested that.
---
B I G T H I N K
---
That's because warrior players try to justify why every other class pays a hybrid tax, but they can be the best dps, and the best tank in the game.
---
I think I love Classic too much to just have one zone, as almost every zone feel special. If I was forced to choose one I would probably go with Elwynn Forest.
---
haha yeah, im sure they are very fun, but i cant for the life of me get past the leveling experiance, and ive played wow for for 15years now.  Ive mained warlock since vanilla thou xD, its something about the pet happiness and abilitys, and all the autoshot that seems to make it impossible for me to enjoy it, haha
---
Just smash. 
---
This. After taking the time to actually read each of the quest details instead of bindly running off like  a sheep, it never felt right to kill him. Sadly I wanted his sweet loot more. I'm a monster I know...
---
So by that, would the ghost wolf + speed boots + pvp boots for shamans also stack to 63% move speed?
---
I remember using this macro into BC, did a friend tell you it was botting, because I have no memory of this at all 
---
I don't recall the name of the item, it was 12 years ago. I know it was a green quest reward in Hellfire Peninsula.
---
Vanilla gear was mostly primary stats like sta, agi, str etc with additional secondary stats on high end items. Secondary stats were ULTRA COMMON on TBC gear. So the comparisons were not easily identifiable at a glance. It is not as simple as "this one has more agility". It is not possible to look at the tooltips and say "14 crit rating is better than 14 attack power", because it depends on what your crit is already at.
---
Nowadays there are tools to simulate fights to tell you which piece of gear is better, but back then you had to go to the training dummy and check logs/meters.
---
So no I don't recall the name of the random quest green from 12 years ago, but if you provide a link to the resource you are using to dig up item stats then I can take a look and see what rings a bell.
---
+1, Reck paladin has all the ridiculous burst of enhance but it's a bit more predictable and IMO more useful in small group PVP.  Shaman have a nice offensive support toolkit but paladins overall just have a better "help your friends" type of abilities with cleanse, BOF, and BOP
---
Thank God.

I'm glad someone remembers

Sweet naked baby Jesus. I'd never heard that before. Can't decide if she needs a hug or a smack upside the head. Either way, pretty sure I'm gay now. Oh well.

2 level 40-45s can take down a lvl 60 who is in pre-raid gear if they play their cards right. Especially if the 60 was as bad as this guy (no offense to him, that's just how it was).
---
You shouldn't expect anyone lower level than (lvl 20? Come on) to be relevant. That would counteract the power fantasy. You progress from a new recruit peasant dude who can barely kill a bandit at lvl 20 to a godslayer. Working as intended.
---
&gt;Stormwind noblemen can gtfo.
---
Didn't one of the later retcons make it somewhat more nuanced than that? 
---
There's a thread on the Story forums about it. Something about Onyxia having a hand in both sides asking too much. 
---

---
My understanding is that warlock is more rare Alliance-side. So that sounds like a good choice for you based on your criteria.
---
It wasn't a retcon, since it was consistent with the Vanilla story. Onyxia fucked everything up on purpose.
---
The pet happiness is annoying, but once you raise their loyalty to best friend (lvl 6) you barely ever have to feed them. I'm usually leveling fishing and cooking as i level up so I always have extras.
---
But yeah, if you want to be efficent as you level you will be doing a lot of autoshotting instead of OOMing yourself with arcane shot / multi shot and drinking after every pull 
---
My bad - miscommunication - I meant that I have already RECENTLY posted my first dungeon run story on reddit - I didn't do it at the time it happened - it was a post asking for first dungeon run stories, memory monday, other such things.
---
To be clear this is an anecdote based on a very clear but old memory of vanilla.  I imagine both travel forms (ghost wolf and cheetah form) should stack with 8%.  PvP boots did not stack with the movement enchant to my knowledge.  I think shamans cap out at 48% movement, but I think testing when classic hits beta would reveal that with certainty.  I can only truly vouch for druids because I played them extensively and doing something that stupid stuck in my brain all these years.
---
1.5 is not particularly fast, many other mobs even non-rare ones are faster. its not terrible, but not the best
---
its his skin that makes him very cool
---
I always really liked Hinterlands
---
the fucking bat in rfk
---
This was never a thing.
---
Truthfully I don't think Blizzard as a whole cares about it. It definitely not a major launch to them (shareholder meeting). It is more of hey come back and pay us your subs and you get this nice bonus game on top of it. 
---
Do you have more like this? I love alternate perspective videos, and it's a fun way to learn more about the lore.
---
TBC/WOTLK/private server babies please go
---
Saw one on Craigslist about a month ago and almost gave in to the hype and picked it up.  I just can't live without modern keyboard features anymore though.
---
Blizzard^^© only tested things on some servers Live during the game's release. 
---
This video is amazing. 
---
Edwin and his Stonemasons literally rebuilt Stormwind, and instead of payment got their livelihoods and homes taken from them. 
---
At face value he seems in the wrong as a relentless leader of thieves. But delving into the details reveals its far more complicated. 
---
The ironic thing is that the nobles apparantly couldnt pay Vancleef for his work because of the debt from rapidly expanding their military. Yet where is that military to protect the citizens of Westfall? 
---
Druids become absolute beasts at level 10. Before that they are completely unbearable. 
---
Not only am I now convinced the leaders of Stormwind are evil (and by association all Alliance players) but now I also feel justified for killing this entire race of cheats and scoundrels.
---
#ItsOkayToBeVC
---
yeah yeah and Pallys and Shamans too....whatever
---
Desolace is the best zone.
---
If you're speaking exclusively to spec viability, I agree with you.
---
The problem is TBC came with a host of other design-level changes that fundamentally altered the course of the game and planted the seeds of most of the problems that eventually drove us away and made us long for vanilla's design in the first place.
---
TBC was when the focus of development shifted from world building to endgame. When leveling-as-the-game began to give way to "the game begins at max level." This represented a fundamental shift in design philosophy, and because endgame dungeons and raids became the driving force behind the game's direction Blizzard eventually (and completely reasonably) wanted to be sure everyone would get to appreciate all the great content they'd put so much hard work into, which laid the groundwork for dungeon/raid finder, cross-realm grouping and everything else later implemented to make that content more accessible, thus minimizing the importance of community.
---
It was also when Blizzard started to really experiment with a more directed narrative experience rather than the traditional adventure game approach of vanilla. I remember when I rolled up a dranei paladin and leveled through the starting zones, ultimately ending with a scripted event in which my character paraded down a line of people who were clapping and cheering for him. I thought it was pretty nifty at the time, but in hindsight I can see that as the seed of your character ultimately becoming the Champion of Azeroth and everything in the world centering around you and your actions... just like it does for everyone else. It's antithetical to good MMO design.
---
Finally, the introduction of the Arena was when PvP went from a *relatively* well-balanced macro-level affair (wherein the smallest organized conflict was still 10v10, meaning you were virtually guaranteed to have plenty of role overlap within your party) to a tightly-tuned micro-level esport that threw into stark contrast the shortcomings of the rock-paper-scissors design of vanilla class balance. Quoting /u/JuanLob0, who [said it] (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a7ctcf/survey_what_would_you_like_classic_to_be_and_to/ec2h4yn/) much better and more succinctly than I could:
---
&gt;On the one hand, arena is one of my absolute FAVORITE past times in WoW.
---
&gt;On the other hand, I think we can really trace the complete erosion of class identities to balance changes forced onto Blizzard by how much fun arena was / is. Arena is what ultimately required Blizz to give just about everyone an interrupt and hard CC, and for balance purposes blizz had to bar many classes absolutely iconic abilities (like bloodlust or warlock infernal).
---
&gt;Finally, and the absolute worst, arena really forced blizz to stop making weapons/trinkets with really fun effects and had to limit just about everything to flat, predictable, and homogenous stat boosts. RIP Thrash Blade and its ilk, RIP windfury, RIP RPG.
---
I loved playing through TBC when it came out back in '06. I even cheered for a lot of the changes I outlined above, not realizing the knock-on effects they would have on the game. And I would love for Blizz to retool the spec viability and especially the content from TBC (and Wrath, for that matter) to follow something akin to the original design philosophy of WoW and release it in a way that doesn't completely invalidate everything that came before.
---
That said, if getting to play a balance druid, arcane mage, survival hunter or any other meme spec without getting laughed at means once again accepting all the other changes TBC introduced, even knowing where they eventually lead, I'll *happily* take my place as backup to the backup of whatever role I mean to fill in any raiding I may eventually wish to do.
---
After all, at least for me, the whole bloody point of Classic is raiding is only one part of a much larger game.
---
None, log into the game on a computer like a normal human being.
---
I’ve tested it with a half green half naked Warlock. I was doing 3 runs an hour consistently. However, I was going deeper and killing Hydrospawn and those few satayrs as I’ll be a tailor wanting felcloth runecloth.  Need to be destruction/Demo and sack your VW on every lasher pull. Not mage easy mode but never in danger. 
---
It's not really a bad thing, or all that surprising.  They probably figure that most of those that are going to play it, already know about it.  More advertising they probably see as a waste of money for the small potential bump in subs.  I would tend to agree.  If they throw that money at advertising, and they don't see it as panning out, it could be one notch against keeping it going down the road if it comes to that.
---
Me too.
---
Well, if you really don't know why, there is a particular reason Stormwind's military is absent from Westfall, Redridge, and Duskwood.
---
i can’t remember exactly. i just remember at some point, it didn’t work anymore and that was the reasoning i was told. blizz stopped it because it was considered botting.
---
It's  hard because every class is fun and completely unique. Retail WoW since legion is "what class feels the LEAST bad to play?"
---
Everything is 'gatekeeping' for the person who doesn't like the thing they aimed the term at. As such, it's not definable. 'Gatekeeping' functions as shorthand for "stop criticizing the thing I like". It's a relatively recent memetic virus introduced into our society to ensure continued discord and confusion of the masses as we argue about what is or isn't true/real.
---
I leveled my PvP hunter as an alt with my main priest raid heals. So I was able to leverage the fact that I pulled a lot of weight in the guild to get the hunter included in the PvE side when things were on farm. That being said, if your goal is PvP you have to accept (and find those accepting) that they're carrying you in raid content.
---
BM is middle to bottom of the pack in DPS in raids due to the propensity of vanilla content to include some sort of AOE damage to melee, killing your pet off or requiring you pull the pet out of combat. Granted, it's hella safe and guaranteed damage what with range/mobility/FD. And it does have it's moments like razorgore kiting. But still, it was and likely will be again an uphill battle to get a raid spot.
---
If you use an enchanted white item you can use that same item for multiple characters. Basically vanilla heirloom items.
---
Hmm, I wonder if you had it was some kind of script instead of /pet /cast 
---
The way the ghost wolf pvp boots work is it increases movement speed of ghost wolf to 55%, and as there are no other sources of 8% increased walk speed I'd only assume that much like the druid travel form it too would stack
---
(was druid in vanilla, but I can't recall all the details).
---
Either way, in stage 2 content, having imp ghost wolf and boosting its movement speed up to 63% would make kiting melee absolutely premium. (I'd prolly go 31/7/13 in that case, I really just like imp ghost wolf)
---
That was because how honor was given out. It had nothing to do with experience.
---
Night Elf Mohawk
---
A quick google search could have solved this.  
---
No we don't know a release date.
---
I remember having that, but I don't recall it being botting.  I think it might have been one of those things where a patch messed with it and the author just didn't update.  My memory is fuzzy though, so I'm not 100% sure on that one.
---
We'll definitely have a meme spec friendly guild when the day arrives
---
Recent blue post indicated an early summer release, could just be semantics though

It's funny that the hunter does have a high skill cap when at first glance it's the easiest class to play. The term "huntard" doesn't exist for no reason.
---
I sincerely miss my weeks and weeks and weeks of Arathi farm guarding with the occasional flag-room guard thrown in as a break from hiding in bushes alternatively laying traps and flaring to running about a small room alternatively laying traps and flaring...

Lol playing on a private server isn't anything close to being illegal. You are breaching terms of service for a 14 year old game that no longer exists. Even hosting a server probably isn't illegal, although you obviously are under some threat of a C&amp;D and maybe a lawsuit under extraordinary circumstances (like you set up a business and profiting off the server and refusing C&amp;D over a period of months).  
---
I'd join on my as a holy priest, but I'm not planning on memespec'ing in vanilla.  
---
i can’t remember exactly how it was written. gah. damnit. i guess imll just have to try it when classic launches and see if it works.
---
This.
---
I have affiliate already so plan on building the channel more come classic. Stream Post scriptum and my raids on the private server got aq40 tonight.
---
Actually it has very little content that requires flying. 
---
Oh hell yeah!
---
that could be. i always thought the idea that it was botting was pretty ridiculous. but that’s the explanation i got and it’s stuck with me since.
---
hoping classic allows it because it’s a great time saver. and makes sense to boot.
---
I quit beginning of Cata and swore it off when pandaland came along, but apparently a lot of people say that panda expansion was probably the best one after Wrath.. ha
---
Tarren Mill, hands down. 
---
I'm blanking: what's the lightning bolt on 4? Innervate?
---
Very little of it requires flying. Access to the Tempest dungeons could be had via a teleporter on the ground. 
---
I had a hard time pvping as a priest. I raid healed and dabbled in bgs and world PvP but it was just more of the same: heal other people, try not to die
---
I'd join a guild that runs mainly/only gimped specs for the challenge of it. 
---
Honestly I think they're fishing. They're making Classic in hopes of a similar situation to OSRS, but at the same time they're not going all in on their investment. Additionally, no matter how many people end up staying, the game will be pretty much on the back burner with the light's flickering, so they're going to make money no matter.  
---
And finally, I think they're doing it for a stronger legal position against private servers.  
---
I need serious help picking a race/class. I never played classic but I started at the end of BC. I was a blood elf mage and loved it. Unfortunately that is not an option for me in classic so I need to come up with an alternative. I absolutely will not be alliance. I am between Tauren druid and undead mage. Can someone give me advice on why I should choose one over the other? I want to DPS btw, even at level 60.
---
I agree. 
---
True, but that's a retroactive argument to justify the imbalance. In reality, Vanilla WoW endgame was extremely rough around the edges and experimental. The devs were busy putting Spirit on warlock items and making epics that were worse than greens. They certainly were not calculating max potential Fury DPS with a mix of oddball leather and mail items.
---
Maybe from 60-69. There are many questing/daily hubs(netherwind isle, various high spots in nagrand) and a raid even (Tempest Keep) that requires flying!
---
There are methods that risk running afoul of the subreddit's rules which would be the best, but beyond those, Wowwiki still maintains the quest lists and the pre-stat-squish item stats.  
---
All the Hellfire quests are listed here:  https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Hellfire_Peninsula_quests
---
At a quick glance through the Alliance quests, the only leather bracers I found as a quest reward (it was quick, so might have missed something) were https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Demonslayer%27s_Wristguards from https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:Cleansing_the_Waters.  And that's pitting 96 armor, 12 AGI, 18 STA and 26 AP against 126 armor, 26 AGI, 14 STA, 1 crit and set bonuses.  So, ~1.5% crit and 30 armor (plus 14 AGI for buffs) against 4 STA and 12 AP.
---
Ya me too idk how they fixed it though; That's why no one wanted to heal early on.
---
Classic doesn't only mean classic vanilla
---
You might like my last video on the Scarlet Crusade being wildly incompetent lol. Not quite the same perspective as this however. Only my third video. 
---
If people like this one ill probably do more in same vein.
---
hell yeah brother. horde or alliance though?
---
But then it can only be used on one char
---
Tyvm dude!
---
I'm sure I'd like to join such a thing, and I'm also sure I'd get frustrated after the 9th wipe in BWL and respec to something more effective
---
The way it should be!
---
Really good for ret paladin, will double your dps.
---
Well I really like the idea of it. I will check out your other video. Can I just point out that there were times when your voice was almost drowned out by the background music, for future reference.
---
[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MlPDT_O7-aM](Here) Otherguy shows his spec and how he played.
---
I'm a healing warrior. Would you let me bandage your raids?
---
So I normally have zero interest in lore and I can't watch the videos either. I don't ever really care to be honest.  
---
However, I watched your video to the very end. I guess when you're basically dicking around through the video, it captures my attention more.  
---
Dicks... my attention... my attention for dicks...  
---
Anyway, make another one. You don't have a choice in this matter.  
---
I've already told my fiance that wow will be part of my life. She understands thankfully
---
I regret to inform you that most of the people who will be playing classic haven't been playing on private servers and, from the portion who actually played 12+ years ago, don't perfectly remember things. 
---
Probably referring to the pair of tone deaf blue posters who, within a day of the announcement, went on the new Blizzard Classic forums and [dumped cold water](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759242036?page=7#post-127) on the jubilant masses [for whatever reason](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759242036?page=7#post-140). 
---
[Another](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759242036?page=8#post-153). And they kept going with it. 
---
As someone who levelled as a Hunter Tank on a private server it's a safe bet that I'd join in a heartbeat.
---
Especially since I'm currently stuck on my decision of what to main in Classic including a Ret Paladin, Melee Hunter or Bear or Balance Druid.
---
&gt; I'm a healing warrior.
---
Is there any other kind?
---
Thanks. And yeah looking back theres definitely a part talking about the nobles in particular thats rly annoying me that i didnt fix up a bit. Appreciate the concern.
---
One of the vanilla devs was a warrior player that hated hybrids thats why warriors got buff after buff in vanilla.
---
&gt; And finally, I think they're doing it for a stronger legal position against private servers. 
---
This is irrelevant. Because any country that is willing to uphold Blizzard's IP/Copyright will up hold them if Blizzard seeks out the servers that is what happened to Nost. The biggest private servers are in countries (cough Russia cough) that don't give 2 craps about Blizzard's IP/Copyright and nothing Blizzard can do will force those countries to care. All Blizzard can do is offer those people a better experience and hope they change over.
---
Yup. Just to stand loudly and shout that it’s viable and probably more fun than what the mainstream does. 
---
Horde?
---
Didn't watch it all, but looks like hes on an earlier patch where you can't pick up pyro for just 1 point?
---
I’d be playing Alliance, but eventually roll Horde on another server after a while
---
This is the exact opinion why we should do something like this. Everyone writes it off without even trying it. I bet you’ve never ate asshole too. 
---
I've never seen a Pally or Shaman tank during progression. I doubt it's even possible.
---
Bring lots of bandages
---
Damnit. Skarm hasn't put out many videos so far anyone. Anyone who is seriously interested in high level information can look through the few uploads.

100% had China farmers in azshara during vanilla

---
As Horde, what was the run you did heading south out of Arathi Highlands through what seems like a dozen Alliance lowbie zones? You had a few dwarf tunnel towns to go through and all. I can't remember what the point was...but I remember doing it.
---
Honestly, I don't think anyone actually knows.
---
Yeah we have played private servers to death, and people have played Vanilla back in the day but this isn't going to be the same as either of them.
---
Private servers have already proven to be pretty inaccurate, and that's only at the low levels so far.
---
Vanilla was played when unviable specs were much more unviable than they would be now due to the general ability, knowledge and lack of keyboard turning.
---
Sure we can guess how it's going to pan out, but there's no point worrying or complaing about what classes should or shouldn't raid until the game releases and we know how they play out. 
---
Right. Warriors were never treated by the devs as hybrids. It was about being able to heal. 
---
&gt; around level 8 I am just getting stomped by this rodent fuck named Hogger
---
Har!
---
Honestly you might be surprised how different classic will function compared to retail. Yes there will always be tryhards and “mythic raider” 15yr olds but the majority of players will be an older generation that played vanilla back in the day.
---
I could be wrong in saying this or maybe I’m biased, but I think a lot of guilds will be much more accepting and casual then you think. I know the guild my friends and I are making will care much more about dedicated players then what spec they play or min Maxing. Someone wants to play a shadowpriest and raid, sure no problem...just show up to the raid. 3 ret pallys? Fantastic come along.
---
Yea we might not get into naxx or too far at all, but atleast we’re having fun.
---
BUT HUMANS ARE BORING /s
---
Likely down through Wetlands and Loch Modan to reach Badlands, Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes
---
W
---
I come up with this:
---
-Tempest Keep 
---
-Netherwing
---
-Throne of the elements (Nagrand)
---
-Kil'Jaden Throne
---
-Skettis
---
-Ogrila (Blade's Edge)
---
Of that list, everything except parts of the Netherwing grind are doable without flying mounts if you have access to the areas. Correct me if I'm wrong, it's been a while since I played TBC. Access to these areas could be had via teleporters or flight paths.
---
How could you not mention HoJ from BRD?! People will be running BRD for HoJ basically forever.
---
I will never forget where Mankrik's wife or the stolen silver are
---
People already knew about all that. Thottbot was a thing. Other than the first couple of months, pretty much everything was mapped out. What I think will take away from the Magic of WoW is that we know what became of it. And I don't even mean that in an anti-retail way.
---
Part of the mystique for me when I was playing it was a lot of the unfinished areas. Locked doors, inactive portals, empty zone areas. The world was full of so much promise. This amazing world was going to grow and be fleshed out further. It was exciting.
---
Now of course we know that the first expansion took us through a portal to spend most of our time on a completely different world. The locked doors of Classic will be forever locked. The promise of what is yet to come is gone.
---
People in Vanilla were clueless noobs.
---
All end game dungeons are important to run for one reason or another including rep, rare recipe drops, mats and gold making (orbs), farming raid consumes like holy water and dark runes, and much more.
---
It seems like blizzard under estimates how well it will do in my opinion.
---
I'm planning on grinding Org rep, I think undead on wolves look sweet
---
Unless you are just trolling, you are glossing over the fact that raw damage/healing is not a useful metric in a raid composition in respects to hybrids unless you're comparing individual to individual with the same setup.  If however, you're comparing hybrids in the sense that they fulfill niches in the form of doing less-optimal damage/healing/tanking and providing additional utility, then you are correct.  Usually these are in the form of providing boosts to the rest of your group or raid composition while performing the role they are hybridizing as (DPS/Heals/Tank)
---
Examples:
---
Shadow Priest (DPS): Shadow Weaving is something only they can provide while performing their regular DPS duties (Assists Warlocks/SPriests)
---
Feral Druid (DPS or Tank): 3% crit to Group while performing regular DPS/Tank duties(Assists Melee/Non-Magical DPS)
---
Enhancement Shaman (DPS): +20% Nature Damage for next 2 attacks and provides least effective Nightfall uptime while performing regular DPS duties(assists Boomkin, Shamans, Thunderfury-Warriors)
---
Retribution Paladin (DPS): +10% Holy Damage aura and Flat +Holy Damage on spells and provides 2nd-least effective Nightfall uptime while performing regular DPS duties (Assists Protection Paladins/Retribution Paladins)
---
I would be up for it on horde side. I think we could easily meme our way to Twin Emps and probably Cthun. Depending on preparation we could probably even MeMe most of Naxx. 
---
Future Undead Shadow Priest
---
You missed the awesome strategy of one person pulling a pack that you can't kill and running away while other person kills one of the pack. Let's call it the brave sir Robin tactic (can alsow be used to loot chests)
---
I heard the same lol
---
I think the recent trend is saving the hype for closer to a game's release. I expect they'll start advertising by, latest, mid May
---
&lt; Dad Bod &gt; is what I’d like to name my guild of a similar approach
---
That's not the situation that was described. The person that I was responding to said this:
---
&gt;The only reason Shedo gets so close to the top is cuz no one else on his stream / guild bothers to go as hard as he does for all the possible buffs in the game.
---
Lmao glad you liked it. From what i've seen there seems to be a real lack of this type/tone of wow content for some reason. Regardless its what ill continue to be doing among other stuff.
---
They're not great, but the +10% shadow dmg debuff is nice for the warlocks so that can be enough to have a spot for 1 per raid. You have very low range, 0 aoe damage, generate high threat, run out of mana very quickly with no way to regen, poor scaling (getting very little from +crit, not needing much +hit and poor spell damage coefficients) and of course even under best conditions they're still low dps and at best can hope for a top 15 spot in a competent raid. So yeah, have fun!
---
Defias/VanCleef's slogan: Make Stormwind Great Again!
---
Jokes aside, I know both groups were manipulated by Onyxia but damn, did I feel bad killing the Defias and VC.
---
But would you marry your spouse of 15 years ago today?
---
(If you're still in your 20s, the answer should probably be no)
---
The orc has the advantage for dps and threat production.
---
Yes basicly until ZG patch, you are healing. because there is only 8 debuff slots, so there is no room for shadowpriest spells.
---
The general idea of vanilla is, and was. if you have heals you are a healer. 
---
With the exeption of druid tanks, but even they get a healing backup set.
---
I will also be rolling on the cloth with plus healing for my spec. 
---
would you believe that some people think they can tank or dps as a warrior? newbs.
---
or not play on a PVP server
---
I see what you did there, here, take my upvote!
---
OP has the exact same cadence and delivery as Nixxiom. Interesting.
---
Depends how far you wanna go and your mindset.
---
High end guilds take 0-1 shadow priest per raid. Because of the debuff limit you usually can’t use SWP or mind flay, but you will be taken to put shadowweaving on the target to improve warlock dps.
---
Low end to medium guilds take 1-3 shadowpriests, depending if you show up to the raid with consumables and always ready to go. More flexible on debuff slots.
---
Casual guilds will take whoever, and if you don’t use shadowform and are willing to throw a shield and maybe a clutch heal here and there, I don’t see you having much difficulty finding a group.
---
Dungeons you are very much liked because you pad a lot of damage with vamp embrace so everyone loves you.
---
Not when you're horde, no. 
---
I assume he's talking about the Horde. Either way I find it hard to believe SW cant send SOME troops to Westfall and alleviate the issue. Sentinal Hill is a joke.
---
Lol, is this a joke that Ret dps is bad haha?
---
&gt;A second chance to take every mistake made in 15 years and go a different path. #nochanges is like going back in time and choosing to do the same fucking mistakes over and over because of the nostalgia factor.
---
OK let's say Blizzard open to changes, who decides what changes get made?
---
Is everyone going to agree on the changes being asked for, and if not should Blizzard just listen to the majority?
---
You're not going to like hearing this, but this is EXACTLY why retail went the way it did, and that is why people are asking for a pure form of classic. People naturally want life to be easier for them, so the majority of voices asking for changes will gravitate towards that. This isn't conducive to a rewarding MMO experience, which is what we really all want. 
---
Of course there are changes that may subjectively improve the game for certain audiences, but you are never going to find a formula that pleases all, including original vanilla.
---
But with the original game in its pure form, you can be sure of what you're getting, and it's something that everyone who asked for it believes is better than retail.
---
Then why even play wow‽
---
How did you not get it? I only PvPed and didn't raid and got it from a guild who messaged me to come take it because it was gonna rot.
---
Wtf 
---
Never knew this

All I remember is seeing him in his iconic armor and wanting his red Bandana

Tbf I don't think games have altogether lost that aspect. I think you're just a good deal older and the adult world done what it does. 
---
I'm not on the hype train but games like Fortnight command pretty insane followings. There's plenty of anecdotal stories of people losing limbs to poor circulation playing VR games. 
---
But there's something to older games with simple graphics that leave more up to the imagination, which to me makes for a more memorable experience. 
---
I'm going through Assassin's creed odyessy right now. Fantastic game in its own right and a game I've always dreamed of, it's so polished I have kind of forgotten half of what I've been up to since I've begun. Playing on autopilot is easy.  
---
The years I spent scouring Oblivion for every Nugget of content, completing over and over is time and feeling I will never quite achieve again. Listening to the soundtrack now is a pretty longful experience, knowing the magic isn't quite what it was. 
---
Pretty much all popular private servers are hosted through OVH in france as far as I know.
---
The barrens and stranglethorn vale always were and will be my favorite zones in WoW.
---
For me the subreddit isn't going to make any difference, but the fact that it's a 15 year old game that I played fully of course will. It will never be as magical as it once was. But it's still a game I could play from time to time for a pretty reasonable monthly cost that I could enjoy without going crazy. If I were able to play hardcore again it could also be a game I'd enjoy doing progression in, even if it ends up being easier now that people know how to play. It can be good even if it's not as magical as it was before.
---
Na, not to me at least. My first play through in Dark Souls was awesome but I still enjoyed the several other runs I put into the game and vanilla wow will be no different. The biggest draw of the game is class design and I never got to experience a warrior or shaman. Discovering things is small in comparison.
---
Good point.
---
I remember how stressful those quests were. Always worried someone would show up and mess up your attempt. And I wasn't even on PvP. I am glad to have done both the priest and hunter quests though. It's a lot of content and the hunter one really does make you a better hunter.
---
I like the idea of rolling Tauren, but i just cant do it lol. Glad you liked the video.

TLDR?
---
They are both excellent choices!
---
You can dps as both classes although you will have to spend a significant amount of on your druid if you want to be considered "viable" by your peers. Feral Druid is heavily reliant on consumables and a 2-handed mace from Gnomeregan in order to do decent dps. Balance druid is unfortunately not considered optimal in any way because of mana issues, although there are probably guilds out there who will take you if you are dedicated enough.
---
 The upside of playing a druid over a mage is the ability to play different roles and you will generally have an easier time getting into groups. That said, I would definitely not consider rolling druid if you are not somewhat prepared to play other roles than DPS.
---
May the Earthmother smile upon you.
---
For the Horde!
---
you only go troll if you absolutely cannot stand undead and absolutely love trolls. which of course would make you wrong, but plenty of people are wrong.
---
there is no world in which trolls are remotely a better race for mage than undead.
---
Oh right, the joys of missing attacks and corpse running. Have fun mate.
---
As far as I remember, 1.2 was the fastest attack speed with most pets being 2.0 - 2.2?
---
It doesn't get much better, but yeah if you only care about min/max then there are better options.
---
Do how about warriors and priests? They can both dps and either tank or heal. But they sure don't *feel* like hybrids. Why?
---
Im not in board with that but tell you what, we'll let you kill Katrina Prestor as many times as you want.
---
Preferably one with poison dispel lol.
---
It’s not that black and white. Onyxia had a play in this, manipulating both sides. The stonemasons to ask for much more money, the nobles to refuse any payment.
---
The armies‘ missuse was also part her doing and she is the main reason why aid was not sent to Redridge when the Blackrock Clan invaded.
---

---
Most servers were not PVP
---
I played horde, not sure if that makes a difference. I took a look at the fandom links, and I think those items are from after the stat rework. Even then the items are very comparable considering one took weeks of running a 40-man raid and the other was thrown at you just for waltzing by.
---
6 - 8 is the big tell here. I'm not trying to tell you how to play the game. I'm trying to save you donuts the frustration of lvling as non combat.
---
Most groups wont but you'd probably be able to find a low tier raiding guild.
---
Dwarf ret paladin
---
High elves are neutral, hostile to Horde, hostile to Alliance, or hostile to both, depending on the individual high elf.
---
Minor speed to boots is one of the most powerful PvP enchants in the game. If you don't have it and your opponent does, they have an innate movement speed advantage over you which will sometimes put you in a losing situation.

Duskwood, i remember watching my dad leveling his warrior and kill the skeletons near the city. I was so young and it's one of my clearest memory of that time :D ! 
---
You caught me, i stole my personality from someone else.
---
&gt;I only reached lvl 54 in Vanilla back in the day
---
This is the reason there is such a mob of people foaming at the mouth to have flying mount TBC.
---
He goes abobe and beyond for sure. But the people in his raids still have a lot of wbuffs. I actually disagree with that assessment. I would say his skill and dedication is a big part of why he gets up on the meters, not cause he raids with a buncha slackers.
---
Sorry, should’ve included a TLDR edit. Will update when I get home. 
---
What a shameful waste.
---
Well I was always a Horde player but this time around I was planning on doing Alliance but now you have made me love my Tauren again!
---
Nope. Now sure, it won't be quite the same as going into the game knowing pretty much nothing about it, but I've been playing on private servers for years now and it's still so much fun. Were you ever recreate the experience of making your first character? And touring storm in for the first time? Or Orgrimmar if you're cool? No, but then then only ever happened on one character and most people play more than one, play the game for years, and knowing what you're doing is actually being part of the fun. 
---
It's generally accepted that UD for PvP and Troll for PvE is ideal.
---
People will cite WotF for PvE but if you're a competent mage positioning correctly you'll outrange most fears, and you get Berserker for casting speed.
---
In the end the difference isn't deal breaking.
---
fuck to the yes. what's the faction?
---
Do you like healing? Because that is most likely what you will end up doing at max level. While Shadow is amazing in PvP it is somewhat lackluster in PvE due to mana issues. That being said if you heal, your fellow adventurers will absolutely love you and getting into groups/raids will be a piece of cake. A knowledgeable priest is a thing to fear. If you enjoy healing and enjoy having a bigger toolkit than druid, roll priest. 
---
There's always Benedection/ Anathema to work towards, which is something mages do not get.
---
You can't do anything you didn't try.
---
It isn't a coincidence he yells 'our cause is righteous'.
---
What about your alliance friends defending her? And are they fair game as well?
---
Thats fair. I was thinking beyond vanilla where a level 80 player could just endlessly kill level 50 players. It just got so crazy as the expansions went on. You became millions of times stronger than a level 1 players. Like..... dragon ball z levels (according to the stats and whatnot)

---
Played healer throughout my vanilla (resto druid) and TBC (dis priest) but I want to try a new role for Classic (thinking dps). 
---
However, I am afraid that if I pick a dps class, I would have to compete for spots on raids/dungeons (which are components that I like). 
---
Out of all the dps which class are less competitive to find a spot in a raid/dungeon? 
---
Movement speed on dudes is the only enchant you should ever use on your boots for any spec of any class, unless you have a talent that you take that gives you the same effect, but you shouldn't take that talent because you're wasting Talent points when you can just get the enchant.
---
What about the corpse runs when you miss 50% of your abilities due to the lack of precision? Or the overall kill time you have? Do you expect to be corpse camped by 60s?  
---
On a separate point, how does vanish help you vs hunters exactly? How do you remove the dot off yourself? Not like it matters though, you're vanish will be on cd since you'll have to use it every time you pull more than 1 mob.  
---
I'm not even going to go into Endurance and Imp Sprint, as it will take you 5 minutes to find them on the talent tree. Maybe level a rogue to at least level 5 before you post this theorycraft bs.
---
Nah, they just a bunch of scum bags and mismanaged beuracrats.
---
Nahhh. I mean, sure, the first run with vanilla was absolutely magical. I was enamored just by running around the barrens for hours listening to the music and exploring. It's not going to be like that this time around but it'll still be awesome if people keep the community aspect of it alive. It's like playing Diablo 2/3. After awhile you kind of know what's what, but that game was still amazing because of the community aspect. 
---
If you want to do dps in vanilla and not be shovelling shit uphill the whole time your only good choices are warrior/rogue/lock/mage. So this is a very easy problem.
---
You're wrong though. Guilds do have off specs and they do clear raids. In 2005-2006 we had a ret paladin, an arms arrior, a feral druid and a balance druid, and we cleared AQ40 (up until C'thun before I quit) and the first three bosses in Naxx). back in Vanilla we actually did include these specs, maybe not as guilds who wantet to be the best, but still to clear most of the content. and there was definitely room for all spes. I still remember the first time we downed Nefarian. We had every type of noob, and every type of spec
---
Nope. Maybe they discussed it, but was never implemented.
---
XP loss as a result from death was a pretty standard feature in most MMOs at the time (in fact, WoW was kind of casual for it’s time) so they might have wanted to add it, but i have no recollection of anything like that on live servers and i’ve been playing since 2004.
---
I'd say mage. They bring strong CC, strong damage, free water for the healer. Everyone wants a mage in their party. Unfortunately they are also one of the more popular classes.
---
Hunter is also worth considering. They also have good CC, decent damage and they don't share armor type with more than one class (0 if you are alliance). They are also far less popular than mages. Sadly most guilds do not like to bring more than a couple hunters to raids, but if you show yourself to be dedicated you will have no problem finding a spot. This is somewhat true for most classes.
---
That being said I'd still caution you to play the class you think you will have most fun with. It's a long journey to 60 and endgame, you're going to spend as much time out of dungeons and raids as in them.
---
Shadow Weaving is a ONE OF to buff warlocks in NAXX and maybe AQ progression. Before then it is not worth the dps loss of a real dps
---
Druid 3% crit to 4 people, not worth it over another rogue or warrior
---
Nature damage buff is absolute trash, you could only reference boomkin(probably the worst"hybrid" dps in the game) and a fucking thunderfury proc lmao. Ele shaman will oom themself 40% through a boss fight
---
+holy damage is absolutely useless. Ooooh you can buff other terrible pally damage or a sick smite priest build.
---
Their class utility is already at it's most usefull (except the ONE shadow priest) in their healing specs. Their damage utility is not even close to offsetting their terrible dps. They either heal or don't raid. Either way, the dps slot is always better used on a real dps. All special fight mechanics are covered by the healers for dispels and utility. There's just no reason to bring a hybrid dps. I wish there was.
---
At best, hybrid dps can hope to get carried through a dungeon
---
and then some guy dispels you
---
Just have mining and herb on any class, but mage is best because mind quickening gem lets you mine nodes/grab herbs faster.   
---
Go to burning steppes. There are some locations with many rich thorium and a lotus spawn in close vicinity.  
---
Try to get all the nodes on the same timer by not mining them until they are all spawned. (Hard if they are contested)  
---
Know the timer.   
---
Play some other game and then mine the nodes when they spawn, look for lotus.
---
But we are of course talking about it with todays knowledge in mind
---
I'm pretty sure we will start with 16 debuff slots, as the devs said during Blizzcon. 
---
Also a very dedicated Shadow Priest shouldn't have such a hard time finding a guild, unless the private server min-max mentality carries over to the official servers.
---
I am but the gaming definition of Zerg isn't Starcraft exclusive it's used in a wide array of games and the general consensus and even Urban dictionary states it as such.
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zerg
---
Now mind taking away that downvote (not that I care  about karma but even little things such as Reddit can set a dangerous precedent for the human population when correct information is shunned)
---
As a druid you may be disappointed as DPS. At end game their tier gear is all for healing. Also your DPS will be significantly lower. Undead mage is a good choice though.
---
I mean.. without itemization and 1.12 talents/spells min-max druids are suppose to be resto. You will never come close to compete with a mage in terms of dps as a druid, so go for the undead mage choice if you want to dps in classic.
---
They weren't always the best DPS in the game though. Prior to the weapon normalization patch which pushed Rogues slightly down as well as the Warrior class rework which buffed Warriors considerably they were fairly limited in scope.
---
The meta of 8+ Fury Warriors in every raid that you see on private servers was not originally a thing in vanilla. That's the consequence of how the game was in its finalized state.
---
&gt;Maybe they discussed it, but was never implemented.
---
&gt;XP loss as a result from death was a pretty standard feature 
---
No one's talking about Xp lost on death.
---
If you play as a priest you are likely going to be asked to heal in raids. I was a shadow priest in vanilla and my guild did not give me a choice and said if I wanted to raid I had to spec as holy. Maybe you will be more lucky tho. But if you don't want to heal ever then I recommend avoiding paladin, shaman, druid, or priest.
---
Best of all, you never go OOM. Infinite heals baby!
---
Also don't forget that sweet Ankh of Life [https://classicdb.ch/?item=1713](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1713)
---
Instant heal with only 5 min cooldown? OP! Those priests will eat your dust on the healing meters.
---
Elwynn and Westfall &lt;3
---
I played at launch and off and on until BC and thereafter,l. I never played any of the end game and was never that hardcore. While it may be common knowledge, I personally have a lot to discover still. 
---
Better off taking the boat to STV
---
A priest healer is better, but if you game with people who are not slaves to the mentality of min-maxing you can certainly be a Spriest in Classic.
---
If you have many warlocks in the raid a Spriest is very good. So it all depends.
---
I'm a simple man, I see my words, I upvote
---
I can't wait until you talk about orcs.
---
Threat meter is a must in my opinion.
---
I wasnt expecting the last sentence of your comment and burst out a chuckle during class and a few people turned to look at me. Well done
---
In wPvP, before people get well geared, and with the element of surprise you might get some nice kills and win most fights.
---
But once people start getting T2+ and you start doing BGs for honor, you will be severely gimped.
---
This is a good post highlighting the downsides of enh shaman:

It can be a fun spec, but know what you’re getting yourself into.
---
He didnt drop his cruel barb for me.. thats what he did wrong
---
No changes in 3, 2, 1.....
---
If you plan on raiding as dps go mage 
---
All druid or all paladin guild please.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I think being able to be sapped more than 10sec within a 30sec period is just stupid. Especially when you start adding combos in, even if you have a stun break, another stun can just be thrown on you. Takes a lot of fun out of PVP for me personally 
---
You’re welcome. Let’s level together sometime and I’ll tell you all about my wife’s asshole 
---
I would accept it in bgs only. 
---
As another guy said in response already, the damage was less spikey on a druid and threat was far less of an issue. Towards the end of vanilla, I preferred healing druids to warriors. Its anecdotal but I feel like the druid tanking your raids was so much more committed to the game and a better player.
---
I'm not trying to argue progression cause my experience was always with warriors and the pserver evidence will always be tainted.
---
I mean, can you do a killing blow without someone dying?
---
Hell yeah brother, cheers from Stormwind!
---
But that sweet sweet innervate.
---
I can't believe i didn't think of that lol. Yeah I will definitely have to have that. 
---
My guild during Vanilla was run pretty much like this. Most people had something close to ideal specs, and I don't think we had any fire mages in MC, but we had a BM hunter, an Arms warrior, Ret pally. We didn't get super far in progression, but we cleared MC, ZG, and BWL (killed Nef shortly before TBC came out). I can't remember how much of AQ20 and 40 we did.
---
The biggest difficulty was always having people know what to do and when to do it.
---
You can't sheep or sap someone for 30-40 seconds in 1.12. What are you talking about?
---
Yes, don't forget, since its meme specs only it will be scored like golf. I'm sure to win.
---
I agree!
---
MadSeason has the BEST content. People complain about his monotone voice, but I love it. His knowledge of the game and video editing is right up my alley. 
---
Guilds may take one shadow priest raiding so there will be stiff competition for each spot so you will have to better then the other shadow priest aplying. From my experience guilds usually give there shadow priest spot to a priest that has already shown they will be there for raids and the guild in general. That way if they ever need you to go back to healing for progression they know they have a competent priest.
---
i’m not sure what i used exactly. i just remember it not working after a certain point and me being upset i had to click mark AND pet attack. i’m hoping it works in classic though! great time saver.
---
He also calls players "lapdogs" aka pawns.
---
Lazypig is incredible. Atlas for navigating dungeons is nice. Class specific stuff like swingtimer, druidbar, energytracker are all very helpful.
---
Hope to hell Blizzard gives add-on devs time to make these before classic launches. Doubt it 
---
Tbh red = dead.

You can. I just tried it on a 1.12 server and it's stupid. What are you talking about?

---
Swingtimer will definitely be useful ill be a shaman and using totems for kiting between swings is going to be my main way of playing. I can't believe i forgot that as well. 
---
Dungeon maps are definitely going to be important. 
---
I hope they get enough time as well. Hopefully Beta drops several months before the game.
---
Not the Horde. Something else...
---
Well, in part maybe, there's another reason much closer to home, that gets revealed in a series of quests starting in the Burning Steppes.
---
Most people live at home, in my experience
---
I meant in a never leave kinda sense
---
Make the next one about the pedophile who butchered the girl he wanted.
---
not only is it limited in sources, but it has a dynamic effect on the way the game is played.  It's not like the other stats which make you either kill stuff faster, die slower, or fight longer.  Movement speed actually effects the mechanics of the game, and how they interact with your character.
---
Bring us 10 Akiri Reeds and wipe away the debt!
---
But that's not nearly as fun
---
&gt; Do they always tell us exactly what they are considering at all times?
---
No, of course not. And none of us have telepathic powers, either. So unless Blizz starts talking about Classic TBC, then the best assumption is that they are not talking about it. Anything else is literally unfounded speculation.
---
Spurs give 4%
---
Carrot gives 3%
---
Gloves give 2%

I think this falls into the same category as fixing meme specs and damage scaling getting out of hand.
