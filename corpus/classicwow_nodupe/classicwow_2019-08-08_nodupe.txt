Pserver levelling is also the mythic version of levelling. its much easier on classic
---
I see your tricks, you want MY treasure chest...nice try! I will be the first!!!
---
As warrior, you’ll have to mostly rely on your gear to get you through battle.  You have the opportunity to outplay warlocks, priests, and rogues and hunters to some extent, but smart druids, paladins, and mages will pretty much always wipe the floor with you. 
---

---
It’s still a blast - especially AV when you can charge into a group and intimidating shout - healers have a hidden instinct to pocket heal you if you’re being effective at your job.
---
Nice. I belong in this subreddit.
---
This comp defeats all odds. Baffled!
---
They were separate AHs, so people only ever used the IF one.
---
They can have a very high skill ceiling, but the difference between just playing and min/maxing in your play style/rotations is lower for hunters than most other classes.
---
Edit: in my opinion
---
Nice

I wasn't able to recreate the exact request, as i never got the  CLFR02 error, but i was able to record a request to the zengine db update service.  I hope this will give you the information you are looking for.

---
I wager Darnassus was as empty and forlorn an AH as Gadgetzan.
---
I think a smaller, non-epic MMO could work fine. Something with a theme similar to TF2: Red vs Blu, no real complicated story, no gigantic world that contains tons of zones you never revisit after you out level them (wtf is Loch Modan, Redridge, Westfall, etc.).
---
What ultimately keeps people playing is new content : new raids, new BGs, new arena seasons.
---
Step 20 for tauren warrior - Teleport to moonglade?
---
Thanks, this helped alleviate some of the anxiety I was getting thinking about how crowded it will be.  You're right, its no marathon, and eventually it'll get much more stable (ie less fighting for spawns) :D
---
They said their plan was to only use it for the first couple weeks but that they will absolutely not have it past the first month.  But if that's true it will still be a painful transition after 2 weeks.
---
where did they say that?
---
What do you mean? 
---
You said:
---
&gt; the fact that this game has such great feeling combat and responsiveness.
---
Retail has that now if not more so? 
---
&gt; The time sink on leveling and on gear really makes the epic items feel truly epic/rare and rewarding.
---
Time spent gives the impression of worth, which is good for some. 
---
Personally, I get satisfaction out of defeating difficult content for my gear / rewards. That is not something that Classic has but what Retail offers in multiple avenues. 
---
&gt; And the 2 opposing factions giving the players an "enemy" that's a real person.
---
Couldn't really comment since this didn't really make sense to me. 
---
&gt; The fact that they naturally let the factions encounter each other in the world creating endless dynamic conflict and struggle.
---
This is more of a thing in retail than in Classic. There's no world pvp in Classic and it only existed organically because there was nothing else to do. 
---
A hammer will of course see everything as a nail.
---
This should be the top voted comment.
---
Apart from the fact that it's a security risk to download random files from random people, it's also rather pointless, even if OP has the best intentions. You save 30 secs but then you have to figure out wtf you downloaded, find the pages of the authors (where you should have been in the first place) for guides, then delete the add-ons you don't want.
---
Download the add-ons from the creator's page. Faster and safer.
---
It's not a macro, it's an unbound keybind setting.
---
Yep, I'm pretty sure I remember standing in Org, next to the ring of portals and a little system message popped up saying something like "World of Warcraft Cataclysm is now live" and we could start the trek to 85.
---
Why does that Attack Table article talk about level 80's?  I don't know why, but something about that tells me it's not Vanilla based.  Maybe there's some other explanation?
---
dont forget the poop knife attachment for the bucket
---
where though? on the blue post it just says "Our global pre-launch test of WoW Classic will begin on Thursday, 8  August at 20:00 CEST and is scheduled to end on Friday, August 9. "
---
He says that, but he's clearly wielding a 2h hammer.
---
“Aww yea, I got this with 10% health to sp- oh shit he’s running, hamstrung but can’t...get...him.. fast.. eno-“
---
“Rwlrwlrwlrwlrwl”
---
“Aaargh...” *writes Aaargh to mark his death*
---
I mean when leveling is a month(s) long quest to 60, I don't think starting at 60 is a "much better gauge" for what the gameplay will be like.
---
In PvP, there's a lot of skill and nuance to any class if you want to consistently win. In pve, it's truly not that big of a deal. Almost every class has an easy rotation, and even if you're not perfecting it, pulling aggro is a big issue and at least you won't be doing that.
---
Classic just makes me want to also relive Guild Wars 1 all over again too
---
That IMO was one of the only few that got close, if not better in some aspects
---
I went Dwarf hunter because of this scene, its also the scene that made me notice the game.
---
A backend error leaked through. We have since fixed that and it will be live on the next data push.
---
We've seen it time and time again. Being on Fel makes you swole. Do they really gotta spell it out for you?
---
Ofcourse warriors want it. It's a sick pvp weapon.
---
Just playing word games now.
---
In my case, she had interest in wow being a gamer and all, but there was always someone there to tell her the game wasnt the same, wait for classic, play private servers, etc. Well, classic is here now!
---
No problem! Helps me with my CHS (Classic Hype Syndrome). 
---
That sounds like a great plan though. I'd personally focus on Prot as soon as you realistically can. Tanking is a lot more involved than anything else in this game and takes the longest to master. While you're getting good at that you'll be getting more than enough gear for both of your specs. When you do eventually switch you'll already know how to tank the bosses, how to position yourself and that will make you shine as a melee DPS class. Once you're there respeccing is a joke because you'll be rich. If you're not just offer your tanking services for $$ and after a run or two respec and go murder kids in PvP lol
---
Roll Alliance.
---
I'm contemplating making a training routine while playing. Everytime there is mandatory wait time from flightpaths, drinking/eating, waiting for spawns and long auto-runs.
---
Push-ups are easy to do in between the short breaks. Maybe some stretches might be good on the longer ones.
---
Given that his answer wasn't scripted, it's entirely possible he made a mistake.
---
"EXECUTE! EXECUTE GODDAMN YOU!"
---
"Not Enough Rage"
---
"FUCK YOU!"
---
It is? I’ve heard warriors would be better off going dual wield.
---
Thanks for the reply! There is much more coming. This was a bit rushed out so we can have something available for the stress test tomorrow. Should be much more fully fledged out with saving and other useability addons
---
It was a goofy thing i came up with that just doesnt stop making people smile
---
This tbh
---
Mobile gaming and MTX has killed the industry. And it's just not going to recover. Why would it? They make 100x more for half the effort
---
Ahh I will bathe in tears of those ppl that will go on and cry on forums how hard classic leveling is.  
---
Hey! Atleast you have community right? kappa
---
Yes we deserved to be quarantined.
---
I'd rather they just stuck with sharding, at least that's only the zone wide. Now if you get ahead of the pack while leveling there will be 10 different layers to switch from to abuse mob camps, nodes and chests

Okay--can we all use this as an opportunity to give blizzard some kudos? It can be easy to be negative but I think it's really encouraging how much they've responded to the community.

Ah I see, isn’t might of menethil better though? Since the lifesteal from the corrupted ashbringer, I believe, scales with int which warriors won’t be building and the might of menethil gives better stats for warriors.

I think the same thing when we I hear “Where Eagles Dare”

Yes in wow. Never actually seen it.

By playing the characters aren't we role playing in the first place?

Yes, we must have posted near simultaneously. 😀
---
One does not simply solo farm as a Warrior.
---
You can farm mobs duo with a partner (healer preferably).
---
You can form dungeon groups with certain items on reserve (righteous orbs).
---
You can form and lead PUG raids (in later tiers, MC/BWL pugs will be easy) and reserve all the BoE crafting drops from trash mobs to sell on the AH.
---
If you want to be able to solo farm to your heart's content, consider rolling a Hunter/Mage/Warlock alt.
---
😀
---
Nice for the people who want it! gz you've let yourself be heard and it payed off.
---
I'm more excited about the realms, really wonder what the mix up will be on EU, weekend is getting close.
---
citation? there is no way they are forcing all servers or any servers to TBC expansions, they are keeping classic as is.
---
Asmongold said he was rolling PVE because he's such a big target. Of course he could have been kidding, or lying. Considering the fact that he has a personal army following him around, I'm not sure why he would be worried. But I don't know what it's like being a big streamer, so maybe it's a legit concern for him.
---
A single RP-PVP realm for a region that speaks 30+ languages. That's gonna be fun.
---
The 50s are my favorite levels. Un goro, wpl/epl, blasted lands, felwood, winterspring, silithus.
---
PLEASE
---
I'm in such a dilemma.  
---
I really want to play Troll Hunter, but Ironforge is just too fucking awesome.
---
It’ll be a huge difference and people will see it as a waste. It’s a set dedicated to tanking at pretty much every turn. It would be like a resto shaman wearing an enhancement shaman set during the burning crusade. It would be pretty much an absolutely fuck no in pve to wear it while doing dps. And you shouldn’t want to. 
---
That said I did know a main tank of a vanilla guild that was given first dibs on might of menithil as a reward for his dedication and he used to PvP wearing his dreadnaught set with MoM specced arms and did really well. He was pretty good solo and was basically unkillable with even 1 hybrid / healer supporting him. 
---
Tldr: get it but don’t expect to use it to dps in pve.
---
Gotta take the run from Dun M to Loch Modan to Wetlands to Menethil Harbour, then take the boat to Darkshore, then take the boat to Teld.
---
I'm doing the reverse, Teld -&gt; Loch Modan. Good luck friend.
---
Correct. Ironforge had the only AH. Other cities got them at a later point (pretty early on) Even then, they were not all linked together, leaving Ironforge as the main Alliance hub for Vanilla WoW
---
&gt;Nice for the people who want it
---
Yes, I'm not one but pleased for those who do.
---
Yes, who knows  what mix up awaits us.
---
Thats the World of Warcraft that you plaaaaay
---
I played Undead Rogue in vanilla but my friends are going Alliance so I’m going to make a gnome warlock to level until it we approach the BG phase and then bring up a Dwarf Rogue. Really looking forward to stoneskin in pvp.

I think having the big streamer vs anti streamer pvp battles would be awesome personally.

It's better than zero, but your point is good.
---
Of course not, America is the world, and God forbid anyone else tell them they are wrong.

I even doubt America is the biggest pond with fish, would be funny to see a statistic after the stress test. I'll bet a Windfury, Asia is taken the lead by a substantial amount.

Ofcourse it's better. But who knows if and when it drops?

Thank you!

And you don’t really have a CC or escape ability, except for aoe fear. But sometimes that’s not even enough.

Hamstring again - Parry - Fuck I’m outta rage

You died.

I think it's a neat solution to selecting a class for people getting anxiety about it but I wouldn't want to do it myself.
---
He didn't have enough points to go deep ret after grabbing Holy Shock. How else would he have a no cast time heal that hurts undead?
---
" I think I'm losing my mind." - no argument.

But yes, a souped up "Randomize" may be fun. But later…

Really happy for you guys! Shows that if you keep pushing, it pays off!

I might actually do it. I had no intention to RP or even PvP, but when I made a shaman on Maelstrom when it first launched I had an awesome time with people.

Glad they did it.

SO insanely pumped right now.

And don't get me started if you die in a mob infested cave and/or don't get in and out before respawns. That's going to be your whole day and a hefty repair bill to boot.

an? as in singular? as in not enough servers for launch?

Facts.
---
It depends on the player. Some people do quests based off of whether or not they would do them IRL, but lemme tell ya what, IRL me wouldn't go kill 10 bears for 2 silver. (No way in hell!) I'd say most people kind of pretend their character is 'them' but it's not that way for RPers.
---
RPers tend to interact with the world in a way the 'average' player doesn't. Oftentimes their character has a name, an identity, a role, one that fits within the game lore (or at least doesn't contradict it). That character is separate from themselves entirely. Most RPers don't write in the first person (I do this, I say that), but in third person (for example: Essie turned the book over in her hand. "What good is this? The pages, they're blank!") The character takes on a shape, an identity really, that the RPer then plays that character as/directs them with.
---
I had a retired battle-priest draenei who had a young son, a pearl-diving rogue who invested in various ventures and inherited a small fortune, a night elf mage who believed fire could be purifying (BfA was weird for that one), an archmage who took on a young draenei apprentice who was gifted in the arcane, a front-lines soldier/emergency healer (think: shockadin) who retired to teach new baby pallies, a gnome adventurer who lost a pet while in the wildnerness due to the lack of food and only has mechanical pets now (because they can't starve). The list is endless; I have tons of RP alts!
---
I personally don't really RP them in-game (I find it tedious and time-consuming), but while I play them I like to imagine how they'd react to certain quests, or quest items, or magic, or situations. I could write novels about my characters roaming about in the world meeting new people, or even just taking care of their family/doing their everyday things.
---
I do think you're right in that the game is technically by default encouraging roleplaying (RPG, after all!), but most people keep their 'roleplaying' to casual 'I wish I was as cool as my character' and 'I wouldn't actually do this type of quest IRL even if I was capable' or 'I'd kill this questgiver, actually, for giving me such a dumbass quest.' 
---
Meanwhile, the RPers see their characters as...storybook characters whose actions/abilities they can control. (And then they can take those characters they control and interact with other player-controlled characters. It's like writing a book, kinda, but you get the surprise of not always being able to predict what the person you're interacting with will do/how they'll react because they're not your character and you don't know them the way their creator does.)
---
Of course, this assumes good rpers/writers and not trash-tier nonsense. Some RPers take the storybook character elements and get to writing with strangers just to see what happens! Sometimes their character meets a new friend, or an enemy, or they just say hi and part ways. RPers like me just think a lot about the characters and write backstory for them and stuff, but don't really want to dedicate hours to typing/writing in the in-game chat. 
---
I hope this clears some stuff up for you! If not, you could always roll an alt on Moon Guard or Wyrmrest Accord-US and get the TotalRP3 addon. Then hover over names in capital cities until you find people's bios to read, and go to town seeing the concepts people come up with!
---

Thank you so much for this response, honestly as long as I can have the set I’ll be happy and I wasn’t stuck on having it equipped all the time. I completely forgot on the number of tanks required for the horsemen. Thanks again
---
The problem is with confining too many players to too few realms is that it will make it hard to remove layering after phase 1 to avoid queues.
---
I'd wager that the number of re-subs and downloads of WoW classic at the start of this month made them pause and go "Yeah... maybe we could use another server."
---
Gonna get staff of westfall so hard.
---
First off, all 4 healing classes’ pvp specs are viable and close to the best spec for pve too, save for druid where hotw is okayy for healing raid. Also, up through phase 4, you clear mc ony and bwl easily in one raid night, and many guilds design their raid days as the day just before and after reset day, giving a 13 day period to go pvp spec if you really want to pvp. Again this doesnt really affect healers nearly as much as warriors, rogues, mages and locks because they dont really need to respec to begin with.
---
Yeah, which reckons out to about 500 players for each starting zone. Those players will get dispersed fairly quickly (within a couple of hours) so that the competition becomes much less fierce than what it is on private servers, which these days typically have 2-3 times the players.
---
Sure, it'll be crowded, but it won't be [this](https://i.imgur.com/sYwTIzK.jpg).
---
Onyxia kill more dots.

This server is going to be PACKED
---
He's the Rich Piana of orcs.
---
The fact that they decided to even put one in is a good sign for initial realm numbers.
---
Same exact rules. If it has a PvP solution, it's not griefing unless you keep it up for days on end. Names should be RP friendly, so nothing like xxsephirothxx or whatever.
---
again, I responded to you on another comment, you know these numbers on gdp, population, and average household income are available to look up?
---
Those who don't live by the hammer can still die by the hammer. Lord Uther (bpuh) didn't make those orcs brutally sacrifice humans and raze a village to appease demon gods who betrayed them years ago.
---
I'd give them a little intro on a private server
---
I'd rather start with one and fill it up to capacity to make sure we have an amazing and vibrant community.
---
No I'm not. With laying you will never "Phase out" like you do with sharding, layering will slowly combine layers (Which are world-wide), until eventually the entire world is one single layer. They will never remove players from a layer which is the big difference between layering and sharding since you get shuffled around from shard to shard frequently.

This is not a fun way to play and puts classes with no instant attack at a severe disadvantage. The starting areas will be packed but they won't be so packed that you won't be able to quest.
---
Death, taxes, and people not knowing how to convert fucking timezones.
---
Don’t get why people hate gnomes.. is there a reason lore wise or is it just plain racism?
---
Since it's a PvP server, you can't roll both factions on it right? I'd like to roll both horde and alliance characters on RP-PvP but if there's only one realm and you can't roll both factions I won't be able to do that. Not sure what to do about that.
---
I've never been big into RP but have played on one RP server or another (Wyrmrest Accord, now Earthen Ring) on live since Wrath. Thought process being that there would just generally be less assholes on the RP servers. Can't say it's untrue.
---
Honestly thinking of doing this now for Classic. Can't see a streamer picking the RP server.
---
Not around here.  Only things in that price range are still rocking ddr3
---
Bolvar is the faction leader. He's regeant lord which means he fulfills the role of the king until either varian returns or anduin reaches ruling age.
---
It's hard because too few servers and you might end up with a population problem, too many and you defeat the point of layering since there might be deal realms.
---
There is no easy fix. We gotta hope Blizzard is ready and adaptabile.
---
Glad to see this shit quarantined on its own server.
---
Imagine being NA and actually having any dev (in any game) care about you
---
Open realms, offer free transfers put extremely large queues in and people will transfer off.
---
This looks interesting, curious how that 10% str and one arms spec could change it up
---
If you dont want to heal and want to have an easy time in pve, mage is a great choice.
---
Okej good thx! Maybe skip ruining RP events, since that seems to be frowned upon.
---
how many roleplaying pvpers do you think there are?
---
Each layer holds however many people blizzard wants, they announced specific layer thresholds that I'm aware of (And I assume those thresholds would be dynamic anyways). If they have I'd love to read the source you got that information from.
---
48 posts after 40 minutes
---
really shows how little people actually care
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Yes
---
Depends what kind of gamer your friend is or if he/she is a gamer at all. Does your friend play fast paced games such as shooters then show a pvp video. Does your friend like lore and rp, then show some cinematics and exploration videos etc etc. you get the idea.  
---
Back in the day it was shit like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sug4QLrwk-Y) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyaDs_2L4fs) that got me interested in the game, but then again I was like 12 or 13 years old at the time.
---
&gt; You be lucky to get one mob every 30 minutes
---
Laughs in FedEx.
---
Lmao I love how you just say wrong and don't elaborate why you think it's wrong.
---
I’ll copy paste it when I get home and I’m not on mobile!
---
I can't wait for the stresstest!
---
The Warcraft III Reign of Chaos intro cinematic.
---
Like the knife in your back.
---
You can get to 5 in 45 minutes with 0 kills, and competing for 0 quests.
---
As someone who has never played a vanilla server. Wouldn't it be smarter at the start to get a group a wander just outside of say northshire and grind mobs with your band five level ones then sit there and try to do quests
---
I think my shaman just found its home, mon.
---
17ish hours from now.
---
If there aren’t enough realms they’ll just make more. In fact I think they will undershoot and need to make more. We’ll see!
---
always glad with uther makes it
---
Drunk dwarf attracted to night elves here I come
---
So which professions aside from skinning?
---
&gt; Bro the line for rumbleshot ammo starts back there. Get to the back or you're "blacklisted".
---
Rumbleshot's crate (and all other unique quest clickables) have like 5 second respawns.
---
A busy server is better than a ghost town.
---
Druids have mana, dont really depend on it too much though. They heal or tank at end game and in dungeons. Warriors are the best tanks, they rely on built up rage to use abilities. The non dps classes left after warrior all use mana. I recommend druid, it solos great, farms well, pvps well, isn't commonly played so always welcome, etc.
---
But actually, why the fuck all the gnome hate? Do these people just hate midgets irl? It's unreasonable.
---
I'm okay with this. I want a thriving RP-PvP server and I'm okay with waiting in a Queue for it.
---
I dunno, Uther. I just checked my D&amp;D manual and it said there’s an entire Oath of Vengeance.
---
The way to do this is to bring in a minimum bar to begin raiding. FFXIV does this with item level and hard locks behind quests. Want to raid? Be this geared and clear this content. Its not hard (hell the attunment is literally a one day grind) but it stops people that want to pit in zero effort. Exclusivity isnt bad for the game. Some people just arent good enough to raid, and instead of bringing things down, they should be the ones to step up.
---
Damn, this was me too. Right in the feels.
---
Well you say that now, but bring your rain coat for when all the streamers decide to roll there.
---
After all look how well the GTA V RP thing went.
---
Or at least give us a few days of stress testing rather than just 24 hours. I would totally sub if the stress test lasted until August 12 which is when the name reservation begins, but I'm not doing it just for a single day of testing in the middle of the week when I'm busy.
---
you also have to consider blood fury if you're comparing orc vs undead. +25% ap from agi and str (base ap) on a 2 min cooldown that can be used in stealth is hella useful vs any class. everyone focuses on hardiness but blood fury is just as useful as a rogue. and if you stack blood fury with damage trinkets you have the ability to hit higher ambushes, evisc, etc. than any other rogue race. undead on the other hand for the second racial get an extra bandage on a longer cd that needs a corpse to work.
---
THANK FUCKING GOD
---
They say if you cut an appendage off, it'll grow BIGGA
---
I don't understand what you mean.  There is 1 world boss on a server, it can't be layered, everyone needs to be able to see it and fight over it.
---
They had this quote as part of an announcement in may:
---
"*Imagine a tray with an empty glass. The tray is a single server in WoW Classic. The empty glass is a layer. When you log into the game on launch day, you’ll be with a flood other players: the water that we’re going to pour into the glass. Once the glass is full, we add another empty glass and start filling it up with water, or players, too. Each new glass is a new layer that consists of two to three thousand players — which means any single server could handle tens of thousands of players at the same time but without all of them being crowded into the same place in-game. The only way to see players from another layer is to group up with them —otherwise they don’t interact.*"

Having to save rage to punch through the VW bubble, jukes, nades, 10s cooldown interrupt being on the GCD makes pummeling every fear a pipe dream. With nades of your own and berserker rage it's easy enough to avoid them for a while, but you'll need quite some lucky crits to down him in that limited timeframe.  
---
I can't recommend ever thinking about warrior in terms of how it will perform in 1v1 pvp situations. Think about group fighting, because you're *very* good at that, and very bad 1v1. In group fights you will absolutely get caught by fears outside berserker stance, but stun resist is still way better, and tauren reach too.
---
Less weirdos for the other servers. These are good news.
---
&gt; people who will level fishing day 1
---
Wait. Why would you not?
---
All my character names are the names of death metal bands.
---
Glad to see your ignorant ass won't be on it.
---
It's fine solo, it's fine in 5man, you'll take max 1 for raids unless your group needs bodies.  Out of all the hybrids, its probably the least worst one though.
---
This is correct.
---
I'd rather grind to lvl 60 as a naked warrior than quest through the barrens again.
---
Don't believe it!
---
Oh hey, that was quick
---
Sounds like it'll be a party.
---
8 servers for whats probably hundreds of thousands of players. i shudder at the amount of lag these will have even with sharding in the first month...
---
He's a bit biased though, he'll never say SP is bad at anything.
---
When you played on both high and very low population servers back in the day, you don't really see any population numbers as a problem
---
Got a Meme with dozens of upvotes taken down for being "Low Effort" yet here's this post.......
---
Ahhh fuck it were too close to launch to hold grudges!!! I'm excited too!!!
---
There is at least one pserver that has x15 xp that you can switch on and off as you like. Just sayin
---
Calling it now, 10 servers total, 5 PvP, 1 RP-PvP, 3 PvE, 1 RP.
---
which is fucking awesome!
---
Did you even play the stress tests?  Such blatantly incorrect information, why would you even bother posting if you have zero clue what you're talking about?
---
You could level to 15, and there was no fun/wonky stuff (Rag spawns, etc) in the starting zones.  It was up for people to test their layering system(s).
---
Everyone always talks about how they like the rain weather effect in vanilla. For me it was always the snow. Put on some headphones and you can hear that cold, crisp wind whistling past you. Almost gives you half a shiver, as you snuggle down deeper into your comfy computer chair, and take another sip of warm tea.
---
Death by snusnu!
---
This is not a problem anymore.
---
Blizz anounced a single RP-PVP server.
---
Just assume all streamers will roll there, for the drama, to ride the GTA V RP streamer success, or the lulz, whatever, they will all roll there.
---
On chrome (desktop) and the guide seemingly stops at 18/18 in the barrens and doesn't go forward?
---
&lt;Stolen Iron Chest&gt;
---
10Hand InForged SteelThun'grim Firegaze is the last quest
---
I dont mind paying...hell ill buy gold n shit..but why pay when its free? Theres hundreds of guides out there...like why  pay for porn or tv series when you can watch it free
---
for the spelladin what professions do i level for?
---
If you replaced “streamers” with...
---
Yeah it’s extremly unforgiving early on. I actually think alliance is even harder, since so many enemies are humanoids in close proximity to eachother. 
---
It gets easier though as soon as you have a big health pool and some abilities to do proper damage.
---
He hates sand.
---
As in one of the servers they initially weren't even going to have. That seems about right to me
---
This X 1000.  
---
I won't play on a RP realm, but there were clearly a lot of voices who stated they would like to.  Again, Blizzard listened and met the fan demand. 
---
Remember, there's a number of things they've done the same thing for in this Classic journey we've all been on.  While we have problems on things they've done to the retail game, anger over Activision being greedy corporate shills, and the infamous "you think you do, but you don't" line, they have met fan demands multiple times and changed course where we provided feedback.  That needs to be applauded, regardless of the other issues.  
---
Lets try and be happy for what we're getting, which is a product awfully close to the 2004 launch.  This day-one vet is happy and excited to play.
---
Honestly if you could tell me the lowest pop pvp server, I want to roll there. I played on Nost when it was slammed and that was incredible, I just want a change of pace. Even the low pop servers won’t be dead.
---
I mean it was patched a couple days ago so you may have just downloaded that. Guess you already had it installed
---
Serenity now funeral raid
---
I'm glad you can read the wiki, youre still wrong
---
2/2. Do I get a prize?
---
When you say eventually everyone will log-out.  You are not taking into account the people who are going to account share and try to clear MC week 1.
---
Which is significantly smaller than any major private server launch. That's the point.
---
I had faith. Is that ironic for a Warlock main?
---
&gt; Just as before, I will post the raw data results after a couple weeks
---
Same!! I was so dead set on not rolling on PVP but this is a game-changer... It could be a lot of fun! Maybe I'll decide if I want to play based on the realm's name. If it's awesome: join it. If it's awful: go RP. This is exciting!
---
They wouldn’t give 24 hours to get to 15
---
Are we still on the anti-streamer bandwagon ?
---
The current cutoff point was set in the wrong place. It is supposed to go all the way to 15 to mirror the levels available for tomorrow's Stress Test. We're working to fix that along with a host of other issues prior to the Stress Test tomorrow.
---
I thought I just read on one of the latest blue posts that you can't roll both factions on any PVP server, like it was at the original launch.
---
Retribution Paladins are wow classic's best kept secret. If you're thinking about going DPS, go retri paladin.   
---
Arthas beat Illidian 1v1 after respeccing to retribution. So can you.
---
yes, in Battle-net launcher, select World of Warcraft, then above Play/Install button, click &lt;Select Game Version&gt;
---
I bet they got quite a few hundred resubs and maybe more just from this announcement today
---
Having an RP-PVP server is a big win even for those with no intention of playing on the server
---
At pserver launches when it's insanely crowded, I would just run off and get exploration exp + gather flight points. Like, starting from the dwarf starter area, I would just run my way all the way up to Menethil and grab the Loch Modan + Menethil Harbor flightpoints, maybe even corpserun my way all the way up into Arathi and grab that flight point too, then hearth back to the starter area. From there, I'd go to Ironforge and tram my way over to Stormwind, and from there, gather the Lakeshire + Westfall + Duskwood flight points.
---
Would usually be level 3 just from the exploration exp.
---
Same way how Alliance players secretly like Taurens.
---
Do you plan on updating this to 60 aswell?
---
- right click an enemy unit with the wc3 paladin 
---
- “strike with great vengeance!” (Literally Uther)
---
- mfw
---
What about that thing next to you ? *points at a literal decomposing zombie*
---
Pve boiiiis
---
I'd be wary of loot council too, go with some form of dkp (I remember zero sum dkp being fair).
---
The last thing you want is to be raiding for months to get one specific item, only for the guild leaders cousin to join the guild and get it their first run because "they need it more"
---
eye no rite?
---
nice i get to experiment with my level 1-15 quest running
---
Hunter.
---
Brother man, that one initial server will be packed to capacity.
---
Names of deleted characters above a certain level are restricted from use for 30 days, which happens to be how long you can restore your characters. You honestly think Blizzard hasn't made sure you have to pay $10 for a name change?
---
sl locks won't deal much damage until late bwl / aq.  Before that its either squishy sl with decent damage or tanky with low damage.
---
What’s worse is you think you’re about to win and the mob executes you for 22% of your hp.
---
Sorry to the bearer of great news, but rp-pvp servers are now confirmed :)
---
Yea running from like elwyn to wetlands n shit
---
The &lt; Knights of the Silver Hand &gt; guild wouldn't let any of it's Paladins spec anything other than Holy.
---
It's base AP. I think it's 50ap fixed at lvl 60, no matter the gear. Otherwise it would be incredible. Blood fury is situational, it's better in duels but cannibalize is better in world pvp.
---
RP team: "What are these? A twisted Alliance from a twisted plane? Fight them, boys. Finish them. Keep their chaos from these mountains lest they infect the others."
---
Non-RP team: "Lollllll."
---
RP team: "Is that gnome nude? Put an axe in him."
---
...I'm cool with it.
---
or skip all that and just go straight from Gnomer to Menethil in like... 4 mintues.
---
Cant they choose na servers?
---
It’s because characters have higher starting spirit than on pserver.
---
We didn't deserve Uther.

&amp;#x200B;
---
an actual queue that formed
---
You say that  like they haven't listened to just about everything we wanted
---
Lol. I’m probably going to do a test run of 2 Warriors 1-12 with a new leveling guide just to get ready.
---
Retail was all about the "ZappyBoi" male troll shaman from recent cinematics.
---
I'm the exact opposite. A Human Female Paladin.
---
So ZappyBoi cause why the fuck not?
---
I meant it more as a joke but it obviously wasn’t received as such. I would rather RPers have their own server than carve out a niche in a normal server or overtake a normal server as an unofficial world.
---
I'm gonna go for the alternate facts and call you FAKE NEWS.     
---
    
---
(but you are right)
---
atlas loot, and possibly boss fighter mods for raiding if necessary i guess. Proper macroing honestly makes most other stuff obsolete, if threat is really a problem then i'll get that to
---
You want them to do a stress test the day before launch? This isn’t a marketing ploy. They need time to test and then address any issues before launch. Players can and should absolutely refuse to take part if they don’t agree with it. My issue is that people expect to be able to take part for free, why? 
---
Also do you know what a stress test is for? They don’t care about gauging interest. They’re going to pack everyone into one realm and see how a single server reacts. There is more than enough people with a subscription and interest in classic to do this. If they know how a single realm handles a high population, it’s easy to determine how 8 realms with respond.
---
For many of us, this shot, right here, is where it all began.
---
No lazy pig? Lazy pig is like a bunch of these rolled into one. Does easy dismount auto sell and like all kinds of wonderful functions!
---
Understood.
---
So what I learnt from this is that there will be 99 other suckers and I’ll be the 1 guy that gets to that treasure chest first.
---
Gotcha!
---
Which race are you considering?
---
1 server- I hope total number of servers is under 15 :)
---
Amazing news. Can someone please explain what it’s like to play on an RP pvp server? I’ve only played on regular pvp. How is it different? Are most people actually role playing all the time ?
---
There were dwarf mages in vanilla for a while but they removed it before release sadly, cause of balancing issues, don't want them hordies to cry to have viewer choices than the might of the Alliance
---
This sounds great. I'll have a moca on my desk instead.
---
Just increases the rp factor lol
---
Not sure i understood what you said there, like at lvl 1, all5 go and skip first zone and kill lvl 4 or 5 mobs? Or get 5 peeps with wands and grind?
---
If you're playing horde you're not exactly a relaible source for opinions on what races look good lmao
---
by way of other places. but correct.
---
It’s going to be G L O R I O U S
---
I'm in your boat with a wife and kid, I'm rolling a priest so I don't have to search for a healer. Also cuz I dug rolling a white mage in ffxi .. My other 2 reserved names will be for warlock and druid.
---
I like casters, no lifed a mage in vanilla

Toss up between Dwarf, Undead, or Night Elf. 
---
Heavier on Dwarf right now though honestly.
---
They were definitely supposed to be, but unless you consider doing 3 quests then grinding mobs leveling in a zone, they don't really fulfill that requirement. Kalimdor was really a forgotten continent.
---
Arthas kills him
---
Yeah, but I don't think most of us believed they would listen to us at the start of classics inception.  It's been super surreal having them take actual feedback for the slightest things.  I love it.
---
Paladins are very hard to kill and every 3 minutes you become invincible. It's for sure a cake class. 
---
...can't really kill anything tho..
---
Best profession is mailbox stripper.
---
Seems really great. Only thing I would add are smaller map icons and arrows/lines (something?) between each quest marker so you can "follow the line" so to speak.
---
Still debating myself  whether I should be rolling a dwarf priest of an undead warlock. 
---
How mind numbing is an spriest damage rotation? 
---
Plus I've never played Alliance so im afraid it wont click for me.
---
First off, armor is different on classic than pserver, mellee classes will be easier to level in this aspect. Second, get her lore/alchemy if you want to be comfy leveling. Always having pots is huge as a leveling warrior. Also, keep FA leveled.
---
wait so how the fuck theyre gonna fit all the players into 8 servers? like cmon, they really think like there will be 50k people at launch?
---
At least 3 classes in the tier 0 dungeon set. ( I know not BiS but it's my goal since I can't raid.)
---
&gt; best way to level cooking
---
I disagree with this if you are a Horde player playing troll/orc.
---
Scorpid Stingers &gt;&gt; Scorpid Surprise
---
Strider Meat &gt;&gt; Strider Stew
---
Thunder Lizard Tails &gt;&gt; whatever the recipe is
---
All of these are common white trash you pick up while leveling 1-20 as Horde in Durotar &amp; Barrens. Why go out of your way to level cooking when all you have to do is save the mats?
---
Shadowmeld and wisp spirit are the best racials in the game.
---
I am from ED!
---
Until you fall off the bridge and die... seriously, Thunderbluff is underrated but it is not on IF's level.
---
Yea I don't think they realize 2-3k is just how many were online. A large server still had 15-20k people.
---
If we have 15k people online that means its 3-4 times that on the server. Some are just at work, school, or asleep. Mega servers will not approximate the vanilla economy.
---
What if big brain blizzard knew the community would react the way it did about no rppvp but were always going to release it but just wanted to change people's opinions on 'we listen'...
---
A less successful 20 year old game did it? blizzard should listen immediately!
---
Getting another account is your only option
---
It mainly depends on the coming stress test. 
---
If the test goes well, maybe there will be more servers imo.
---
Druids are my favorite aesthetic. Mage is my favorite gameplay. Rolling both. Takes some real rocket science, I know.
---
Mechanical fun.  
---
I love the aesthetics of Ret Paladin but it was fucking GARBAGE to play from Cata and onwards.
---
I got my best friend hooked into the game on the strength of that scene.
---
Clan Battlehammer will be there!
---
I'm playing minecraft to pass the time too. Just killed the dragon on hardcore so that's pretty neat.
---
Shaman tank /s
---
I still want a movie based around the cut scene creators.
---
Literally just a screenshot of the vanilla trailer.
---
Quality post.
---
Spoken like a true horde player
---
You took the words out of my mouth. If I could live in the Westfall, Duskwood, Redridge area forever, I would too!
---
Not like you
---
That would be a good change for classic. On pservers there was a wait.
---
Lets slaughter the ERP nerds bruh
---
You're quoting old testament Uther, the picture above is new testament Uther.
---
That was already known
---
With first aid and food it isn't that bad. Private servers also have some things wrong. Anyway, I chain pulled on the stress test up to 15  with very few deaths discounting the strategic deaths to get where I was going faster.
---
+1 rolled a dwarf hunter as my main because of this cinematic, dwarf beards ftw
---
Exclusivity and community. =)
---
Shaman water walking and water breathing are really underrated aspects of the class. I remember I used to sell savory deviate delights to pay for my lv 40 mount and I sold to one guy and we went and played around in the stormwind canals as water walking pirate ninjas. It was a lot of fun. This was in TBC because I was a Draenei Shaman.
---
Jokes on you I have three weeks off lol
---
Well if Thex is going, I'm definitely going
---
Just one warlock would help so much.
---
*Moist raven polishes his Big Gun* 
---
Damn, how did that one RP meme go with that dwarf hunter stalking the two NE's ERPing in the deeprun tram lol.
---
I know it’s silly because it’s not “classic” but all I want in the world in a mmorpg with modern day graphics as good as Classic WoW. Honestly if they were redoing the game for modern systems I’d play for another 5 years like I did originally.
---
Played human priest in classic, the levelling was quite mind numbing to be fair however I had an absolute blast in PVP. 
---
The skillcap is quite low and I was beating most people in duels without even wearing armor just for the laughs.
---
Please stop, I can only get so erect.
---
The flight path is less effort. You can just afk / tab out in flight and then autorun a straight path over to the Duskwood border, whereas walking along the path requires constant attention.
---
Or possibly it's that they were taking some time to gauge interest instead of some nefarious plot to incite outrage and then milk adoration. . . but you know, that may be too simple.
---
Can't you show her some good female Undeads?
---
No kidding, I honestly believe that this is a pretty race (with dope casting animations).

Maybe as prot warrior. But once you have ok gear as a dps warrior you're fine solo grinding with ease.
---
Yeah that's why it's weird, i didn't have them equip, i'd just bank all starting gear on any toon i'd created. I was like 8 or something who knows why.
---
You won't see it on a non-RP server.
---
Yes, but people were getting worried, since they said "Later in the week" and it's later in the week ;-)
---
Guaranteed this is where all the streamers will roll for extra griefing protection.
---
Attack Table system didn't change much in the life of WoW afaik. Also this info is pretty easy to verify so overall you can trust this one. You're right though, some articles on this website aren't Vanilla accurate since it was updated for WotLK for.. reasons.
---
She likes ud but always played them on horde.  Shes very burned out on barrens / silverpine and hates stonetalon.. She isnt good at pvp and hates the run :p
---
Na, I feel like we can have faith in the darker things at the least.
---
Why roll the worst healer/dps/tank in the game? Roll a real class.
---
&amp;#x200B; Cenarion is all mine!

That totally worked. Jeez, I feel dumb. Thanks for the assist!
---
There are just as many assholes on WrA, you just dont encounter them unless you RP. Luckily
---
Hell yeah! That game had it all. The fun was just off the charts! I wish more games just embraced the push/pull stuff more.
---
Leeroy
---
It's when all the poopsock nolifers have to set up their addons, because spending ten minutes doing that on launch day will totally ruin their shot at being world first to 60 and make the game not even worth playing.
---
This whole thread is filled with people talking about whether or not it is against the agreement.
---
I hope there isn't 10k online on a single server; it's honestly just way too much. Vanilla was not designed for that many players and zones just become overcrowded.
---
I think 5k or 6k is a decent number so that it's nice and populated, but not crowded.
---
Luna Unitframes is out for classic, they're practically the same
---
Interesting. Haven’t been on WrA since Mists but did see today on the realm list that it’s a Full server, which surprised me. It was solid in Wrath.
---
I prefer horde but love dwarfs and wouldn't mind so I let her pivk
---
Has anyone played on both RP and RP-PVP servers? Any anecdotes on differences in playerbase? Besides PVPers being more bloodthirsty of course.
---
I remember you!
---
wowwww
---
It's amazing to see how things come back together. You planning on raiding progression style like we did or are you going for the more hardcore approach?
---
Fuck yeah!
---
Agreed
---
It's smart to either grind higher level mobs as a 5man to get ahead or just do explo/fedex routes and then dive into dungeons.
---
Arthas was a DK by that point. Get rekt, refill, gg, no re
---
Yeah still trying to pick a faction too. Thinking druid, or shaman, or paladin, or maybe something more conventional than a hybrid. Yeah... I have no Idea.
---
How much is it based on wanding stuff to death?
---
if blizzard wanted a feel for "pre-launch" issues they would stop being dumb as fuck and do these on a weekend, not in the middle of a damned work day. HELLO??
---
I like how bright classics logo is
---
I definitely agree with this list but I would maybe put Shaman above Hunter at least while leveling. Both ele and enhancement leveling specs rely on having a decent weapon.
---
Pretty sure we keep saying the classic team are on point. It’s the retail team that keeps getting flak.
---
Well reddit.....we did it. Praise Thex.
---
You've got me there
---
Night Elf Paladins, you think the Warrior is alone, then out of nowhere a healbot in stealth
---
Absolutely no one wants to see an UD rogue named backstab.
---
The biggest rule is that your name needs to be appropriate. You can't be Noobslayerz for example.
---
&gt; Whats priest like in pvp   (Healer spec) 
---
World pvp - you better have a buddy with you.
---
solo q BG - You are a main target, and your random group will absolutely not help you. It can really suck especially if you are keeping others alive and they could care less about you. Benediction on your back? Oh boy, it's like a huge glowing target on your back.
---
Premade BG - Now your talkin.
---
If you play a druid you can always cast wrath and pretend to be a mage inbetween pretending to be a rogue.
---
It doesn't help that [this dress](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13346/robes-of-the-exalted#comments) is the best healing chestpiece by a mile and it is the dressiest of dresses in the game.
---
Guilds will definitely take paladins to raids just for the blessings and auras. Even going prot. wouldn't be so horrible as people make it out to be.
---
Never actually went to a RP server before. Is it too hard/strict? Does it require a lot of lore knowledge to understand the way each race talks?
---
Good point. I mostly just want it to chill in and have some cool horns sometimes though, y'know?
---
One server is effectively multiplied by how many layers they have.
---
What should I play if I wanna kill Rogues in World PvP?
---
If you're planning to play nonstop the first week I have a power leveling group looking for a priest to join.
---
&gt;I'd be an asshole if I played battlefield and started whining on the forums for them to add MMORPG elements to the game.
---
No you wouldn't dude. Thats how new genres develop and interest grows nad experiments lead to new ideas. IF Battlefield decides to follow that advice and it proves succesful then it's a good thing.
---
Like it or not retail wow is still alive only because it broke away from it's classic core. Look at the playing field, nothing has stuck around with such success.
---
If a genre doesn't adapt and evolve then it rots and dies. Gaming is a free hobby, these people need to find success.
---
No that can't be how it works and would cause any guilds who care about world boss competition to throw a fit, completely non vanilla like.  There can only be 1 per server, it can't be layered.
---
Good shit Melderon! See you in Azeroth!
---
Future mmos lol
---
Oh? I will see if I can find one on Amazon. Thanks!
---
people are expecting 3 days played to 60 with aoe dungeon farming. So by the end of day 4 there will be entire 40 man raids that are level 60 and starting. So prob ony and 5 or so MC bosses will be dead by end of day 7

I have a real PC, but I work for a living and am often staying in hotels on the road! Unfortunately that'll be the case the day Classic drops, so I am looking to run it on my MacbooK!
---
Its weird, when I played classic (when it was retail) I literally lived in IF, almost NEVER went to SW.
---
On all the private servers I've been Ally on, I've always hung around SW. I think that's probably because I was always hoping to get the Ony buff.
---
I still love the design of IF though. That's what does it for me.
---
So I posted in a discussion earlier, however, I am still undecided so I figured I would bring the topic back up again. I am for sure going to heal. Originally when classic was announced I said I was going to be a priest since that is what I have played since Cata. However, paladins seem like an extremely versatile and desired class. Their heals seem to be amazing and I love the tankiness they possess (since I will be playing on a PvP server). On the other side Resto Druid seems to be pretty cool. I have never played a druid in retail, however, they seem to be fairly decent healers with nice utility. 
---
So here are the questions I have:
---
1. In a raid environment how much harder is a holy paladin to gear vs a holy priest. Are they equal in terms of HPS or do they both compliment each other nicely?
---
2. Since I am playing on a PvP server if I roll paladin is Dwarf better or is human just fine?
---
3. Comparing all three healing classes Priest, Paladin, Resto Druid. Do they all get into raids just fine? Does one class struggle more than another (e.g: Druid's not having rez, priests having mana issues, or paladins having only 2 heals)? 
---
4. Finally my RL buddy and I will be leveling together. Which of the three healers would compliment a warlock while questing?
---
Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks in advance.
---
Sounds miserable tbh
---
Layering vs Sharding has been explained a thousand times and people still don’t get it. Not surprising since people ask every day when launch is.
---
Do you know how stupid you sound saying that taking part in a test for a for-profit company is a perk? This is why game companies have us by the balls and don't give a shit about customer service.
---
And still preform worse than classes who don’t bring consumes.
---
“Future MMO’s” 
---
FOOL!! There is no future, there is only Classic.
---
There are 50 character slots for a reason!
---
The gray hairs (well, what's left I mean)  mean I've learned a thing or two ;)
---
cheers!
---
The issue at the start is: you either start with low realms and have huge queues pushing people away, or too many realms and dead servers forcing you to merge. Layering is supposed to be a middle ground allowing “merges” without the need for transfers. 
---
Blizzard is probably underestimating playerbase or overestimating drop off. I’d rather see them do something than have the same problem they had before Dire Maul launched in vanilla. Which resulted in transfers that most people on the existing (low pop) realms didn’t like.
---
Think of it like cooperative improvised storytelling where each person plays the part of their own character. If you ever played pretend with your friends as a kid, that's basic RP in a nutshell, just using WoW characters instead.
---
Think of a character you could imagine existing in WoW's universe. Give them a backstory, goals, ideals, etc. Now go out into the world and use /say to actually say what your character would say to other people. Use /emote (/e, /me etc) to type out actions that your character does, then go out and start interacting with people.
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753396008 I found this guide after a quick google search if you're looking for a beginner's guide.
---
On RP-PvP servers, I find players tend to be "out in the world" more, claim certain areas under their guild's banner and generally stir up more cross faction conflict. They scout areas, get into PvP skirmishes and sometimes huge battles, and then RP inbetween. It's a really refreshing take on playing WoW in general.
---
Listen to this man
---
I see you have your mages very well trained on those RP servers!
---
It feels good to have done it, I felt very civilized lol
---
I don’t doubt people’s ability to get to 60. People have figured out the secret long ago. I just don’t trust that the servers will hold. Launch days are always rough.
---
Hardware Store
---
My gf and I used [this](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/). It has categories specifically for WoW races if you want something more lore friendly.
---
You're better off trying to optimise against your worse matchups than further maximizing your odds against already favourable matchups.
---
It is? You’re paying a subscription to play the FULL retail version of wow. If you’d like you can also take part in the perks including a stress test and early naming for classic wow, a not yet released product. I don’t buy into your edgy attitude that Blizzard is thinking up ways to milk their customers. If you don’t like then don’t participate. No one cares either way because the stress test has zero effect on the released version.
---
Sure! I just don't have access to it right now. I can list all the different WAs I use if you want to.
---
I don't know.  There was just something about fighting a gnome that's irritating when I could just have my pet eat them in one bite or literally punt them from one end of warsong gulch to the other.
---
Yeah I think it should be fine just as a fill in to make numbers.
---
&gt;No one is pointing a gun to your head, forcing you to participate
---
Yes, because that's an extremely logical argument to counter someone pointing out that this is in fact not a stress test, and it's more just a way to generate a quick bit of marketing &amp; money off of Classic hype.
---
I mean, the only reason you're likely defending it is because you personally are dumb enough to spend $10 or however much it costs to "stress test" Classic.
---
And to add, in no way shape or form is this a "stress test", because they are going to have *nowhere near* the number of players required to properly and accurately stress test the servers because not nearly everyone is as idiotic as you.
---
But if Orcs could be mages, Horde would still dominate PvP...
---
Joe Rogan, The Art of Manliness, Dan Carlins Hardcore History, Making Sense with Sam Harris, Tim Ferriss, Live to Win
---
Any no life alliance priest pst.
---
Eh, that would probably invite a lot of people to try the game who wouldn't have been buying it otherwise and generate some new customers for Blizzard. But yeah, probably the fact that someone is getting a tiny bit of free content on some probably laggy servers for half a day is worse, sure.
---
Stuck between my druids original name or using the name of a friend that killed himself. Hand down owe every single friend I ever knew through most of my wow career to him. A few I'm still good friends with IRL after they quit wow and I moved servers.
---
No
---
for the paladin its easiest to cast bok on everyone
---
"May the gods show mercy upon thy, because we don't"
---
Wasn't there some confirmation by Blizzard that early zones will have more layering done so that it's playable? I think I red it somewhere.
---
Pat High warlord
---
Thanks!
---
You copy pasted this but mine says 6pm.  Any thoughts?
---
Second wind is actually better than mindtap talisman, unless the fight drags on for quite a long time.  
---
Second Wind:
---
Use: Restores 30 mana every 1 sec for 10 sec. (15 Min Cooldown)
---
Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 22.
---
300 mana / x second = 11 mana / 5 seconds
---
x = 136.4.   Second Wind's mana regeneration is equal to Mind Tap Talisman, if the fight doesn't exceed 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  Second wind also has +22 healing though.  
---
&gt; enamoured water totem trinket
---
This is a great item, and actually is buffed by restorative totems.  +25% more mana.  I actually tested this back in the day.  That means it generates 405 mana for the entire group.   It takes 3 minutes for mindtap talisman to generate that much mana.
---
I'm pretty sure
---
&gt; LOK'TAR THE HOLY LIGHT
---
would translate to 'victory (to) the holy light'
---
and 
---
&gt;BUBBLE OGAR
---
means 'bubble or death'
---
Perfect.
---
Wait, am I a fool because I pay $15 to play a game I love? People spend $3-4 bucks a day on coffee.
---
It’s literally sad that someone who cares enough to browse this sub can’t spend $15 to play the game. That’s why I asked to donate
---
Yaaaaas I love Blizzard :)
---
&gt; It's specifically a server for people who like to spank both factions.
---
Nyhm's "M.A.G.E." video.
---
all the hype is going to overpopulate the realm
---
I would be mad if I was a broke boi too. I understand. Do you have a patreon I can donate too? Or will you sell me feet pics?
---
NA gets it too. I think everyone is getting one.
---
Not a dad gamer here but when I first played wow, my friends guild was on was an RP server and continued to choose RP servers for years.
---
I 100% noticed a difference between RP and a pvp server - it's going to be interesting to see how long this rp-pvp server is going to stay at high population.
---
It's tempting to roll on, but I might just stick with pve.
---
i guess it's for people who get 60 early and looking for some good int gear before running dungeons, i brushed these items off thinking they were crap but after being 60 for a while as a shaman i'm very much interested in this set when i get 60 in vanilla
---
It's not an opinion, it's a fact.
---
Kings isn't the best until late game when you have a lot more stats.
---
Warlock = kings late game (50+), early game (1-49) = wisdom.
---
Mage = wisdom
---
Priest = wisdom
---
Rogue = might
---
Hunter = wisdom
---
Druid (healing or boomkin) = wisdom
---
Tank (war or druid) = kings
---
melee dps (war or druid) = might (unless offtanking)
---
Paladin (dps) = might/wisdom/kings (in that order, but depends on how their gear is set up)
---
Paladin tank = wisdom, unless he has it, then kings
---
Well Met
---
you go to Goldshire and ERP
---
#GoldshireLife
---
And remember you can get to level 4 or 5 easily just through courier quests and discovery experience. 
---
Just vendor all your gear and inventory and go! You can buy back your weapon from the vendor when you return.
---
No competition.
---
No sweat.
---
Crack open a beer and turn up the tunes!
---
And when you get back and they are still fighting over spawns you'll already have some flightpaths.
---
How do you know that? They can set any amount of layers they want. Just because it's not sharding doesn't mean for first week there can't be 1, 10, 100 or 1000 of layers of certain realm to allow people to play the game.
---
Lmfao you can’t afford to pay $15 to play a game you love. I am very sorry for you
---
Can you explain why world pvp was better? I'm not grokking it from the rest of your post.
---
Druid heals are underrated af, and you get faerie fire, and root, and also has a stun, and can't be poly'd, rooted, or slowed.
---
Rp is for neckbeards.
---
I am fairly confident that Wisdom and Might are the preferred blessings for casters/melee dps respectively. For caster's in particular the bonuses to strength and agility do nothing, and intellect is rather miniscule of a dps gain (I think it adds crit in very small amounts but doesn't give spellpower). Of course, if kills times are quicker and mana isn't at all an issue then Wisdom won't be as useful and Kings will be preferred.
---
Rp was amazing. Hoping it still Will be!
---
&gt;I feel very bad for broke bois who can’t afford $15 a month for a game they love
---
Who are you replying to that said they "love" retail WoW and don't already have a sub? Who exactly is your reply to, or are you just so stupid you had to make up an opposing argument in your head? And just to let you know, to ease the load on your already slow brain, you don't need to answer last question, because the answer is already evident.
---
This kinda seems like it takes a whole lot of thought.
---
Can you even do this if you can play only a few hours a week?
---
Warrior + Engineering isn't bad at all to level, even on pvp servers.
---
Early on expect tons of cheap health pots on the market due to alchy levelers as well.
---
Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it.

WC: Oh no cave snakes are attacking from dreamland with the help of some pink unitard wearing coven of snake magicians
---
DM: Stop a massive underground criminal organization with a bunch of cool and memorable bosses from destroying the kingdom after they were betrayed by said kingdom with even more twists that remain relevant to the main alliance questlines until the endgame.
---
Especially for melee classes early on.
---
Tazdingo, man
---
Ah, spoken like someone who has never leveled a warrior in classic.
---
This. I haven't played any version of Classic yet. Only pserver. I've paid attention to blue posts over the past 9 months and it's so obvious to me that blizzard wants to give us the most authentic product possible. It baffles me how many people nerdraging on this sub about how blizzard doesn't give a fuck about Classic. 
---
Fuck off with your bad vibes.
---
20 DAYS BOYS
---
I played an Alliance priest (dwarf, obviously) whose name was fsck.
---
My trouble is this: 
---
I want to actually RP. Before WoW, and before SWG, I used to do a lot of creative writing and RP. I missed it and have since gotten back into writing, and would like to RP in Classic.
---
I originally played on an RPPvP server. Not a lot of RP happened. Just naked people in the SW-IF tram tunnel, and people 20+ levels higher ganking you and (on the forums) saying ‘lulz, it’s just RP’. 
---
Also, I’m in my late 30’s, too young kids, full career, will be playing casual hours (1-2 hours a night, 3-4x per week.. I’ve seen some interesting definitions of casual on this sub). I don’t really want to put up with random world PvP/ganking. On the other hand, will it be too... quiet on a regular RP server without the possibility of random PvP? Too dull? Just don’t know.
---
So yea, pro’s and con’s both ways.
---
I’m CST, so it auto corrects on the servers to my location.
---
I'm terrible at logic? Dude.
---
At a certain point there is a threshold where it is impossible to quest in a starting area.  Wether that be 100k or 2-3k.
---
There are 6 total starting zones.  Using the low end of your estimate at 2k you are coming out to 334 players  per starting zone. (Hint that's to many to really accomplish anything.) Why do you think everyone is preparing fedex questing? 
---
" It isn't to segregate the community, they have layering in the game for probably a month only in the starting zones and then it goes away. Stop being a whiny bitch please"
---
What happened to the only in the starting zone argument? Are you going to still hold by that now that you have done some research?
---
For hearth and home 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Literally the best news since release date announcement.
---
If I were you I’d just play on the Aussie servers
---
Figured i’d ask you since you know, When is name reservation day?
---
Did you ragequit because a horde named Zfs made you obsolete?
---
I'm gonna level my warrior in a party with 2 friends. One to do damage for me (mage) and one to heal me (shaman). We also tested it out on a pserver and it's super awesome compared to solo leveling a warrior.
---
Probably the best tank healer in the game come Naxxramas though. If you hang on just a moment I have something to show you if you're interested to see their late game power.
---
Dark Lady watch over you.
---
No, I just leveled my prot warrior named Disgruntled
---
Yeah I feel like I need a guide for this now, since I'm probably going to roll here (and convince my friends to do so) to avoid streamers
---
I surely hope not.
---
Good.  Now when my friends all quit after 3 months, I'll have somewhere to reroll.
---
Kings isn't good until late game because of things like how rogues get 1% crit bonus for every 29 points of agility. That's off classic.wowhead. Or Warriors getting 2 melee AP per point of strength. Early on, there just aren't enough stats for kings to make much of a difference.
---
Regardless of whether they layer in only the starting zones or not (i'm pretty sure they said layering will only be for the first 10 or so levels), having 2k people split up between 6 starting zones is WAY better than 100k people. You still haven't told me why having 100k people is a benefit over 2k people other than destroying a server, causing shit tons of lag, and having us never be able to tag a mob.
---
Your argument right now is literally "well 100k is bad and so is 2k, so I want the 100k people so I can be a giant virgin and appreciate how big dis werld is hee hee xd"
---
Get over yourself, you're embarrassing
---
Wowhead says Monday August 12 at 3:00 pm pacific.
---
I do
---
Yea but druid is useful in bg either way.
---
Not at all. It’s completely up to you whether you wish to engage in RP with others or not. You can choose to just play the game as you normally would, or if you want to get involved, you can interact with others by playing as your character and behaving as they would within the world (of Warcraft).
---
Only “hard” rule I’d say there is to playing on a RP realm is making sure your name fits the fantasy setting (i.e. “Moonthistle” would be an acceptable night elven name for example; “Xxlegolasxx” not so much). Also, if you come across others RPing out in the world, don’t troll or grief their RP!
---
\&gt;The obvious solution is to just have more than one character, but looking at this predicament through the lens of "I need one MAIN character", which of these qualities takes priority for you if you have to choose?
---
&gt; 25-30 servers worldwide sounds totally reasonable for a cautious attempt at not spreading people too thin down the road. Remember, these servers can host A LOT more people than your average server (thanks to layering), and it's not like they've not prepared for spinning up more servers if necessary.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; We've seen pservers host up to 20-30k total players. So let's say 20k and 3 layers, that's 60k, times 25 servers that's 1,5 million separate players on day 1. Go wild with layering and they could easily host 4-5 million on day one with 25 servers. But ofc, too many layers and they risk running into overpopulation down the line.
---
Stop talking when you are clueless. There is no more and never was anymore than 3.5k EVER on a retail realm. Talking about 20k per layer get out of here lmao. Why is this upvoted?
---
Yup. It definitely will
---
Not sure why you
---
Got downvoted.
---
ah shit, right in the middle of my flight....
---
thanks though man, what name are you thinking?
---
MC 2. week made my day..haha...plans have been made to clear it before first reset lmao
---
And the crowd goes mild
---
Spoken like someone who relies to much on p servers
---
And you can’t have a guild named “Dead Naga Storage” for example. I thought it was a funny reference and all but that one got changed pretty quick.
---
NO. CHANGES.
---
UI mods should be bannable (perm)
---
Sure thing. So, cancels your form, of course. Those are conditions that must be met for your form to be cancelled when you press the button. What else is happening when you press the button such that you would want your form to be cancelled?
---
First thing on the list: holding shift uses Hibernate. You need to be out of animal forms to use that, so you'll want to cancel any form with \[mod:shift\]. Next thing: control uses your mount and you need to be out of forms to start the animation. Thus, \[mod:ctrl\].
---
\[nostance:2/4\] is more interesting. If you press that button and you are \*not\* in travel or aquatic form, then cancel your form. Once you're free of that other form, the macro continues and automatically casts travel/aquatic form.
---
Lastly, \[combat\] means that every time you press the button while in combat, you will cancel your current form and enter travel/aquatic form. This is so you can repeatedly press the button to break snares, but you won't accidentally waste mana while you're casually pressing it around town.
---
They have mentioned they can change layer sizes at will and something to the effect that smaller layers off the bat may help... it looks like at one time they attempted to shard but it didn't work well with layering.
---
Pretty torn between Mage (OG vanilla main), Shaman (main ever since mid TBC), and Warlock (new character to me, still fills caster mold I like).
---
I've accepted I'm probably going to level all 3 to ~20-30ish and decide as I go 🤷‍♂️
---
Mechanics. If I like the idea of a class, that's a nice bonus, but it's much more important to like the reality of it.
---
Shamans easily have the coolest class fantasy in the game imo, but I'm not trying to deal with totems and whiny melee.

Healing you will spend more time trying to survive than actually healing.   At least in random bg.  Premade ranking is a different game.

Treat battlegrounds like a dungeon queue.   Luckily it's very easy to grab a couple people to support you.

I got bored of hunter, so I am biased.  Priest gets my vote.

Seriously this thing is crap, it's a series of forum post links and then a thread. Also you can't sort at all and people don't follow a format.
---
Wow you’re just all over this thread with useless nonsense. 
---
What do they gain from making sure everyone reaches level 15? And regardless, level 15 takes like 6-8 hours if you’re trying.
---
What a surprise that something affiliated with Twitch is a pile of shit
---
Yeah it's pretty sweet, it does player/guild kill on sight, keeps track of wins/losses, has an ignore player setting, and a handy enemy player nearby counter.

I'm tempted to roll a dwarf and just go around shouting "Rock and stone!"  "Rock and stone, to the bone."

There are bad people on every server, that’s just statistics 101. I do think overall though WrA is a solidly friendly server. (Source: I’ve been playing characters there since Wrath/Cata.)

I'd like to see the maths because I feel like might would be far better.
---
Thank you for responding. Those are all really good points. Like I put in another comment. I am leaning toward the paladin the most. Although all the classes look fun.
---
Fordring, Turalyon, Mograine
---
bruh
---
So what I’ve gathered here is that all the paths take approximately 4 minutes. So the flight path from sentinel hill would be a waste of money.  Only upside would be going afk for a minute and a half.
---
Squishy, but good. You need peels. Best to partner up with a mage. Everyone will say warrior but mage having your back +water is 10x better.
---
Open-minded Night Elf male here. Let's have a few beers in Teldrassil and see where the evening leads...

Did vanilla have Chinese language support back then?
---
Ahhhhhhhhh
---
Thank you
---
I was 12 bro
---
&gt;(i'm pretty sure they said layering will only be for the first 10 or so levels),
---
They didn't. You are thinking of the initial announcement of sharding potentially being in the game. At no time have they said layering will be starting zones only, or not past a certain level.  Commenting on something you don't even know the basics about is very stupid of you. 
---
&gt;having 2k people split up between 6 starting zones is WAY better than 100k people.
---
Not really. It doesn't matter how many people are in a starting area at one point. 
---
&gt;Your argument right now is literally "well 100k is bad and so is 2k, so I want the 100k people so I can be a giant virgin and appreciate how big dis werld is hee hee xd"
---
Actually this was my original argument: "Server transfers in no way garuntee a fix for high population servers and in my opinion are just as bad as server merges. They also have to keep layering in until it does fix it halting content or renegading on there promise of no layering in phase 2. "
---
I would explain the context of the situation to you, but considering your ability for comprehension we would just end up going in circles of your own stupidity. 
---
&gt;Get over yourself, you're embarrassing
---
Says the dumbass that doesn't even know the difference between layering and sharding.
---
FWIW, shackle and exorcism worked against them in Beta. :)
---
Do any of these come with a totem timer, if not is there one you would reccomend? Ty for this list.
---
Short of giving them a completely customizable list, it looks like I'll just go with Might/Wisdom based on class, with a flag to say "prefer kings".  And then advance that with a "If I detect Bear Form flip Might instead of Wis".
---
Woo I'm for sure rolling here.
---
The layer amount is flexible.

WHat is this "Log-out\_ you speak of?  I took 3 weeks off work for this launch and I intend to use every one of those hours.
---
Who's down to kill Jandice? ::crickets::
---
Sure you can, go Holy/Reckoning spec.
---
peels?
---
No they didn't say it will always be this this or that day one it will be this.
---
It maybe. But that wasn't explicitly stated like that.
---
Sorry frien...buh Im not attracted to female dwarves....why would I be to ye? *Hick*
---
Well i would argue that just murdering random people from the opposing faction (often low levels or "inexperienced adventurers") wouldn't really make sense even in wartime. But neither would not be able to fight them at all to be fair.
---
Blood fury did not give you spell power until I think wrath.  In vanilla it was only AP.  Agree that Orc mages would suck.
---
I don't know how weird I am for this, but I look at mechanics as a part of aesthetic. What you can do helps define how you can present yourself to others (or to yourself as a player). I realize you mean "aesthetic" more in the sense of "static visual design", but there's a lot of potential in how that design acts that I think shouldn't be ignored. I think demons look cool; being able to summon demons and hang out with them is a mechanical representation of action as relating to that visual attraction.
---
I expect major server congestion.
---
well it does feel like there's probably just a small team leading the project who also loved vanilla for what it was
---
they will make money off of classic, but they're putting in more effort than they need to
---
&gt; It is a bit slow, and repetitive; but from a certain point all leveling is like that.
---
Aye aye. The slowness of paladins is partly only a perception, partly coming from the perspective of min/max levelling, and partly true. Any class, unless you're 100% on your game 100% of the time, will die for stupid reasons and paladin just needs more of a stupid reason than other classes, which for most people will cut a lot of time out of the overall 1-60. u/hytherix, if faction has any weight in your decision making choice, I'd say probably go with that over anything. If after that it still comes down to playing priest vs. pally, imho they are both good but nothing makes a 2-man group stronger than having a pally in it
---
I'll play devils advocate here. As someone who played RP-PvP as Alliance and PvP as Horde at the same time in Vanilla (RpPvP first then later rolled the Horde character), I personally didn't notice as much difference as other people seem to. Besides a little more RP (it still happens on PvP servers) and stricter naming standards, it was pretty much the same imo.
---
When he said "Philosophically" did you not understand that word?
---
That was a general statement not a specific one.
---
Combination of mechanical fun, novelty of mechanics, and power/utility  relative to other classes.
---
Right, no one wants a druid to carry the flag.
---
Makes sense they sure needed a fuckton of people with the amount of makeup necessary not like they'd stick out.
---
I mean, they warned you not to take their candles.  Fargodeep mine will be a bloodbath once again, and I'll love every minute of it.
---
Mained a warrior in vanilla, did the rank 10 PvP grind too.
---
Yes, it's that bad. You need support because you are the easiest class to kill for everyone else except maybe holy priests, even then I'm pretty sure you're gonna die.
---
Uhhhhngg
---
Are you planning on playing on the rp-pvp server?
---
Shhh. Don't accept reality. They KNOW.
---
Why would they do that?
---
Sick guild name. Bruenor better be the GM
---
This.
---
Yeah it's always a thought of "hope the mob doesn't crit".
---
If you don't plan on being the guild enchanter/alchemist, just go engi. Really adds to the paladin toolset with stuff like nets, death ray, rocket helm, and grenades
---
I know.  Everyone sucked back in vanilla.
---
We did it Reddit!
---
My guild was such shit, that we never actually even went into Algalon's room.  
---
I will probably play Wrath again just to kill Algalon.
---
Times were tough...
---
Alliance PvP premades in bgs can stomp horde pretty hard - paladin healers are just too strong. So I would say they win at PvP with good teamwork.
---
Hahaha  
---
I feel like you're that kid who never got a birthday cake when they grew up, and got really shitty presents for christmas.
---
Stop projecting your broken childhood please.
---
Glad to see you're still around and reading up on Classic! Are you returning?
---
Yeah. We really did. And it was really awesome.
---
This is getting really stale, you can let it die.
---
I played a shadow priest in Vanilla and did the rank grind to 11 before TBC dropped.  I never felt like I didn’t have a fighting chance and I was in a mix of the blue pvp gear and some pvp rep epics.  Healing gear won’t help you much as a shadow priest, so gearing him up through raiding may be tough depending on how bad your guilds mages and locks want the dps off set gear.  
---
If I were to roll a shadow priest again, I would go for the pvp gear especially if I could get to rank 13 and get an Anathema.  That said you won’t feel very squishy on the blue set, even if you do feel like you tear through your mana.
---
Thanks for responding!
---
Ah, the one real purpose of hand sanitizer - keeping your hands free and clear so you can do the real work. If I could train a cat to carry my luggage for me, of course I'd use it.
---
This. When fourth kale gets down to 1500 players during off hours, trying to find or start a dungeon group for pre-60 content is a lost cause.
---
Spent most of my wow time on thorium brotherhood i was a older player in Vanilla now i have a greying beard and hair. From my personal experience RP realms tend to be more mature not that there is not toxicity sometimes. I hope its the same in Classic as i will be rolling on the RPPVP realm and will be seeking out a casual raiding guild.
---
Yes, You’re a fool to pay into a stress test. 
---
Just because somebody doesn’t spend their money on frivolous things doesn’t mean they can’t afford to or don’t care enough. That’s a ridiculous statement.
---
This has been fixed!
---
Thex?!
---
Well the two roles besides dps are tank or heals, and healing always "depends" on mana. I might suggest druid or priest, both are easy to level and can fill multiple roles at 60.
---
Tolkien?
---
I've always been a fan of range classes in video games. I was coming in as a hardcore runescape player that spent hours on end leveling my range skill to 99 farming fire giants and dragons. Hunter was the obvious choice. I just wish it was a class with more powerful range dps and no pet.
---
I’m sorry you feel that an optional resource which helps to identify and avoid streamers for people who wish to do so is shitty.
---
Yes, yesss!!!   
---
beat that dead horse into a pulp
---
It's cool that tauren warrior kills his bear and smashes his face in at the end of the cinematic. BLOOD AND THUNDER!
---
I mean sure, If you enjoy slow-ass combat for the first 30 levels then FF XIV might be for you.
---
In my battlenet launcher, is this the same as the retail wow icon or is there a separate install for classic that I'm not seeing?
---
Fellow altoholic here, definitely taking it slow then disregarding my lvl 6p to level alts and twinks!
---
Afaik at level 60 you'll get  242 Attack power for 10 seconds. Not sure how much dps it would be though.
---
I'm not sure if the exposure this server has gotten will make it clear or not... but this will be *the* server to be on, I bet.
---
rip bot
---
I’m not at my computer I will find out in the morning, but I had a drop down menu for the classic beta / ptr
---
Also freezes using Firefox on PC web browser.
---
Holy fuck I'm happy
---
Setup your ui so you're ready to go on launch
---
Then you would know that warriors are factually harder to level than other classes.
---
so there's no actual rules to follow
---
Base melee attack power is all the AP you get from Strength (and Agility for Druids, Hunters, and Rogues), including what you get from gear, enchants, buffs, etc plus every character has some base AP, around ~160 at level 60.
---
How else will I play classic? Can't raid and baby bro, raid comes first.
---
? What lol
---
truly epic xD
---
This is awesome! Thank you so much for developing this ^_^
---
I just see this server attracting so many fun people and personalities, who are up for doing whatever. Should be great
---
It was exactly this when wrath came out for me, and also it was a sleet storm outside and i had spice candles
---
Interested
---
Goal: OT as much as I can as a Paladin.  
---
Shoot for the moon: Tank 4H as a paladin.
---
I doubt it will most people will just roll pvp or pve i am personally hoping more RPPVE players role RPPVP this time. Also faction inbalance tends to be a problem on RPPVP servers so hopefully more people roll Horde. The streamers and most the major tryhard guilds are unlikely to roll RPPVP that is why i doubt it will be overpopulated in the long run.
---
If their name is a female variant of Thex.
---
Am I the only one, seeing a dwarf with a black beard on the right side of the mountain?
---
Only if it's undead rogue b/c of fear break. Otherwise an SL stands a decent chance of surviving the stun lock with void sac and soul link. Like I said, clothies are gonna have a hard time no matter what but the odds improve drastically if you can can past the initial burst.
---
Thexa
---
That’s pretty neat
---
Got em pretenders!
---
They literally objectively are, as world record speed leveled have all said. Enjoy talking out your ass don’t you?
---
I forgot about boys
---
As someone who was born and raised in an area that had fairly cold winters and prefers indoor spaces, ironforge hits that cozy spot more to be honest. It's that dichotomy between cold as fuck outside and tolkienesque roaring forges inside a torch-lit cave that just feels much more cozy and relaxing.
---
Then again i can see thunder bluff if you're more of an outdoorsy person. Which i am not.
---
Wrong, early on there was no AH in Stormwind or Darnassus.
---
Sounds like pure RP server might give you more consistency in that area. 
---
For me, I'm shooting for SWG vibes. As you know, there were no contested zones, just TEFs at best, and just normal servers, but there were still a decent mix of PvPers, RPers, and neithers.
---
I have no idea how many PvPers will be on pure RP servers - there could be a surprising amount of organized PvP. 
---
Or it could be that RP-PvP will absorb PvP oriented roleplayers who wouldve went RP. In that case, RP-PvP might have been a bad idea.
---
Or, it will end up really awesome.
---
We just dont know yet, it could go either way. I guess this is one of those "stick your finger in the wind and chart course" situations. 
---
Personally, as someone who was going to go PvP but enjoying a fun community who embraces RP, I'm going RP-PvP. Hope you enjoy your choice, nerfherder.
---
Do you intend to RP? Will it bother you if you join a dungeon group and they are roleplaying through the dungeon? If one does not intend to ever RP or will get annoyed with others roleplaying around you then i would say its better to head to another server. Also world chat and trade chat it is common courtesy to keep conversations game related. Politics, religion exc. Will be frowned upon by many players. Its also common courtesy not to interrupt organized rp events even if it is cross faction. These rules are not set in stone but lets say a player is regularly toxic in world chat or does not respect others RP they may find themselves blacklisted or just dismissed from dungeon groups exc.
---
\*laughs in Mage\*
---
Getting 15 isn't the point of the beta friend, they're trying to stress the load
---
Yes they didn’t specify good job at reading what I said
---
It does not scale at all with gear in vanilla.
---
fact on no solo
---
THE VERY FORESTS OF LORDAERON WHISPERED THE NAME...
---
&gt; They DID say they are removing it soon after launch though. The fact that you're whining about them thinning the population at the start of the game so the servers don't crash over and over is very stupid of you.
---
Again your lack of knowledge is making you look like an idiot. They stated they would like to remove near launch as soon as possible but that it is dependent on the current populations. The only time line they have given us is that it will be removed by phase 2. Hence my comments on why smaller amounts of servers make that ideal more improbable/ difficult. 
---
&gt;LOL. Proof is in the pudding. You really aren't bright are you? So having 98k more people split up between the starting zones has NO downsides? That's really your point of view? Just admit you're dumb at this point.
---
You are just going prove me wrong aren't you? You will go around in circles of your own stupidity just for the sake of showing the world that yes you can. You will jump through a moved goal post to a new moved goal post to give yourself the illusion of besting someone you don't even know on the internet than have to admit you may be wrong about something. 
---
&gt;Did you hear that guys?
---
Ahh thats the reason. You expect people to follow this thread and need to save some sort of face. Mate I hate to break it to you but the mods aren't even reading this chain. 
---
&gt;Also the fact that you quoted me from a post where I inquired about a topic and learned about it as being a dumbass. 
---
Did you have a stroke? Or are you just to upset to think straight? Regardless mate you seem to not be taking this well so I am going to let you be. Take care. Go read up on layering.
---
It's also the Home City of two races, just like Orgrimmar and unlike Stormwind.
---
It entirely depends on your gear.
---
Naked Orc Warriors have ~410 AP and gain 2 AP per each point of Strength.
---
Naked Orc Shaman have ~340 AP and gain 2 AP per each point of Strength.
---
Naked Orc Rogues have ~370 AP and gain 1 AP per each point of Strength and Agility.
---
Naked Orc Hunters have ~340 AP (melee) and gain 1 AP (melee) per each point of Strength and Agility.
---
It does not include gear, it remains the same bonus forever at level 60.
---
Totally. Fresh servers are a positive for the community, whereas merges are way more difficult and just feel bad.
---
I raided as resto druid....and if you want to be competitive (i.e., do well on the meters) forget it. Your heals have too long of a cast time and they will get sniped by pallies and priests. If you don't care about that stuff druid is fine. Otherwise roll pally or priest.
---
Serious orcs edgelords can't handle being killed by cute midgets. Hilarious
---
For the Alliance!
---
If you've played beta or the stress tests, mobs dodge/parry/etc about 66% less often which is huge while leveling compared to private servers and you regen hp way faster as another commenter has said.
---
They gave 48 hours last time and if you are telling me that they will only give 6-8 hours you are most definitely wrong
---
Lol. Why do we love the pain.
---
Rolling Troll aswell. Wanted a fresh new name instead of usual gamer tags. Found an item in another game and added a letter which made it sounds "trollish".
---
False. Bloodfury scales from the attributes on your gear (white stats), just not bonus AP (green stats): https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/2
---
It's the auction *house*, you filthy casual.
---
Damn
---
I'm worried that it could go the other way and die off.  Either way someone is going to be wrong: blizz or the community.  Will be interesting to see who really knew more.
---
Warrior is hard counter to rogue. Well played Hunter would be second.
---
That’s why they tell people to log in in the first 2 hours that’s when they really are going to be stressing after that it will be a lot smoother with people enjoying the experience
---
Of course it's not true. This is just more *private server people* telling Imus what to expect, when THEY DON'T KNOW. Because pserv =/= Classic.
---
That’s great. They’re still the slowest levelers and it’s not even close, as has been proven time and again on retail vanilla, on private servers, and on beta.
---
&gt; Again your lack of knowledge is making you look like an idiot. They stated they would like to remove near launch as soon as possible but that it is dependent on the current populations. The only time line they have given us is that it will be removed by phase 2. Hence my comments on why smaller amounts of servers make that ideal more improbable/ difficult.
---
What do you not get about server costs being a thing? Do you think Blizzard is conspiring against the players just to fuck us in the ass? No. They're doing a middle ground for both parties. You're so thick in the head i'm not even surprised anymore that you can't grasp this concept. I'm not even going to read the rest of your post or reply to you anymore, just know you're really fucking dense. Seek help

---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
Human or Orc both make great warriors. If you want a no-pet hunter, play another class (mage or rogue I guess), pets are a key part of playing a hunter.
---
Maybe for horde. I find it hard to believe they're better tank heals than paladin.
---
So you mean a social guild like the ones with 1000 members that people only join to stop getting spammed with ginvites?
---
And as the original commenter said, "Warrior isn't that hard to level."
---
It's not going to be that difficult, regardless of if it's the slowest and especially if your experience with it boils down to private server leveling lmao
---
Say 20% roll human (approximation from the poll)
---
3k per layer/shard ~= 600 players in the human starting zone
---
This is really big props to blizzard. I don't partake much in RP, but I know people really enjoy it. That's the thing about classic that is great. Give people the option to play what they want to play.
---
What are you talking about? There aren't going to be tens of thousands of people per server. And there will be lots of layers....
---
3k PER LAYER? What?
---
better continue to stomp on hopes and dreams here
---
Hollow's End is in classic, but it has no horseman as he was also added in TBC patch 2.2.2
---
Can’t wait for the drama that happens when asmon or soda rolls on the rppvp realm
---
So them listening is how they ruined wow, then they listened when asked to revert back to their original game! Wow! Let the wow community whining begin again! Oh nooooaah not this time.... Noooooahh....uhuhhh
---
WTF?!  Damn it I hope he's joking!!  I'll be on a Normal server so I'm a bit concerned now.  As long as he rolls Alliance then I'm still safe.  He does have his fan squad swarming around him like flies on fresh shit so I don't see why he'd be worried either.
---
PvE servers aren't favored by stream watchers so he'd have to be content with losing sizeable chunk of his viewers, not to mention his income.  Money talks, bullshit walks, and I don't think he'll risk his $$$.
---
Because the main advantage of warrior is being a good tank; so you might as well get used to getting the shit kicked out of you.
---
Can anyone with a sub play during the stress test? The launcher isn't installing the game for me.
---
I wonder how the Nay sayers feel when their childish crusade to stop this had failed. Omega bent lol
---
Warrior attacks rogue. Rogue blinds warrior...  Good fight, was fun.  
---
 
---
  
---
Rogue comes back when warrior is fighting anything and is inevitably below 50% hp.
---
Do we get to keep our characters
---
then I would need another alt to hide from the secret alt guild \~.\~
---
Just join one of the hundreds of guilds that spam trade chat, you know they ain't raiding shit.
---
Remind myself  Int -&gt; mp5  &amp;  +healing -&gt; mp5
---
Dude your logic is so flawed.
---
That’s literally like saying classic raiding is easy but refusing to acknowledge naxx as being harder than MC/BwL etc. 
---
Does your brain make those connections?
---
Sure!
---
For me, one of the best parts of vanilla was the gigantic factions battles over world locations. Tarren Mill is the most famous one, but there were several others too. Those fights were SO MUCH FUN.
---
RP servers took those battles and picked them up a notch. People REALLY GOT INTO rping the war. There were elaborate tactics employed, and there were lots of posts on forums getting into character and taunting the other faction. Most in good fun, of course. World PvP was good on any server, but the RP PvP servers really took it to a whole other level. And the fighting basically never ended.
---
Another cool thing was you tended to have more meaningful interactions with the other faction. If an enemy ganked or camped you, it was less of a stupid trolly thing, and more of a rp thing. Other players of your own faction were generally WAY more willing to stop what they were doing and come help you fight back.
---
Perhaps the best part, although subtle, was when enemies DIDN'T attack you, and you ended up working together to achieve some difficult goal. This happened rarely, but when it did, it was really, really cool. RP servers had players that were more likely to go all in and create emotional experiences like this. That's the kind of thing that sticks with you after 15 years. I STILL remember teaming up with a Tauren Shaman in desolace to clear out a bunch of centaurs that were too hard for either of us to kill alone. We spent about 2 hours just trading off tagging mobs and helping the other kill them. It was amazing. That kind of thing happened so less often on the non-rp servers.
---
I hope that answers your question!
---
I think I do! For the horde my brothers and sisters! It is time to begin this incredible adventure
---
Always irks me how easy it is to get upvotes with no effort, while I put in effort for my posts. Lack of upvotes doesn't bother me, they dont *matter*, but seeing posts like this always annoys me for whatever reason
---
Hi Kives, my name was Smallit I played a paladin back then and was good friends with Alexandir and K ro nos  the paladin who you may remember. I was in Elysiun into All for One at the end there with Oneiros, and mainly participated in the Marshal grind in Gwenavior's team with psycosis, went on to join Feint in Wotlk to play with Psy, Vesi etc. wonder if any of those nerds are still playing, see me in classic.
---
Most players that have played on a RP server realize it may have a lower population that is not always a bad thing particularly on RP servers.
---
Literally no one said wow is difficult. You’ve lost your argument and are clawing at straws that aren’t there.
---
I had just finished reading the hobbit and my stepfather came home one day and showed me the cinematic for World of Warcraft. This scene cemented my love for dwarfs and made me decide on a dwarf hunter and he’s been my main ever since.
---
How did you get the client to recognize manual installs if I may ask?
---
It is indeed highly strange that there had never ever been a wow killer, except itself.
---
The genre just kind of unraveled within itself. I wanna see it evolve positively this time also.
---
It's not flawed at all. When someone says, "This thing is not hard to do." You don't counter with, "Well they do it the worst, so it is hard." That's a complete non-sequitur. We're speaking to the question "Is it difficult?" not comparing them to other things e.g "Is it the *most* difficult of a given set of classes?"
---
Is Elemental Shaman viable for PvE? or will people ask me to respec if i want to raid with them?
---
I only played pre-CU. You could either PVP flag yourself, or you would attack faction bases or NPCs or flagged players, giving you a TEF (temporary enemy flag). So, pretty timid rules overall, but you still saw those big anchorhead versus Bestine fights
---
I don't believe it. There's no reason to worry about BIS if you ever raid Molten Core. You know there's no way you can level in 2 weeks realistically if you've done it before. Racials don't matter to farm Honor.

I don't believe a game like classic would survive in 2019. It's mostly classic wow imitations that ruined the opportunity for me to trust any other devs. Grinding on a new game without knowing just how trash it is until you reach the level cap is such a turn off, no matter how great the journey was.
---
The mmo industry is just so dry. It's either a super infamous company with a ton of money to blow on mmo's that look great and play like trash or it's a very small, indie company with fantastic ideas and poor execution of them due to the small budget. Also, the majority of games seem to forget about the casualcore players.
---
You can if you attack them, which many noobs do their first time seeing an enemy lvl "??".
---
You've never actually played on an RP server, have you?
---
Call it &lt;FIGHT CLUB&gt;

Minecraft also got one of the most impactful bunch of free advertising ever: it *dominated* YouTube
---
What? How?

I don't think they can even comprehend anything other than "Warriur is hurd"
---
Inside the "World of Warcraft" folder you have folders for all the different game types. For example
---
    World of Warcraft\_PTR_
---
    World of Warcraft\_beta_
---
    World of Warcraft\_retail_
---
Just find the one for classic - and then put the addons in the Interface\AddOns folder of that.
---
Ah. I see now. You’ve completely misunderstood the argument. I suggest you reread this thread. Hopefully it’ll help.

This is all because of me. I knew that Blizz wouldn't announce this until I had given up all hope. So, your welcome.
---
So we making a group for this. Mid life dads/wifes who can't play anymore but want to group for fun. I'm on a boat for either warrior again or priest, both UD.

And this is why I'm going RP, to avoid little trolls like you.

Gods, let it be so. I know it would only last 1-2 hours max but I really don't want to put up with the headache/buzzkill of competing with 300 other players for spawns.

From what I hear, consider it "RP Lite"

I...I just got a warm snuggly from this, thanks ;D
---
Says the guy who misread the initial post and is desperately trying to defend their position instead of just admitting they didn't read the comment correctly in the first place and took a huge shit all over themselves because of it.
---
I agree
---
i played on rp and rp-pvp, rp-pvp realm was all about world pvp guilds and having rivlarys. a 2v2 fight could turn into 40vs40 if the right guilds were involved. RP existed on rppvp realms but not as much as regular rp realms. rp realms is just like a pve realm except it has rp centered guilds. i never was involved in rp but its mainly you name your character something it might be in your races lore. make your own story of him, they added role play addons where people could click on your name and see your toons backstory. on rpvp realms there was guilds claiming territorys and what not. they make the game funner. when wod was having a content drought i was busy having fun hunting enemy faction guilds and trying to start guild skirmishes
---
The fact that you actually believe only mature big boys play on rppvp realms is beyond hilarious.
---
But, you know, whatever keeps the kids off your lawn boomer.
---
I honestly thought I was one of the only people that thought to use the flightpath in westfall to go back to darkshire. Always felt like it was faster, but I guess I was wrong. :(
---
You’re projecting so hard dude. This is actually beyond being funny now. I feel bad for you.
---
Hey, go ahead and read what the argument began as:
---
&gt;Here come the downvotes, but warrior isn’t that hard to level.
---
"Warrior isn't that hard to level" makes no statement about whether or not it's better than other classes. It can be both not hard to level and also the slowest of the bunch. Literally logic 101 you'd learn in even a high school or community college course.
---
How exactly will we be reserving names? Will we do it on WoW itself? Does our sub need to be active? Anyone have details?
---
4.2.3 Cataclysm? Probably not, the API has changed a lot over the past 9 years
---
You’re right. I’m the original Thex. I support this.
---
BUT ITZ DA SLOWEST11!!
---
Classic has the benefit of not having to answer the question of what to do with an expansion, or several expansions. How strong for you make the quest rewards in the expansion?
---
 If the gear rewards are too weak, then raiders go for ages before getting an upgrade, because their raid gear from the previous content is too good.
---
If you make the rewards too strong, then you nullify all the previous content, and there's no reason to do old raids. Then the previous content is just something to level through quickly to reach the cap. This is kind of what has happened in WoW a few times, new expansion gear just makes all previous content irrevelant except to level through quickly to reach the new stuff.
---
I'm half convinced that this is a flaw built into this type of level based game. Ideally new expansions would not nullify old content, and it would all be valued forever. But without design changes to repair it, it seems inevitable. Can a level based game be built better?
---
Classic gets to avoid all this mess, by existing before expansions. Even being an inspiration for other MMOs doesn't answer this problem.
---
Depends on the context. Solo PvP is dull, but who really cares while you're (mostly) melting face? If you're opened on: PW:S -&gt; Psychic Scream(unless you're fighting an undead) -&gt; Vampiric Embrace  -&gt; Mind blast (if they're still feared) -&gt;SW:P -&gt; DP (if you're undead, DO NOT USE AGAIN DWARFS, IF YOU DO THEY WILL ALWAYS KILL YOU UNLESS THEY'RE BRAINDEAD) -&gt; Mind flay until dead. Throw in a silence if you're fighting a caster. Maybe a dispel if you've got the time. And if you're a dwarf, use stoneform against bleeds and poisons. Opening is basically the same thing, but with an extra mind blast + inner focus.  
---
Group PvP and Bgs are a different story. Mind blast and mind flays are fine occasionally, but mainly you to be spamming dispels, silencing key casters, and CC'ing with psychic scream. You can also pull people out of the fire with PW:S. Dispel makes druids and non-destro warlocks useless and it makes paladins and frost mages very afraid.   
---
Spam mana burn. Is your group fighting an invincible pally? Spam mana burn and dispel and watch them die. Pain in the ass druid interrupting you and a bud while you're trying to cap a flag, but also has gone bearform + barkskin + rejuv and now just won't die? Dispel and mana burn. Mage nuking your melee? Dispel + mana burn. Warlock with SL just existing? You get the gist.   
---
If you're undead, DO NOT USE DP IT WILL BE DISPELLED AND YOU WILL LOSE A TON OF MANA! Of course, if you get into a 1v1, feel free to nuke them, but your group utility is so good that it a waste not to stay with your zerg.
---
Do you not understand the effect of the word "that" when used as a modifier for the word "hard" or something?
---
You haven't really refuted anything I've said, but thanks for the take.
---
I'm aware that druids don't use HoTs much. THAT'S THE POINT.
---
They're a HoT healing class that doesn't use them because they suck. So they're stuck using ranks of their slow heal and getted outhealed significantly by Paladins and Priests.
---
/r/cringe
---
Sounds immersive 🙄

" Well, we could open Burning Crusade and Lich King or we could keep you  all at level 60, we honestly have not made a decision but we could do  either of those things. We're going to be listening to all of you to  tell us what you'd like to see happen next. "
---
WTF, why is this an either-or thing? So in the future they might \*force\* TBC on classic servers, wiping the progress I made on my level 60? If that's the case, I'm not even sure I want to play classic. If they introduce TBC servers it should either be a fresh start on those servers or you get to copy your character there. Forcing TBC on classic servers would be BS!
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
They will always run 180 degrees from where they are facing, just have them point to where you came from and it should you not agro more in the same fight
---
In what way?
---
Should I tell you? I guess I’ll tell you.
---
You responded to my comment, my argument, not his. LOL. Is it connecting now in your head?
---
I tend to let people speak for themselves rather than have someone on reddit interpret their version of reality for me.
---
The world is round man, its ok.
---
You're soft
---
My buddy and I have never played WoW before, but we have played WoW clones and love WPvP. We also don't care much for PvE, but we'll try to push content anyways for PvP gear. 
---
Should we roll double undead mage or double gnome rogue to wreak havoc on Azeroth?
---
Nah, he's right. Most classes are all filler until 60.
---
&gt; Mage elemental build just doesn't really work until 51 at least.
---
It doesn't work until you're 60 and have good gear.
---
&gt;The standard elemental build for Shamans (30/0/21) also needs at least 51, and arguably even flat out 60
---
What. Shamans are destroyers of worlds at 40. You spec 31 into Ele.
---
Priest gets Shadow Form at 40, and then they're at peak power.
---
Druid gets like.... Furor and HotW by 45. They're set until NS at 60, in-between is filler.
---
I'll give you Piercing Howl. It's pretty good for Warrior PvP.
---
Posting here as evidence that i believed ony will die within 9 days.
---
Actually I think it would be funnier if everyone gave me $10 for uh... reasons.
---
I usually agree with what you have to say on here Nudvik but you can't say that druids revolve around hots and then say they don't revolve around hots because they suck.
---
Are you listening to yourself?
---
Someone link some of them sweet sweet drakedog videos.
---
I’ve had a Naga Epic for six years and it works 100% perfectly. I still use it every day as my only mouse.
---
&gt; That screenshot has less people
---
***Fewer
---
PoMPyro is still one of my favourite builds ever.
---
I'm 90% sure I'm going to roll a priest and level it as shadow. I never played one in vanilla but I've always liked playing them in the later expansions. I hear they're godly in 1v1's and 1v2's in vanilla.
---
On the other hand there's 10% of me that wants to place good old mage or rogue, I loved them  both in vanilla! Guess I'll have to make multiple toons 😂
---
No, but a former boss of mine did renfaire stuff and liked to practice his character at work.  That was enough for me.
---
I’ll be seeing you in STV.
---
You’re very dense. Sorry brother. Just reread the thread if you’re having trouble. Maybe have a friend help you.
---
Sorry to dissapoint man, you won’t receive a spot as elemental in the guilds that actually down end game content. Ele just doesn’t have enough dps and generates too much threat.
---
Ahurrdadurr thex
---
Plz clap
---
I agree, it was weird to let us rage for months. Maybe to make the hype even hyper? Either way I'm glad we finally got our RP PvP server confirmed.
---
&gt;You’re very dense. Sorry brother. Just reread the thread if you’re having trouble. Maybe have a friend help you.
---
Just say you are willing to tank if needed as an off spec and you will get the gear after the main two tanks in the guild. Come Nax they will need 8 tanks for horsemen if you get that far.
---
What happens if I join on my main?
---
Stop trying to make Thex happen Gretchen.
---
Ah I do see both classic and retail now, thank you for this response!
---
You obviously forgot the first 2 rules.
---
Yessir. 10 years now.
---
Other than ooming quickly they arent that gear dependent really imo.  Since you only need to focus on 1 stat assuming the people you're pvping are in similar gear situations spriest are pretty strong earlier than some other classes.
---
If you've downloaded the 1.12 client then your Wow folder should have two sub folders. I believe they are called "Retail" and "1.12" but not certain as I'm not at my pc.
---
Inside those folders you should find an almost identical folder structure and you should be able to navigate to the 1.12 version of the addons folder.
---
Like someone else has mentioned with twitch. When you go to "get more addons" through the twitch client and select world of warcraft there should be a drop down box in the top right hand corner which lists your two separate folders (retail and 1.12). If you select 1.12 in the drop down it should automatically download the addons into the correct folder for your 1.12 client.
---
Troll priest is the shit
---
What did I just tell Dave?
---
Oh my bad I didn't realize that me responding to the same exact argument you were giving the previous poster somehow bent reality and changed it somehow??? Am I just now discovering quantum redditing or some shit
---
Pls explain how you saying "Spoken like someone who has never leveled a warrior in classic" changes any of what we've said o great galaxy brained cat king
---
I think clear MC and get most the Tier 1 gear and epic weapons. If I’m still engaged and time is good I’ll push further. I never really raided much in vanilla and got really livid once when I got fucked out of an epic by some douche class leader. So I guess finding a cool guild as well lol! This game has a really addictive side to it so I want to make sure I’m having fun and not dreaming about it and sacrificing personal goals and relationships.
---
Just join a different guild and make different friends.
---
Can this meme be any more “forced” it’s like Ugandan knuckles for wow.
---
Yeah, RP servers aren't like that at all. They're basically PvE servers with stricter naming conventions and that's it. The RPing you'll rarely see unless you hang out in cities.
---
I'm not sure what the population is going to be like for classicwow, but the servers I played on in the past the horde was out numbered. I'm sure it wasn't the case for every sever. Just my experience.
---
You spelled Thex wrong.
---
By that same logic, they **can't** keep layering in classic at all, because it's completely antithetical to the entire point of this recreation.
---
But of course they *can*, they just claim they won't. When phase two rolls around and the population hasn't died off to the extent they expect, of course they'll keep layering.
---
Are druids able to run away easily? Also, they are tanky enough to fight everything?
---
\*sigh\*
---
The class design revolves around HoTs. 
---
The gameplay doesn't, because experienced healers know that it's just wasted mana. Except for healing raid damage in a coordinated team that isn't all fighting over being top on healing meters. Unless your healers actually take note of the Rejuv icon on the raid ui, it'll just end up being wasted mana.
---
Yall alliance need to learn to pvp like a man instead of 2v1ing lowbies c:
---
Bring it homie.
---
All jokes aside im very excited for the horde vs alliance hatred to resurface. It used to be so real. Now days no one cares what faction theyre on or despises the opposing one.
---
Not what I said at all, but keep making shit up. That and your sad attempts at getting a rise out of me just show your maturity. And don't respond, I won't see it.
---
This is something I am now aware of. I was not 13 years ago.
---
Eh, I've had to change a few, but got away with Notviable and Ketameme on an rp pvp server until I stopped playing
---
&gt;stricter naming conventions
---
Wait so I wouldn't be able to name my hunter Maxboner420?
---
My man I adored the WC quests. DM was damn good though.
---
Put it here if it's not yet created - C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns
---
How dare you skip mind control.
---
Fair enough, I agree with you on the design aspects point. And you're definitely right about HoTs getting sniped by other healers, it's basically pointless to cast them on anything that isn't taking constant damage.
---
Great news, but this just made my horde or alliance choice a whole lot tougher.
---
Stay away from streamer servers hopefully
---
I prefer the MLG bunny slope
---
Well, yes. Neither of those names gets hit by either filter at Character Creation, so only reports from another player would force you to change them.
---
I have actually found a raid spot (for now lol) in a guild as shadow, but wasnt aware you can get PvP gear. How does that work? Sorry for all the questions, Ty for the info &lt;3
---
But that one was actually funny for a good 2 days before it got old.
---
Perhaps have a friend assist you in reading this thread. They might be able to help point out where your brain cells left you. I’m done responding to an idiot lmao
---
I love you and your beautiful comment.
---
Ugandan knuckles was at least funny before it was done to death
---
I love you both
---
Makes me want to play Dwarf, too bad they're Alliance...
---
Says mature, worried about those gosh darn twitch kids stomping all over your upvote garden.
---
Looking at your post history, it brings me such great joy to see such a mature person care so much about fake internet points.
---
You shoulda seent the original launch. It looked a lot like the login screen for 3 days.
---
unpopular opinion: having 10000 players online at the same time IS fun in classic.
---
Yes, I found it. Its _retail_ and _classic_ so I installed the addons into the classic fomder
---
Yup, that's why I wanted to post in this thread. Were gonna play as much as possible with 10 minute breaks every 2-4 hours.
---
I think eventually a runaway hit MMO on the scale of classic will appear; but I don't know what it will look like.
---
The technology pieces are being put in place.  Games are getting better at procedural generated worlds (Minecraft, No Man's Sky).  Alternative RP adventure systems are being tested (Sea of Thieves).  AI environmental elements for NPC's and world events are advancing by leaps and bounds (think of the terror felt playing Rimworld).  Techniques for reducing GM load (and hence operating costs) with cheat detection, player management, abusive behavior handling, etc are far more developed now than in classic Wow days.
---
Nobody has hit the magic combination to replicate a classic Wow success; but people are playing with very interesting game elements which eventually will fall into the right place and a miracle of an MMO will emerge.
---
Overall I think the biggest enabler will be when these elements are standardized into modules that allow a small team to make something like classic wow but on a shoestring budget.  Kind of like how indie people can use a system like Unity to build a game on a shoestring budget.  Unlike classic wow days, developers don't have to write their own customer graphics engines anymore.
---
I read somewhere, that this only applies on private servers and not on retail/vanilla. They ran in random directions.
---
Didn't get to test myself on stress test, didn't get to find mobs that fled
---
Hmm I still can‘t decide. I like some pvp and definitely want to play on a pvp server because back in the time I only did PVE. RP on the other hand is completely new for me so maybe I give it a chance. You guys think people on rp-pvp still do a lot of pve stuff 2?
---
??? Pre bis for pvp? Once you get that - wait for p2 and start ranking for r10 gear.
---
/spit
---
That or we’re sick in the head
---
omg, this fucking comment, I'm picturing it and it's cracking me up
---
Keep it a secret and make an alt.
---
2H leveling is very unforgiving until you get Mortal Strike. If you prefer a bit more headroom, I recommend leveling sword and board with the first 15 points in Protection with the remainder in Arms or Fury as you wish, then spec Mortal Strike at 40. This playstyle is slightly slower than a good player with a 2H build, but much faster than a sloppy player with a 2H build. The Revenge stuns are amazing, and the extra armor really helps. I recommend pairing the fastest 1H you can find with a fiery enchant for a bit of extra speed.
---
Link to the first 15 points (Last Stand optional, of course):

---
He's a ~24 year old Canadian, likes programming, has his life together, and his SO is going to play Classic with him.

He doesn't need your charity.
---
Yes ret is not a strong spec at all but when it comes down to it casual guilds just need bodies. On my server in Vanilla there were a bunch of small guilds that formed an alliance (SGA=Small Guild Alliance) that would take anyone willing to raid with them and that included "meme" specs. So yes, you will be fine with Ret, you just wont get into any hardcore guilds and purely dps but casual guilds will raid with you and 5mans and pvp are fine.
---
almost forgot how dogshit we all were in vanilla, dear god
---
I don't get it. Why you want to play a priest of a paladin if you don't want to heal?
---
Will everyone be able to get on it?
---
Won't happen to me, Tapioca

I remember farming that level 32 green, second best bow in the game because of the attack speed multiplier to abilities like multishot.  It was a huge damage improvement over the hunter epic bow.  Rocked that shit until the xbow of smiting...oh yeah....

&gt; In fact, Navak used the guide to get to 30 on the beta fastest on the Horde side... and he did it as a warrior.

I am, like many other people, stuck going back-and-forth on what to play. I played a Warrior back in Vanilla and absolutely don't want to do that again. I started a Feral druid in TBC loved that. But I know they're shit in TBC (Feral DPS). 
---
I am stuck considering a Druid, a Rogue, or--somewhat--a Mage. I don't love casters, but I enjoy DPS and the convenience of a Mage. I also absolutely love stealth. What I love most is flexibility, which is why I keep coming back to Druid. In Retail, I tend to swap roles often, and I can see myself wanting to occasionally Tank, sometimes Heal, and other times DPS. I know I can't do that with anyone but the Druid (of those 3)... however, my favorite role is DPS (I'd say for every time I tank or heal, I'm DPSing 3-4 times otherwise).
---
In play style, I am definitely casual, more PVP oriented. I can probably only play ~2 hours per night every few nights, and maybe a few many-hour weekends. I probably can't dedicate more than a few hours to raiding per week (e.g. one night of 3-4 hours per week). I am definitely not a min-maxer. I want to get the best gear I can without spending tons of hours in game - so I'll try to gear up what I can in PVP and pugging raids.
---
So, I know it's sounding like I should probably go Druid. But I am stuck on the DPS side. If I raid, I won't want to Tank. I could heal, but I'd prefer to DPS. If I PVP, I'd like to be able to do more in WSG than just flagrun. And that's where I'm stuck! Rogue would fill my love of stealth, give me the ability to DPS, and allow me to PVP with more of an emphasis on offense. But I can't heal or tank.
---
Ugh! Part of me wishes they were re-releasing TBC, then the decision would be easy for me :). 
---
Anyone have any thoughts?
---
Double rogue would be a cool thing for WPvP. Mages are not able to hide in stealth so maybe pick another class for the second player to help with tough opponents.
---
That’s impressive
---
final word is rp pvp is on the menu boys!!!!

Greed Roll - 100 for [Pregnancy] by /u/dragonbooty27

People forget - that's a *6* hour dungeon for non raid equipped people.  The front of the dungeon respawns way before you finish.  So you need to clear from the start if you wipe.
---
This is perfect lol!
---
There's a hybrid elemental/resto spec that you can raid on but you'll be expected to primarily heal. You can can then use the elemental side of it in pvp and world.
---
Any further discussion on size of said grain of salt?
---
Yeah they are seriously underestimating this. I'd wager it will be the highest pop server within a month.

My favorite thing to do when I see this while questing is wait till the very last second then heal them to full. It is also fun to see that look of recognition warriors get when they see they are going to die but... OH MY GOD A HEALER OVER THERE!!! Then they run to you even if you didn't see them.
---
But what about a paladins? Instead of, "Threx," or, "Thex," they could be, "Thret," or, "Tret."
---
Pretty sure this is a pserver thing

I was gonna roll nelf Druid on launch, but now you’ve made me change my mind again to dwarf pally or priest #classicWowProblems
---
We got called "donkeys" but I only see one jackass here...
---
I'd also add, keep in mind what you plan on levelling as your real professions. For tailoring, you end up needing quite a bit of leather later on so it's worth saving it.
---
Torn between tauren tank druid and a resto shammy. What race would be great? Are alch and herb fine profs to roll with either?
---
Sure, but blizzard has not told you for sure at releases layers will be 3k pop. They have not said that. So you literally are putting words in their mouths. 
---
I don't claim to know blizzard's plans for launch layer size because they have not told us them. It maybe similar to vanilla pop caps. All i know is i am not the person claiming blizzard said something that they did not. They didn't say layer sizes will always stay the same, they didn't say what they would be off the bat, they didn't even definitively say the size they are planning on (however, have offered a few answers such as vanilla sized layers and tossed out some numbers.)
---
And while the world maybe round where you come from, where i come from it is a spheroid. Heck even the flat earthers think its round :P
---
If it's anything like RP realms in retail, it might have less sharding/layering problems. I don't think they addressed this being the case yet for Classic.
---
Glad to hear that about the item and named npc spawns. That was the worst part about Private server levelling
---
That sounds...terrible.  Multiple world boss spawns in different layers, I'm being trolled right?
---
People love to shit on blizzard but seriously...
---
-They listened to us and CREATED CLASSIC WOW you ungreatful bastards
---
-They are using a 1.12 based client WITH progressive patching AND itemization, just like we asked for
---
-They gave US, EU, &amp; Oceanic servers just like we asked for
---
-They ran multiple beta and stress tests just like we asked for
---
-They gave us a release date and stuck to it just like we asked for
---
-They only require a sub and no purchase just like we asked for
---
-No tokens just like we asked for
---
-No cash shop, just like we asked for
---
The list could go on. There are about a million ways they could have monetized this release for maximum profits but they didn't. MANY lesser companies would have, just to milk a cash cow.

I know many of us here are super humbled and greatful for what they've done, but I see so much bitching and whining, crying and complaining. Like children, the doomsdayers saying everything is messed up, leeway wasn't in original vanilla, give us spell batching, oh wait, not actual spell batching as it was, but like this instead. Wait, these DRs shouldn't be shared even though they were in vanilla. Waaah waaah pets are bugged in the beta, WhY hAvEnt wE gOTten ReaLMlIsTS YeT?!?!?
---
This community in large part is awesome, but there are some that really need to grow up and appreciate what blizzard has done for us.

racial language at full effect.
---
If you can take them by surprise, sure.
---
If not, you will end up in a choke point in the tunnel towards tinker town.
---
The stress tests were as bad as the picture if not worse. Even with layering you're still competing against 3,000 people per layer. That means 3,000 people in one zone at launch. Good luck tagging those mobs.
---
Man, that intro is what started it all for me. The was and still is a magic to that video, I love it. Ironforge also has a lot of nostalgia for me.
---
I was watching every video possible on priest, and I was sold. But now, after watch Payos rogue videos, I feel like that might be more my style.
---
it's 3:58 for the whole thing (walking to sentinel hill + fp) OP just messed up and worded it badly
---
I think I slightly prefer the fp method since you can go afk for a min, but i guess it doesn't make a big diff
---
This is such an exaggeration it's insane
---
I remember scrolling all way in and pointing cam at ground so it wouldnt cause fps drop and ruin the rotation, was a rogue in vanilla
---
Lets just hope Classic doesn't crash and burn.
---
go read guides on improv comedy. Same rules apply in RP, but less funny and more , , anything
---
Why not?
---
Read some guides or watch videos about improv comedy. It's very much the same skillset for RP, just it gets more serious sometimes.
---
Being enhancement is like being a swinger. You don't tell the world unless there's fame and fortune to be made. Otherwise, you just tell your friends so they'll stop asking why your place always smells like lube whenever they come over and why the mattress in the guest room is twice the size of the one in your own bedroom.
---
Fuck yes, I hope so
---
He's made over an hour of videos on the topic describing the contents of the guide, how it works and why it's beneficial. What more can he do?
---
Blizzard probably truly has no fucking idea what’s going to happen.
---
That's a fun idea. Reckon it's possible to run the whole map like this? Or just too many deaths?
---
I didn't play most of Mists. Nothing about it felt like WoW to me. Warlords was pretty meh all around, and Legion killed it for me with the stupid weapon system and how unfriendly it was for alts in general.
---
If it’s any consolation, Hallows End is the best even and is in the game...
---
Troll for resto shaman, alch and herb is great on resto sham since you have less use of engineer then others and no bis item from a crafting profession.
---
Myself i'm going shaman, been my main through everything WoW thrown at me so would just feel weird playing anything else, highly recommend! Also if you're getting into raiding, resto shams are always needed and you can have quiet a few of them in your group, druid tank not so much, while you could probably tank almost every vanilla boss not many will take you over a warrior when they just do it more easily
---
As an orc the only class I legitimately feared was boomkins.  Between Windfury, Purge, and Earth shock you make short work of cloth wearers if you can get close enough to land some hits.  Spend anything in the resto tree and you can usually outlast other melee classes, though warriors with good gear can be a problem.
---
&gt; Also it's going to be very hard to pull people away from Classic WoW now - it's a game that will have 85% of things right and a community behind it already.
---
I'm not so sure about this.  As great as Classic is, people are already very divided on what they want Blizzard to do after Naxx.  They can't please everyone there- whether they stay on 1.12 forever, move on to BC, or develop Classic Plus, some players will be disappointed.  And there's probably a lot of players who would just want something new but similar after finishing all the content they wanted to see.
---
Sure, I do expect Classic to keep a solid population for a long time, but the vanilla content rollout will be a big high point.  After that there will probably be some level of dropoff that Pantheon's in a good place to benefit from.  I know I'll be checking it out, even found a guild that'll be playing both Classic and Pantheon.
---
Bloodlust in vanilla is a 30 second haste buff, single target.
---
If for whatever reason the 31 ret talent was this Paladins would basically be the physical support alternative to disc priest's power infusion. They would speed 20 into holy for illumination and 31 into ret for buffing the tank/melee, and not themselves.
---
Servers in WotLK only held ~3k concurrent users. Classic servers hold ~10k concurrent users after Layering is gone and infinite concurrent users before then.
---
You know you're excited for classic when your wife's boyfriend says he'll take care of her during classic launch.
---
Would you recommend a RP-PVP server then?
---
Screw that make it a central server!
---
Fuck my back is feeling good after that, holy shit.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room
---
I hope not wow succes put the focus on the mmo genre, allow it for more games but, most of them were lazy and try to copy wow... in addition the will to make new people play thoses type of games lead to more casual games (bfa).
---
Vanilla follow the same concept, to appeal more people he is less "hardcore" than most of his predecessor.
---
I came from DAOC the simple fact of drinking/eating was shocking to me, old mmo don't encourage solo content at all..
---
Yeah, I knew warriors would be an issue. Disarm me and then I die in the next 8 seconds probably. On my paladin, I never really feared enhancement at all, but the utility they had was so nice. Just being offensive rather than defensive always seemed like a plus.
---
"Layering is going away"
---
Also his video on trolls vs undead is biased bullshit. :)
---
Just about every paladin I encountered in the world had to bubble hearth.  Warriors are really only a problem if they have enough gear to 2 shot you.  Otherwise you'll probably outlast them in a slugfest.
---
This not only solidified my server, but also my class and faction. I really wanted to go horde, but something about healing as a night elf druid on a rppvp server sounds right.....
---
undead mage lowkey sounds cool tho too damn.
---
wow, super quick reply. thanks sm
---
Yes, why wouldn't it? It's a Priest spell in the Shadow school that deals damage. Blackout gives your Shadow damage spells a chance to stun the target for 3 sec. It also procs Shadow Weaving and benefits from all the other talents.
---
So, I have devolved into an inebriated slob the past few years after change jobs. I made it 3:30 into it and had to stop. BUT, I bookmarked this and will try and do this every day. Even if I only do half this week, I will make it to doing it all the way through every day, very soon.
---
Thanks for the video.
---
Hell yes. There is raiding &amp; pvp guilds there. It just has other things normal servers dont have
---
&gt; Or am I missing something here?
---
Layers.
---
My mistake then
---
This is really good to know. I dont usually take myself too seriously, which sounds like it could get me in trouble.
---
I'm in the same boat. Planning to go primarily Horde, so it won't be a problem at first, but I'm hoping things go well enough they eventually add a second realm somewhere down the line.
---
Fair enough.
---
Awww your account got suspended. So sad. 
---
Is there an addon that's already compatible that will show XP/hour?
---
I wasn't sure Shadowguard procced off of more than attacks considering the tooltip says melee and ranged attacks, not spells.
---
Is the 10k target something Blizzard has mentioned?
---
Yes, mage master class represent! Those poor warriors will hate life even more when we roll up on them! =D
---
You must not have been playing blizzard games very long lol. They also specifically promised they’d never bring back Rank 14 titles in retail, way back when. Then they gave them out for winning BGs a couple years later :)
---
I couldn't really tell, and with what is available I definitely can't, but is this guide for speed leveling or will it factor in gaining rep and being a complete package by the time you hit 60?
---
Yeah, because Blizzard really depended on those Private Server bootleggers to tell them how to make Classic a success...
---
1  Holy paladin is both easier and harder to gear.  Easier because they can use any armor type so they can minmax in ways other classes cannot.  Harder because their sets are not good for raid healing have too many useless offensive stats.  The sets are actually quite good for pvp healing, so that is quite nice.  Raw HPS priest should be ahead early MC and on any heavy aoe fight.  Paladins scale at a bonkers rate with high +healing so will eventually overtake priests in raw HPS.  
---
2  Dwarf is noticeably better for holy in pvp.  One of the counters to blessing of protection is blind, stoneform can clear it.  Also some poisions in vanilla stack per instance applied making dispell through the poisons quite difficult.  Using stormform to get a viper or mind numbing poison is very good.  Paladins high armor means melee struggle to take them down, increasing the value of dots that go through armor mitigation in group play where you might get focused by multiple melee at once stoneform is very noticeable increase in survival.  
---
Human perception is nice, but human is already the most played race on alliance.  If you are expecting a rogue, someone nearby will almost always have perception.  Also perception is maybe worst on paladin as you are basically the least vulnerable class to rogue, if you expect a sap just prebuff sacrifice on nearby allies, if they go to kill you, you are already a tank.  Last you have only 1 real ranged ability in holy shock on a 30sec CD, even seeing a rogue with perception can be difficult to hit them with anything.  Human rep bonus is nice for pvp reps, but practically all of the pvp gear for paladin is ret focused.  Offhand from AV is one exception, and that is only useful in pve not pvp.  Ideal gear set you will have as little spirit as possible, so human spirit is not very good, and weapon bonus is only useful for doing damage in raid, it has a tiny effect in pvp.  That being said, if you want to main ret, Human is basically must because the weapon skill has the potential to be massive in raid dps scenarios, something I would not advocate.  
---
All three classes typically get into raids just fine.  Druids are the least desirable, but are often the least played.  A typical guild will run 4-6 paladins and a similar maybe slightly larger number of priests.  If you are dedicated holy spec you should have absolutely no issue finding a guild on paladin.  Priest on horde is more desirable because they are the only dispellers, and early on there are several fights that are dispel based.  
---
All three compliment a warlock somewhat.  Priest/paladin + warlock are both top teir duoing comps.  Priest would level as shadow and provide some off healing and 15% damage from shadow weaving, but the priest would lose some killing blows and lose spirit tap efficiency.  Paladin has hidden increased value with a warlock because you can buff both the warlock and his pet with your powerful blessings.  You could play with righteous fury on and kinda offtank so the warlock can play more aggressively, or you could play more as a healer hybrid and push up his efficiency.  Druid might stuggle a bit to be of a help because healing is quite mana consuming as a leveling druid is without shapeshifting talents or much int from gear yet.  Maybe better to level on druid as bear, but it would be a slightly worse version of paladin.  It would still be helpful, just maybe not as much as the others.
---
Yeah, so basically I’ll be cheesin it for a long while. It’ll take a good bit of time before anyone’s rolling in that.
---
Progressive itemization will not be in Classic
---
Undead Rogue.
---
I don't believe there's another option :p
---
Typical alliance smooth brain.
---
Some thoughts/tips that you might already know:
---
Tight hamstrings is perhaps the priority, so I would start whatever routine with good-mornings like they do in the video.
---
Push-ups are great and squats or (assisted) pistols. Greatest bang for the buck. Pull-ups would complement if you have access to them. Might also add quick assisted handstand to get your blood flowing and shake-up your system before going back to your computer.
---
Salty that twitch is bad? No, more like highly amused
---
Any news for EU?
---
Well a fair few Aussies have even been playing private servers for the last 5 years on EU servers with 340ms+ and still doing fine in high end PvE/PvP. Vanilla WoW just isn't a game where it matters that much.
---
Imagine if the big streamers decided to roll on this realm lol
---
I'm almost positive that was from the Silverhand launch. It's a 2 month long server with all raids unlocked. A kind of final hoorah and rush before classic.
---
That’s an excellent point and I’ll be sure to do that, thanks mate
---
EU was confirmed for RPPvP too.
---
Learn to harmstring kite, vet!
---
Who knows how much blizzard depended on them. But they brought them in for a reason. Now that could only be for Community advertising, or it could have been for more. Replaying MMO content and what it does to a community of players is not something blizzard has experience with.
---
You're out of pocket, dude. Just admit you made a mistake. It was very clear what he was referring to.
---
Ya and if you can convince someone to hook you up with that cthun axe that has a chance on hit to fear someone for 3 seconds you can basically cheese people for eternity. Makes for some hilarious PvP vids.
---
If there was never more than 3,5k total players on a single realm in vanilla they would've needed 2,2k servers by the time TBC came out. Guess what, they didn't have anywhere close to that.
---
This is the best idea I've ever heard regarding a Classic+ option. Thank you for being a voice of reason.
---
And killing this will actually give you a random green. \*queue desolace theme\* :\`(
---
[It's not rocket surgery](https://i.imgur.com/NnTTqz4.png)
---
No. You can talk normal.
---
Well first I have to convince myself to do a 40 man raid again xD
---
For the mounnt?  Iirc, undead cannot ride kodos.  Maybe i'm wrong but there are some race limitations on certain mounts.
---
Can you name one and provide proof of their PVP prowess and success?
---
How did you possibly come to that conclusion? The word "forced" wasn't even used, nor did they say anything about how a potential TBC or WOTLK release would be handled. And this executive is from China. Jesus.
---
+1 wondering too
---
Multiboxing perhaps?
---
U dont have to be a big time roleplayer. Just have faction pride and go hunting the other faction in the world alot.
---
&gt; move my addons into the new folder and it should be good
---
No. They need to be the addons specifically for classic. They're not universal. If you just forklift retail addons to classic, they won't work.
---
Level 60 Chinese content?  Gold farmers confirmed.
---
Layering would like to have a word with you
---
Hehe : ) I know it's a heresy, but I've leveled the priest slow way for 3 times on private servers, so I thought why not rush it once to test myself. And I'll be on a PvE server so no mind control madness expected.
---
Why does this sound like it was written by an orc traitor.
---
Sent you a discord add
---
As someone who played on rp-pvp. The servers have everything. Raiding guilds, world pvp guilds, pvp
---
??
---
Well yeah I knew that I just meant the addons I had downloaded for classic already
---
Every guild I ever joined was because they were spamming trade chat.  I've raided damn near everything.
---
You have a virtual competition. May the best man win. 
---
The other one has a nice advantage ingame so you need to convince her irl.
---
Orc Warrior Solo route steps 13-17 are wrong. You already die and rez at Crossroads at the end of step 12, so step 18 should immediately follow.
---
In terms of user friendliness, there are too many icons overlaid. At a glance, I cannot see where to go. For steps happening on the same icon, just re-use it. There is no need to have icons 7, 8, and 9 overlay each other.
---
Am I the only one who finds this weird meme obsession with RPPvP bizarre? You guys don’t even intend to actually RP do you? 
---
It’s like this collective demand brewed up out of nowhere and became a point of principle for the community that Blizzard just *has* to do this and listen to us. I don’t think I ever heard a word about RP PvP during vanilla days up until people realized there’s a chance we might not get one and then it became a huge petition brigade and a cause for everyone to get behind. 
---
Buts that’s none of my business... *sips tea*
---
I definitely would get ganked less on my Tauren vs my undead
---
so what you guys are saying is roll druid
---
&gt; The naming policy
---
What *is* the naming policy please friend?
---
Remember how everyone complained about their little niche aspect that they wanted? Even though blizzard listened to the community and delivered, but they kept catering to everything until we had retail?
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
?
---
Tell them your dead ? Might work getting out of using a mic
---
I mean they did have classic servers first
---
You already have Classic installed. Now you just wait. You'll be able to play for a day starting in ~12.5 hours, but all those characters get deleted.
---
The version you are talking about is somewhat similar (in terms of buttons n stuff). It is just the design that's different. But yea, they are hard to come by.
---
I luckily have another Razer Naga Molten, completely new. Bought it 2 years ago in an hardware store, where they had it on sale (on last piece). Got lucky that day :D Hope I survive for the next few years with them :D
---
Well to be honest there is a risk in setting up niche Realms, they may become very empty in 4 months. So it's not just about list ning but weighing potential problems in the future.
---
Apparently OP doesn't know Blizzard are implementing layering.
---
Hey thanks for explaining it for me! As goofy as a Dwarf using a bow might look I guess I’ll suck it up lol, better than being a male NE imo
---
Whelp, now I know which server I'm playing on. Fucking awesome move.
---
I can't wait for Mists of Pandaria Classic. It's the only expansion I really missed.
---
Lol not me some crazy people. I hope to be 60 in a month or so.
---
It's worth it, purely for the naming policy.
---
The sort of congenital brain defects that typically afflict griefers make them almost utterly incapable of selecting a name that complies with the guidelines. 
---
The baby rage that ensues as you get them name changed makes up for the annoyance that led up to the reporting of them. And if it happens to much they get to take vacations of increasing duration, or toddle off to a more suitable habitat.
---
2h leveling is not worth it due to never having the hit
---
I remember a long long quest i did with a couple of other alliance members. We went EVERYWHERE to complete the quest. An epic fun from lvl 60 undead horde, had to fight off a group that was around our lvl too that we surprised along our route. It was awesome. But I was so glad to go back to Ironforge once we completed it; got a nice weapon out of it too.
---
Not convincing at all.
---
The only con is that endgame raids 100% revolve around healing. Pretty much all of your time at max level is focused on making your heals better - farming gear, consumables, etc. all for healing.
---
Aside from that, Shaman are amazing. Great at soloing, the best offensive hybrid in PvP, strong DPS for dungeons, and you can even tank dungeons if you really want to. I went Shaman in actual Vanilla and it was a lot of fun. This time around, I'm going Druid because I need to play a tank and Druid is the closest class to Shaman without actually being a Shaman. But I'm going to miss destroying people with Chain Lightning.
---
He is bipolar, there is some clip where he talks about it. Thata why he coud play for 20 hours a day and then crash and be gone for weeks.
---
Someone made a guide for "Exploration and Fitch&amp;deliver Quest" which got him to lvl 10 in 4 hours.
---
https://youtu.be/O9_qYqNAXf8
---
With paid option you can usually expect a certain level of quality. Not always but usually.
---
I learned a long time ago that paying someone for their work, even when not required, is a good thing to do.
---
And their free sample was just the perfect format and style/quality for me to use (which the pserver testing proved).
---
Everyone is gonna have shit gear, if you don't slack and fall behind after release, you shouldn't have any problems even when you play a gear dependant class and shadowpriest doesn't need that much to hold his own. 
---
Since melee's won't have any decent weapons at the beginning, you won't die too fast.
---
And once you have gear, shadowpriest imho is one of the best specs for pvp.
---
Current retail is one emotional investment of mine. Classic will be another. They aren't mutually exclusive for me.
---
Patrick!
---
I'll always go out of my way to gank a night elf hunter
---
he's taking his sweet 1-2 seconds to switch bars and select his spells while standing still and the other guys still don't seem to manage to get him in target xDDD
---
Dumb post is dumb.
---
Well to be honest it is a risk/reward kind of decision to add niche servers. The players picking RP-PvP may end up in a ghost-town being very frustrated that "Blizzard let this happen".
---
Lol I suppose my post hit close to home for this one.
---
Yes, you are absolutely right that we have servers (Some looooong before nostalrius, but yes they do get to take a bulk of the credit) because of nost and because of the community. That is what served as a catalyst for classic.
---
But you're forgetting one important fact.
---
Blizzard didn't have to make it. In fact, for years they explicitly said they would not make it, but they know what it means to admit you are wrong when faced with proof, eat a slice of humble pie, and deliver an awesome product.
---
Blizzard of yore was an absolute powerhouse of a development company. The created numerous awesome games. I've been playing their games since the lost Vikings, so yes, they've earned a bit of loyalty. But Diablo 3 was garbage, as is hots, and modern wow is no longer a game I enjoy so I cancelled my subscription in cata. 
---
They certainly aren't perfect, but they've earned the benefit of the doubt.
---
Your post is so comically cynical and pessimistic that I'm wondering why you're even here.
---
Tell me the name of your character and the realm you want to play on and I will reserve it for you... I swear
---
Yeah I know, but I already have enough now :) Quite happy with the Qpad actually, didn't know they still existed when I saw the mouse and it's actually one of the most comfy I've used.
---
Should open properly if it's not bugged.
---
i totally understand this is not viable for retail players
---
if anyone plans to play retail in the future its better just sticking with your old account 
---
ive personally not played the last 2 expansions so i decided to just start fresh for a bunch of reasons
---
I play on his server on live and the most that's ever affected me is people assume I'm a fan of his sometimes in pugs because I'm a fury warrior on his realm. I see him AFK in town sometimes and there's never anyone swarming him.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJNVCOToAr8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJNVCOToAr8)
---
Wish I had recorded the entire run! This is about all I have of it.
---
Damn this can only be true since I literally never play anywhere else. Will do something else before I hop worlds.
---
No, should be able to download as of last week for everyone.
---
Well, we've got RP-PvP for Europe so that's atleast 8 servers in EU.
---
English PvP, PvE, RP and RP-PvP
---
German PvP and PvE
---
French PvP and PvE
---
Only problem with that is that it doesn't switch to the tab automatically.
---
Been playing off Na servers since launch, 240ms to 300ms sucked but you got used to it, but yeh not ideal, I thought there was going to be an oceanic server for us or is it that we aren't getting an Rp pvp realm for Oceanic?
---
I really don’t see the allure of playing wow with your gf if she’s a total noob unless you are one too lol
---
It got confirmed today.
---
stress test will be live later today. so you have a chance to make the same exlerience on blizz servers :D
---
i think ill pass on 300+ ms 
---
we could play around it back then but im looking forward to trying classic on double digit ping
---
dont let them discourage you. Back in the day they had 40 priests kill onyxia. Or 40 druids kill onyxia. Just find a more laid back guild and they will let you. Will they let more than a few people? Probably not.
---
I believe you’re confusing 2H with dual wielding.
---
2h≠dw
---
Just wait until he invites her to his Discord server. That accent is going to win her over. She might pretend to play Horde casually with you, but when your focus is entirely lost in a raid, she's gonna swap over and play that Dwarf's fiddle.
---
We rock that 2.5 set and it looks damn good too
---
I agree. High-end graphics are approaching the uncanny-valley which I think is one of the reasons many are scaling back now into cartoony-looking graphics (that and its less resource-heavy).
---
lol ye, best way if you're 2-3 players playing together is just to run away and  start killing mobs in the next area.
---
The real concern is that nich realms will be ghost-towns in the future. If that was not an issue Blizz would add every type of server in every language...
---
Technically correct
---
oh and I didn't meant you in particular. I meant if anyone wanted to play both they had to pay twice. Could have worded that differently.
---
If you average 2 silver per skin attempt (is this high?) you need 50 attempts to get 1 gold; that multiply by 9 then multiplied by 3 seconds and divided by 60 will be 45 minutes to get 9 gold. If someone can give me the average of copper/silver per skinning attempt I can recalculate it.
---
nice man
---
yeah like not sure why all the hate i just want to start fresh
---
tbh i would not have complained if they just restored my level 60 characters and let me continue from there but if i need to start from scratch im starting totally new 
---
cant wait
---
They're not saying that they'll only give 6 to 8 hours though.. they're saying reaching level 15 would only take that long as in 24 hours is more than enough
---
Monitoring the stress test is part of their job which is why it is taking place during their working hours. My guess is they close it on Friday when they’re wrapping up work for the week maybe around 3 PST.
---
Wait, so do we hate or love Blizzard now?
---
Nothing but facts here
---
Just play on an oceanic PvP server? Why would you play on NA servers just for the RP tag.
---
That’s you. I want classic plus
---
Of course, dude. In fact, you're probably more likely to get a response from people because we RP-PvPers are often drooling at the mouth to make some good old fashioned WPvP battles happen. The server I'm from (Emerald Dream) has quite a few people that are famous because of how ruthlessly they gank the opposite faction.
---
As an aside, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW00yW-kif8 Here's a fight I was a part of Horde-side on Emerald Dream back in MoP when the WPvP scene there was still healthy. I ended up there because some people in Arathi were calling nearby zones for aid against the Alliance and my small guild just so happened to be RPing in the town outside of SFK.
---
The best advice I could give is to not go out of your way to try and ruin RP events that guilds are hosting. You'll probably get PvPed away anyway if it's in a contested zone, but the thing about RPPvP is that the RP side of it breathes life into the WPvP side of it. So running up to people in uncontested territory to spam their chat while they're not flagging up to fight you is generally frowned upon.
---
until you realize the biggest streamers rolled there and their thousands of followers came with them.
---
Yo yo I told you that shit was gonna happen one day, everyone's like we trust everyone
---
Yikes does it hurt being this mentally handicapped?
---
Best answer for sure.
---
yeah certainly not worth if you plan to dabble in retail
---
i just want to avoid any temptation to play classic, even if they bring out some good expansion 
---
i want to stick to classic and if not classic some total different game
---
If she likes the game she can consider the time played as an activity you did together and she might be less annoyed when you play alone.
---
Plus most men like it when we can look smarter, so explaining in game shit to her actually feels kind of good.
---
Better xp
---
I love the effort you put in it but clicking through every quest is just a pain and it means you constantly need to switch between your screen where you play WoW on and the site.
---
Like other poster says it why would you follow this one instead of Joana's one? Looks to me you tried to reinvent the wheel and you didn't do it good.  
---
So some suggestions:
---
1. Get a column on the left where you can select directly race/class and don't have to have to select them in 2 separate pages.
---
2.  You show only complete this or that quest but there are quite some quests you finish over a longer period of time and kill creature x or y when you see it.
---
3. How does the progress get saved? Is that something that is only done when you use an account on your site?  
---
I mean once I'm level 20 I don't want to do the whole select race/class and go through the whole list again?
---
4. So other suggestion in a column on the left show area with (lvl 1-5) or something behind or just any sort of better navigation.  
---
If I follow your leveling guide and login the next day I only want to look at the zone I'am in and the level I am and then I want to be able to directly select  that part of your guide where I am.
---
5. If you follow the guide with a group of 3 you should make a  good clarification what quest are class quests.  
---
Cause now you sometimes have a full screen of quests and hand ins and you have a hard time to understand which quest is for you.  
---
All in all it just is not that good and there are other sites who have done a much better job and is much easier to use. So if you are not able to make it easier to navigate to the part on the quest you are i don't see anyone using it.
---
This is false. Base melee ap is what your char has at lvl 60 without any gear/buffs etc
---
So you'll be on this realm with the big streamers and all their followers?
---
Careful, he gave you wrong information
---
This is. Great
---
Nice try blizzard
---
The important thing to understand is that your gear matters more than your talents in Classic. Your damage is going to be shit in healing gear. And given the mana cost of going into cat form, there isn't ever really a reason for a healing Druid to start doing damage. It's better to use any extra mana to blanket people with HoTs.
---
Instead, you keep multiple sets of gear and swap them in depending on the fight. On my private server Feral Druid, I had at least 3 full sets of gear on me at all times: a pure mitigation set (agility leather with extra bonus armor), a pure healing set (mostly cloth), and a hybrid set (leather with lots of intellect and a mix of other stats - mostly PvP gear and T0.5). I almost always wore the hybrid gear for trash and then swapped to the mitigation or healing set for bosses depending on my role for that boss. I would also wear the hybrid set on certain bosses like Lucifron, which is a fight where I started out tanking and then helped decurse after my mob dies.
---
It's more work to play a hybrid. You have to get two sets of gear enchanted and you have to know more about the game than your average player in order to actually fill multiple roles. But it can definitely be done.
---
There's no plate before 40.
---
Didnt Navak as a warrior get close to if not the fastest 1-30 on the beta? Pretty sure i read that.
---
Thex roleplay is the best roleplay.
---
Fun fact: having no interest in human anatomy meant the first time I saw the word hamstring was in WoW. I thought to myself "that's a weird word, but whatever."
---
I tested it today. It takes approximately 40 minutes and you can grab flights paths on the way. If things work out you should have a couple deaths in wetlands.
---
Well I used to play mage and rogue too. Rogue was a lot of fun I just wasn’t good at the class and I’m tempted to go back. I’m also tempted to roll Druid because it’s one of the only classes I’ve never played.
---
80% of my playtime in Standard WoW has been with healers. Hundreds of hours of healing, pretty much every class. The rest 20%? Vengeance Demon Hunter tanking.
---
This ends now. I'm thinking of playing a Rogue in Classic, or a Survival Hunter.
---
Can anyone, please, give me a detailed rundown of all 3 Rogue specs and how a Survival Hunter plays? I enjoy complex classes and playstyles.
---
No it isn't: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/2
---
Seriously, lol. I’m not even talking in a negative light about pservers, just stating facts
---
Man, this image still gives me that feeling of seeing that cinematic for the first time. Everything looked beautiful
---
A shaman is most valuable to pve groups as a healer. Both 5-mans and raids. Ele is a phenomenal pvp spec though.
---
Enhance is for leveling. It's the worst pve dps spec besides lolret amd it's garbage in pvp because you will never get in range to actually hit anyone.
---
**Alliance-EU-PvE Server Dead Gnome Society** 
---
Looking for additional members.  
---
**Who are we?** 
---
We are a bunch of people that are more focused on the social than rushing to lvl 60. So dont expect server first or anything. Atm we are around 40, all Danes, but all nationalities are welcome. However, someone may write in Danish in the general Discord, and maybe guildchat, but our raid language will be English. Most of us have kids, meaning that the main play time will be from 19-20 Cest.  
---
**What about my precious loot?** 
---
We are using Loot council, so you are rewarded for participation and activity, even if you can only raid 1 time a week, you will still get loot. 
---
**But when are we going on adventures?** 
---
Nothing about raid times have been settled yet. But an estimated start time will be around 20.  
---
**Can I join?/What are we looking for.** 
---
Sure! We welcome all people that wants to have fun.  And the class is up to you.
---
We are also on the lookout for class leaders.  
---
Does this sound like something for you? 
---
Then come join our discord

Warriors are seriously terrible at soloing. I've been dicking around with one on a private server before Classic launches and it's just awful. 
---
The only chance you have is to jump people and kill them before they kill you. Easier said than done on a class that can't stealth or go invisible.
---
well they just announced recently that they gonna add an  RP-PVP realm in North America  for WoW Classic
---
Spirit tap takes great advantage of spirit.
---
More like they literally expect 90% of players to leave the game before the end of phase 1.
---
just rp on the oce pvp server lul
---
oh thanks for the heads up. I was only planning on getting a subscription once classic goes live but it's worth considering.
---
I like how they show you a level 60 dungeon with a warrior with thunderfury! Thats what we are all going to be doing at 60!
---
The best tip I can give, that helped me out a lot, is to focus your stats on Spirit while leveling a Warrior. This at least decreases downtime by a metric ton. Also, Private Servers were harder iirc.
---
I think being a low 40's mage and playing wsg until the turnings lvled me SEVERAL levels, maybe from 42 to 48, really ironed out some of these blatant mistakes, god I miss being a lvl 46 UD frost mage in wsg just being **insanely aggro** and pushing into groups of 3 enemies after every respawn. As far as I was concerned there was no flag in wsg, and no nodes in arathi basin, there was only damage dealt, killing blows, and honor gained.
---
Go druid bro and if you're lucky you can find a guild who will let you play dps!
---
Luckily you didn’t make this post then. I’m not talking hardcore raid progression. I’m talking casual have a beer and raid a little teams. I’m sure casting a few heals and survivability amongst some buffs and mediocre dps wouldn’t be to bad to a guild having fun with the main core group all set up. Yeah the first few months people will be focused on progression but I’m talking long term when a team is already decent geared and just need fill in spots.
---
Yeah, but it's no different with any of the other servers. Except for Germany and Russia but hopefully all the people in those two countries who don't speak English will roll on those servers anyway.
---
Thanks, Oprah.
---
Man, I had a ninja looter legit break my heart, so I still don't understand this stuff.
---
Stretching during flight paths!! Thanks
---
I want rank 10, would love to go higher but as a warlock there is no real reason to because the epic gear is pretty sad. 
---
I'm a completionist so I'd like to have every recipe from engineering/alchemy and the secondary professions. 
---
I kinda want the Scarab Lord thing but again, the reward is pretty mediocre and I still think the dreadsteed is the coolest mount in the game, even by BFA although the meatwagon is close. I still will complete the chain though because it's really epic, but I'll do it after AQ is open so I don't have to grind rep like crazy.
---
If I get serious with healing on my druid alt then I might do the questline there instead for the dagger.
---
Spanish? Roll Troll
---
French? Roll Gnome
---
etcetc
---
No no quite the opposite. Druid bad, cant you read. 
---
^Im ^trying ^to ^help ^you ^guys out. ^Get that ^sweet druid loot.

Yeah sure let me just abandon my 15 year old account.

The items for the crashed gnome inoch modan a cursed. On p servers they had long respawn and everybody was doing that quest and theres 3 of them.

Drops off Viscous Fallout in Gnomeregan.  Easily farmable.

There is genuinely not a big difference in DPS between all of the classes besides Mage pulling far, far ahead of everything.

Hi, /u/Askyl

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cnhl40/thanks_everyone_who_helped_our_community/). 
---
Actually you can..
---
Make sure your battle.net and all wow client is closed.
---
Open your WoW folder, followed by the _classic_ folder, then into the WTF folder. Open Config.wtf with notepad or any text editor.
---
Search for "SET textLocale" and set it to "itIT" *keep note of your default to change back*
---
Save the file and close it. then open WoW and create your Poopknife.
---
Close your game client and go back in and change your "textLocale" back to your default.
---
Enjoy being poopknife until someone reports you for such an offensive name.
---
Well, there are plenty of otpions, but I can give you a spec example of each archetype:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/505001-0522-052031512203151 - classic deep ret pvp
---
You can also trade the hit talent for more parry, if you don't need it. This the classic offensively oriented pvp build, it provides a high burst and is fairly reliable, also quite versatile as you get focus, guardians favor and consecration allowing you to support quite decently. But it lacks the defensive tools of control or holy reck.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/-0532410003-052051512203151 - deep ret control
---
This spec sacrifices the holy talents in order to get to get improved hammer of justice. It's the best control spec as oyu have repentance as well as a 35/45 sec cd hammer of justice. It lacks a bit of dmg, due to no divine strength and no consecration is a problem for flag defense.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/-0532510003105-05203151220311 - Ret reck
---
This the most powerful offensive spec, but also the hardest to execute. You have less control than the former two specs and also less reliable damage due to no vengeance. If you manage to get a full reckbomb off, it's bascially a guaranteed oneshot. This is a high risk, high reward spec, which needs good gear to work at all and is likely more of a meme spec due to the difficulty of getting a full reckbomb with this spec. Building up a reckbomb requires you to not attack and this spec is nearly no threat at all if it doesn't attack.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/50503102501-0532510003105 - Holy reck
---
The other reckoning spec with no points in retirbution. The 4 left-over points can be distributed after your preference: divine int (little more mana), imp sor (little more dmg on sor), imp loh (less cd), lasting judgement (for raid support), 3/3 conc aura (for pvp support) and bosanc (for raid suppport) are all viable choices.
---
This is mostly healer spec, but also great offensively, if you get attacked. Building a full reck bomb up is easy, as you are a threat with your healing and your dmg without reckbomb is not that great. A full reckbomb however will do a nice chunk of 3-4k dmg.
---
Those are the 4 archetypes of offensive paladin pvp, well 3.5, holy reck is more a hybrid between the defensive and offensive paladin.
---
And what about all the Spanish and Italian players that don't speak English?
---
2 factor authentication...
---
what if i want to roleplay as a ninja?
---
RP is not mandatory. As long as you don't have an immersion breaking name, you'll be fine. Especially on RP-PvP compared to PvE, you will probably not even have a problem finding a guild that doesn't really "roleplay".
---
With that said, casually roleplaying is _really_ easy when you build the habit, and in my (personal; anecdotal) experience, 100% of people who are genuinely interested in RPGs find themselves enjoying traditional roleplay (_i.e. acting_) when they've pushed through their inhibition.
---
If you're at all interested in dabbling in roleplay, [here's my basic RP advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c9vmqj/an_ode_to_rppvp_servers/et4aouz/), which I provided to a poster with similar sentiment. I come from a D&amp;D background, so full roleplay is natural for me, but I've also ran for a lot of new players who are trepidatious. RPing in an MMO is actually a lot easier, because you don't have any of the social pressure (you and the people you interact with will never know each other unless you opt into it), and you have _time_ to process your response.
---
I pose that you will find yourself making fast friends with light roleplay; it's hardly something steeped in great expectations.
---
For anyone reading this, I'll be rolling Alliance on whatever the NA RP-PvP server is. If you want someone to play with, and maybe guide you in the joy of roleplay, feel free to send me a DM.
---
Internet speed isn't usually that important since games don't take up enormous amounts of data..  
---
You will be fine as long as you pick a server in your region
---
Sir, what about druid? I want to play either hunter or druid for the world pvp. I know that hunter is alot scarier for people to play against but I kinda want to be a player that is hard to kill and annoying. Hunter fits this but does druid also have more survivalbility? I don't care if I don't have massive damage numbers, but the idea of stalling a fight and slowly whittling down opponents or escaping when ganked really intrigues me.
---
&gt; blizzard has not told you for sure at releases layers will be 3k pop 
---
Yes, they have:
---
*"Imagine a tray with an empty glass. The tray is a single server in WoW Classic. The empty glass is a layer. When you log into the game on launch day, you’ll be with a flood other players: the water that we’re going to pour into the glass. Once the glass is full, we add another empty glass and start filling it up with water, or players, too. Each new glass is a new layer that consists of two to three thousand players — which means any single server could handle tens of thousands of players at the same time but without all of them being crowded into the same place in-game. The only way to see players from another layer is to group up with them —otherwise they don’t interact. "*
---
Yes, and since your typical griefer is constitutionally incapable of abiding by the naming conventions, you get to experience the unparalleled joy of reporting them for violating it, for the third time.
---
The satisfaction of their baby rage the first two times is fulfilling, but watching them get suspended, and then todlde off to a more suitable habitat as it sinks in that they aren't welcome is unparalleled. 
---
Of course, this depends on blizzard actually enforcing the policy, and they reaaaaaaaaly seem to hate the idea of paying GM's and CS staff, so we will see how it goes this time.
---
So after looking some documentation and listening to guides, I've come up with what could be the most useful/viable options as a spec for Frost Mage in PvP (my intention is to raid casually here and there, but not a priority: my guild is aware of that already and have granted my a spot nevertheless) 
---
The first spec would be the one in the picture.
---
And the second one would be taking out the 2 piercing ice points and put one in Elemental Precision and the other one in Frost Warding
---
Every melee is fucked in pvp without gear, except for stunlock rogues, if they get their full rotation off. Without gear, you take a quarter of your health from a single spell and barely do 10% dmg with a 2h white hit on a clothie.
---
Looking for high mobility high control class that can allow me to make sick flashy plays in PvE and PvP. Would ideally like to be good at 1v1 but not required.
---
Not interested in druid btw. Open to suggestions by all other classes.
---
Might gives a rogue 13 DPS Base, before considering haste or crit, which are both multiplicative modifiers.  
---
Might is going to give like 50-80 AP (~5dps) and 1-1.5% crit depending on your gear level. 
---
It's not particularly close given that a rogue is going to be rocking like 30%+ crit before things like world buffs.  
---
It's an easy choice for Rogue.
---
forum drama is fun, look at all the nostalgia for it
---
Question for druid pvpers: I want to play either hunter or druid for the world pvp. I know that hunter is alot scarier for people to play against but I kinda want to be a player that is hard to kill and annoying. Hunter fits this but does druid also have more survivalbility? I don't care if I don't have massive damage numbers, but the idea of stalling a fight and slowly whittling down opponents or escaping when ganked really intrigues me. The high skill cap is also a boon. Are druids good at surviving and harassing?
---
Fuuuck I might need to go Dwarf now..
---
Can I still make my 2 bank chars, Bankbros and Bankbus?
---
What?
---
My favorite combo.  What's the problem?
---
The comments on this thread look like bots in my Instagram ad spam
---
The problem is the kind of ppl they attract, even more so than some of the fudged up views they have (gosh it was a shock to hear Soda talk about his server plans lol)
---
Certainly. The first is my annoyance at how many in the private server Community either view a server as healthy populated or dead. The second is hoping does private server Community Representatives had something more substantial to offer blizzard in terms of help.
---
And have no money for skills. Good idea bro
---
Blizz will ban for AHK
---
Gottem
---
Are they doing a speed comparison run with fury tank vs prot/thunderfury tank?
---
It's almost like in reality... isn't that scary!?
---
I played on a PvE server back in the day and there was loads of PvP. 
---
On a PvE server, ganking and griefing is fairly limited -- no wiping a raid group on their way to MC, etc. But PvP in the world happens all the time. It'll happen especially often in P2 when BGs aren't out yet.
---
Those damn sweaty nerds blocking the mobs so you accidentally rightclick on them like a fucking retard. GG
---
Not really. If you can do it effectively, yes, it's pretty good. You spend perhaps 15min per full cathedral run and while SM doesn't have any special valuable items, you get quite a lot of money from all those mobs.
---
But, to pull it off effectively, you need pretty good gear and you are also incurring a good repair bill due to the nature of constantly getting hit by dozens of mobs. So, by the time you can pull it off effectively (i.e. T2 set, engi shield and good chunk of defensive epics, most importantly Styleens), you should have better sources of farming gold. It's a lot of fun though.
---
Doing it with lesser gear also works, but is harder, needs more pulls and takes longer. So, I wouldn't say you get a good deal of profit out of it, but I don't know for sure.
---
Funny, I have similar thoughts, definitely druids have real advantages compared to warriors, considering in one single talent tree they have both dps and tanking talents, they don't need to stance dance to start a fight with a charge, their equivalent for sunder armor (sorry dont remember the english name) can be applied even being not melee, no need to upgrade weapon all the time to improve dps, and of course the ton of utilities that only a druid can bring...
---
Still, I'll play warrior, I want a shield, nice defensive capacities, charge and intercept, wield mighty 2 handers, big execute numbers, nice tier sets (I like the druids ones too but to play feral, they are not much helpful!) etc etc!
---
No. 
---
I'm not sure how it will be handled these days (manual or automated) since the GM team isn't as big as it used to be, but back in the day a GM would message you in game (even if you're logged in as another toon) and ask you for an alternative name. If you can't or won't provide one, they will change it to a random name.
---
This guy is actually braindead LOL.
---
"Warrior is slow but it isn't hard"
---
"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN HYPOCRITE? SLOW = HARD LOL READ NEXT TIME"
---
Kill me please
---
You’ve got some learning to do : P RPs put actual work into the role play - a lot more to it than what you role, tho that ofc matters 2. It’s been done for over a decade now, but if you started playing late I’m not surprised you haven’t seen it. Retail wow is hardly an rpg these days so limited rp options
---
Yep, druid meets that definition pretty well. I found that I could beat most classes 1v1 as a druid, but they were longer fights where they struggled to kill me and I slowly whittled them down.
---
Lol wow you would think you couldn't "change" to the same name.
---
Yes, holy reck is a tier 2 healing spec for pve as well. So, good enough most of the time, but not optimal.
---
Morrowgrain
---
That's a weird mindset to have. You care more about the speedlevelers getting an edge they don't even really need more than not having the super annoying, immersion-shattering disappearing act every time you load into a new zone? Sharding would really fuck Classic up imo.
---
Btw, aside from hunters and druids, dungeon grinding in cleave groups is the purported new leveling meta so open world sharding abuse would be very minimally utilized even if it was a thing.
---
Aw, I do hope so.  Though I won't lie, I started in tbc and I still enjoyed the hell out of that version.  Battles seemed to go on for maybe 1 to 3 hours.  We still have time though before bgs are released to fight for the original.
---
That's why flying mounts ruined everything. Even with a 100% mount, you still have to watch what's ahead of you, i.e. hostile mobs, enemy players, sometimes you might fall down somewhere if you're not paying attention, like the Thandol Span or whatever.
---
Then they should name them after zones exclusive to retail. Haha!
---
It's going to be very different for sure compared to the PvP servers. 
---
I would expect mostly raid-equipped lv60s to turn on PvP, and roam around in larger groups looking for groups of the opposite faction. Also, I'm sure the more serious guilds will collaborate cross-faction and organize some sort of inhouse-wPvP events for their rankers.
---
There was a *leak* posted here saying it was lvl 20 max and then a day later at the actual announcement they said it was 15. There's no tin-foil reason to really think they changed their mind or whatever, they never said it was going to be 20.
---
Because they're liars?
---
I guess im missing the point here. Why would anyone willingly followed a guide on what to do and where to go in classic? Its suppose to be a journey in a world, its fun and fine to get lost and discover new things without being directed there. Vanilla leveling isnt about being a blind rat following guide
---
I agree with that 100%   
---
Think Barrens would be a big meme server
---
This is reeeeally nice. Also makes me nostalgic as fuck.
---
The first post said 20 before they deleted it.
---
I spy Undead Rogue opportunities
---
But it's not paying for the game, it's about principles. A stress test or a beta test's purpose is to test the hardware or the software. If they wanted as much objective feedback as possible, they wouldn't ask money for it. You're free to pay for it, but don't act like they're doing you a favor. Fucking blizzshills in this subreddit even, ugh.
---
Already dismissed them thanks to the crappy attitude.
---
Yer between him and Frost, they are the best of the bunch.
---
To be fair people not willing to learn the language should not be welcome. People who are unable are perhaps excusable but unwilling...
---
I don’t know about you chumps, but Aiden is playing warrior.
---
As the original comment in this chain said, this just assumes a bad rogue. This falls apart when a rogue knows what they're doing. They have a counter to every ability in the mage's arsenal. Having Perception/two vanishes is the #1 reason subtlety really turns the tides of the fight. A mage will totally shit on any non-subtlety rogue though.
---
The whole Blue Dragonscale Mail gives:
---
69 int
---
33 spi
---
28 spell power
---
If you wear:
---
Robes of the Royal Crown
---
Leggings of Frenzied Magic
---
Lead Surveyor's Mantle
---
[there are better items, but all those 3 are from BRD, and you can farm BRD starting at 55ish without any particular gear]
---
you'll get
---
41 int
---
34 sta
---
18 spi
---
49 spell power
---
5 mp5
---
so you'll get better stats and you don't lose 28spell power the very moment you switch out a piece.
---
Considering Blue Dragonscales are skinned from elite 55+ dragonkins in Azshara and Winterspring and you need 96 for the whole Blue Dragon Mail set I'd say it's far better to just farm BRD for drops.
---
6% is enough so you only need 3 point in it.
---
Can you use names that are already in use for characters in the game?
---
Example: Peon
---
Imagine getting camped by Peon the Orc Hunter :D
---
very unique, I love it
---
The mental gymnastics to turn a paid fucking 3-day stress test into a good thing. If you wanna donate money for a multibillion corporation, by all means. Don't act like they're doing you a favor while licking their boots.

Copied from another post:
---
Here are some high resolution scans of the original Bradygames physical World of Warcraft map. I've uploaded these in an effort to share this beautiful map with the rest of the community and for the sake of preservation.
---
The creases where the map was folded are visible as damage, this affects the back moreso than the front and could likely be cleaned up easily by someone with editing skills.
---
Some circular screening artifacts are present if you zoom in very close, this is due to the printing technique and can be alleviated with "descreening" methods. I have had some luck removing these myself by applying various blurs, either way it does not impact the fidelity of the image too greatly.

Yes it was. This is how you forget to put on your ony cloak for nefarian.

There's actually a very good FedEx guide requiring only to run from places to places you can do up to lvl 9.

True but 3k is a reasonable ceiling to what an individual layer might hold. Blizz has mentioned in the past that layer sizing will mimic the sizing of Vanilla servers but made no reference to when they expect that.

Yep! Lots of modernized improvements, and more to come. One of my favorite games, I’ve loved creating content and exploring other player made content the last 14 years.
---
 Okay, can we all just take a moment and just stand up from our tables and give one big salute to the activision blizzard and especially WoW team that spent their time at work developing a game. These mad men went as far as making additional server for players, do you even realise how much time it takes to order a server? To think of a name for it? I am telling you man, the Blizzard North is back, i feel the vibe and i am heckin excited. Me and my wife will be gaming hard, of course beyong 24:00 is out of the question since we have 4 kids and a lot of hobbies, but man oh man, blizzard deserves some kudos. o7

Get the addon called Pallypower. Literally makes blessings 100 times easier. Not even exagerating.

Well it’s a translation so it could be inaccurate but it does say “KEEP you at level 60 OR open TBCservers”

As in it’s one or the other.

Barrens isn't a zone exclusive to Retail. I meant Vol'dun, Nazmir, Zuldazar, Stormsong Valley, Drustvar, Tiragarde Sound, Mac'Aree, Krokuun, Antoran Wastes, Broken Shore, Suramar, Azsuna, Stormheim, Highmountain, Val'sharah, Tanaan Jungle, Ashran, Nagrand, Spires of Arak, Talador, Gorgrond, Shadowmoon Valley, Frostfire Ridge, Vale of Eternal Blossoms, Dread Wastes, Townlong Steppes, Kun-Lai Summit, Krasarang Wilds, Valley of the Four Winds, Jade Forest, Deepholm, Uldum, Twilight Highlands, Vashj'ir, Tol Barad, etc.
---
minus the ones that are already realms of course.
---
Ahh I see so the conditions don't all have to be met, just one of them. Makes perfect sence, thanks for the explanation!
---
If you're a warrior leveling alongside a priest then spirit won't matter. His mana is your healthbar.
---
Ret is bad though. Very very VERY few retribution paladins actually succeed in doing average DPS in a competitive 40man raid enviroment.
---
Yeah but if we are talking about Spanish, Italian, French and all the other languages without their own server, why would there be proportionally more of them on the rp-pvp than any other server? Are non English speaking people known to like rp-pvp more? 
---
As for the German and Russians my argument is that if I'm a Russian player and I don't speak English I would rather roll on a Russian server. That would be more important for me than wether it's rp-pvp or pvp.
---
&gt; Sharding would really fuck Classic up imo.
---
Layering is sharding, it's just a bigger one. And it's more ripe for exploit because they will have access to all of the rare spawns, rare nodes and being able to abuse mob spawns through layer hopping. If it was just sharding it would be limited to the starting zones and the resource exploitation would be kept to the low level zones. Layering is just sharding but worse.
---
It's not about them leveling faster, I just don't want the economy to be exploited because of it.
---
There wont be that many classic Players tho after few months
---
Iron grenades don't let a warrior take on 2 mobs at once. At best they do some damage and stun (thereby preventing you from taking damage). Aka grenades increase kill time and lower downtime. Alchemy pots do the same thing. Stacking buff pots and stocking up on hp pots. Increased stats increase kill time, while health pots and things like Trolls Blood decrease downtime.
---
The only significant downside to this is that if you eventually want to BS, you only drop your primary to pick up BS, but with Herb/Alch you also have to drop Herb for Mining.
---
there's the tauren racial, but that's barely anything
---
You have to buff yourself with \[Glue\] and use \[Ladder\] next to the Kodo.
---
I will meet you there fellow adventurers...
---
This is interesting since me as someone, who leveled couple 60s in private servers also tried warrior a year ago or so. I expected some hard challenge, but was kindly surprised that its far from hard. Of course, its harder than mage, hunter or probably anything else, but you only get into danger if you dont focus on a game and make a bad pulls
---
Mobs like that are great for testing. The two roll melee system couldn't be totally confirmed until TBC because they added some mob that gave you 70% or something miss for a long time.
---
I leveled a warrior to 60 when I was 12 playing classic and didn’t even think it was that hard. 
---
Y’all are making this out to be a lot harder than it actually is. Is it harder than other classes? Yes. Is it objectively difficult? Absolutely not. It just takes more time and patience.
---
Oh brilliant was hoping to hear this I've only ever played on PvP servers so it's nice to hear that ranking would still be possible before phase 3 on a PVE server
---
Walter walk and claim to be Jesus
---
Pvp hitcap is 5-6%
---
I'm trying to think of a situation where this might've happened to me but I think you're correct, i've never had that :/
---
I didn't know about France getting a server. That's cool. I think the people who say that they would roll on an rp-pvp server rather than a native language server probably are considering that becasue they speak English anyway. Otherwise it's pretty damn stupid. I mean to be honest the RP doesn't make that much of an actual difference anyway. 
---
Did they really expect to get all types of servers in their own language? If so they are pretty delusional. No way there is enough players to support that.
---
Top tier right here
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
Ugh. Taxes and timezones.
---
Blizzard didn't eat a humble pie and decide to make classic "for the community"
---
They made a calculated business decision that the could capture some of the money going to private servers.
---
I just subbed since I wanted to see all my chars again and do the stress test.
---
Not to actually play the stresstest, but to get my UI ready with the addons I need. I want to play on release day, not spend the first hour compulsive disorder my unit frames to perfection (bad habit hehe)
---
I believe so.
---
Sharding would not be limited to the starter zones. On day 3, while things will be more spread out, populations in Duskwood, Redridge, and STV for example will still be very very high.
---
With that said, I share your concern about the endgame economy is layering is kept for 4 months. Blizz has tools to prevent/mitigate that however, and have already made some changes to that affect (a layer hopping cooldown). Gradually increasing a layers population cap will also help, as competition will remain high while total number of layers goes down. Whether this happens remains to be seen.
---
I guess bliz always have the option - if this realm fills up early - to open a second and allow some free transfers from it. 
---
I'm curious what the most prevalent language is amongst RPers following English.
---
BGs were released 3 months and 27 days after the global Vanilla launch. And Ion estimated that the first couple of phases would be "quick" and "a couple of months" (each).
---
So it's not *that* far off.
---
Are there diminishing returns on crit at 30%? 1 crit turns 1 attack into double damage, and potentially procs increased combo point generation etc, I doubt kings is cheesy and stacks over other stat buffs so it probably applies 10% to base stats. 
---
full tier 1 + 10 agi per ring, 15 for a neck, 10 for a cape is 234 agility.
---
STR from tier 1 is 50, well say all items in total it's 70.
---
Rogue has the lowest base agility of 126 and strength of 82, bringing it to 360 agility and 152 str.
---
in total 512 \* 1.1 = 563.2
---
51 attack power, 1.24 crit, 3.64 dps
---
might is 186 AP with 5 talents improving it, 13.28 dps
---
So 9.64 dps vs 1.24 crit and seal fate is rogues even spec that far in assassination (i have no idea).
---
I have no idea how good 1.24 crit is for a rogue but my intuition is might is slightly better after all, at least until tier 2 gear is out, then who knows all over again. I also don't know if kings stacks on druid buffs, elixirs etc.
---
Happy for you guys that want this.
---
in *actual* network traffic used, the 1.12.1 WoW client basically hovers around 0.1mbit/s in the windows task manager (note that 0.1mbit/s is the lowest digit it can show so it's likely lower). Adding to that, people played vanilla on 56k dialup-models (although with terrible latency). The new classic client likely uses more bandwidth than the old 1.12.1 client but I doubt it's a big difference.
---
tldr: WoW will probably run fine even on a 0.5mbit/s connection, as long as its stable.
---
Blizzard has said that layering is only a launch thing and that it’ll go away in phase 2. However, with this amount of severs I’d say it’ll stay forever.
---
Im pretty sure that manual crowd pummeler is only necessary if you wanna raid as feral druid..
---
Aint needed for pvp
---
Hi thex!
---
No, France, Spain, and Italy are notoriously bad at English education and a majority of their players don't speak passing English. And yet they don't care. And many of the recruitment posts for the RP-PVP realm I mentioned say "X language only", none of them being English. They want to carve out their community on the shared RP-PVP realm even if it means not communicating with a large chunk of the playerbase.
---
This is some high quality stuff. Looks awesome
---
Awesome man
---
I agree! I dabble into some RP sometimes, however, it's quite a fluid transition so to say. If I meet some RPers I greet them in character or in the case of World PVP I like to do some over the top orcyness.. but 1 min later I can be discussing real world events or whatever. We'll see how these realms turn out!
---
&gt;\-No cash shop, just like we asked for
---
haha, don't be so naive , give them 3-6 months after release
---
you're mixing terms. Internet speed is always by default measured in bits per second. Do not introduce bytes as that will only confuse non-IT-plebs.
---
Both Druid and Hunter fit that playstyle. Druids can heal themselves and recover from getting jumped much better than Hunters can. Hunters rely on not getting jumped in the first place.
---
I’m thinking of doing exactly this. 
---
Out of curiosity, is there any reason why a HS in IF is preferable to setting it where I’m leveling? Either way the HS is only cutting out half of my trip and if I set it where I’m leveling I could use it more often for quest turn-in times and whatnot. I might be missing something though.
---
I didn't introduce bytes, OP did. But thanks for being you.
---
Thanks a lot for your answer, and fore everyone else' answers
---
pserver experience is worthless
---
Was there not that one dude who leveled every warrior race and gender combination to max?
---
If it is like the old days of vanilla then you will not be allowed to raid in anything other than full heals or dps , Hybrids were too weak at ether.  I loved raiding as Druid healer.  I am not aware that anything will be different in classic.
---
Mage or Warlock? I was always into casters (my main is shadow priest since WotLK), but I want to reroll in Classic. I like to play both PvE and PvP, I don’t have ambitions to do progress etc though
---
I wonder what his reaction was. He got downvoted hard and deleted his comment
---
Ok, maybe it will happened and there will be a French guild or whatever. I'm not too worried about that. The effect it will have on my enjoyment will be marginal at worst.
---
Full cooldowns ups , a decent rogue will win every time. It’s mathematically unfair for the mage playing against 2nd Blind.
---
I really like the artistic outline used in this, and I love the sense of quiet camaraderie and adventure
---
Lol. Roleplayers fucking hate this shit. They want people to roleplay with, not people who are basically the same as PvE realm players but "are just here for the atmosphere" and such.
---
14ap = 1dps
---
When I was younger I heard from somewhere that when warlocks got to a high enough level they transformed into a lich, which was the raddest shit for edgy teenage me. 
---
By the time I got to 40 I had forgotten about it entirely.
---
Also, at the beginning I had filed my entire hotbar with healthstones and couldn't figure out how to remove them.
---
HNNNGGG oh yessss hype just rose 9000%
---
Wow. Love it.
---
Tooltie is giving bad advice, he's wrong on stats for pvp like hit chance, and wrong about the value of talents like imp arcane missiles.
---
[https://classicwow.live/guides/46/basic-stats-sheet](https://classicwow.live/guides/46/basic-stats-sheet)

This is the basic frost pvp spec I filled this out in under 20 seconds.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#o0xVfobZZVVGhRbtho](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#o0xVfobZZVVGhRbtho)
---
You can get your arcane hit to 3% (youll be over capped with 4% from talents but that is okay, arcane has lots of bad filler you can sacrifice. You can move talents out of: magic attunement, arcane resilience, you can use imp arcane missiles 4/5 or 3/5 (if you like to gamble, but 4/5 is pretty safe), and improved arcane explosion(not advisable).
---
In the frost free you can take 2 in precision and just pull them from: improved blizzard, perma frost, frostbite (optional if you aoe farm, a strong talent, but IIRC does DR novas, I love it, but it is optional as the proc is not reliable), arctic reach(not advisable), imp cone of cold (not advisable). The last 2 are really just there to highlight how core the other talents are.
---
Arcane missiles is a very misunderstood but very powerful spell, seems like I now use it in every single mage matchup, against all shamans, some warlocks and maybe in certain cases vs priests and druids, it also snipes people who run away. (once it gets past the initial range check and begins casting it has unlimited range).
---
Honorable mention to putting 3/5 or 4/5 into winter's chill as debuff padding to ruin enemy defensive dispels. You can build a mage around just causing trouble and not about dealing damage, that would be one of the talents.
---

---
In general people type "properly" on RP servers as it's meant to imitate actual dialogue or prose. You get that less on non-RP servers.
---
But what SPECIFICALLY assumes a bad rogue?
---
If you go pound for pound, blow for blow with a rogue what happens? You're left with your root on a 21 second cooldown, a 60% slow on a 10 second CD, and a 50% slow on no CD. Not to mention a 800 hp shield every 30 seconds.
---
When the rogue has what? A grenade to gapclose every minute?
---
A dagger rogue will threaten your HP to the point where you have to use CDs early if you don't play near perfect which will flip the matchup outside of your favor. But most rogue don't run daggers because they're worse raid weapons almost always. Sure if they are serious gadgeted up it might be a problem, but ytou essentially get an extra trinket up on rogues because they cannot use insignia.
---
So long as you can break distance, trade CDs, and get in / understand how where and why you can get some safe dmg in, you're chilling.
---
And even IF they get an extra form of CC on you and you can't block both blinds- you have skull- if you're a good mage, nevermind the rogue's skill- if you're a good mage you can get it off and break distance- and from that distance so long as you TRADED cooldowns like tidal charm etc. you should be able to win.
---
what medium?
---
Shame ElvUI isn't ready in time for the stress test. Though I reckon you can configure it to your liking on retail and import the string once ElvUI for classic goes live.
---
Dude! Happy Cake day!
---
Seconded - I started playing right before Wrath came out, but the release event and then levelling through Northrend - running those dungeons a thousand times over, and finally managing to solo that dragon daily - will always be my clearest Warcraft memories.
---
Yeah there was no leeway on for 95% of this- there were some areas where (like in the beginning against the hemo rogue- the very FIRST real place) they would've connected with it
---
The stability of the connection is far more important than the speed of it. Anything wireless will be worse than pretty much any wired connection.
---
- 2004 beta: Paladin because I had just played paladin in Diablo 2.
---
- 2006 retail: Warrior because I had just played Barbarian in Diablo 2.
---
I'm just afraid I have to go into RP mode all the time. Hello, I'm Thex the Troll Shaman from Sen'Jin Village. I'm the third of my generation, my father was a well known Troll Hunter...etc.
---
I Just want to play, raid and kill alliance.
---
I still remember the heartbreak as a warlock when a friggin paladin had more dkp then me and won the Azuresong Mageblade.. not a technical ninja action but still felt like one!
---
frostbite is good but can be sacrificed because you never rely on it, you can only fish. Frost warding is basically 0 armor so you're just fishing for reflect chances, it's 15% of like 560 armor. I wouldn't waste a talent point on less armor than a lvl 40 armor scroll aka vendor trash.
---
i want to ride an warhorse as an Tauren :(
---
Some things will be different in classic:
---
&gt; You can (and should) login into your account early.
---
With new Bnet, this is no longer applicable. You should be logged into the Bnet client regardless (and have it running). If you launch the game from there, you skip the account login.
---
&gt; You will see them turn to green the moment they go live and you can create your character and start playing right away
---
You can create characters beforehand. I think the servers will be up for character creation the whole 2 weeks up to the launch. But we will see. Regardless, you will probably skip this.
---
&gt; Buy two or three 6-slots bags when you can (from players or vendors).
---
Some classes benefit from pooling money and cloth so they can craft their wand early. For Mages, Priests and Warlocks I recommend 1 6-slot bag for buying if you don't get one until level 5-6.
---
&gt; "OMG I won't get to clear MC second week"
---
People thinking they will down Rag second week will not down Rag second week. To down Rag second week you already need 60+ people (50 for raid, 10 for consumables ... better if you have more) that do hardcore instance aoe leveling throughout so you can be 60 after 5-6 days (~4 days played). You probably need a few guys running actual support for the guys leveling (WL ports, might be especially useful) additionally to the guys just farming for consumables.
---
Dowining Rag second week is an insane achievement. I personally will be fucking glad to ding 60 before Nov.1st. Anything more is pure bliss.
---
Good old felix
---
Take Stormwind, then flood the Deeprun.
---
people shit on paladins but have yet to see what a proper decked out paladin can do with just 2 buttons
---
this is the [begining[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8MJdPJjkkA) with warrior pieces from BWL
---
but with AQ...my god... run
---
As far as pve, yeah no.
---
I'm planning on playing quite a bit the first week. Gotta work 3 of the days, and I do sports at least 5 times a week, so there are limits. But for the wednesday and the weekend after launch I'm certainly planning to do a lot of stretching and stuff. After level 10, probably every level I'll get up and stretch or do some 3 minute planks. If I don't, I tend to feel absolutely horrible after long gaming sessions.
---
"I am 12 and cringe at everything"
---
Honestly, just any of the old CGI game trailers or the vanilla wow intro.
---
For someone who have never played wow, and who isnt familiar with the lore behind it, then gameplay videos will not do anything.
---
Except for the reality in which the mage has the ability to clear stuns and teleport 20 yards away every 15 seconds baseline and the fact that the mage has 2 iceblocks of his own on top of a skull of impending doom to clear two blinds.
---
Sure if the rogue gets the second blind off you're gonna have a bad time, but if you watch the video I specifically address that.
---
Myself and everyone I know returning hasn’t played live for years outside trialing it for a few hours to see if it’s tolerable. We all came back and subbed for classic.
---
I remember getting a pvp kodo mount on my undead rogue. But I'm guessing will be later phases when pvp rewards come out =/
---
Or you could say the classic beta already tested that pretty well.
---
3%
---
They just listened to wrong people. To whiners. To people that didn't like the game... probably never liked MMORPG concept in general, but still wanted it tailored to their needs. Blizzard should listen to positive feedback - "it would be cool to add this thing" - not the constant whining - "I don't like this thing, remove it, I hate doing this, make me not have to, etc. etc."
---
We got one in EU too. [Different post](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/announcing-rp-pvp-in-wow-classic/67502)
---
Wait, are you saying XXXTentacion was a l33t WoW player? :D
---
Fuck yes! Thanks for listening Blizzard.
---
People will for sure /spit on you if you dont remove weapons in cities. You can run but people will look at you and think you are weird. If there are weddings in the castle you should clap and maybe donate some coins to the happy couple. But most important.
---
This is why I decided to go with pally lol. I was on the fence between the two and while both will be slow I know I can survive more accidents on my pally than a war lol. But hey when you actually get to 60 I’m sure you will have a much better time :)
---
If they ever would make another wow with a new engine, this is what I would like it to look.
---
Will the streamers really want to be on the RP server, though? They won't want to risk their fans not wanting to join them there.
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
Classic rep gain numbers are like 45% compared to PS data (100 instead of 250 or 50 instead of 100).
---
I plan to level my first character fast. Got some guides I'm going to follow with the only differentiation being that I'll add in some profession stuff that they skip.
---
Hopefully within 3 weeks I'll be done with my warrior. After that, during downtime on my main I'll be leveling a mage or a shaman. No hurry for that one.
---

You're gonna need to turn in a lot of runecloth
---
Can't be stressed enough.  Game was designed to run on a modem.
---
Make sure to state you region. If you are EU i'll be glad to play with you
---
Leveling will take less time than it did back in  anilla. You cant forget your experience you have. There is significantly more information sources out there. Having 3 60's will probably be pretty normal in classic
---
German, Spanish and French people are notorious for forming non-English speaking cliques in online games.
---
According to what others hinted to me, I won't have Furor for the most part, as the priority to get it, supposedly is below Omen and Hotw, so I wouldn't have it maxed before level 58.
---
You done need the licenses- if ya know what I mean :P :D
---
When they make the movie, Samuel L Jackson will be playing Uther and Arthas will be played by John Travolta.
---
Now im confused. One guy said its normal, you said people will spit into my face
---
Yep, should work.. Well, that's great because I'm going to play a Lock this time. ;)
---
I love you.
---
We remember this
---
Yeah, Pyroblast can reach up to 4.5k roughly and execute with 100 rage nad the talent would deal ~4k on a crit. That's by far the highest you can get. Fireball would be next with around 3-3.5k.
---
Note, those numbers can all go higher with buffs from other sources. A PI pyroblast can do up to 5.5k. You could also get berserking in wsg for more bigger numbers.
---
This needs to be updated and contain Rp-PvP as a server option.
---
Since when has remote desktop been against ToS?
---
Dondé esta la bibiotica?
---
The age of MMO's is pretty much over as it is right now.  WoW was made during the perfect time and all the MMO's that came after could not compete with WoW.
---
But a remake of classic WoW if it is as successful as we all hope perhaps we will then get other companies to remake great games such as Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2.  Or maybe even a new era such as Westwood Studios coming back... a man can dream can't he?
---
Pretty much all the dps casters are one or two button rotations in raids.
---
I hoped for improved API allowing to develop advanced addons since Classic will not be using same client as it was back into then.
---
Didnt some guys 5man Onyxia?
---
queue time struggle &gt; realm picking struggle
---
&gt; 1k is gonna be real rough.
---
A layer can hold more than that. Not everyone is going to log in on the first day. I'd say of the final population (not that that exists, but for the purpose of layer merging), 50% will log in the first 2 days and almost 100% will log in by the first sunday.
---
The zones can be seen as an XP over time generator. The purpose of layering is to not oversaturate the generator so people take unusually long to get the XP needed to hit the next generator. If Blizz does some math (and I am **sure** they do, because it's fun), they probably have some models to project populations to create more layers before the first one is full.
---
That being said, the 1-10 zones will be full. Really full. Probably for 2 days or so on every layer. I personally would not start a DE alt before  day 3 at the earliest if you can wait that long.
---
why do people try to do quests and not just go grind mobs a bit? seriously
---
SEPHIROTH!
---
You can't make a squishy sl. You have two bubbles, health potions and the priest. Lock and sp should burn down a rogue in under 10 sec. Rogue has zero defenses/mitigation against magic dmg.
---
The coordination.  It really is a group effort.  It's like going to a line dance when everything is in sink.  
---
Plus, the rush of when you first defeat that really hard raid boss the first time with your guild.  Feels like you won the superbowl.  People literally screaming and jumping around, over a computer game.
---
Well there would also be times as a undead where I'd find myself stuck in a fear because WotF isn't ready.
---
15 January 2007
---
yeah you’re right, rppvp servers will inevitably lead to LFR
---
And now I need to tell my new found guild that I am going to play on RP-PvP after all :/
---
&gt; The stress tests
---
Were specifically to oversaturate the layers. This is helpful to point to problems that only happen in specific circumstances. It also helps point out general performance of the layering code and what happens if you move around bulks of players between layers in short times even if the source and target layer have high load.
---
The launch will be packed, but not as packed as the stress tests.
---
What the hell are these morons doing?????? They could get ~~4~~ 10 levels in the time it takes them to loot the chest
---
They did not listen Russian community.
---
Just have to wait and see. Asmongold has said that he will keep his server a secret, but once he reveals which one he is on, it is GG if it's the one you've been leveling on. 
---
It's not the streamers themselves who are bad. It is the legion of retarded followers that are bad. Smaller streamers won't be an issue. It's just those BIG streamers with shitty fanbases that you will want to avoid.
---
if I hadnt played on alot of private servers the past 7 years then I wouldnt remember marrowgrain either.
---
Can someone post a sample macro? Or is it just [target=...]?
---
You can avoid War Stomp, but not because of leeway.
---
Minmax woes imo. 
---
Healing classes do have a point, though. If you want to go dps to pvp, the best gear can still be found in raids, which means you have to heal. Not many guilds accepting of a healer without healing spec.
---
I'll never forget how I cracked up laughing when a spanish guy joined our vanilla guild and teamspeak 
---
&gt;Hi guys... I am from... eh... espain.
---
Holy shit this is great! I love the rogue's daggers sticking in the sand. The warrior's empty brew knocked over, taking a nap. The caring hunter with a fat and happy boar. The lounging mage, deep in her thoughts, gathering wisdom for the next battle. You captured a wonderful mood with this piece, really well done.
---
Shhh don’t out me!
---
But mana tide totem is resto 31 pointer.
---
Ele/resto (assumimg 30/0/21) don’t have it. And apparently MTT is pretty sought after in raids.
---
It’s the whole reason why i’m slowly dropping the idea of shaman; i want to raid, but would prefeer a spec viable for pvp and raids.
---
Still getting 1.12 av, sigh...

ElvUI + Questie + Bartender and some auction addon is all I need.

One of us is telling the truth
---
Here are some good RvM duels (dagger):
---
[https://youtu.be/og9QmFGPJfU](https://youtu.be/og9QmFGPJfU)
---
Note that it's really difficult to do much as a mage because the damage from the rogue is so high. Everytime they vanish they can ambush crit for 2k damage. Also note that dagger rogue has another root break with improved Sprint.
---
Because there is a cost to play? 
---
Yes, you can use tokens, but then you have to spend your time playing making money too, and for most people in the game making gold isn't as easy (due to lack of knowledge usually), and they'd rather spend the time they have actually playing what they like (e.g. doing pvp or whatever).
---
Rogue, check out his daggers sticking out of the sand :)
---
 For rogues it doesn't matter at all really. We kind of need stun timers, energy bar meter and a nice cup of thistle tea.
---
He floated down a river in a reed basket, was adopted, lead his people out of bondage and ran across the sea to the desert and formed a new nation.. never understood how people ever got Jesus out of that.
---
I mean why aren't BFA private servers more popular than vanilla.
---
 What? Because you didn't know how to use addons in vanilla, it means that we who did can't use them now?
---
I used UI addons, swing timers, cast bars and everything,.

Amazing!

Awesome

Okay. He is telling the truth. But my description CAN happen in rp servers. Like you would see a group of players walking slowly together in linen shirts while chatting about their inspection of jangolode mine.
---
One word: Why?

Both factions are ran by Goblins, the whole point of the constant warfare is to make profit off all sides.
---
I like the guild cohesion, progression and bants.
---
The content may sometimes be just mind-numbing, but I see it as spending time with people who hopefully enjoy doing stuff together.
---
No, the rules do not require roleplay. Just don't be a dick to those who are and it is all good. But hey, perhaps give it a go and see if you like it!
---
And the mobs did less damage in the beta
---
I'm well aware. Usually they form guilds, though.
---
I just created a addon repository on git which has all the addons i use as submodules. A simple update on submodules will update all the addons 😁
---
Ah, probably because if you're going out your way to find a server it's usually not the current version of the game. I'd imagine a very very small number of people play current patch servers, even during like WotLK or whatever the vanilla/TBC servers would have more.
---
we'll see about that

---
I see extra info when you mouse over a step but there is no way to easily get those coordinates etc.
---
I would not recommend any RP server to someone who literally finds RP "cringe". You don't have to actively RP but the server community and immersion that people love depends on there being RPers.
---
Wasn't Desolace designed based on the Amazon rain forest?
---
It was an issue in Vanilla, but it was a different time. Now we have two-factor authentication. Just use Blizzard's authenticator service.

If you are missing out on the passive aggressive IC letters, and 'the so and so guild is trespassing in our guilds keep' announcement posts, you are not making full use of your RP realms forums.

Night Elf Druids and Night Elf Hunters.

Always a feral druid ganking horde lowbies in Windshear and always a Night Eld Hunter ganking lowbies in Tanaris, and Zoram Strand, and a mixture of both (and maybe a paladin) killing lowbies questing in hillsbrad fields.
---
Nice illustration!
---
This reminds me that I'm looking forward to WC3 reforged.
---
Why will people refuse to acknowledge that pservers have 10s of 000s of players for years. They're so hung up on their sunk cost fallacy in live.
---
I'll laugh my ass off if it ends up being low pop in like 6 months. I think it'll be popular, but people on here have blown it waaaaay out of proportion.

Felwood or Winterspring
---
Expect to not have a general chat, trade chat, and local defence chat for the entirely of phasing as people will be trying to get into X steamers' layer.
---
If you want to do a dungeon, might as well walk there and find a group in /say chat... Better not be on an outnumbered or equal faction pop PvP server.
---
The starter area is going to be a cluster fuck for weeks. Just party up for the quests.
---
Alright, thanks. Time to sub up.
---
Ngl that looks really cool
---
If you're in such a rush to get a name you can't spend the 30 sec it takes to customize your char, it's a shit name.
---
RpPvP has stronger naming policies. Names should be lore friendly and nothing like xXSlayerXx oder Legoolasxy. The Rp-PvP tag tends to attract player who are more mature than on pvp (not saying all pvp players are immature).
---
If you don't care about lore and hate the stronger naming policies of Rp-PvP servers and you just want to play the game, go for PvP.
---
If you prefer a deeper experience with more roleplaying aspects, a less hardcore attitude and a more mature community, go for Rp-PvP.
---
I even got into Minecraft through a wow youtube channel.
---
Sure! It's all about acting out a role while playing the game. Both PvP and RPPvP have mechanically speaking the same rules and options; if players were to ignore the RP aspect the servers would be identical. The difference lies in RP servers being intended for roleplay. This means it attracts and concentrates on players that want to act as if they really were their characters. They are preserving the fourth wall and speaking as their characters would. A troll or dwarf player might chat with an accent. Players usually care more about the lore and story and form guilds that fit with the game world. Players tend to have long in-character conversations in towns (especially some lewd weirdos in Goldshire) and refrain from gamer-speak or discussing real world subjects. All this spices up and intensifies the experience the game already projects, allowing players to make their own creative contributions to the narrative and game world. Some players write backstories about their characters, even forming relationships and families. Many join guilds that form alliances or rivalries with other guilds. There is usually an increased amount of organized world pvp and all kinds of events.
---
Oh the abuse will be a thing for sure.
---
Was searching for a timer for the stress test, stumbled upon this article and saw the comments https://blizzardwatch.com/2019/08/06/wow-classic-getting-one-stress-test-launch/
---
hell yeah I intend to RP! and pvp! even at the same time!
---
Yea it wont but even if it was, a populated server is a good thing
---
As a horde Rogue, this is basically my home
---
Great news!
---
Lmao almost 0 streamers will be on an rp pvp server. Cmon
---
I really wish that alliance had an equivalent buff to warchiefs blessing. That would give horde more of an incentive to regularly raid if. I'm going alliance mainly to fuck with the horde. A coordinated attack is super fun, no matter the outcome :)
---
100/10 mate, its so unique and heartwarming
---
I dont think so? Can you kill a full elites hp in 1 mana pool with just blizzard?
---
&gt; you forget ~430 armor, 30 arcane resist, and 4 fire frost nature shadow resist.
---
I didn't, those are useless stats and won't help you one bit.
---
And if you are a healer you can enter dungeons as soon as you get to the appropriate level, crafting Blue Dragon Mail won't help you one bit and it's a serious time/gold sink
---
That’s awesome ! Where?
---
Yeah cause thats hilarious.  We’ll see. No one has any idea how popular classic will be as a whole
---
Hello new phone wallpaper thank you so much what a masterpiece.
---
Keep in mind that there will be around 10k players on your server. That alone tells me to create my fav name as fast as possible. If you think that indicates a shit name, well idc.
---
what class  have you played in vanilla?
---
Every poll showed that Rp-PvP was a lot more popular than Rp. So, don't worry, the population will be fine. I'd think we're actually going to get a very full server.
---
!remindme 20 days
---
Lol as if an rppvp will have a queue
---
Not really true, i'm definitely not against bringing uncommon specs to raids, i'm an advocate for playing what you want unless your goal is going hardcore. However if you look at the private server data (not optimal but the best we got right now) the difference in dps between classes while in BiS is quite significant, even between the "optimal" specs. And mages doesn't pull ahead until later tiers such as AQ and Naxx.
---
See you guys there
---
If I set it up for a duo of different races.  
---
How does it handle meeting up etc?
---
Does it compensate for extra experience running and meeting up in either starting zones?
---
Does it remove race specific quests from the starting zones?
---
I thiiiink that the RP implies that there's a few interaction rules you have to stick with, right? Like character names and not ruining other's RP? I don't know, never played on one.
---
Hey, a fellow troll warrior! :D
---
I'm gonna play a fury warrior, just for the aesthetics. I mean, BERSERK.
---
Not sure if it will get a classic version but i presume so, so check out the Minion addon client, pretty much the same as the old curse one
---
And how many of those players do you think will create a character within 30 sec?
---
This will be my main server just because they're less likely to impose any server load reducing system to
---
an extreme waste of time
---
one? 
---
\-random frost nova breaking
---
\-1 sec delay on blizzard applying (batching)
---
\-better pathing and AI from mobs, also faster movement
---
\-lower mana pool on mages
---
Hunters have no home, they live in the wild.
---
It can be pretty fun. I like rolling low level paladins and guarding the Alliance quest area in Durotar. Level 5-6, enough to be a fair fight.
---
very nice, ty
---
You cant know. Because you dont know if there will be queues to login into the server. If so, its going to be a big problem for a lot of people.
---
It looks awesome bro, I can't wait to relog into that world. I will try to achieve that immersion as much as I can and I feel lucky that I am still in uni (even if its the second degree I will get) so that I can invest as much time as I can into my fantasies!
---
Good luck to all of you and see you in game!
---
Also congrats to the RP-PVP community for achieving their goal!!
---
Release is close!!
---
Someone please explain to me the difference from RP-PVP and just regular PVP worlds and why it’s so important I’m actually confused lol
---
I will take my time. I am not too worried.
---
The name is still available on a "full" retail server right now.
---
I can imagine:
---
A Tauren Warrior
---
A Forsaken Rogue
---
A Troll Priest
---
An Orc Hunter
---
All mid level 20s questing in the barrens south of Camp Taurajo.
---
Given the amount of Quilboars there I wonder what those sausages are made of ;)
---
Shoulda had ebbnflow on
---
I did the 69th like.
---
Yea, I did that.
---
You hear me mom? I'm not complete trash.
---
They are the same people that crave for the whole game to be safe space so they can't be bothered by anything and achieve a lot for doing nothing.

---
What may be the reason behind it? It's a perfectly normal post.
---
This is retarded
---
If you waited 15 minutes to get in does the (I would say less than) 30 seconds to customise it really matter?
---
A high tier guild would be happy to lose 3 pieces of gear to get rid of an asshole. Every top vanilla guild used FFA looting back then.
---
They are the kind of people that believe posting shit on the internet will change fate, but it never works.
---
For those wondering, from top left clockwise:
---
Warrior, Mage, Hunter, Rogue
---
HDMI dont have enough bandwidth to show 4k in 120hz.
---
I've leveled 3 druids so far in private servers up to 35~45 as feral, tanking all dungeons. Here's what I think.
---
Feral faerie fire will speed your tanking A LOT.
---
It will allow you to pool rage near the end of a fight so you can pull the next one witout losing any rage.
---
It will also increase your threat and your group's physical dps.
---
It's instant and free! You get +20% maul damage at level 32 in the feral tree too.
---
After that you can choose:
---
- keep going down feral tree for extra health and strenght.
---
- get omen of clarity for extra threat.
---
- get furor for versatility, offheal potential without losing as much rage, and pvp.
---
My usual path is FFF &gt; 1 point in nature's grasp &gt; Furor &gt; complete feral
---
I usually just spamtank dungeons and grind mobs in the open world hoping for some world pvp fun in between dungeons.
---
Underrated 10/10 would purge again
---
you haven't taken into account
---
* random frost nova breaking
---
* 1 sec delay on blizzard debuff application (this one is huge!!)
---
* better pathing and AI from mobs, also faster movement
---
* lower mana pool on mages
---
this is not gonna be possible on classic. mage solo aoe grinding is dead
---
If you go into the classic folder and open up the game and log in, all the folders get created like they should. So login and put addons where you usually put them in retail.
---
Dude first 15ish levels are very easy, the hard part is yet to come.
---
No, they will wipe.
---
Im not going to fall for the trick of blizzard to activate my sub that early.  
---
Ill activate my game time on the 26th and not earlier.
---
My name will be so unique, nobody will pick it.  
---
Im going to roll a shaman, and probablly will name it Thex
---
I do agree with you, but many peoply simply don't want to invest the 3-4 months it takes to level casually without an addon to guide them. I remember reading thottbot constantly while leveling, which is semi like using an addon, as it tells you where your objectives are located and describes the quest in detail.
---
If you ever used thottbot, you used a leveling guide and now it's just an addon to assist you in-game instead.
---
YES !
---
&gt; only creating a new layer when the previous is full isn't a good way of handling things
---
Perhaps, but that's what Blizzard has literally stated that they'll do:
---
*"Imagine a tray with an empty glass. The tray is a single server in WoW Classic. The empty glass is a layer. When you log into the game on launch day, you’ll be with a flood other players: the water that we’re going to pour into the glass. Once the glass is full, we add another empty glass and start filling it up with water, or players, too. Each new glass is a new layer that consists of two to three thousand players — which means any single server could handle tens of thousands of players at the same time but without all of them being crowded into the same place in-game. The only way to see players from another layer is to group up with them —otherwise they don’t interact.*"
---
I've been RPing on non-RP servers, and most people will do at least a little RP back. Even just a /wave, or cracking a joke about how gnomes are short.
---
Druids started with a very hard life leveling.  The druid classic will launch with is the 1.12 druid- probably the most buffed class up to that point.  Because the buffs were mostly aimed at endgame, but many had class-wide effects, it definitely lifted druid from a poor fate in the leveling game to a good one.
---
It's only going to be a problem for people with shit names though.
---
not to be worried, but dont chose easy passwords.
---
And just use the BLizzard authenticator and you are fine !
---
Hey man, you might have missed something called layering.
---
I've never RP'd and don't plan to but I was curious how big the RP community was if they justified two servers just for Rpers.
---
You were saying? 😏
---
Do you want to talk about it?
---
It won’t be dead in 6 months, many people including me plan on playing for *years*.
---
I don’t like to farm for karma, but I’ve made this exact post multiple times and it always gets tons of upvotes so I take that as many people around here have the exact same plans, this game will be something I play for the entirety of my life.
---
You probably dont know this but you receive a flag when you come home from your 1st deployment. But go ahead keep trolling.
---
What class are you rolling?
---
There is no loot trading in any vanilla server afaik. What do you mean there is no reason for a guild to use FFA? How do you distrubute loot when doing loot lists or loot council? Don't just use FFA and have people pick their assigned loot up?
---
Load the game via the .exe (might not need this next part) and login until it tells you no servers active. Close the game and the interface\addons folders will be there.
---
As Jeff above already stated. Most macros from currently retail will work in classic except focus.
---
Im just glad in launches at 11PM in the UK so kids and people who have work will thin down the numbers actually online, sure it will still be mad though
---
Streamers played on Wyrmrest Accord and Moonguard on retail due to the fact there was no sharding.
---
You can bet your ass they’ll be on this server too pal.
---
&gt; Pull 2 mobs on accident? Dead. 
---
Run away, until the 2nd mob turns back and kill the one you pulled. But more likely someone ELSE will tag the 2nd mob first.
---
Well, stoneform is always neat for dealing with rogues, as well as a lot of crap in AQ!
---
Failed it's Kickstarter campaign because few people believed they'd actually manage to make it, went into development anyways with their own independent pledge system, and went on to get a lot more support since they've done a great job showing their progress in monthly newsletters and even occasional pre-alpha streams.  As of right now it's still a good way from release but making solid progress- they expect one more phase of pre-alpha and are working on completely finishing a zone (which they say involves creating the tools to finish everything else much faster).
---
So you would recommend staying Arms for tanking 5 mans? Is it better or just more convenient because you don't have to respec? Or should you respec to prot if you wanna grind like 50 dungeons in a row for example.
---
I'm levelling a druid as feral and i think I'll respec in to resto when I hit 60 to make it easier getting groups. Not sure if a dinged 60 feral druid can tank much.
---
Imagine if they turn off layering day 1 for RP realms to preserve immersion... the rage on this sub would be intense lol
---
See you tonight comrade 😁
---
You should have converted your GF to the vanilla cult.
---
It saves you the cooking time and gives you a free pocket healer.
---
Efficiency man, efficiency.
---
Great work 👊🏻😎
---
Azeroth auto pilot should be no where near classic IMO, great addon for retail though.
---
Amazing work
---
Quality stuff brother
---
*"Broken on private servers"*? As I recall from vanilla, you couldnt "push" bosses in this manner. You can to run thru it and turn it again. If anything, pushing bosses *IS* broken and shouldnt be part of classic.
---
For future it's called vanilla wow. Classic wow is a replica of vanilla wow.
---
/u/EgregiousWoW
---
You can alternatively just add a link to this video in the notes section for this step
---
You're right. It should be Green Charlton Heston - but you're probably overthinking it.
---
Human Mage, Human Paladin, NElf Druid, Orc Warlock, Tauren Warrior, Tauren Shaman.
---
Probably going to have a Human Mage main but level a Tauren Warrior on the side on a seperate realm.
---
I love this
---
fatherhood really changes a man
---
The only ones that I wouldnt actually want to be on a server with are Asmon and Soda. Its not that scary a thing pal
---
I'm logging in every second just to make a troll shaman named Thex.
---
I think you forgot about the cloak off ragnaros (Cloak of the Shrouded Mists)
---
Do it, that's your freedom. As long as you face the consequences ;-)
---
Those are the exact ones that are going to be playing on that server.
---
It’s not scary, but this subreddit has issues with interacting with people and the anti streamer circlejerk is pathetic.
---
I plan on going sword and board as orc warr, until around level 15-20 when i can get a proper 2h
---
Your group seems like the perfect fit for our guild! I sent you a PM for more details.
---
i like this myth, people get surprised all the time
---
I figure even 5 hours is enough to help clear the area. I was really talking just about RIGHT at release where everyone is 1-5 even 1k layers would be rough in that case.
---
You're saying that people who spend hours on social media doesn't affect society? Idiot.
---
You're saying video games don't affect society? Idiot.
---
Then waste your life on video games whatever xD
---
Sounds like someones mad they cant play haha
---
As long as we get more "real" PVP events than you get on RP realms... I've participated in a few, and always ended up getting chewed out for *actually* using my abilities and trying to kill the opponents. Apparently you're not supposed to do that, which never sat right with me.
---
I mean, I know one factor of RP is that "level/gear doesn't matter" - but at the same time, you'd only send your most skilled and equipped soldiers into battle; so in my mind it made sense that the lvl 40s shouldn't be in the frontlines, and that the 120s should've left their grey RP gear in the bank, and come prepared for a fight. But apparently I am wrong in that.
---
I get it when it's small-scale RP combat between guilds etc. But in large, raid sized skirmishes? All bets should be off. That's what I'm *hoping* we'll get more of on RP-PVP realms, and that's the only way we could keep the population up, tbh - by not turning away the PVPers.
---
100% agree.
---
Retail vanilla I didn't accept a shaman tank.. and in Classic I won't either.
---
“Male gnome model is just fucking ugly” 
---
Well that’s debatable, there’s basically 2 schools of thoughts... and on both them this is subjective and therefore reverts to my first statement.. pure Racism! ;)
---
&gt; You can certainly die that many times. It's quite simple.
---
Its not optimal as a *warrior* which the guide is for, to die that many times, since you can grind while running, and you need the grinded levels anyway.
---
This really captures the dnd feel of classic
---
I could be wrong, but I think China is probably not going to shut down any pservers (I imagine their government literally laughing at a request to do so), so the Chinese pserver community doesn't need to worry the same way the American/European one does and may have more players stick to pservers because of this.
---
Nothing new about people taking days off from work to enjoy a hobby. Who are you to decide wether sombody else's free time is well spent. Maybe you should spend your time better than typing on a forum with people that you don't understand, because in my opinion; that's the real wasted time
---
Dude it's 2019

---
What's wrong with NoFap? Most sport players are supposed to do that such as mike tyson for example who was in NoFap for 5 years.

And that banana peel and baby food was a troll which i admit lmfao check the comments.

You grow old when you stop enjoying life and dont do what you like.

But sure getting a wife and kids might be smart, and then I can act like I have grown up.

Then I can leave my job.

---
This guy has a fairly comprehensive series running on doing DPS checks for every class and spec. The generally agreed upon worst specs usually are only lacking behind the top of the pack, minus Mages, by about 100 DPS. Mage does pull ahead pretty significantly starting in BWL. 
---
His Shadow Priest video is a bit skewed though because he's using SW:P, as well as his Enhancement Shaman one using Stormstrike. Though that would only really matter in a raid setting.
---
Yes! You didn't really have to RP if you didn't wanna but dialogue in /say was tidy and more mature. Not many people at all going out of their way to ruin the experience for others. Also we had the all powerful (( ... )) for ooc
---
&gt;PLEASE don't say this is a troll since everything i said is basically true. This game is SUPER time consuming.
---
That might be true but so what? There are many games that are time consuming and if people like something they enjoy putting the hours in, look at EVE Online...
---
&gt;It can't but laugh at grown ass people who are hyped for a NoLife game.
---
And yet there you are nolifing the no-fap nonsense... lol
---
RemindMe! 19 days
---
So cool! Make an Alliance version too!
---
Yeah... this was funny a few weeks ago..
---
Two to three means its flexible. And that was an example not the code or specific numbers. Is 2-3k equal to 3k, is it a specific for sure number? No, its a range from an analogy. Thank you for supporting my argument.
---
My only concern now is only 1. Most likely it would be Chicago time no?  Never not played on EST server. Hoping latency wouldnt be too awful
---
Can you run current wow? If yes. Then yes.
---
If you can t speak the language you re not a functional member of society. Outright dangerous even
---
I think TitanPanel had something like that back in the days, though the whole panel itself is ugly af.
---
We live in a society.
---
God this community really is full of snowflakes if those two comments actually insulted you. Sure they were wrong, but cmon.
---
And seriously no one gives a fuck about who you in particular "respect". Get out of here with that shit. Blizzard is a big company with lots of consumers to satisfy, and with many employees who all do their best to give you games that you like. They don't owe you shit

Thanks for your input. I’ll probably go with Undead Warlock then. Only thing that sucks is the soul shard farm (and -1 bag slot reserved for shards), on the other hand it makes the class more unique and I guess more true to the class lore, and the Ritual of summoning is so badass. Do you know what spec was “the best” for leveling and lvl 60 content?
---
And you are the worst. But it is not cute at all.
---
XD
---
It should get fixed before release. I submitted a report last week.
---
I would never wanna see 10k players on my server.
---
Ohh so you plan to stand while you play for 20hrs?
---
Classic version has options to show floating/scrolling heal numbers
---
I've only looked at holy paladin so far, but the stat weights seem to be really off. For example:
---
Robes Of The Exalted is considered pre-raid BIS, but in the search they show up on place 11. There's a green mail chest piece with only half the +healing that's higher up the list. 
---
Spell power is weighted more valuable than healing power. I understand why you did this, but in reality as a healer they are equal. Mana Regen and Intellect seem to be considered too valuable compared to healing power aswell. There are pieces higher up on the list with no or practicly no +healing just because they have high intellect/spirit/Mp5 on them.
---
That’s amazing ! Thank you !
---
Just get good
---
Windows 7 64 bit is the oldest supported version of Windows so I really doubt XP will work.

I made an app with joana's guides inside. Been using it on pservers, Gonna stick to it.
---
Possible? - Yes
---
Bannable? - Also yes
---
tldr: Dont do it.
---
You cant switch trinkets in combat tho. Skull is a weapon.
---
It’s not worth it to pickpocket such low level mobs.

If your tracking gold per session, I would just make a note of gold at log off on a spread sheet each day. Then you can see each day the gain. Super easy to setup an equation that automatically subs the amount from previous day.
---
This is unfortunately what happened in recent years on retail RP-servers. The RP-population to PvE/PvP-population is skewed heavily in favor of the latter. Not all of those people are trolls of course, but plenty of them have no clue about server rules or don't care about them(and Blizzard doesn't really enforce them anymore).
---
As an actual roleplayer it sucks to be stuck in what's more like a PvE than a RP-server. It feels like you're some monkey performing tricks for tourists, with the occasional tourist throwing a rock your way.
---
So they were warriors?
---
You cant log in to setup addons. 
---
If you start wow manually from the install folder where you can setup graphics and sound atleast. Also you can prepare adding addons to the addon folder.
---
Pickpocketing early will sure get you cash. It just won't be much. But comparitively speaking. At low levels things don't cost much. The real value is the locked boxes you pick pocket for leveling your lockpicking.
---
It's not until later levels that you start getting good vendorables like the diaries etc from though. I believe they vendor for 90s? I also got a ln epic dagger from a pickpocket lockbox in stv once.
---
What are you talking about?
---
No, Windows XP does not meet the minimum requirements to play Classic WoW.
---
Barrens and Dun Morogh/Winterspring.
---
The longer avs get old really fast. You think you do but you don't.
---
Only a newbie addon maker so my 2 pennies... depending on the type of stats and info it could vary from extremely easy to complex, e.g. just counting the number of pick-pocket casts is easy, capturing what you looted and then tracking how much it sold for.. harder... 
---
Exporting I expect is fairly easy - WoW saved variables are LUA tables, so a small script (or upload to a website) could parse the table into something more friendly (e.g. CSV) for externally viewing the data.
---
Yeah because there was 3 rp/pvp server just for France, for example.
---
My name will be Thexinator and my main purpose will be to kill all Thexes
---
:(
---
Drakkisath is immune to taunt (as are all dragonkin as far as I recall). Tank switching will be done by making sure 2x tanks are both top on threat so that when the MT gets conflag the 2nd gets threat. 
---
Like tanking hakkar in ZG basically.
---
This is like the old guy that doesn't understand why his horse isn't allowed on the freeway.
---
The characters in ICC change throughout ICC in size. So strange.
---
5mans, LBRS, UBRS will be totally fine as paladin if you have consecration. Tanking further raids will be harder (but not impossible). Not having taunt is a big limiting factor in raids.
---
Should have been more clear, meant I was considering subscribing to setup addons during the stress test. Not now before stress test is live.
---
 Was just unsure if the WoW classic Client I downloaded will work for the stress test or if you need some beta client for that?
---
To expand on OP's question, tonight's stress test is still part of the beta client, right? So if I want to test my addons I need to put them in the beta folder and not in classic?   
---
I plan to set everything up today and then move the WTF and Interface folders to the \_classic\_ folder if that is the case :)
---
good less people on realms that matter
---
It s not the middle age anymore. A country has the right to have an official language and enforce it in schools, law, etc.
---
Moving from Alliance to Horde so will be getting new names.
---
OMG, this is amazing.
---
Christ this kid's a narcissist.
---
I was thinking of something original. Like THEX THE TROLL SHAMAN
---
That's some proper RP tho!
---
I don't know.
---
I totally understand why Classic is unplayable on Windows XP. It's just that I was hoping it was playable, because then it would be easier and more accurate experience, at least for me. I don't blame Blizzard or anything.
---
yeah, you can get a decent test going by limiting the number of servers.
---
Considering Classic is under the same umbrella in terms of architecture as retail, it's doubtful.
---
Gotta get to brill in &lt;50minutes!
---
Because immersion
---
And this is why we whooped your ass in a war, so we could have the freedom to say fuck that. Now the US is the most powerful country in the world and we still don't have an official language.
---
If Blizzards happens to actively manage the quantity of layers for first few weeks then sure problem is solved...its all easy in theory.
---
Contrary to what people here are saying, stopping support on an OS doesn't mean they prevent the game from running on it. It simply means that running the game on it is unsupported and as such, you won't get any assistance from them if you have any problems running it.
---
For shits and giggles let's assume it's 8 for NA as well (it will probably be more but I'm not that concerned if there's less); 1 RP server, 1 RP-PvP server, 3 PvP servers, and 3 PvE servers. 
---
So, for servers that actually matter, there's 1 in 3 chance of rolling on a server that doesn't have a streamer you personally don't care for. The salt will be quite interesting to witness on this sub just due to people coming to terms that no matter what they're likely going to have to be dealing with whatever bullshit comes with someone that can pull a 3k+ viewership.
---
Shieldslam was added in patch 1.6 (BWL). That's why most tanks were arms-prot hybrids before. Likewise, Bloodthirst in fury tree was changed to its current state in 1.6. Before 1.6 Bloodthirst was bad for raiding.
---
Ill propably make a Shaman called "Thex". Maybe a Troll aswell!
---
I am forsaken
---
I love his, adventurous. It shows the real vision they had with vanilla
---
you forgot the last part
---
"And fuck European RP-PvP players btw"
---
So you think that I could run it on Windows XP?
---
And my axe ..
---
(Well probably more like my staff as I'm thinking 'lock) EU  here too.
---
Heretic!
---
You are confusing a low-pop server with a full server (2-3k)
---
Private megaservers are miserable experience, arguably as bad as retail in terms of authenticity.
---
I tend to view my characters as their own entities, not as me. So I’ll be creating new names as I would feel weird recreating my exact old toon from when I first started wow.
---
Even if, going online on a PC with windows XP is a masive security risk. This OS has been unsupported by Microsoft for a long time and is wide open to any attacker.
---
Just use a windows XP skin for windows 10 and call it a day to get the full experience. Check this guide: https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/make-windows-10-look-like-windows-xp/
---
You could always go for a 2560x1080 21:9 monitor. The game looks amazing in ultrawide
---
Just ditch your casual shitters friends.
---
https://m.imgur.com/r/classicwow/vnbdxi7 heres what happened on a private server that will be closing when classic releases.
---
(I think this is what you're after?)[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/accountant-classic]
---
A pro would be just being able to start your raid at the appointed time without having to fight / corpsewalk your way to the entrance.
---
A con would be missing the fun of delaying the oppositions raid times by making them fight / corpsewalk their way to the entrance.
---
Now i need cell shading filter in wow
---
Is „shit name“ a synonym for „most desired“ to you?
---
Real OG AV lasted for more than just 1-3 hours, you could log off at night and enter the same AV the following day.
---
I don’t think the top bar is too bad. It’s quite sleek and uninvasive, and has a lot of useful information on it
---
&gt; Because Windows XP is better for Classic experience. (In my opinion)
---
Did you buy your 4:3 CRT monitor already?
---
Sadly, not vanilla, and not a quest item. :((
---
Finally, we may rejoice!
---
Wanted to try playing a shaman... Rather limits your faction choice at that point!

Get 1440p 144hz with gsync/freesync and never look back. They cost around $250-300 for a decent one
---
\&gt;axe
---
\&gt;picture of a sword
---
No, most desired is a subset of shit names though.
---
Why bother? just kill mobs and gain gold while levelling up.
---
I'm not paying money so I can do them a favor.  
---
If they want beta testers, the absolute least they could do is make it available to people without demanding the subscription for it.  
---
For reference, beta testing is a profession. There are people out there *right now* employed in this way.  
---
Activision expects us to not only do this for them for FREE but to even PAY THEM? For the *honor* of  doing them a favor? Fuck that.
---
You won't trick me. Trying to get me to excercise and not grind so you can take all the glory while the rest of us are doing yoga!!
---
As in creating new content for level 60 or open TBC servers.. what's the problem with that? This isn't new information, they've already said as much.
---
This 100%
---
What about Paladin? There’s a fun build that can let you do a healing/damage build called shockadin. Though it was decent in vanilla the shockadin really took off in TBC
---
That would be very useful to have! Any idea if that'll work on classic?
---
How are those things in any way related?
---
1440p 144hz. Accept no substitute. Even if you have to wait a month, it'll be worth it.
---
Yes, they want all the characters to expire. The refresh period has shortened, the notifications have become less frequent, and the recovery process if you missed the deadline is no longer available.
---
Latest? You have more art like this? 😁 Really loving it a lot!
---
Not to sound ironic, a simple Kobold Worker from the starting camp gets you 5 copper. Pickpocketing them before 30.  I was thinking about leveling in MoD just so I can pickpocket Aggro mobs. I don't know how effective of an approach is that.
---
Framerate &gt; resolution, across all games. I'd put money on the fact that anyone who says otherwise doesn't actually have a monitor capable of that output so they've never seen 144+ FPS in action.
---
That guide will be better for leveling... once the hype dies down and the starting zones arent filled up. But yeah people need to know how to deal with a filled up starting zone otherwise they are going to take hours just to hit level 5. Random party with people, avoid non mandatory quests.
---
I don't think any addons do that in classic, or at least I've not seen one, loads of quest tracking addons that you could use alongside one of the many guides like [classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live/leveling) etc.
---
4GB RAM limit with 2GB per application limit, on an unsafe OS that has been end of life for 5 years..
---
Ways to get your account stolen while getting 15fps.
---
How do you explain 5? Makes little sense in my world (along with the rest)
---
I'll be duo leveling with my Warlock irl friend. I recommend switching to Horde (because we're cooler and I see you're an alliance player) and getting a duo partner as a warrior.
---
Picture of warrior class icon....
---
This post confuses me. Classic was announced in November 2017...
---
Halwin’s sure gonna love this
---
Fantastic, really captures the spirit of those times.
---
good luck with that EU!
---
Ah, right. Ty.
---
There is a retail version, but I have linked the classic one.
---
If this model works, we may see blizzard releasing future expansions on new servers each time, instead of on top of existing servers. With shared infrastructure on the cloud, it’s going to scale pretty well. So I believe classic will stay as one of the feature branch.
---
It’s different from d2 as wow is subscription based
---
I'm wondering if hunter is just going to be a liability in dungeon spam groups, needing ammo means that they might have to leave the dungeon to get more every so often and everyone else has to wait for them.
---
Like why would you willingly play horde?!
---
You don't see how a completely unoriginal name is shit?
---
OP here. Yes, just a screenshot of the trailer, timed to the frame to get the most stable, wide-angle shot, cut to 1080p and carefully edited in Lightroom to get more contrast, localized sharpness, and dusted an annoying snowflake off the Dwarf's cloak. But I didn't do that for karma points, I did it because I wanted a WoW classic wallpaper and I had to upload it somewhere. Cheer up!
---
hmm yeah im looking at a 1440p 144hz now that is ~$160 more than what I was going to spend, maybe ill just do this and 'future proof' myself even tho I have no intention to upgrade anytime soon
---
we are still recruiting holy Priest
---
That was an amazing read. The standing in line for roaming fingers really got me.
---
What? No. Most RP servers have very good pop. Especially in vanilla. After TBC when the world started to be more "solo" content RP started to die out, and when phasing came it pretty much killed it (even if it was fixed it didn't really matter, it was dead).
---
Blizzard killed RP servers by changing the game in a way that didn't really work well for the server type.
---
Vanilla is perfect just for that. So RP-PvP will always be high pop.

There isn't a huge difference in practicality, but if you look at it from a numbers perspective, "a couple" which I interpret as 2+, makes a combined 4+. 2-3 months in comparison would shorten the lifespan of the first phases by a whopping 25-50%+. So while I do agree that it might be a little pedantic because in reality the time will fly by, it's a huge difference in terms of raw numbers :p
---
It'll be absolutely fine. Long haul circuit infrastructure is way different than it was in '05.
---
The point is that this map was made before Naxx was originally released.
---
Yeah, christmas at the very earliest imo
---
Administrative burden? What? They changed a couple values in a some code and now more and more characters get deleted. There's no burden, they just want to shut the game down.
---
Either you’re just learning English or you’re operating at a 3rd grade level. Best of luck to you.
---
If you want the true classic experience, go for a CRT.
---
Why destroy Hearth?
---
Is „Krissam“ in it’s own sub category?
---
This IS the classic wow launch we're talking about, though. I reckon it might draw more people than the stress test. How many stress test servers were there, though?
---
Yeah that’s not gonna happen LFR is one the reasons people wanted Classic. Toggle-able graphics are like addons - you don’t have to use them.
---
Why would you destroy the hearthstone, what effect would this have?
---
I will be rolling a human war, i took off from work  the 26th - 28th but have to work at 6pm central on the 29th so can get 6 plus hours to play depending on start time for the day, i then have 30th off till the 2nd then work the 3rd then off till the 5th, after that i am back on my normal work schedule of 3rd shift 10pm to 6am, if this works for u let me kno
---
I haven't tested it personally, but if it's the same as  the nelf area, you won't have an issue on classic, standing about waiting for it to respawn
---
Shadow resist aura plus heals. In early phases spell power gear has low stam so you have low dmg or are squishy.
---
good luck getting my name...
---
I reckon you could probably even build a decent MMO using the Minecraft engine.
---
This looks exactly like a screenshot I took... time to dig for it.
---
Classic is also near the greatest Trailer ever for me, just for the Feeling
---
But Wrath man... that's still the best for me, just for the sake of Arthas. And you really have a Feeling when u watch Wrath that many many Years of Character Progression flows just right into the Trailer you know? But yeah Classic and Wrath are my favorites.
---
Sounds like you're the kind of guy that belongs on a PvP server 100%
---
What makes troll warriors harder on private servers is that you can only learn 2h weapons at level 10+. But this is not the case in real Vanilla/Classic WOW, so you could farm up enough money at the beginning to wield a two-hander. This should make things quicker (like undead/orcs).
---
Rs3 players hated osrs players at the start and this will be the same but eventually both sides just stop caring and enjoy what they have and it will be the same in this case aswell.
---
Spriest are pretty gear dependent, but so is everyone else. The thing is, shadow priests are often, and should, be last to gear in raids. So getting rank 10 gear / benediction during P2 is vital, you can do respectable damage with that set up pretty much until P5/6.
---
No chance. Every single person who thinks layering will be the death of the game would flock to those servers and fuck them.
---
The only thing I want more than classic release right now is an official "Classic WotLK" confirmed announcement...
---
This looks somewhat like the Borderlands 2 art style. Was confused at first
---
do you still not understand that spawns are not synced?  
---
a mob doesn't spawn in all layers at the same time.  there's a chance that it could, but with a respawn time between 3-5 days that chance is *very* unlikely, even with dozens of spawns.
---
People will have done everything there is to do in the game within ~5 years. What are they going to do for the next 10 with absolutely no new content? I think you’re underestimating how long 10 years is in gaming terms. MMOs are a niche these days, so the amount of new players starting will slowly decrease as well. Even on the biggest private servers in the past few months, there were  ~2/3k maximum online at a time (lower new due to classic launching) which isn’t even close to the capacity of a single official Classic server. 
---
Furthermore, there will be a lot of new games for people to play by then. I wouldn’t count the game as “Alive” if there’s only 1 or 2 servers because all the others died due to people quitting as a result of a lack of new content.
---
Thank you! I couldnt have said it better myself.
---
&gt;Reply
---
If I had to guess id say that its probably a fuck ton harder to code a bfa server than it would be for a vanilla server but yeah I do agree it wouldnt be as popular either way.
---
When you stop dreaming about work (it's not a nightmare, but it's not a dream) and dream about wow classic
---
WARcraft meant something in vanilla....get some friends who want to play on a real server.
---
That's for orks, not orcs. I swear to God if they made a 40k MMO I would never leave my house.
---
&gt; How many stress test servers were there, though?
---
3
---
Classic launch will have 8 per region (as per leak) for a total of 16 for US and EU.
---
Leveling a paladin as holy doesn't necessarily mean healing only. Holy has a bunch of QoL talents as well as damage talents - which when compared to ret isn't too far behind leveling speed-wise. As you say, you can heal dungeons as ret, probably true, but not in higher level dungeons
---
For me it was Vurtne that made me want to play mage
---
You think you do, but you dont.
---
But at least you're playing a race you prefer to play. If you're playing orc for the stun resist, and the stun resist isn't working, you're going to be hating your decision.
---
I loved this guy, hi was one of the best classic yotubers but his last videos are complete trash.
---
What phase are you talking about? If all content is released then I'd be very surprised if a BiS list didn't consist almost entirely of Naxx/AQ40 gear, if we're in first phase there is no PvP gear at all so none of it is on a BiS list.
---
That one actually confuses me a little. Didn't the orcs drink the fel blood for greater strength and fury? Shouldn't the mag'har be weaker, otherwise what was the point of the blood in the first place?
---
2fa makes being hacked by a random person nearly impossible.
---
Saw the post about Thex and liked the name
---
True, but Thunder Bluff has trainers for non-Tauren classes in a section under one of the mesas. I don't recall exactly what's there but there's a bunch of Forsaken so there's probably Priest, Mage, Warlock and Rogue.
---
"huh, whats this... oh... shit... fuck... fuck... shit. shit."
---
Idk if there is one. Stam, str, crit, a fucking huge 2h weapon, engineering, a friendly healer, and you're pretty much set.
---
You'll also need to go ALL the way back to Org to learn shaman abilities every 2 levels. It's not worth it 1-
---
&gt;or, whether we'll have ClassicPlus. 
---
Could they establish multiple timelines in BFA give us new Classic material with classic mechanics?  I would not only stay subscribed but also buy stock.
---
That's only when looking at different aspect ratios, 1440p and 1080p are both 16:9.
---
Me too. As a veteran of several launches, yeah, the struggle sucked initially, but you learn to appreciate the grand zerg scale of things and such a crowd of players feels pretty epic. The rush dies down in less than a week anyway after which starting areas were perfectly viable even on 11k player single-layer servers. I'm not against some amount of layering as mitigation but they should not set the goal of eliminating the rush entirely with a phonebook's worth of layers.
---
You're kidding right? The R13 gear has less offensive stats than Naxx/Late AQ40 gear, compare wowclassicbis.com and look, you've got double the strength on some of these Naxx pieces compared to their R13 equivalent.
---
Now some of the late game BiS items are a bit janky, Onslaught girdle from Rag etc, but generally speaking the BiS PvE list is also going to be the BiS PvP list (Until you take things like trinkets, engineering items and weird effects into account)
---
Maybe, and almost certainly no.
---
No kid, it isn't. Go take your 1440p monitor, put it into windowed mode, take a screenshot, switch to 1080p, and take another. They'll be completely different.
---
I thought it was because he didn't want to play classic at all, but it is because he wants to play it so bad and don't want other people to ruin his experience :P
---
Ca1
---
Just kill every gnome you see. They're all abominations.
---
yes it will. At least, that's what they instruct for you to download on the blue post for the stress test.
---
Anything but playing Shaman determining that?  I was full on Alliance at launch but I'm wavering atm on what faction I'm gonna be for Classic launch.
---
Have there been any other updates, changes or analysises of this?
---
jesus fucking christ, have you ordered 56k internet already?
---
You can also download it without the subscription, then activate your sub an hour or so before servers go live
---
I will play 30/0/21 and i will only respec to raid for naxx if it's really needed for progression. I might lose a little compared to an optimal resto shaman, but shaman are so sought after in raid that i don't care anyway.
---
I had “rivendare” and “moltencore” as bank alts, but it didn’t let me make “supermario” (said it was offensive when I tried).  
---
I always found what is acceptable or not weird
---
The only ones i really need are trinket menu and buff timers. I'll try to run without DBM and memorize all the boss mechanics.
---
Does it works if the game is in french/spanish/russian/martian  or is it for pure english only?thanks :D
---
Much better. Thank you.
---
Yes, partly I played Vanilla a lot. I feel I got everything I could from the alliance side, there are no surprises there. So along with trying a new class, I will get to see new quests and new stories and hopefully make Classic feel like a new version of Vannila for me.
---
Slayerxx
---
I actually disagree with a lot of what you said, I think there have been many companies that have created compelling mmos and worlds - they just didn’t have the Blizzard machine behind them. 
---
Some of the mistakes other development teams have made have killed the game very quickly whereas Blizzard can make the same mistakes and ‘get away with it’ for a lack of a better term. I also don’t think it’s a coincidence that some of WoW’s rivals over the years created systems that Blizzard implemented after the rival game died. Blizzard are a company of polish and not a company of innovation.
---
I raise you Afternoon August 26th!
---
Tauren = PvP (Hoofstomp OP, more HP).
---
NE = PvE (For feral you are right beside Gnomer for the manual crowd pummelor, Kings and Wisdom for Resto/Balance is excellent for raids, more int at 60).
---
muh slippery slope
---
They should call it Babel.
---
Thought about it as well, but the only abilities I would go back to OG for would be new ranks of Stoneskin, Rockbiter and Flame Shock.
---
So I think I'd be safe for a couple of level after I leave with the earth totem quest done?
---
Sounds awesome, but i think i will play with my hungarian friends on a hun server (if there will be any)
---
Life man..
---
They're both important, which is why I play an Undead Warrior.
---
Serious question: is anyone going Alliance for classic? Will I be the only one?
---
Unexpected goblin slayer?
---
The first 37 seconds of this trailer remind me that Vanilla came out right after Fellowship of the Rings.
---
I believe Onoxium is talking more about AQ 40 and especially Naxx. 
---
I agree that the early raid content (Onyxia, MC, ZG) will be pugged to some degree, but at some point you simply need the numbers to down the bosses. And the moment the guild realizes that they have to trim some fat (because it keeps wiping at 10%), they will look at the Ele Shamans, Ret Paladins and Spriests first.
---
So it all depends what you want to do. MC till BWL? Aynthing goes in my experience, as long as you have a brain. Beyond that? Numbers matter.
---
It is especially fun with a Zandalarian Hero Charm and t3 gear.  You can instant pop anything every 3 minutes.  It was fucking hilarious.
---
Which mod hurt you? Haha j/k. 
---
At least you can find solace in the fact that you won't need this reddit anymore in 3 weeks
---
Hell yes!
---
ultrawide monitor 21:9
---
Cool, definitely get that new vanilla feel in for the relaunch.
---
Hey, sorry for noobing but whats the difference between a normal pvp server and a RP pvp server? Thanks!
---
One of my friends was reported for being called Sadist. Then he changed it to Masochist and apparently that was fine.
---
Crist the graphics, im gonna miss updates spells and character models
---
LOL. it wont be worth 100k. Maybe 3 to 10k.
---
Happy cake day! :  )
---
RP rules regarding naming, AFAIK.
---
TPS (assuming you mean threat) is more or less is the ceiling which limits the potential damage output of your raid (because if your raiders out-threat you, they pull aggro and everything goes to hell). Of course, this is assuming your raid can actually put out enough damage to do more aggro than you whilst tanking. You generally won't need to worry about Rogues/Hunters pulling aggro (because they can wipe it) but other classes (e.g. Warlocks, Warriors) aren't quite as lucky (short of getting a battleres and wiping threat via death).  Another way to look at it would be that you (as the tank) are the 'speed limit signs' and and the 'damage dealers' are those unreasonable people who will play chicken with the speed limit. The more TPS you put out the higher the speed limit, but then you have those crazy people who want to do 0-100 in under 2 seconds within a 50-zone (which just ends badly for everyone  because they don't understand moderation).

HP (and effective health) is just essentially how much of a beating you can sustain before you're at risk of dying. The more health (and effective health) you have as a tank the longer you can survive on your own without healing, whether that's because you're  negating damage or just outright getting kicked in the nuts and still smiling.
---
In theory, if your raid can deal more damage in a smaller window of time your health (and endurance due to health) is less important because there will be less chance of you dying (less total boss attacks vs whatever your raid can throw your way to keep you alive). It's like a Paladin who bubbles on 1HP and then steam-rolls you. It doesn't matter if they're quite literally getting by on the skin of their teeth, the fact is they live for as long as they need to to get the job done.
---
By design, races with weapon skills can get  higher TPS (just, due to game mechanics), that doesn't make it a significant difference though and there are plenty of trivial things raiders can do if they were legitimately worried about over-aggroing a tank (of course, people would just rather blame the tank).
---
I just wonder, do games still make money? I mean those one time payment games? If yes, then MMOs should also make money. Example; FFXIV which is a horrible MMO in my opinion but can still retain players. What if an MMORPG was released by a developer who knows what an MMO should be (like Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen which is THE MMORPG to play once it's released).
---
Problems with MMORPGs are not the fact that they take a long time and are too expensive to develop (that's a fact and a problem) but the main problem is that corporations are greedy and rather just develop cheap to make games that nets a lot of money; hence, why Blizzard went Diablo Immortal.
---
Mobile games are making an insane amount of cash for a really puny budget. That made companies like Blizzard cancel Project Titan (their next big MMO after WoW) and create Hearthstone, Overwatch...etc.
---
MMORPGs now have returned back to the garage and only developers with passion will create one; like Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen.
---
I've heard that hunters scale worse than mages, so they tended to do better relatively when undergeared.
---
And why people say language its going to be a problem? I mean, it was also going to be in a normal pvp server wasnt it?
---
 Preach, brother, preach.
---
 Never drop the mic, you SPEAK the truth, you ooze it.
---
 Blizzard made the game, you get it? They actually made game so thats already huge news, if they didnt we would of had no game at all. They gave us EU and NA AAAAAND Oceanic servers when all we asked was any server even if it was in Africa. This company made servers for us to enjoy. They ran a beta that lasted to level 40 without raids or any significant dungeon, but who cares, we had asmongold raiding nipsoutbaby crew, how epic is that ????  They ran multiple stress tests and SUMMONED RAGNAROS, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM THE DEVS YOU UNGRATEFUL FUCKS??? THEY DIDNT EVEN MADE GAME P2W.
---
 Sorry, got a bit heated, when people dont appreciate activision blizzard enaugh it kinda gets on my nerves.
---
 Seriously though, who cares about bugs, nerfed raids with 1,12 itemization and talents etc... the main thing to focus is that game exists and its not p2w and that they are making servers at all.
---
I got a warning for using the name «Firemaw» back in vanilla, so I dont think its allowed.
---
I played 20/0/31 Ret pala as a healer in raids thru all of vanilla. 100% viable and when ur not raiding u can smash ppl up in bgs or whatever. All you need is 2 item sets
---
Borderlands: Barrens vs. the World.
---
That's weird
---
Yeah I know fishing can make you a pretty coin. I'm just not a huge fan of semi-afk activities in games.
---
You don't need the talent if you're going to be sneaking up on mobs from behind (or using distract).
---
In the end, the player retention is driven by one of two things:
---
Fresh server launches, to start the leveling and gearing process over with a new economy, much like a ladder reset in D2.
---
New content, to let you develop your character further and try new raids/abilities/metas.
---
They're going to have to take one of these routes eventually - I think especially pserver players are more addicted to constant FRESH servers than they'd like to admit.
---
Hopefully 6d for me. Count 8-10 if you haven't played recently and are not following a guide
---
"Son, we need to talk."
---
As if I could forgetti.
---
I got ganked and corpse camped plenty on Twisting Nether. Not so much on Illidan, but that server has heavily imbalanced in favor of the Horde so it's probably not a fair comparison.
---
You are 100% wrong lmao. The REAL raiders lean into the fact that you can abuse windfury totems after a certain gear threshhold, meaning theres no way alliance can keep up damage wise with Horde once the threat is under control. The ONLY reason to go ally is because it's easier initially due to salv blessings, anyone claiming otherwise simply does not understand how a min max environment/high end raiding works at all.
---
For pve it’s actually pretty easy
---
Troll for horde
---
Human for alliance
---
If you want to do some pvp orc is a  ice choice for horde. It’s not far behind trolls in pve and insane for pvp
---
[http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)
---
can’t believe I got shivers reading a Reddit comment chain, this is so dumb wtf
---
Just to piggy-back.  This is why so many people like human warriors for pve.  The weapon skill converts to a higher effective ilvl.  
---
For horde, I might argue Tauren for the stomp, but I don't think horde even have a pve race for warriors.
---
It’s incorrect for the same reason that speaking like a Shakespeare character in 2019 would be incorrect. Old =/= right.
---
We are going to have English, French, German, Russian servers. Only one RP-PvP server. I don't know if it will be a big problem.
---
This is awesome, I'd love if they made a remastered version that looked like this. Excellent work.
---
Wow....what a sad state to miss one of the biggest parts of the game.
---
I feel bad. I would roll away from my friends. Fuck not rolling on a PvP server and if they want to miss out, whatever.
---
Burning Steps and BRM. I'm a college student in music scoring and Composition, the soundtracks that play in that general area are so impressive and inspiring to me. You know what, im gonna get on YouTube and listen to them right now... Jason Hayes is an absolute legend, and is as impactful as Jeff Kaplan or even Chris Metzen imo. He absolutely nailed every track to the environments in which they play. You don't really notice the soundtrack until it's quiet, that's how you know it's truly legendary.
---
my only concern is that my rx580 may not be powerful enough for it?
---
This
---
I do enjoy your content and consider you an good mage but, i also do know you that you ve got a reputation for being opinionated. I know greater mages than both you and me like Lolwtf have said that the matchup is just unfair. Perhaps a bad mage vs an equally bad rogue has the advantage due to the rogue class skyrocketing based on player skill but a good mage vs an equally good rogue has no chance in my books. Also, since your guide is more about world pvp instead of dueling, how come you chose places where there’s no models around for the rogue to abuse LoS? 
---
Maybe it would prove your point better by having 10 duels with full cds vs a skilled rogue instead of having your friends take dives for your video. 
---
PS: You said “if the rogue gets his second blind off” , what kind of self respecting rogue fails to get his second blind on a duel?
---
It's probably a good bet everyone who is excited about classic is over 30 bmi.
---
I'm 6'2" 330 lbs so yeah I'm over 30 bmi.
---
...
---
if you're like that dude tryin to run it in Windows XP, def gonna have some security issues. Otherwise, keep your OS updated with security patches, run av scans, and use 2FA on your account and email (SMS 2FA can be social engineered, I would jsut use the authenticator app).
---
A tribute to the best game ever made, hands down!
---
"Nothing like" is straight up emotional  hyperbole.
---
Holy shit there's only millions of those in existence!
---
I agree, but there are a lot of nay sayers! They don’t really have a leg to stand on though because a toggle-able graphics options effect the game less than addons do.
---
Anyone know what the go to RP profile addon is for classic?
---
it’s called windows xp
---
Nope, even then no chance vs hardiness 
---
Nuff said
---
Love the Wow Classic Devs. Hate Blizzact.
---
Thats win10 with a skin ...
---
You'll get better gear and you will level faster, the firsts 10-15 levels can be hard. Warrior is a gear check.
---
Oh I see. Thank you!
---
TIL there are two flights paths in Duskwood.
---
Female NE op though
---
I remember a lot of lagging and people appearing to be in places where they weren't, but that can look like leeway too
---
What makes it worse is some of them are actually saying they won't roll a pvp realm because the pvp is not fair XD One actually said they would consider rolling a PVP server if they got a full heal and it reset all cooldowns each time you fought a horde I kid you not :l
---

STV arena chest?
---
LaYeRiNg wIlL FiX iT!
---
Will blizzard balance the weaker classes? Or everyone and their mom will make rogue/warrior?
---
Gonna need a few more x's in that if you really wanna be an edgelord
---
You can finish your starting area before moving to Shadowglen. You'll still be low level enough to get full rep on quests.
---
I don’t know if I would call players on RP realms more mature, and I’ve played on Moon Guard and Wyrmrest Accord for a loooong time. 
---
The community on these servers is way more active and chatty than any PvE/PvP servers I’ve been on with tons of events and people grouping up for content, but you still see 24/7 “Le Donald vs Bernie xdxdxd” in Trade like anywhere else. It’s just also accompanied by fashion show spam, world PvP events, Gilneas RP, and Goldshire jokes.
---
Lol nope
---
This is amazing thanks alot!
---
3440x1440 ultrawide 75-60Hz display.
---
Orcs becuse of axe skill and their wep skill bonuses. Horde have their own issues with no salv and totems meaning that dps produces crazy threat, but you'd need to ask someone else as I'm no expert on the details.
---
Yeah it prevents you from naming your character after lore figures and extends the griefing rules to constantly interrupting other’s RP. At least that’s how it is on retail RP-PVP.
---
Record is 4 days 20h and 50 min. Everything else is private server bs with different xp. We will see how the dungeon spamm works once classic is released. Even the record was done in 7 days real life with 5h sleep per day.
---
At this time they were the most broken of any class at any time...it was just plain stupid
---
Besides, what makes holy good at healing is that u get mana back after you crit, which you dont do much before having good gear at 60
---
But my stapler... I mean But paladins can definitely tank dungeons. It's just that the group needs to not be idiots and give the pally 5 seconds to build agro
---
I’m more excited for the overall leveling experience and making WoW friends again lol
---
What about lore characters from other universes? My dank hunter name Xlegolasx is central to the enjoyment of my RP.
---
The stat weights were based off a spreadsheet in the paladin discord. That particular build was focused on raiding and staying high mana, so they prioritized intellect and crit for the Illumination talent and mp5. 
---
It sounds like this spreadsheet does not align with most bis lists, so I will look into changing the default holy paladin stat weights. 
---
In the meantime, you can create our own stat weights. There is a dropdown for stats weights, and you can select "add new". Once you tweak the stats to you liking all of the results will be based on the new stats.
---
That's new.
---
OEF 2013.
---
This is really fantastic! For some reason your art style gives me a Borderlands vibe too. It could just be the vibrancy of colours and details like the Troll's hair, Orc's skin and that staff against the beige landscape though.
---
Are you genuinely dumb?
---
Perhaps it's like NASA's mission control, everybody calmly talking under a tremendous amount of stress.
---
finally someone noticed ;) that's what inspired me
---
I mean it isn't a man...
---
Umm, not too far behind? Ok. As holy you get 10% strength, 10% int, 15% bonus to SoR and JoR dmg, consecration (horribly mana inefficient unless you use it to aoe), imp wisdom (4-5 mp5), 5% holy crit (only affects JoR and holy shock) and holy shock a 30sec cd weak instead spell.
---
Ret gets 15% cheaper seals, 2 sec less judgement cd, 3% parry, Seal of Command, 5% crit, 8% movement speed, 6% weapon dmg bonus, 10% holy dmg, 15% dmg bonus on crit for 8 seconds and repentance.
---
And that's supposed to be close?
---
Regarding your hybrid build, can't really assess that unless you use a talent calc like [Bobo](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/), which shows the pick order. But on first glance, doesn't look great to me. Imp SoR and SoC is redundant. Imp Sotc is big question mark, especially as you don't get imp judgement.
---
I'm pretty sure there's no 1h axe that a tank would want.  Even if you do have axe skill increases.
---
step one: roll shaman
---
Step two: learn earth shock
---
Step three: spam earth shock on named quest mobs
---
Step four: decline every invite
---
That's not reportable
---
and mages
---
&gt;My experience has been that the most chill people play tauren, dwarf and troll.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The least chill people tend to play male undead, female humans and female night elves.
---
oddly enough I can totally relate to this.
---
Id imagine that will be a fair few years away considering they would do tbc first and thats after we are on phase 6 of vanilla so gonna be a while my friend.
---
By far the largest demographic is 25 to 35 so not under ten really. Even the lowest end of that is 10/11.
---
Still true that loads sucked though, part of the fun.
---
Over kill dude lol
---
As a mage is good to do skinning,tailoring while leveling and send tailor items to alt for disenchant and get enchant instead of skinning at max level? Does skinning  + tailoring bags make me enough money for mount at 40?
---
Who do you think is taking the picture?
---
What? So if I prefer the new AV I should play AB or WSG? That's some serious reaching. 
---
At any rate I'm pleased I'm getting the AV I enjoy.
---
Dwarf and gnome are my two favorite races :) never played human or elf
---
That was the scene that made me roll my first character as a Dwarf Hunter, good memories.
---
To be real tho, the things we asked for, like this one, are no brainers that should never have been in question. I’m ecstatic that they listened, but let’s not get caught up in thinking their doing us some favor by being sensible. Praise them for it, but keep perspective.
---
I first started on a PvE server. It's really annoying to be out looking for PVP and an member on the opposing faction runs up to you, jumping all over you and /spitting at you, and there's nothing you can do about it. It really killed the immersion of the game for me. Having played on PVP servers ever since, I would never go back. There are too many great things that come from a server that is not restricted in such a way. You just miss out on a huge core part of the game if your not on a PVP server. If my old best friend came back and said he was playing on a PVE server, I would still roll on a PVP server. The quality difference is that big.
---
Extremely well done! This is on another level from most of the fanart you see around reddit.
---
Scandinavians speak english almost as good as native english speakers anyway.
---
Financial independence. Only 1% will ever get it.
---
Why are people buying new graphic cards for 15years old game :D
---
Yeah I know, it's a distant dream...
---
Is that a graphics card from 2006?
---
This is correct, there are at least two priest trainers in the spirit rise, both undead. Probably some other class trainers for non tauren classes too.
---
Proportions and cell shading are too perfect, as well as the repetition of forms — the sausage and backpacks are exactly identical for example. Probably a 3d render.
---
Fair enough, me neither really, but I love multitasking so I'll just use it to watch some netflix or YouTube or listen to some new albums
---
Kevin Jordan designed the classes :P
---
As for both SoC and imp SoR for using both fast and slow 2h throughout leveling. It's only one point extra. 
---
Is the 2 seconds really worth it compared to the extra parry chance? 
---
Would [this](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/) be better considering?
---
I was going to say, it’s been a few days since I saw one of these posts...
---
I for one always thought it was really weird role playing realms weren't pvp.
---
I mean, you are role playing in a world centered on conflict between the horde and alliance and when you meet the other faction out in the world you are supposed to give them a high five?
---
Its like a warhammer role playing without the heresy!
---
Congrats on the new card
---
Race is not that important for raid spots in most guilds, unless it's an alliance guild who is short on dwarf priests. People who say "irregardless" need to be shunned though.
---
I leveled 3 Warriors on Nost, Ely and Lighbringer and for a while I planned on playing Warrior again in Classic until I asked myself: WHY? So now I'm playing Warlock and will twink up a Warrior as my 3rd Char.
---
They bearly made it
---
&gt;How much layer a realm can handle,
---
More than they need. The layers are going away by phase two or sooner, so each server will only have enough layers for the players expected to quit during phase one. 
---
&gt;they do not have unlimited server to host infinite layer,
---
If they wanted to they could get this in a matter of hours. 
---
&gt;what will happen ?
---
Server queues.
---
Forsen if he decides to play.
---
My take on this is that mage is supposed to be able to blink if immobilizing effect is applied on him on top of the blanket silence. A lot of things in vanilla and quirky and weird that's why we love this game.
---
If you're going 1440p at above 60+ fps, this card should do great! Overkill for 1080p though.
---
In my opinion it doesn't completely compare with reality. Boss fight lengths wont always be 4 minutes, armor and resistance values will  vary and ass you said debuff slots does have it affects.  Another thing that affects it quite a lot is for example the fact that he doesn't include execute with is quite a larger bulk of dps for warriors and he uses poisons for his rogues which probably wont be allowed in raids.
---
Also mages wont be able to go fire for the first 2 raid tiers because of the fire resistance of mobs and hence they loose quite a large number of dps. Then again it could be argued if raids should be the only measuring scale for dps.
---
And in my opinion the difference of 100-200 in dps between is quite large, for example the difference in his videos between an pre-raid warrior and a pre-raid ret paladin is 67%.
---
I would however agree with you on that the "non-conventional" specs aren't as bad as people often describe them.
---
Go in hard if servers cant handle it?
---
You need the sub to help testing the stability
---
&gt;For horde, I might argue Tauren for the stomp, but I don't think horde even have a pve race for warriors.
---
For absolute best TPS, troll. Orc has nice +weapon skill racial, but the problem is that there really arent that many great AXES for tanking. Tauren +5% HP is nice, for raiding, if you need stomp you are already doing something wrong.
---
Those tar elementals that keep disarming you in un'goro or that silithid pox that those bugs in shimmering flats give, +42% melee damage taken and lasts for 30 minutes.
---
Can relate. Have fun playing :).
---
I hear warriors are hard!
---
The default-stat-weights look really decent for most classes but for holy-paladin they look completely off. Especially when it comes to Int.
---
I will definitely make use of that tool later on with custom stat-weights.
---
Your best bet is probably asking in WoW Economy, lots of guys over there who specialize with this kinda stuff.
---
It's not high. Average adult in the USA watches TV 5 hours per day. That would be 35 hours per week.
---
Indeed. Just get the paramedics in to perform CPR when your heart gave out. On a fresh Heart-Battery pack you can easily dive in that game another 80 hours without sleep.
---
Logging out.. pff, lol.
---
After getting a 144hz I couldnt stare at a 60hz monitor. Even if you dont play FPS the general feeling is so good.
---
Also do we get to keep our toons we make now ? 
---
When the servers launch live ?
---
"...a simple resource..."
---
That's what a lot of people look for in a reddit with 150.000+ members. Everything that is shared this way won't work on live servers. Same with leveling routes etc.
---
You might consider to work against all the suggestions made here to make extra cash. You won't achieve that with making what everyone else does...
---
Nice, I have the exact same goal. Full T1 hunter with Rohk'Delar!
---
„stretch your harmstrings as hard as you can.“
---
yeah, sure, will do! 😜
---
The only difference between a PvE and a PvP server (in real terms) is the ability for you to 'gank' others. If you flag yourself for PvP there's fundamentally no difference (assuming you were never the aggressor).
---
I totally forgot about the attack speed buff.  Trolls are definitely best, as long as you're hit capped
---
Imp SoR is a really bad talent and don't worry about fast or slow 2h weapons. You can easily create a weapon progression order, which provides you with SoC sutiable weapons until 60. You don't even need that many. You get Verigans Fist on 20, then Rock Pulverizer in the Badlands at 35, Bonebiter from Scarlet Monastery at ~38-39, one of the Uldaman weapons at 44 and that's it. Except for the Uldaman drops all of those weapons are quest rewards, so easy to get and the Uldaman drops are so good, you should do the dungeon until you get one of them as they can take you all the way to 60.
---
The link for your talent build doesn't work. Bobo doesn't update the URL, yo ucan find the sharable link below the talent calc.
---
Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
---
I'm assuming we'll have EU english (UK) and EU english (INT), otherwise the english servers are gonna be flooded with small non-english speaking communities that don't have their own servers.
---
Note: shouldve probably mentioned it was meant as a joke. I just needed a new gpu, regardless of classic.
---
You have all phases set in stone. So you could stack up on items in phase 2 that will be in high demand in phase 3 etc.
---
No you don't keep your characters, or even names
---
I'll take "exchange +hit for Stamina" for $100 Alex
---
Use this: https://www.classicwowbuilds.com/bis?boe=&amp;classs=128&amp;itemLevel=&amp;lvl1=&amp;lvl2=&amp;lvl3=&amp;phase=1&amp;raid=&amp;reqLevel=60&amp;spec=fire&amp;statWeight=default
---
You have to make your own stat-weights though. This is fore PvE, so it doesn't value Stamina at all. But you can modify the stat-weighs and enter like a 2 for Stamina. This should spit out the BiS-Items in that regard.
---
It was confirmed in classic that all classes can learn weapon skills at level 1.
---
Still good to know though. I'd rather spend my first few silvers in something else.
---
/sit Reckoning stacking won't work in Classic since it didn't work in the Beta. It might still be valid for normal play though. Not sure.
---
Forsaken
---
Just like in the real world!
---
TB is the best city with flying mounts enabled, but the second worst without. Undercity is worst regardless of mounts.
---
What is the loot icon for in the desktop? It caught my eye.
---
You can literally tool around with a few talent points here and there and argue that they make sense....  
---
I played mage from day 1 until about some time in late 2005, I did alot of pvp and was very good at it. I would mess with talents like once a month.... Improved Frost Ward was one of my favorites, I wasn't an engineer so I didn't have the Ice Reflector... Improved Frost Ward gave me a leg up against other mages and the frost shock happy shamans.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ozxVcobZZiiGokbtho](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ozxVcobZZiiGokbtho)
---
Even this \^ is fine, like I said you can easily argue value in alot of the talents of any of the Mage Trees....
---
There's multiple messages here and you've even replied to them. Why do you want to put points in Holy? People have already said you have no trouble healing leveling dungeons as ret as long as you have some int, spirit gear.... Why are you stuck on Holy?
---
Maybe Kungen aswell if he really is coming back as he plans to.
---
There, there, sorry for stepping on your toes there :D don't you worry your little private server head, Classic is going to be A.O.K. with or without you!
---
Now you're just spouting random bs
---
You could camp a spawn point in PvE or PvP, the only thing the is that on a PvP server the opposite faction can interrupt you, where-as the friendly faction cannot. There's not twice as much competition (or anywhere even close to that number). You're either in a position to gather an item before anyone else or you're not, there's no what-ifs, it's a purely boolean thing as far as opportunity is concerned. An NPC could just as easily wander by and interrupt you when you're attempting to gather stuff and it has the exact same outcome.
---
If you're a melee class trying to tag mobs and a ranged class of your own faction tags them first it's not like you could have done anything about it. That's no different on a PvE nor a PvPe server and it's not like you can gank your own faction on either. On a PvP server you 'may' be able to interrupt someone, but that doesn't guarantee that you'll get that resource (someone else can easily pop in and ninja it whilst you're occupied, which is exactly the same scenario as you not being in position to gather the resource to begin with).

ok, footage is still pre 1.9
---
Idk a pve bis list is just based on theorycrafted dps you can't really have a list that weighs that vs survivability without it just being the opinion of the person who made the list.  If your goal is to be a glass cannon then pve bis is your bis because pve bis is glass cannon but beyond that it's up to you how much damage you want to sacrifice for survivability.
---
I'm curious what the original statistics are, because back in the day I'm pretty sure it was the case that alliance out populated horde, but these days in retail I'm pretty sure it's swung hard in favor of the horde
---
I'm confused. I only played vanilla upto BWL patch and mages could always blink out of my stuns. Did that change? Or am I misunderstanding what you are getting at?
---
Yeah no need all the hit that's true.
---
Rank 1 fire blast to assist in pulling hard mobs when AOE farming
---
The one nef drops is surely worth it. Even Alliance players use it.
---
How do you not understand that opposing factions can kill each other thus this reduces the number of people farming an area?!? Like wut.
---
There aren’t, the pic is poorly formatted
---
Well that's certainly some niche utility but are you going oom from using max rank a couple times during your aoe pulls?
---
Does this mean paladins cant gank lowbies? I mean that’s out of character I’d say. And rogues are supposed to ninja loot all chests and corpse camp?
---
Everyone with a subscription and today around the afternoon sometime I think
---
&gt;If I sub right before the stress test
---
That's a big if, servers are probably going to be slammed so might be an idea to sub a bit earlier than that.
---
WE DID IT GUYS!!
---
Better to not use max rank and save as much mana as possible...playing on a pvp server
---
Edward Longshanks would like to know your location.
---
Thanks
---
No offense but you really do not know what you're talking about and you should stop saying wrong things because you will confuse people who know even less than you do.
---
Think of a layer as a server. Each layer/server will fill up with players until it reaches around the size of a full server back in Vanilla (~2500-3000). After that layer/server is full, new players are sent to a new layer and the same thing happens again.
---
The only way that you can join/leave a layer is if someone invites you to a group.
---
Yes, there will be hundreds of players in starting zones. Want to know what it will feel like? Go look at what it's like on stress tests. That's how it will be.
---
I'd not pick a race for one drop.
---
On the flip side, trolls get a baseline 10% attack speed boost which I previously forgot about. That's your horde tanking race.
---
Thank you. will sub now then
---
Never go with Occam's Razor!
---
You are lucky. Anyone who played on unofficial language realms in Classic can tell you how shit it was.
---
Right your farming a pack of mobs. There is a member of the rival faction there as well on a PVE realm you can do nothing. You share the mobs. On PVP realm you kill the opposing faction member and continue to farm and you do it so much he leaves. Tell me how that is not a direct difference?
---
It's for everyone with a subscription, no emails. Servers go live around 1 pm CST. When they are up just click the drop down menu on the launcher and it should say something like "Classic Stress Test".
---
Here's a link to the official announcement that somebody here already linked before. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-pre-launch-test-11-00-a-m-pdt-august-8-and-minimum-specs/239621
---
24h, from what I saw. I forgot about the last one though, and missed it.
---
That's just astleast.
---
Info is from Blizzard confirming servers for German and French players (1 PvP / 1 PvE each) so that's 4 servers.
---
Blizzard have confirmed 1 RP and 1 RP-PvP for English (+atleast 1 PvP and 1 PvE).
---
Which makes it to 8, and I'm quite sure we'll see even more.
---
Not sure if that would be the biggest salute, or the biggest fuck you..
---
Thexia
---
I actually think one of them will be named like this. Even though they got it down, it is known that they pay a reasonable amount of respect for what it means for the whole community.
---
Well we still get to play classic even with 30 bmi
---
No Divine Shield is 12 sec duration, hearthstone a 20sec cast.
---
Due to gcd, you wouldn't be able to bubble hearth successfully it were  the same duration.
---
But I'm not going to give 40 cents to Evil activision for free!!1!11oneoneone
---
A smart person would just simply farm something else with the equivalent or greater value in gold and just 'exchange it via trade (in person, or via AH), instead of limiting themselves to the NPC spawn rate and competition. That's the in-game solution and by the time it gets to the scenario you're suggesting if would have been orders of magnitude more effective for farming items, especially items that don't have 100% drop.
---
If you had 20 players of the same faction farming a single spot the opposite faction isn't going to be able to clear you out anyway. You'd need an equivalent force to engage and then it just turns into a bloodbath. It's essentially an all-in scenario which is impossible to resolve via PvP (as much as you'd like to believe otherwise), unless you're suggesting that a crack squad of elites is going to be able to pill into a group of trigger-happy players with no NPC's around.
---
😂😂😂
---
Yeah, this should be possible in classic as I remember doing it on my mage during TBC to garrote silence + kidney, priest silence + the shadow procstun and improved counterspell + a cheap shot.
---
I recall using a pickpocket ambush macro. Other than that why bother.
---
Dear Lord that was hard. But feels good now :D
---
Thexama
---
Hah in all the years I knew that mages can bind frostbite so they can press it just as I charge them and then again when I intercept. No one believed me..
---
&gt; Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen exists
---
&gt;&gt;exists
---
Yes but if you look closer he has improved counter spell silence on him and he still blinks right as the rogue cheapshots him.
---
"Wasting" your money on a sub a day or two earlier doesn't seem so bad right now, eh?
---
Pretty sure my phone autocorrected to that.
---
Is 50 not higher than 25 anymore?
---
&gt; Sure, but blizzard has not told you for sure at releases layers will be 3k pop. They have not said that. So you literally are putting words in their mouths. 
---
Nope, sorry! They have literally said this in the video I linked.
---
I wouldn't put hunter in the same category as priest and lock. They do far less dmg to a paladin and unlike the other two, they have no way to manadrain nor a very strong cc effect to keep the pala at a distance. Mage is certainly a harder matchup than hunter.
---
Why so
---
Does anyone know of an add-on that has an easy to enable combat text that replicates Classic almost exactly?
---
I don't want to use Miks because it looks like legitimate ass and the current stock Classic combat text is just BFA's and is really depressing to see/experience.
---
Just want an add-on that is for combat text with potentially an option to just replicate Classic combat text as close as possible.
---
I hope that they won't try to reinvent the wheel and use exactly the same server names as they used to when WoW launched.
---
I want to play with my buddies on Aszune like we used to 15 years ago, and not browse through forums to find out to which new server most of them went.
---
I try to tell people how amazing Living Root is whenever I got the opportunity. Roll on it if it drops, you deserve it way more than the priest anyway. It'll last until RFK, and even after that it makes for an easy switch-to between combat for higher regen.
---
If you get Living Root, it also allows you to pick Wingblade instead of Crescent Staff (the only real alternative to Living Root, so get that if Living Root doesn't drop), which is a good one handed tanking weapon you woulsn't otherwise get
---
Calling people a kid doesn't make you right dude.
---
Try doing what you suggested yourself and see how wrong you are.
---
Once apon a time I agreed with this. No longer do I believe this is necessary. I don't even believe we should be segregated. Cross-faction grouping/guilding should have been a thing since day 1 imo.
---
It’s not a trailer, but the veteran of the wrathgate cinematic was my favorite.
---
What actually happens is the weaker players go farm something else leaving the winner to farm the mobs or item. That is how PVP servers have worked since they came out. Guild regularly do take over whole areas for example earth elementals are farmed by whole guilds to get elemental earth for AQ20 and AQ40 launch. Take that aspect away directly changes the game play and the economy of a server.
---
TBC &gt; all for me. Illidan at the beginning always sent chills down my spine.
---
Does someone know if a name becomes available right after you delete a character, or do we have to wait till it becomes available? Sorry did not play classic and I know some games have a one week lock timer on a name.
---
You ever see a Tauren Rogue stalking it’s prey? Exactly.
---
That could be me :D
---
Yes. Exactly this.
---
This is beautiful.
---
Mod loading manager for games like Skyrim, Oblivion etc if I recall correctly
---
Dude, just like the last thread where you said "participation is brown nosing" you just reveal how unpleasant you are to be around, and how you twist that to be not your fault.
---
Take a break, sort yourself out, and stop farming downvotes.
---
If you don’t play alliance you don’t have this problem.
---
As a practiced tauren leveler I can confirm the mulgore route is really good. Better than Joana's for sure
---
Anything greater than 3mbps
---
Is there a source stating we keep them?
---
You not gonna use a click-casting-addon like Clique?
---
For any class that can heal, that is the most important kind of addon to me.
---
It allows you to bind all your heals, dispels, etc. to mouse-button+modifier-combinations, so you can heal people by simply clicking on their unit-frame while you can keep your enemy in the target. Much like mouseover-macros but without them taking away space on your hotkey-bars.
---
&gt; Better hope you don’t miss/get parried or dodged because things can go south fast.
---
This is why you roll orc or human for that sweet sweet bonus to a single weapon. Plus orcs have that stun resist chance so they have a chance to not be stunlocked to death by rogues.
---
It’s a pvp server where they touch eachother in Goldshire.
---
Take a look at this:

I will explain it here as its not that useful. Basicaly when you are silenced by garrote, improved counterspell or spellock you cannot cast blink. The thing is that when you are silenced(only by spells that I have mentioned before) AND stunned - you can. By using this tonk you can force yourself to be stunned.  
---
The trick worked in TBC even.

Zone is called Swamp of Sorrows, so what are you expecting of it?

Did the same thing with Classic Shell lol.

why should i use this guide instead of joanas?

Previous one was 72 hours but this one is 24h afaik
---
Set up a one month sub about an hour ago. Not sure which option you are trying with and if that would cause any difference.
---
I may be there player sneaking up behind you. ;)
---
Yeah, that's all fine and dandy until you find yourself on some random beach somewhere because some sick fuck sent you to collect murlock guts for some disgusting remedy or something.
---
All those tips get thrown right out the window. Those tickets will grab ALL their friends and you will die.
---
You engaging in PvP does nothing to stop other players of your own faction, or the opponents faction from giggling at you whilst they get the resource. The fact that you don't recognise this simple truth reflects very poorly on the standards of education you've been through up until now.
---
You try and get a resource, I sit at max range on a Hunter (or even just send in my pet) and just keep interrupting you over and over and over. No matter what you do there's nothing you can do that would allow you to get that resource with any guarantee. I don't even have to get the resource myself. As long as I eliminate your opportunity to do so someone else now has the opportunity that I've denied you. The conditions to 'gather anything' (whether that be by harvesting, or tagging a mob) are significantly higher on a PvE server than a PvP server.
---
3 people are in a room, there is food on a table. As long as I pin you to the floor (or at least keep you occupied) it's no different to you being unable to reach the food in the first place. The 3rd person in the room can have their way with the food before you ever get the chance.
---
Its OK, there is a lot of private server fuckery that makes people mid remember.
---
Taking the name of a heavily camped rare mob or something would be funny.
---
You could fuck quite a bit with peoples targeting macros.
---
And a level 60 gnome rogue, waiting for the perfect time to strike....
---
Good logic, as a shammy you will be in demand and will get a spot in your average guild even if you aren't at every raid. No it is not as intensive as tanking. You will do fine healing as ele whilst levelling, but as a hybrid spec at 60 you'd likely need to be resto dominant.
---
I don't remember DPS queues being that horrendous back in the day, so I wouldn't let it put you off hunter, especially if by solo you mean truly solo doing BGs and farming etc without a guild or friends. As long as you're organising your own groups or better yet, have a friend or guildmate who tanks, you'd be fine PUGing.
---
Someone has to kill off the ret paladins.
---
you guys gathering up? GOing Ally again? Wanna get on the same server and hate each other with love a bit more? :)
---
I played Horde side on a PVE server on Vanilla and there was constant PVP going on in Southshore and Tarren Mill once the honor system was released. Also many many Crossroads and city raids. As the Horde we were greatly outnumbered but it was a TON of fun and I remember it quite fondly.
---
Hamstring into warstomp is usually a safe escape.
---
Do you enchant your gear?
---
I’ve had this problem with blizzard before, and customer support told me to try a different browser.
---
This didn’t work, so their next suggestion was to try on a smartphone that isn’t connected to WiFi. I have no idea why this worked, but it did. If I were you I would try both of these out before contacting them.
---
Good luck OP
---
I like horde side priest, only two races and no crap about fear ward. Fear ward is awesome, but staring at a dwarf for hundreds of hours, no thanks I’d rather anything else.
---
Renegade Legion gathering up btw? Wanna get on the same server?
---
Would mouseover macros work?
---
Hogger - EU PvP 
---
Where all the mad lads are at.
---
Oh well, then he made an extremely false equivalency.
---
Fractured gathering up btw? Wanna get on the same server and love/hate each other again?
---
Relatively, yeah. It'll still be jam packed but it'll have WAY less people than the other two zones.
---
This is what I was looking for, ty.
---
Don't you mean 10 sec cast?
---
Can’t you just right click on the unit frames and “unlock”?
---
Also, the party/raid frames can be unlocked as well
---
You dont need an addon for that.. because of the legion client you just can right-click your playerframe and move it
---
this.  with hanzo swords and fiery enchants!
---
Blizzard was super weird about renaming characters back in the Vanilla days.
---
On Bloodhood, 'Deshaman' wasn't allowed to have that name, "because it had the word 'Shaman' in it, which is a Class name" and he was required to change his name before he could log in.  He went with 'Desham' which they said was acceptable.
---
Around that same time, 'Tfarcraw' (Warcraft, backwards) was hit with the same message, saying that he couldn't have "Warcraft, or any variation of it in his character name".  He chose 'Tfar' and was allowed to keep playing.
---
I don’t remember if this was an issue in 1.12, but later on you could just make a macro with modifiers to different ranks of a spell. Like button x for flash heal rank 5, or shift-x for rank 3, Ctrl-x for rank 1, etc.
---
Just because a person speaks English as a second language doesn't mean they want to speak a foreign language during their off-time.
---
Pretty strong in 1v1, but most classes can just run away, when they realize, they are going to lose. 
---
Warlock, mage and priest are generally the hardest matchups. While you can good damage to them, priests can quickly drain your mana and mages and locks are very good at keeping you away. Against average palyers you can still win, but against strong palyers those matchups can be very frustrating.
---
Druid and shaman (resto) can become very long fights, where neither side is able to win.
---
Hunter is a strategic matchup, which is decided by who makes more mistakes. If you can get close and stick to the hunter, they have no chance and hunters do have a hard time keeping you away. But if you don't have engineering, you also have trouble closing the initial gap. 
---
Warrior, rogue and non-resto shaman are favorable matchups for you as your defensive tools outweigh their offensive tools.
---
There is no difference between fighting over the same spawns with your allied faction and your opposition faction on any server. You either have the option to get the loot or you don't. It's no different to wiping on a boss at 1%. It'd make zero difference if you had 40 alliance and 40 horde farming the resources in one area or 80 alliance/horde farming the one area. If you're not in a position to get the loot you won't get the loot and having the potential to 'attack' your opponent is completely independent of your opportunity (potential) to get the loot.
---
You try to mine an ore node, a Mage sheeps you, you can't break the CC, they finish mining and run off. That's no different to that ore node not being spawned in the first place, you could never have obtained it.
---
As a mage you will use 2 ranks of frostbolt
---
- rank 1 for quick cast time + slow
---
- rank max for maximum damage
---
As a healer you use multiple ranks
---
- highest rank = overheal = waste of mana
---
- lowest rank = underheal = not full hp = chance tank dies
---
By your logic then the fact that PVP exists and players can kill each other has no effect on the game AT ALL you live in a dream world. We are not talking about just members of your own faction we are talking about the fact that one faction can kill the other faction. Either you kill them or they kill you or you kill someone on the rival sides competition or someone rival side kills your competition. You are clearly the one that doesn't understand and clearly you are someone who will be rolling a PVE server because you cant deal with it. By your logic all servers should be PVP servers as it makes no difference anyway XD they are the same as PVE servers. Your a joker and you don't understand the game if you think that people being directly able to kill each other does not effect how resources are gathered how mobs are killed and how the game is played. Honestly get a life troll
---
The fact that they have been clear and public about it? Layering is gone as soon as they can, and no matter what gone by phase 2.
---
That was a joke mate. I’m rolling horde and I’m happy there’s not a huge gap between troll and undead priest like there’s between dwarf and the other two. But there’s gonna be alot of people who don’t min max playing nelf priests and there’s nothing wrong with that.
---
Yep, a typo. Thanks for pointing it out.

The art style has a Borderlands feel to it. Well done!

Try the subway app, it makes paying for your sub easy!

Insert Thex joke here.

Id like and i hope that classic stays classic as it will be by naxx, forever. No fresh servers, no shenanigans. If were forced to have something beyond that, the ONLY addition id accept down the road after a few (3-5years?) is the introduction of wargames or arena que’s and aszhara crater/emerald dream/dragon isle/hyjal zone opening but with mobs still just level 60/60 elite and if they introduce new dungeons/raids corresponding to those zones, the items in those zones NEED to be only SLIGHTLY better than Naxx items, no big power jump no massive health pools and dmg. Have every item still kind of relevant. 
---
Nothing feels more shitty than knowing your bonereavers edge is totally useless and that you cant even compete with some highly geared players (pvp wise) - and dont you dare say that its useless compared to naxx items, cause thats total bullshit.
---
That is all.
---
WoW was all ready an inspiration to future MMO's and we see how that turned out.
---
Here is the reality of what's going to happen with classic.
---
Huge spike of returning/new players.
---
Huge fall off after new players realize there are better games out there.
---
Classic is for a niche audience. IF they really wanted to retain an audience they'd have release WOTLK or TBC.
---
Art style reminds me Borderlands  &lt;3
---
That's insanity. If I ever emmigrate to a non-English country, my very first goal is going to be becoming fluent in the language. Showing up and expecting everybody to deal with your inability to function is the most lazy selfish thing a person can do, which is a generous description of the people currently flooding into the UK.

That picture is basically this entire subreddit
---
Crazy, I opened the thread for my server and like half the posts were from my old guildmates who I havent heard from in a decade. Hoping we can get the gang back together!
---
Might use this name, Helsafabel. Or some older ones I used to roll with such as Zoso or Buko (Bucowski if Tauren.)
---
Builds and plans for gf and my leveling to 40 by day 8, plans for professions, add-ons, macros, trade ideas, oowwee I got plan boy. As it get closer we will plan food for the 4 days :)
---
Nah, no balances will happen. Quote me if I'm wrong 6 months from now, but the game will be as it was in 2006 - except with some high res textures and general bugfixing.
---
I do think it's unfair that some classes are weak, but that's just one of the charms of old wow for me. It makes the game more gritty &amp; makes me respect stuff like shaman utility over their raw damage.
---
What content have I suggested that would make you need to trust me? Simply stated how I felt on the matter of Classic+ content. Blizzard destroyed their own game with subsequent expansions after Vanilla with ideas they felt were "good".
---
Troll racial was confirmed to give 43% attack speed in classic, and attack speed buffs were confirmed to stack multiplicatively.
---
Based on just that, I'd pick troll honestly.
---
The buff is better than expected, and it synergyzes better than expected with fury-prot builds (or just normal fury during occasional offtank situations).
---
They're also handsome as fuck.
---
Troll is bis for tps no one can compare. Berzerking is just too stronk.
---
I wish they would leave it on through the weekend... But just a wish
---
You can still get the Payo experience by wearing a sweet head band and yelling at the screen regardless of class though.
---
TopTier right here
---
Yeah, it's big brain time.
---
Dwarf or Human Pala? (Either race: male)
---
All-round goals: raid and a little bit if pvp.
---
I'm more into Dwarves from a fantasy standpoint, but I do really hate their Special 2H animation.
---
It is wonderful on a Human, but Humans will make for about half of the Alliance players + they are... just Human.
---
No comments based off racials! :)
---
No there is none as it is not needed. It is stress test, meaning that characters will not remain and everything will be deleted. Purpose of the test is to kinda simulate the launch load on the servers and fix any issue that may occur so that launch will be as smooth as possible.
---
I would totally buy a print of this if it’s available.
---
It's incredible that you're unable to recognise simple truths.
---
+ If you're farming objects/NPC's, it makes no difference whether you're on PvE or PvP because you either were in a position to obtain the loot or you weren't.
---
+ If you're caring about PvP then the only thing you give up on a PvE server is the ability to 'initiate' an attack.
---
I'm willing to bet I've played for far longer on PvP servers than you have (especially since you bailed during TBC by your own account). It's astounding that you don't recognise that a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.
---
I'm strongly considering hunter but I am concerned about the end game DPS, can anyone put my mind at ease?
---
&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/Whooosh/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Whooosh/)
---
No, that logic doesn't track. Some servers have a fuckton of people, but not many play at once or there is a wide range of time zones for whatever reason. This ruins any "Lets worry about the total number of people who roll here" plan. Instead they just need to track concurrent users and set their number of servers with that in mind. 
---
Worrying about overall numbers is a trap, and it doesn't work out long term. Especially since every retail user is a classic user until determined otherwise, and many will play for a short time and then disappear forever. They would still be counted under your plan, and we would have a bunch of dead servers.
---
Agreed. As a long time Bleeding Hollow veteran (including 30+ of my close friends and old guildies) just give me the same server again LOL!
---
Viper sting &gt;  blue rage bar
---
Scatter shot, frost trap, wing clip, I think these would be sufficient to keep a paladin away. No?
---
I think it will be less of a difference in Classic where the average players is 30 years old.
---
I could explain my point again but you seem deliberately obtuse to it
---
I don't quite understand your question.
---
This kind of add-on is an alternative to using mouse-over-macros. But other than that it essentially does the same thing. You just don't need all the spells in your bar.
---
It doesn't prevent you from still using mouse-over-macros ontop of it.
---
Yes, you can die in the ocean close to ratchet to go to the orc/troll starting zone.
---
Of course I'll be fine, I'm gonna be playing on a French Realm :D

Smarter mobs run away from you when they are dying. Make sure you stand between the mob and possible reinforcements, and use movement impairing abilities when they about to die.
---
I kinda dislike posts like this. I've never played any WoW game before but I'm aware of how frustrating these sort of games can get if you have no idea what you are doing and screw up your build. You are assuming I (or any newbie) gets enjoyment out of the game the same way you do.
---
I want my character's details/skills min maxed because I don't want to worry about that crap as a clueless newbie to Blizzard game. I just want to play the game and not have to start all over again after 50+ hours because my character is so poorly skilled out that I can't do end game content or can't defend myself in PvP.
---
And?
---
But if this was a bug in BFA or any other modern game, people would lose their minds and throw shit at eachother like apes.
---
That's a no from me, IL keep my 1 account so I have all my blizzard games under 1 login.

15 deaths, the problem isn't the game, the problem is you. Warrior leveling is not hard, it's just less forgiving than any other class. 
---
Is there a chance of pulling 2 mobs? Pull with your ranged wep, if it's a bad pull you can run immediately. 
---
Actually pay attention to your health, keep your bandaid and food supplies topped off, and carry around a few HP potions for good measure. You rarely need to buy any since they're common drops and quest rewards.
---
Use hamstring to prevent runners from getting adds.
---
Be social and group with a healer, the two of you together are a killing machine.
---
Too many misses/dodges/whatever, use faster weapons. Let the law of large numbers work for you, not against you.
---
Keep your gear topped off. You're the most gear dependent class, which is bad in that you can't just ignore gear, but it's awesome in that if you spend a little time making sure you're gear is solid, your power level goes through the roof.

There's no crying in warrior.

Ahh yes and you can also use wasd to move around hmm yess

I was unsuccessful.  Above my skill in photoshop
---
Retreat direction is random on live servers.  Private servers changed it so the ran the opposite way
---
Paladin can do the same though and has better utility. I agree Druids aren’t terrible but they don’t really have a thing they can do better than other classes but that’s the point - they are so versatile that they are not the best at anything.
---
Intresting..
---
ROFL get a life your a drip honestly I didnt say anything about bailing in tbc. I played vanilla on a russian pvp server as the only english speaking person on it as a holy paladin alone. I then raided everything from TBC in a top 100 guild and then played and raided everything to WOD. Since then I have come back for every expansion I have played private servers also for vanilla. I have played this game more than you have had cooked dinners. You cant face simple truth that PVP directly effects gameplay on the open world ie everything we do farming doing quests all of it and to say it doesnt shows you are a clueless troll. Get a life and l2p
---
I think they will pay tribute to some iconic characters or places that unpredictable turned out from vanilla. Like servers named Leeroy, Hogger, Mankrik, Stranglethorn Vale (pvp obviosly), Kungen (maybe) etc.
---
I stand corrected
---
Bro, that dude just stole your chick.

Cheers for the feedback. The obvious answer is to roll both and see what feels best but I'm on limited time so I'm loath to waste any. Might stick with the plan and see how much I fall in love with my Tauren Hunter 🤣

How tf does a bird throw sand in a 3 meter tauren's eyes anyway

I see you're a solo player as you don't have ventrilo and mIRC installed.
---
A few people are talking about Classic. personally I wanna get back to pure 2005 nostalgia. 
---
Do we get to see servers to plan these kind of things monday when we can reserve character names?
---
Hopefully we can sort it so we're on the same server, that would be a blast.
---
I prefer horde lore but alliance animations and toons. Fml.
---
I just did it with no issues. Hope things clear up for you.
---
Yeah I wouldn't play with them. Doesn't sound like they will stick to classic for too long.

Wow I love how this has sort of a borderlands feel to it. Time to go kill some SKAGS BITCHES!

I used to have to hide classic on my dads PC way back in the day on XP. I created tons of sub folders with random names like “system-003” and then at the very end was the wow launcher. He never found it. Also had to buy wow time cards with my allowance. I was 11 at this time and my parents wouldn’t get me a PC and I could only use my dads for certain activities. This brings back the nostalgia of how I used to find the game through the start menu. Luckily by the time BC came out and gained my own PC independence. Can’t wait to play classic unrestricted now lol.
---
i hope they name one Bob, just for the f\*ck of it.
---
I've been thinking about it a lot. But with downranking (plus Renew, PW:Shield and dispells), aren't there just too many spells to cast than can be bound with Clique?
---
You seem like you've decided on hunter really, and you should go for it. Marksmanship is good fun, it's difficult to see how fun they are from watching gameplay. There are a lot of subtle things you don't see going on like managing your range, shot / swing timers and pets that really adds a lot of depth.
---
On top of that they really are the best solo class, so if you're playing alone you won't find a better main. If you arent even raiding then you wont care about their main weakness which is bad scaling in high end raid gear.
---
Don't play a warrior. It's a miserable experience solo. You will die so many times without doing  any damage, where if you had a healer you would have been incredible.
---
This hits me in feels and I didn't even play Vanilla, I remembered playing with a friend in wrath, levelling in Goldshire and it was raining so he didn't wanna leave the inn because it was a miserable day to quest and for some reason it had always stuck with me.
---
Here's the setup I've been using on the PServer:
---
Select (normally on Leftclick) =&gt; MB 4
---
Menu (normally on Rightclick) =&gt; MB 5
---
The Heal I use Most (for my level 45 it was GH Rank 1) =&gt; Leftclick
---
The Heal I use 2nd most (downranked version to about 50% of highest heal) =&gt; Rightclick
---
Flashheal =&gt; Alt+Leftclick
---
Renew =&gt; Alt+Rightclick
---
Dispel =&gt; Shift+Leftclick
---
Cure Disease =&gt; Shift+Rightclick
---
Powerword: Shield =&gt; Ctrl+Leftclick
---
Fortitude =&gt; Shift + MB4
---
Shadow-Protection =&gt; Shift + MB5
---
There's still quite a few possibilities open with Shift and Ctrl that I could use for further ranks. 
---
The general idea is that I can heal 90% of the time with nothing but left- and rightclick. Makes playing a healer just so much more comfortable.
---
PvE would be more fitting imo. But Hogger is a must!
---
I'd actually put hunter above the others as the toughest 1v1 opponent. If played right they should never get hit by the paladin. Pack + slows makes them insane to try to beat as a paladin.
---
I prefer horde races but alliance cities so I feel your pain.
---
If you havent been to mulgore at low levels, here's some info/advice: Its a spread out zone so you'll walk alot, many quests are item drop with lowish drop rates.  It does have some decent grind spots: the venture co mine is one, some gnoll camps, some harpies in the mountains. But quest wise, with seemingly endless drop rate quests, its not an ideal zone. All that said, its easily the best looking of the 3 horde start zones imo, and it will be the quietest but thats all relative, its still gonna be busy.
---
Onyxia was 5 manned in retail with bwl gear....
---
&gt; Anyone else have any lifehacks for staying healthy(ish) while grinding 16 hours a day? 
---
Simple - don't grind for fucking 2/3 of the day.
---
Interesting option. How much do the tokens usually go for?
---
Point of classic is different to everyone.  With an obvious bug such as this, I would have called for a fix in 2006, and I'd call for a fix again in 2019.
---
Its been so long since anyone has seen a tauren rogue it started to seem like people forgot about them.
---
It has some quests, good for a level. Definitely had a "where's the rest of it" moment after I went through it back in vanilla.
---
If it was a bug then, it should be patched fixed now. Not recreating exploits for the #nochange mentality.
---
That's clever, thanks for the explanation.
---
You think you do, AND YOU DO. Suckmyphatslong to anyone that tells me otherwise
---
Err don't wanna burst your bubble but enh shamans get kited literally for days. Warriors at least have charge, hampstring and intercept, which are huge. Enh is literally just waiting to die if a good caster engages you at range.
---
It s not how it s supposed to work. It s a bug.
---
Blink is only usable while stunned and snared.
---
With blizzard recent layoffs and moving to a auto report system I will be shocked if name rules are enforced, they were barely enforced post TBC
---
I definitely agree that hunter don’t benefit the MOST from weapon upgrades.
---
But I think Hunters are harmed the least by not having any other
---
I really wanted to like the Warcraft film and I do in some aspects but if they would have done the film based around Thrall and Varian having a generic War over some piece of land would have been a ton better in my mind but considering they sold everything off I doubt we'll see another film as a western release considering it did amazingly well in the Asian market.
---
a trade agreement. we'll give you darnassus for thunderbuff.
---
I'm definitely pro horde but its really hard to beat out having a dragon for a mom.
---
I love this man!!

nut
---
I never got to the point of raiding in Classic. My main then was a Fury Warrior. I remember leveling being an absolute pain in the ass, especially on a PVP server. Between not being able to handle monsters 1 or 2 levels higher then me, and constantly getting ganked, it really slowed me down and nearly burned me out from playing.
---
Still, I'd like to play the class. Later on in the game I played as Fury, Arms and tank in many different levels of raids. I am leaning towards Arms/Fury for leveling, with a few points in Protection to tank dungeons. Will I regret this decision? Or is warrior leveling really not that hard, and was it just youthful, inexperienced, me being a complete noob almost 15 years ago?
---
Classic wow.  It's in the drop down menu below "version"
---
I'm in a bind.
---
On one hand I want to play Paladin for Holy but do not look forward to being a Blessing bot even with Pally power especially in a raid environment but the Paladin class fantasy has always been one of my favorites along with the class mount. Bonus points for being a pretty solid dungeon tank and PvP healer.
---
On the other hand I want to play Priest but do not look forward to how much down ranked spells they juggle along with the amount in which they have to fill their toolkit but I also want to have access to Shadow and do the Benediction quest chain. Bonus points for melting faces.
---
Battle of the good boys.
---
2005 it is baby!
---
as opposed to clearing 2 dungeon side by side? yes.
---
like mauradon, except they added a skip to the middle if you were going for the higher lvl half.
---
Ye remember Osz. I personally hope they use nostalgia names for servers and if there pops up a Bloodscalp.. Well guess what, Hunscalp it is!
---
Umm, ok. If he uses cheetah/pack, you rocket helm him and he never gets away again. Even a grenade means he is pretty much done. A paladin can't be slowed, so that's a non-factor.
---
Also hunter dmg is fairly low, so the paladin has a lot of time to wait for the hunter to make a mistake.
---
I saw mrp on the willitclassic site, I’m not sure if that will be the go to favorite but it is an option.
---
What? Haha
---
Damn I cant name my shaman Thexanal
---
As much as I love classic, I also love beer. I think I could handle drinking in a british pub over a few hour stress test.
---
Thanks for the link.
---
Not a fan of the decision tbh, I don't see the point of splitting the community of old friends who first and foremost want to see their buddies they explored Azeroth with, many many years ago.
---
Screw this scenery. I'm going to be a Troll Shaman named Thex.
---
Nice!!
---
YOU THERE! CHECK OUT THAT NOISE!
---
What a nice Guild Friend.
---
I read through the class guide. I am looking at either a dwarf or human holy paladin or dwarf priest heals for pvp.
---
Basically, style points for human paladin, or dwarf for stoneform. Is stoneform really worth it considering cleanses? Cleanse only takes mana right? No CD? Stoneform can be done while stunned too right?
---
If I went priest, would choose dwarf, but what spec is best for pvp? Disc or holy?
---
What do you think?
---
If you ate less crap you might not need the ibuprofen
---
A lot of recruiting guilds insist their aim is week 1 or 2 Rag kill.
---
There will be MAYBE 1 per server that manages it (averaged out probably, maybe one will have 2 and one will have none etc). And that's being generous.
---
It will definitely happen, but it won't be that common. And it's a waste of Classic.
---
Same!  TBC killed my guild so I rerolled horde with some RL friends.  But some of the best times were on vanilla Maelstrom with RP events and faction battles!
---
Thank you!! I find the first example rather interesting. Non medieval names I understand, but what of the tech sounding names that are found in Gnomes? I suppose it's case by case, but I would approve a gnome being named Johnnyotron or Ash3000 just because of the lore associated with being a gnome.
---
It gets used everytime Seal of Commans proccs.
---
The Human one is pretty badass to me, kind of like a demolishing blow.
---
I mean you can but it normally ends up either really weird or hilarious.
---
I had a rogue named bangboose so we were obviously the same maturity level lol
---
Same!

---
I know the feeling. I'm torn between rogue hunter and priest and am just going on a hunch that I'll enjoy rogue highjinks the most. I'd love to play a few BGs to decide but they won't even be in the game until later!
---
Speaking as someone who actively roleplayed for years: Most people won't expect you to constantly be 'in character'. There's a few like that, but differentiating between OOC gameplay and IC role is fairly normal on RP realms, especially since there's often a difference between the character you portray and what the game requires you to do. If you're playing an inexperienced recruit in the Stormwind city guard, for example, it doesn't make *any* sense for you to fight across the burning steppes. So if you're questing there you're naturally not doing it in character.
---
I bought a 21” crt just for the immersion. It was a cheap second hand but the whole thing was at least 25 kilos and occupied most of my desk
---
Imagine the literal rebellion if they named servers after streamers.
---
i can see that. i also dont think there would have been any confusion in the first place since you install the game you play first and then choose a server but i dont think different names will be too much of a problem :)
---
Nowadays a lot of people prefer the mouse-over macros. Installing an add-on that performs a function already built into the base game is redundant for most.
---
Jenkins
---
I also want to roll a hunter, but am kind of concerned about leveling, mostly one particular thing.  
---
I remember leveling in TBC that you could weave in melee auto attacks between auto shots by moving into and out of melee range. Is this a thing in Classic with range attacks being 7 (or 8?) yards instead of 5 which was in TBC if I remember correctly.
---
On the same subject, would you need to manually click melee auto attack when you move into melee range and ranged auto attack when you are at minimum ranged attack range? Because this is what private servers I've played on been like. What I've seen is just using a melee or ranged skill to activate melee or ranged attack respectively. Can you just right click on a mob and start ranged auto attacking?
---
Help me r/classicwow, you are my only hope
---
Did not think about it but I'll stick to warrior anyway! :)
---
&gt; Is this really a PSA anyone needed? That you can use the camera to look around?
---
Well yes, inexperienced folks like me dont know you could look at your back while running or fighting mobs, now they do. Its very useful and sure is needed if you dont want to accidentally die to roaming mobs. Speaking from my personal experience as freshman
---
I did this route a TON in vanilla farming iron ores. I found so many chests that i almost never took the road. Plus if stitches spawns on top of you its GG.
---
Doesn't work on Brave so I assume it has to do with some form of adblock or security settings.  Tried on chrome and it worked
---
Doing this would knock all the piss bottles everywhere so probably not
---
Lol barrens, not contested.
---
I'm actually okay with Ketameme haha

I think posting your budget would be highly helpful.  We might be able to find you something previously missed.    There is also a lot more to buying a monitor than just Res and Refresh.  As I don't know your budget, I will start with this one.  This is a TN panel monitor sold by Dell.  It's about as good as your going to get on the entry level of this monitor class.  You will see some people say it looks washed out like other TN panels, but that's only because they haven't properly calibrated it.  Specifically this one needs it's Gamma adjusted inside your GPU drivers to really bring it to snuff.  I can't hardly tell a difference between it and my nice IPS after a proper calibration.  Full disclosure, mine is the G-Sync monitor so a slightly different version, but same panel.

---
I believe Zoso came from something I read about Jimmy Page, Led Zeppelin's guitarist... back when I was like 15. It was usually my Warlock's name.
---
Bukowski is an author I read at that age a lot. In recent years I've had the shorter Buko as name for some characters.
---
Helsafabel was a name for a Dark Elf character I made in the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion back in 2006... and I've used it ever since. Sometimes Helsa fits better.. for example on an Orc, compared to Helsafabel.
---
Back in 2004 my Warlock was actually named Ganthritor and my Hunter was Zeratul.. Starcraft 1 characters both. God I was nerdy.
---
That is true, but we got achievements in the last patch before Wrath dropped, so many of us were running around the world like mad things hugging critters and exploring spots in the weeks after the pre Wrath patch, but before Wrath was live.
---
Grateful*
---
Couldn’t help myself. Great post 👍
---
Ok, I missed this point, indeed my experience is on pservers on that point ;)

Tell that to all the Undead Rogues chillin in Westfall

Ooof incel comment
---
It'll be on the live version of classic (not the beta)
---
🤷‍♂️
---
That's honestly pretty fucking cool. If i could find community events like that often I would roll rppvp.
---
I think it's a great opportunity to just see how things would be like for Launch and also prepare your UI, Key bindings and Addons.
---
So I'll play for 30mins-1hr s to do so, but don't see any point in time-sinking into it.
---
Pretty much useless for Horde though. EK out of tristfal is pretty crap, you can go TF&gt;SP&gt;HB&gt;Arathi&gt;wetlands but trying to get down to STV from UC you're going to have a bad time from loch modan to dustwood and beyong.
---
Kalimdor isn't much better, Mulgor is pretty crap to try it from though. Durotar &gt; secret path to Rachet &gt; Xroads &gt; CT &gt; TB, hearth back to VT &gt; Org &gt; UC &gt; then the EK run from above. Not really worth going through to stone talon or 1000 needles.
---
I'd say you'll get half the levels in twice the time for a horde Fedex run compared to a Alliance one. If you throw in some killing on the Kalimdor route through Mulgore you might be able to ding 5/6 by the time you get to EK.
---
For UBRS non the less

---
bring a laptop to the pub and introduce the intoxicated americans to "our" game!
---
Yeah..you can get some pretty inane drama on rp servers that normally try to drag the rest of the server into it.
---
MG has taught me well on that aspect lol.
---
Good healers use mouse over macros.
---
IT's that simple.
---
I like this idea.  
---
Then we can finally say I'm on the VC server and be 100% right!!
---
Tell that to warriors like monkeynews
---
I think it will depend a lot on how layering will work. Have they ever stated how many players each layer will be capped at?
---
Pocket Sand duh
---
Nice names, I mostly go for random stuff. For Classic I'm thinking of naming my Orc Warlock 'Gronk'. I think it's funny to have a spellcaster with a silly name.
---
Some of my other names I go for are Pablox, Axex, Relictus, Zulanathul.
---
Karazhan eas 10 man raid btw
---
**blizz already announced the end date for this test**
---
Start Aug 8th 11am pst and ends Aug 9th (no end time yet). But if its like the last test, it will end around 4pm, so only 24 hours ish.
---
*♪ That's the World of Warcraft that you plaaaaaaaaay ♪*
---
Incorrect. Getting reckoning stacks in classic works due to spell batching.
---
You do not get the reck stack when you sit, but instead when you get up again. It requires a slightly different timing.
---
I think it, like gearscore, are a bad idea.  I don't think blizzard will implement it but I bet there is an add-on by phase 2.
---
I am little divided to tell you the truth.
---
My favorite expansion ever, is without much doubt, The Burning Crusade! Being able to deal with the lore figures I grew up with playing WC3: Illidan, Vashj, KJ and Kael. Also, it felt the gameplay was everything vanilla was but better, specially with the “revamp” of some speccs, making them viable.
---
That being said, the expansion that I feel that is Blizzard’s masterwork, the one I consider the best one is: Wrath of the Lich King! It felt that everything was well done and I genuinely felt that those guys could do no wrong!
---
That being said, the one that I missed the most all those years and the one I am always more nostalgic towards to is Vanilla and if I could chose one to be played again it would be it…so I was very happy when Classic was announced.
---
I guess it doesn’t make much sense? But that’s how I feel…also, in my personal opinion, classic is from all Blizzard expansions, the one that can offer more longevity, the one that despite being old or perhaps because its old or not that modern in way, is the one that I can see myself playing for years even if they don’t release more content. All the other ones seem a but more finite in a way.
---
Sounds like dragon force. You enjoy the death metals or djent?
---
Same here. And I'm Horde...
---
Should be okay as a hunter, right?
---
I was thinking this exact same thing.  Set up VPN on the router and get VNC running on the PC
---
if you’re referring to the video with Shadee as the healer, the tank was a druid so... *grins*
---
You'd be okay getting a 1080p 300hz monitor as well.
---
Haha, fair enough. I plan to spend time there for the entire life of classic even after leveling, those crystal consumables are too good. Healing, aoe damage, thorns buff.. I'm obsessed with consumables which is why I'll also be spending time in Winterspeing too.
---
Yeah but there's a fine line between demanding good games, (Which I have to say I fully agree I wont beat around that bush) and being an over pushy asshat.
---
You don't have to scream and shout your demands everyday, to be frank our demands for WoW classic are being met so what's best to do now is to sit here and wait a little bit, just calm down a little and then after release see what really needs to happen and THEN scream and shout.
---
If WoW classic and CoD's new remake of Modern warfare... And crash bandicoot and spyro and.. well I mean there is actually a pretty big list now, if they don't tell publishers that original ideas are vital, publishers need to be split up, sold and started again. But how we gonna do that? oh shit we aint. 
---
Rocket League and their subreddit is the biggest lie the gaming people have witnessed in YEARS and they just swallowed it whole. I'm as much angry at the industry as anyone else dude
---
If you're not into raiding, by phase 3 you will be able to have people let you into their cleared BWL to use the table in there.  Be warned though, doing so will deny you access to that raid until the reset.
---
Man these karma softballs are getting tedious
---
The end date is in the same announcement......
---
I just hope they are somewhat neutral names because if you have pvp servers like Drek'thar and Stormpike you will more than likely see an imbalanced faction on those particular servers.
---
haha. Yeah that was what I needed. The information I found on the web was not very specific so I decided to ask someone on the inside. So i just need to subscribe for the base WoW and that's it. Thank you very much, or should I say "danke" :P
---
Oh I want that name I think i'll use it
---
It looks so good
---
YEEEEEESSSSSSS! I never played on an RPPvP before, but it sounds really fun, and it seems like the kind of community I’d love to be a part of. 
---
I guess that means I’ll be on the server that needs layering for eternity to handle the population, but I’ll take that sacrifice.
---
Area 52
---
Borderlands vibes!
---
Gnome warrior is best warrior. Nothing generates more threat than a Gnome spamming /train
---
I personally love achievements and wish they were in classic but unfortunately they were not in vanilla wow so they won’t be in classic. 
---
Adding anything that wasn t there before would open the flood gates to a lot more changes. 
---
My hope is that they will eventually roll classic into TBC and achievements will come then :)
---
Cool stuff. Theres many opportunities for humor in char names as well. My bank chars are usually Bankbros and Bankbus, respectively.
---
I also had a Dwarf Paladin called Constipation at one point, I'm ashamed to admit.
---
If I recall correctly private servers have the quest chains mostly correct. There I found out that the UD scarlet quests are a chain starting at the undead starting point. So you wouldn't be able to pick up the At War With the Scarlet Crusade line in the manner represented in your doc. Again, assuming pservers have it correct.
---
Damn, just roasted his ass with the facts.
---
This is actually true. When I searched for accountant in the twitch app it shows two accountants, accountant and accountant classic I made the incorrect presumption.
---
once a day is good but what is the recommended amount of times?
---
Live to win
---
Everyone has sweet girlfriends, while my wife just rolled her eyes and called me a nerd.  But you better believe that bitch is bringing me a fresh cooked breakfast.  So, I can live with it.
---
This really makes me want to roll a Dwarf Hunter instead of a night Elf, why are these decisions so hard.
---
Lol i made sure to do mine yesterday because just this might happen. If it is that might be a good sign we might hit that mythic 10mil player base.
---
The wall behind me has the fridge on the other side...anyone got a sledgehammer
---
Yeah man just go in behind the mob and use those talent points to help you level faster to get to higher level mobs with more to pick pocket.  Make sure to use a macro that uses pickpocket with all your stealthed abilities like sap, cheap shot, ambush.  You will pocket a lot that way and also help level lock picking iirc.
---
yeah - the pub we're heading to is a right corker too. A proper local treat which has been brewing their own beer for ages and sell it for cheap. People keep expressing interest in bottling/selling the beer elsewhere but the landlord is a raging/dying alcoholic (most people are unsure how he's still alive) and he can't be bothered to deal with it all.
---
This. Troll really is THE PvE race for the Horde for most classes - zerking is just so reliably useful.
---
Who pissed in your bowl of shit this morning
---
Thank you!!!!
---
Maybe the fact that you only need 3% hit and much more stamina.
---
Yeah.. there's definitely a large contingent of ppl who don't care. For me, I like a name which is kinda short but possibly could fit the character's race.
---
This is beautiful. Thank you.
---
AVs are pseudo content. They also play a part in the chain of events that changed a great sandbox mmo with a fantastic community into a soulless cashgrab.
---
It's to mitigate being bottlenecked in overcrowded starting zones.  No one said it's ideal, its just better to be level 10 with no bags and less silver than to be level 4 stuck in the starting area fighting over mob spawns.
---
Obviously on a mature server where starting zones are empty, it's a meme and there isn't a good reason to do it.
---
&gt; I like feeling like an adventurer in a dangerous world with consequences for actions. 
---
But also you have addons that pretty much play the game for you.
---
It's not rocket appliances.
---
Yeah, whats considered casual online doesn't make sense in real life. 4 hours a day, 5 days a week is a part time job.
---
I'm not sure I have the hardware at hand to make that happen, but it's a good idea if nothing else.
---
Yogscast?
---
Seems more like a bug. Like that one glorious weekend when Blizz screwed something up so that warriors Big Three didn't share a cooldown. That was fun.
---
Atlasloot is the only addon you need, anything else and you're a shitter.
---
Does it? I thought you only were locked in once you were present for a boss being killed.
---
Eh? I'm not grouchy my dude, just speaking the truth
---
Standing around with 1000 other people being unable to do anything? Good idea bro
---
I think a lot of people who think they are going to do something crazy like that are going to end up getting burned out and quitting or or not following through and really taking 2 months.
---

It's to bad we cant set up camp somewhere and heal or something.
---
Dat increased hit box + leeway
---
But really tho, give it a fair thought :)
---
It saves me a lot of "bar-space" and easily-reachable keybinds for other stuff. To me that's quite valuable.
---
This would be hilarious and nice to see at the same time
---
Eek. It would depend on your build. HOTW hybrid you def want agility and strength. But need Good pieces of Stam and int. That’s at max level. Lots of the gear at max level will be giving you a wide range of those 4. I believe tier 1 is hybrid gear. And so is PvP gear. 
---
As far as leveling feral you wanna stack agility then strength. Stam should come off of pieces that have agil or str. I also like to keep a few int Stam pieces too but not many. If you find a ring with good Stam and int and it’s double the # of stats that an agility Stam ring is then I’d absolutely take it. 
---
I’d like to think of int being more important for pvping while leveling. A shift from cat to heals then back to bear leaves you basically oom early on. With some int in there you can afford another shift to cat or out to heal and travel form away if things get rough.  
---
Feral lvling with PvP 
---
Agil&gt;str&gt;stam &gt;int 
---
HOTW for PvP at 60 
---
Agil&gt;str=stam&gt;int 
---
Resto at 60  for PvP 
---
Stam int are important. Spirit is good for regen during non cast times or while fighting in bear.  And maybe throw in some str there.
---
I mean you COULD, but it would be a *lot* of corpse runs and would take hours.
---
Nah, just choking on some mcdonalds burger after 20h shift at work
---
I'm not saying it isn't valuable, I'm just saying there's a reason why everyone doesn't feel clique is mandatory. 
---
Mouse-over spells is mandatory, no doubt. Clique is not.
---
Memory is foggy, but I think if you're in an instance where a boss was already killed it would lock you after a minute timer?  I vaguely remember a box saying "Warning you are about to be locked to this instance" with a timer.  Maybe this was added later.  Like I said.. very foggy memory of this so you very well may be correct.
---
Thanks all

I think that's a nice way of referring to the wingless horned wyverns :p
---
If they want to, ofc. 180k is kind of like having 180g in vanilla. That's not much to farm for a free month of WoW.
---
Wow, thanks for the thoughtful reply!!
---
I stand corrected boys congrats !!🎉
---
I guess the down votes tell me everything I need to know how most people feel about Alliance. 
---
I've tried to play Horde multiple times over the years but it just never feels right. Brewfest outside Org definitely will never feel right to me and it's my second favorite holiday.

I might hang back for a while and see how it all fills out.

You're allowed to do whatever you want. It's encouraged not to though in public chat. Private chat would be whatever you and the people you're with want.
---
Surely you realize that, while he's an extremely dedicated and skilled player, his clips are mostly highlight montages, right? Recklessness and/or good RNG. With great gear you'll come out between 27 and 35% crit chance, AFAIK. 
---
So obviously those times where you get to swing your big dick twohander, proc sword spec and/or Hand of Justice, and Mortal Strike, and it all crits at the same time are quite rare.
---
I wonder if it would be worth it to make a second account and make a healer just to follow your around and heal while you level a warrior.
---
I made this piece using photoshop to get rid of the folded paper edges, optimized it for printing, printed in black and white, crumbled the paper, poured coffe and red wine over it and burned the edges slightly. Finally placed it in the oven and here’s the result! Very cool looking map, the paper is crisp and it looks a few centuries old. The map to the left is before tarnish treatment.

There are many mods that allow you to change the UI scaling and move the UI elements. 
---
Head over to willitclassic.com to find addons for Classic.
---
No add-on is mandatory or essential in the literal sense. I just wanted to express that to me Clique is more important than basically any of the add-ons OP listed.
---
Ya I did. This was meant for people that already had their account ready to go. All the people with lost emails going to have to start from scratch.
---
Aww man!! :( I was rooting for you!
---
The original client without transparent water was amazing.  Mainly for PvP purposes.  We would have a blast with ambush setups hiding under water.
---
Most of the world firsts are from alliance guilds. Being horde is thinking all the kids are on alliance. Being alliance is realizing you want to play with adults.
---
I've gotta run 3 separate SRs now, can't cut that out!
---
Looks good. Only criticism is that the hunter's pet looks dead instead of asleep.
---
All this time you were sneaking around playing wow he just assumed you were wanking lol
---
People have played vanilla consistently for over a decade =p bad troll is hairy
---
Leveling a warrior was super painful before people knew how to do it. 
---
If you do the right level quests/mobs, keep your gear up to date and stack spirit it’s not bad at all imo.
---
Yes! Thank you! Send me your address and I will go to your house and suck you! (I am straight male)

Can someone explain to me the appeal in RP servers?
---
I'm never going to get a tidal charm =(
---
&gt; I just wanted to express that to me Clique is more important than basically any of the add-ons OP listed.
---
Yeah, that's where I disagree, since you can achieve essentially the same functionality through the standard available macro systems. 
---
I'd say the most important add-ons are the ones that add an entirely new functionality that the base game does not have at all. 
---
Threat meter, DBM, outfitter / trinket swapper, auctioneer, etc.
---
Idk man priests are squishy in PvP if they aren’t shadow.
---
Yeah, it was definitely one sided. :D Definitely funny to think that we may have killed each other at some point though.
---
It's probably my least favourite starting zone because of how big it is. I love the lore of it, it's cool that way but theres so much running and collecting low drop rate items
---
More like "LFM MC link Naxx and have full T3".
---
I like achievements as a whole, but I feel like their inclusion was detrimental to the community.
---
Yes sub and get macros, addons and keybinds set up for the 27th see u in azeroth
---
I'm sticking with the sabotage idea.
---
you will get oom after 2-3 blizzards and a frostnova, so better keep as much mana as possible
---
Even if you're not hit capped, it doesn't matter since most tank weps are swords/maces. There's the AQ20 quest axe, and Nef's axe, but after that it's swords and maces all the way.
---
You dont have to use lfr either
---
Well that's mean
---
Night elf traditional pilgrimage, I assume? :)
---
Now I want a top-down version of wow like Hotline Miami
---
Even if you get to the treasure chest, most are guarded by a million mobs. It's not worth it.
---
leveling with a friend is probably best for a warrior until you get a little higher level.  it might be slightly slower but i enjoy it more, and on last server me and my warrior friend had a good laugh getting into pvp battles in hillsbrad and shit
---
If you're being parried, attacking more often is bad
---
Lovely feature! Would be great to be able to set weight for Stamina too for PvP (or just survivability) purposes.

I am very much not looking forward to that quest. Might have to set an alarm for 3 am or something
---
Maybe everything is laced with laxatives and the eye drops are just citron juice
---
Put a ring on it
---
theres a separate client download. click on the version dropdown from the wow screen on the client and swap to classic
---
Is there a common to orcish and vice versus translator out there?
---
They told you how. Go do it, i beleive in you.
---
In that case, he'll probably need the ibuprofen...
---
I'm fine not hitting 60 in the first week, but I'm just using the head start to try and not get left too far behind with other people I'll be playing with.

This video is a guy doing it on beta and explaining how it works.
---
Which are also laxatives
---
Amazing! aliance please!
---
I am in classic and i have it downloaded. But since this is the live version and the stress test was taking place on the beta version i was wondering if its the same from here on
---
Shiit, I don't believe in me. I suck at all forms of art. That's why I pay $$$
---
The map was made before 1.12?
---
If priest is mostly on the table for PVP heals... just go paladin.  They're EXCELLENT PVP heals.  If you prefer the look of human paladin, go human.  Dwarf racial is nice, but liking what you are staring at for numerous days /played is way more important.  Plus the rep bonus from human will be really handy.
---
My favourite cinematic is between Wrath and Burning Crusade
---
With the artwork of a later expansion!
---
This is one of the reason why classic will have a huge fall off. False memories and simply people remembering incorrectly. They aren't the same thing, but they have some middle ground.
---
That son of a bitch is so sneaky. Nothing like getting comfortable killing the 100 ghouls for Darkshire only to get your ass slayed by a level 35 Elite Skeleton cause you took your eyes off him for 10 seconds.
---
I made a few mil in 3-4 days when I’m playing without much effort (just knowing the economy and how things function, like what people need or want) 
---
It’s super easy to sustain multiple accounts now adays.  A lot of people don’t know how to make gold or care to learn, so they buy the tokens to sell, letting others play for free.
---
I just did three copies and I live in Sweden, so it was never my intention to ship these. However, if you'd like to do the tarnish process yourself I could give you some details and the print file :)
---
and where does the money come to make these games? 
---
games are controlled by profits, which shitty freemium/micro transactions can bring in
---
I thought leeway wasn't active when characters were slowed. Confirm/deny?
---
Alright well thanks for the insight! Much appreciated
---
It's sad that he actually got up votes as well. People just have really bad memories I guess.
---
I expect we will see a huge population dropoff once Naxx is completed.
---
Releasing BC and WOTLK is the easiest way to combat that.
---
you cannot right click for ranged attack as far as i know, but you can always macro it into something
---
The alternative is everyone collectively leaves it alone and the server is empty and the content suffers. It's a win win to have more people even if they don't participate.
---
Must be lore friendly/fantasy friendly. No calling your character PoonMaster or ChukNoris
---
Im a retard so I appreciate the offer but I'm good
---
Take me home, to when community was an actual community and not a mass mob of streamer followers.
---
ahhh i cant decide between lock and druid.  Guess I will end up playing both at some point...thinking to start with lock
---
Well, QuestHelper used to do that. It's a pity it's no longer maintained.
---
Knowing how to 360 your camera while moving is ridiculously important(both in PvE and PvP), unfortunately reddit experts disagree.
---
Or guild used to heal like this before we discovered downranking.
---
You will definitely hate yourself later for not picking what you want. Ele/lock is incredibly fun and top tier in pvp. Just play what you want to play regardless, plans fall through and some friends end up not playing and you are stuck with a class you really didnt want. As for warriors early leveling solo can be a bit of a pain but if you always have good/bandages its really not that bad especially if you know how to hamstring kite and watch the swing timer. Not to mention everyone and their mom is going to be a warrior so you will have some gear competition. And feral druids are great flag runners. They certainly aren't dps powerhouses like warriors but they do their part and can be especially fun in 1v1s and world pvp which warriors are TERRIBLE at.
---
Shut up boomer.
---
Jk.  Welcome home
---
...by that line of reasoning wouldn't troll's Bezerking make them the worst horde tank race not the best?
---
In the pservers I have played on, you can not blink when silenced.
---
I probably have to now xd 
---
If our relationship survive the first week

But i alrdy told her i will Play 14-18hrs a day
---
Are you selling proofs of this?
---
Those tall bois have double joint knees my guy. They just kick the dirt *real* hard and spray a load of dust and dirt at your face. It's 100% unexpected, because "How does a bird throw sand in a 3 meter taurens eyes"
---
Really cool. Only oddity is that the small rips/tears at the map edges are still just printed on rather than actually being there. You could possibly try carefully tearing away the paper in those spots.
---
TPS is the most valuable thing for a tank that is hit capped, and it's really not hard to get there.
---
Haha I really enjoyed this. His voice is soothing I want a GM just like him. The end with the nachos made me lol thank you 😂
---
Lol, low weapon skill or just really bad luck?
---
The thing about the WotLK trailer is that it requires you knowing the history of Arthas to *fully* enjoy it. If you have no idea what Terenas is talking about, it's less impactful
---
shut up millennial
---
First stress test the auth wasn't too bad, the world servers were just zerged hard and couldn't even create a character
---
That’s just his personal tier list. I def think pallys are an A with them never running out of mana.
---
I never said they’re doing me a favor. It’s 2019, do you really think a company that has been launching games for 15+ years really needs that much help from a stress test? If testing with tons and tons of players was vital to their launch they would make it free. 
---
Personally, it’s much more important to me to vote with my dollar and tell blizzard that I WILL pay for anything vanilla content related so they continue to create things like it. 
---
If the vanilla stress test alone caused millions of resubs, it would just be another great example of how many people want vanilla and how it, and other xpack relaunches, should be a major part of their plans moving forward
---
But no, instead we get commies who won’t shell out $15 for a hobby they love.
---
If you play today you get a free level 60 of your choosing on launch!
---
how can this question be asked in general
---
There are a lot of warriors out there.  Not a lot of healers.  Things could change, but I think it will generally be harder to find healers for rerunning old group content.
---
You can just run the client. You don't have to wait for login, as soon as you run the .exe it will create the folders.
---
Such a shame we're getting screwed with shared DR introduced 1.10. I get the reference client has this present in 1.12 but I really doubt the "as intended" when the notes just simply say "Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns." It really makes you think the fact the DR was shared really was a bug that existed for 2 patches, especially since it was fixed with the release of BC, and since 1.12 is the reference client, it happens to exist.
---
This is awesome
---
That's because it only happens on private servers. When you played 13 years ago, they ran in a random direction. :)
---
Wow so much relevant information + a dedicated discord I wasn't aware of: thank you very much Infraos!
---
Exactly. Mmos are basically all about building up a character. And for a game to succeed they have to manage to make the players want to grow stronger. If there is no resire to be stronger (it's too easy) or working to become stronger have no effect then people have no desire to play and grow stronger. 
---
Both eso and retail wow lack both of these things when the players start out.
---
I call BS, marks were considered unique after 20 pieces, and 30 when patch 2.0.1 hit.
---
Well, in order to use those cds, you need to first have them up on either side, which is not a given. And if we are going to apply non-class specific cd’s we need to apply them to both sides equally. 
---
A hunter will scatter, freeze, rf, into aimed shot multi shot. And nade and of intimidate to secure a kill or gain range. 
---
I do really appreciate the example though, and especially the reminder about cleansing viper. I just think it’s not also easy to dismiss.
---
It starts at 4:20:69 on the dot
---
I have been playing on RP servers for years.  i have never removed my weapons in cities and I have never had people /spit on me.
---
PvP servers are the only servers where i have had people use the /spit emote.
---
If only posts like this got deleted as well.

This stupid question gets asked on the beta/test period of every game in existence. It's amazing that it continues.

Not too sure about that. Wyrmrest Accord has majority Horde, and the Discord I mentioned is like 70/30 Horde. The lore is different and I’d wager most are attracted to pre-Blood Elf Horde.

The test will begin as soon as you bend over and pull down your pants

You know there is a modern version of Voltron on Netflix? You dont need to be a 80s kid to get this.
---
Unnecessary reminder.
---
Thank you.
---
Using your eyes to look for enemies is important? Thank you for this revelation
---
You don’t have to play with a weapon, you don’t have to play with Deadly boss mods, you don’t have to play with your eyes open. There’s a lot of things you ‘don’t have to’ do but you’re comparing a gameplay effecting mechanic I.e. LFR (trivialises bosses and gives free gear) to a retexture of a druid’s animal forms. You’re just being pedantic because your argument has no legs to stand on and that’s a fact not an opinion.
---
First Aid, Cooking, Alchemy, SPIRIT GEAR
---
Leveling as a warrior you want to either carry a dress with spirit on it for when you're running around, and macro Charge to equip your real chest piece before actually casting charge. Spirit effects out of combat hp Regen, and while people will laugh that shit adds up. 
---
Over the course of hunting down 12 bear asses, putting on your dress between fights will shave minutes off recoup time once it's all said and done, and you've collect your 12 asses from those 31 bears.
---
It let you click a button and auto target decurse someone in the group/raid.
---
You didnt have to look at all at frames -  you spammed it and it did it all for you.
---
What a beautiful piece, very original.  Do you have a higher resolution version that you could share? :D
---
To provide a counter opinion, I played on both PvP and RP-PvP realms back in the vanilla days - I noticed no difference at all.  The experiences were indistinguishable, and if someone were blindly dropped into one they would be completely guessing whether it was PvP or RP-PvP.
---
That was my experience.  I understand that other people apparently had quite a different experience - but this was mine.
---
Kind of, the tokens you buy from the AH are "owned" by other players. Blizz let's people buy gold from them by purchasing a token to sell on the AH. Thing is, that token cost $20, not $15 like the sub. People who pay their sub with in game gold are actually contributing more to blizzard. It's a win/win.
---
Found the noob
---
I remember it being mentioned they were open to the possibility of TBC &amp; WotLK servers if Classic performs well.
---
Back in Vanilla I was very poor on my shaman.  I made most of my gold via alchemy and herbalism.  By the end of classic, I mostly stopped herbing, and just bought weeds on the AH and made flasks to sell. 
---
This time, I am interested in trying DM east Jump runs.  You can supposedly make quite a bit of gold like this.
---
I am still debating on what professions to get though.
---
If you want to make the most out of jump runs, you need enchanting.   If I want to try to make my own bags, and play with elemental pve dps, then I need tailoring.
---
So you got 1k+ upvotes for your low effort karma-hunting “meme”, but some people dared to downvote your elitist comment and they even dared to call you a boomer?
---
I’m sincerely sorry for you.
---
&gt; and from after people sub this weekend, to turn around and say “our sub numbers are the highest they’ve ever been and people must love current patch of BfA”
---
That's not tinfoil at all, except what they're really doing is using this time to turn around and tell their *shareholders* "our sub numbers are the highest they've ever been, people love our games".
---
Like someone doesn't know xD
---
Probably from sleeping like that
---
Herb and Alch and craft all the potions your heart desires. Although they also make excellent tailors because of their farming ability to farm cloth quickly
---
I played a Shaman on Nost extensively, I would say this is possible. If you want to be the best healer then you're going to put most of your points in resto. That said you should have no problems healing with 30/0/21. That said, I'm not sure if you're aware of how to raid heal as a resto Shaman at 60, but it's spam chain heal, literally.. So spec into mana reduction and increased healing with all spells. You don't really need to spec into any Healing Wave talents or anything, even for dungeons when you have gear.
---
The warning was added later on and there was definitely a time where the only way of getting locked was being present at a boss kill, how exactly locks function in 1.12 I can't quite recall.
---
This is so far off the mark. Vanilla was never even close to these numbers on any server, any Blizzard have announced a cap on players per layer which is 3k.
---
It's equally amazing that people still fall for the ol "Alt+F4" trick. Same with people still thinking the world is flat. You just can't fix stupid :T
---
As is tradition
---
I had no idea this existed!  This is definitely what I will be doing as a hunter, 1-10 sucks balls specially with a loaded up starting zone.
---
Anyone that has done this know how much silver/gold you can end with doing this?
---
Think you
---
Flight Path is most time effecient once you factor in random mobs on way there who can(will) daze you, having to avoid Stitches, and avoiding pvp if you're on a pvp realm going close to the STV intersection.
---
Also it let's you go grab a drink, stretch a bit, and squeeze the lemon.
---
The games figured out dude.

IF it was a good strategy everyone would be talking about it.
---
Uninstall and reinstall Battle.net client
---
  I'm subscribing today just so I can setup addons and macros. If I don't get in I would be upset. Expecting a queue but not being able to login at all would suck.
---
Druids make great gathering farmers with their Stealth, roots and runspeed (especially with the PvP pieces) in combat. It's way too easy to scour an area of herbs and mines without having to kill any mobs.
---
In your shoes I would make the Druid a herbalist amd miner, and the Shaman an Alchemist and Engineer at 60, but do Alchemy and Skinning while leveling.
---
 What a beautiful piece, very original. Do you have a higher resolution version that you could share? :D
---
    /who scholomance
---
    /w &lt;name on list&gt; hey, when you're done with your run, can i borrow you instance to craft flasks?

Might not work every time, but works often enough.
---
It’s more that PVP brings a lot of griefing and camping to people who just want to exclusively RP. That being said I’m really excited for RP-PVP.
---
I believe Bow Weapon damage is the biggest thing, followed by total agi/attack power. 99% of your damage comes from AAs.
---
Pets do a percentage of your total damage I believe.
---
No one RPs on RP servers.  Seriously, other than some random low levels in Goldshire (which were probably tourists anyway), I never encountered anyone RPing.

My buddies and I couldn’t find the answer online. But love the douche mentality of this sub. Keep it up dweebs!
---
This sub would be a ghost town if people didn't constantly ask same question with obvious answers
---
Yes, more damage equals more damage. Pets just continue to suck and scale poorly. Hunters in general after BWL don't scale as well compared to other classes.
---
That's nice and all, but what are you going to eat on the second day?
---
You can pretty easily jump in to someone's cleared school by just asking for them to save it for you when they're done. Could tip them for better results. Quick message in School general would do it
---
Because everyone thinks they're the first to come up with the question.
---
I played on both because my wife had IRL friends playing on an RP-PVP server.  First thing I noticed is no one was RPing they were all talking and playing normally.  Big difference was the population was low and PUG raids were almost non-existant and in PVP and PVE it seemed like the normal server had a higher skilled player on average.  To be honest it felt like the RP-PVP server had a lot of people who were there by accident or because they got talked into it.
---
I'm absolutely torn between hunter, mage and rogue. I really like their playstyles and currently all three are pretty evenly matched as potential main classes. I'm mostly interested in PvP (both premades and wPvP) and probably will try to reach at least rank 12.
---
I'd like to hear your opinions on the classes and why I should pick one of them over the others.
---
Yeah true . I just found out about this and gave the proof. I understand its a bit of controversial topic.
---
From what I understood arms is a bit better. But Fury gets "okay-ish" from 40 and onwards because of the talents needed to make it work. (If I remember correctly).  
---
Will probably play fury after 40 45, because that's what I like. But yeah, arms is "better" apparently.
---
Priest is very good, as is warlock.

This is top notch! Hope you have more to share :)

Secondly, if you had any god damned intelligence you'd know that Voltron was remade for Netflix. It's an extremely popular anime there ergo, yes we fucking get your reference you dweeb.
---
Additionally, Robot Chicken exists and they reference Voltron force multiple times throughout their show and I'm willing to bet that a metric ton of people know what robot chicken is.

Why don’t they scale as well?

Personally I think arms is the best leveling spec, and it tanks dungeons very well. You'll be fine grinding 50+ dungeons in your 31/x/0 spec. And then at 60 you can decide what route youd like to take in terms of spec. You really wont need to respec while leveling unless you want to spec into a different weapon specialization (if you're going arms from 10, that is).

It could be both Photoshop with some 3d they painted on. If not then they just made a grouped layer in PS and duplicated it. Any skilled concept artist though will most likely use simple 3d to paint on in Photoshop.

Hit rating matters a lot too. You want 9% for raids.

Warlocks and Druids are some of the best levelers. If you want to do damage, Warlock is your choice. In BWL with nothing but shadow spell damage gear on our Warlocks on Nost were by far the top of the meters, Naxx can be a problem though. Druids are considered the worst healers in Vanilla, but in my opinion they're one of the most fun to play. It all depends on how you want to play, you will most likely not be doing damage as a Druid...
---
My dream is blizzard finally makes a Starcraft Universe mmo strongly classic wow inspired! I know a man can dream though! :D

The amount of ppl logging into any stress test isn’t even remotely close to the same universe that will be logging into classic when it goes live, so take that with a mound of salt

Layers are realm-wide, they don't break up individual zones. The way you describe is how it works on retail (where it is called "sharding") but they have said that it will not work that way in Classic.

I won't be spending much time there; I'll just be logging in to get my WTF folder set up to copy over to my non-beta character. Macros, keybinds, addon settings, that kind of thing. Having that setup before launch will be a big help.
---
You absolutely can shit on people.
---
IK for a fact that every raid requires hunters in AQ40/Naxx for their utility, but Hunters are the lowest DPS class in the game, especially in late-game due to poor scaling.
---
Totem twisting isn't as bad as people make it out to be, there's only a couple of times you need to be twisting to really be sucesfull. In BGs/groups you can usually just twist once or twice every so often and not a full totem rotation like in a raid.
---
I have G-Keys so I usually bind all my totems to the F1-F4 + G keys which helps a lot with twisting.
---
Youre gunna get dumpstered by a lot of naxx geared classes unless you are much better than them. Hunter peaks in MC and its downhill from there
---
Tbh it may be a little difficult but when it comes down to it, if you show up for raids and come prepared, I’m sure a guild will take you in. Also, there are PVP guilds out there that don’t really raid but do WPvP and BG’s.

DISORDER
---
Private server launches aren't indicative of official server launches. Not in server behavior nor in player behavior nor is scope.
---
For starters, private server players are a self selecting group, generally much more hardcore, more focused on end game, more practiced in efficiently leveling through lowbie areas, and likely have built up a lot of habits based on bugs and inaccuracies relating to mob spawn rates and NPC behavior. Many, likely the majority, of players playing Classic at launch will be returning players who never played private and current retail players just wanting to check out the new thing. Their behavior will be colored by how they're used to retail working and habits developed from that.
---
Additionally, the server infrastructure of Blizzard is likely very different from that of private servers. The bottlenecks are in different places. The behavior under load is likely different.
---
And finally, of course, Classic has layering. Wee don't know the final tuning out layering nor its true impact on the starting zone experience, and Blizzard might even do live tweaks to that tuning as we play in the first few hours or days.
---
Even the way the client behaves in response to servers going up/coming down as you look at the server select screen isn't exactly the same between the 1.12 client and 8.x.
---
No, I'm thinking he asked for professions that help him in PvE and he should therefore have engineering.
---
Defend your position instead of calling names. You have had and still have plenty of time to find answers instead of reposting simple questions.
---
Yeah, basically any range dps with more then 2 CCs can 1v2 that comp because they only have 1 gap closer between the two of them.
---
Have you done those two gathering professions on a toon yourself? I'm just wondering how annoying it gets to constantly have to switch what you're detecting.
---
Love this! Nice work capturing the spirit of the game.
---
I swear nightfall only ever procs as the enemy dies.
---
The difference now is that we know before launch exactly what to expect at endgame, so while there was once some sympathy for people getting blindsided by the unreceptiveness of endgame guilds to grouping with their spec of choice, there won't be anymore. We are now going in with our eyes wide open.
---
Put one point in arcane subtlety otherwise your sheep gets resisted 4% of the time, which you can reduce to 1% by taking the talent and getting 1% on gear. Imo you can take it from missiles, resilience or atunement (i would take 1 point out of missiles myself).
---
I would also drop frost warding for literally anything else in the frost tree. I like to put it in winters chill, 20% chance to put debuff on target which boosts damage and needs to be dispelled before other debuffs (like slow/freeze/sheep). This shouldn't be underestimated imo. But straight up 2% more damage from piercing ice is nice too.
---
New to classic, should I play warrior or rogue?
---
the early game on private servers is a bit unforgiving than it will be on Classic because their dodge/miss stuff isn't tuned properly early on we found out
---
This is what I’m taking about.. the two answers above are completely different. It makes
---
me confused and I don’t know what to believe...
---
Ah. You'll be fine as your dps spec at 60 for 5s, and likely an OT position for ubrs. I think the 31 5 15 build is great for MT ubrs, and will still hold up nicely for pvp on the side if that's your thing.

I can't find the end time for the stress test.  I was going to use it to set up addons and stuff, but I have a job and my gf is coming over tonight for the first time in like a week and a half due to finals and I don't want to ignore her.  I'll be doing that enough when we move in together on the 24th and classic comes out the 26th at 6pm.
---
I was certainly considering this after all the answers: will do it, thanks!
---
How does Fury make you kill things quicker?
---
Yeah it's just too much for my brain to manage tbh, might sound like I'm shit and maybe I am but idk I just don't have the multitasking ability required
---
Engineering is still the best in pve, sappers and grenades will pump your dps
---
You need int for a bigger manapool
---
Great news! Personally won’t be doing this option but very happy for all who will!

PS we have first somewhat confirmation, Esfand has confirmed he won’t roll RPPVP.

Everything I've read so far has recommended leveling as Shadow, and only switching to Holy or Disc once you reach max-level. The guides claim you can still heal leveling dungeons effectively in shadow spec.
---
I'm still not sure whether to follow a guide's recommendations, or just pick whatever talents/skills seem the most useful to me as I go (and end up with a somewhat inefficient/meme spec).
---
This is what I mean, the two answers are completely different, idk which I should believe..

It is less about adding game time (will sub for the 12th anyway) and more about not wanting to "spoil" the feel. 
---
If I am playing WoW again it will be for real, with permanence. 
---
Also, I have things I ought to be doing and I do not need another reason to procrastinate.
---
Your not going to find one. You are going to have a rough time, I can tell.
---
Thank you for doing this. I like your work. I was actually going to do something similar, mainly to work towards having all faction mounts available before attempting a rank 11 grind. 
---
I tried something similar to this on a private server but I was greyed out of the starting zone quests by the second zone, so I didn't even attempt the third. 
---
Is the rep drop off progressive after it's greyed out or does a grey quest give the same at n+1 versus 60? The latter being the case I would probably just plan to come back and hit those at 60 as there will be less competition then.
---
Haha yeah sure, overhealing is the best. Jesus i hope you never played a healer, you are absolutly Retarded.
---
level as shadow, then respec to healer when you hit 60. use your spells that offer the highest damage per mana, not damage per second. starshards is a really efficient spell when it comes to damage per mana. mind flay is awful for damage per mana. there's a couple good leveling guides online that explain the best way to level. i can't link them right now, sorry.
---
Yeah I know your situation. I had troubles finding a good picture so I basically made it myself. A screenshot of the map in wow classic client, removed the fortress icons for capital cities, cropped out the UI and erased some maneuvering text. Although it was still kinda low res which would be too noticable in some places, so I composited it together with the wotlk map which is available in high res. Just skipping northrend and some other changes :)
---
Here are the final images I used in both grayscale and color.
---
https://imgur.com/a/HMsc16r

Booty Bay (insert creepy smiley face dude here)

Nesingwary
---
Valor's Rest

Didn't worry about the time previously, boss asked if I wanted to use PTO for this month 2 hours ago. I couldn't confirm the exact time as anything related to video games is blocked on internet and no cell reception in my building at all. So thought I would ask here so I could confirm PTO days with my boss before leaving.

I'm quite tempted to try making a pure cloth-wearing Paladin as an alt project - is that a viable thing to try to do?

It'll be fine.  It's classic wow mate.  You can run it on a toaster.

Borderlands of warcraft

Speaking as horde, they're definitely an A in PvP.
---
Actually hilarious
---
Yah, I farmed a bunch of elementals too.    The water elementals in felwood, and the fire elmentals in arathi.   Made quite a bit of gold selling greater fire protection potions.   
---
When AQ came out I would farm the clothes in silithus, and solo the little mini boss elementals.   I did that enough to summon a raid boss with just my mats.
---
Well made Horde scum! My hype is in a critical level because this art is too awesome. I'll save this post to give you a humble silver one day when you're not expecting, like the way i'll gank your filthy horde comrades when they're not expecting. Cheers!

Not really throwing away if they want to reserve names on Monday. And it's only 2 weeks of sub.
---
And yet here you are....
---
Anything that requires you mouse to be in a specific position an exact time is a loss of performance.

Why do they fall off after phases 1 and 2?
---
Invictus with the alliance RP leader during TBC. I didn’t RP but I was the GM of the main PvP guild so we supported his RP battles with capable bodies.
---
What's the Language column number indicate? The name I want is blocked in just one language, not all..
---
1) That doesn't matter until Locks start becoming high damage dealers; which honestly isn't until AQ/Naxx
---
2) If a group is going that hard on buffing locks, they'll probably be going hard enough to have someone in a PI/SW spec, or a hybrid holy/shadow spec for healing. It's still better for them to have the priest as a healer that spams rank 1 MF to stack SW, not actually going DPS
---
I’m not OP btw. But I think your elitist opinion is wrong. 
---
Don’t assume everybody needs to be in min/max server first guild.
---
I will happily live in BGs when they drop anyway
---
orgrimmar
---
If playing the game the way it was meant to be played then I guess I’m an edge lord.
---
They were stress tests. They were explicitly and intentionally overloading the shards. No one knows what the tuning of layering will be at launch, and that might be changed live as people are playing.
---
\*plays retail for an hour\* let me jump on quick and get a quick 4-5 levels on my alt toon before dinner.
---
\*plays classic for an hour\* Let me fucking die to the same 2 mobs for a "orange" colored quest asking /1 "LF people to fucking help me" and go nowhere. Classic life \*nods head\*
---
Even then, aren’t you better off just dragging a priest along with shadow weaving them having them go full DPS?
---
You're a healer anyways, go for it
---
It hasn't yet, unfortunately.
---
warlock dps.  vanilla .. lol
---
warlocks were overglorified debuffers.   that's why a raid might bring 1 or 2.
---
What are your priorities in the game?
---
https://technology.ihs.com/582141/world-of-warcraft-in-china-changed-the-payment-of-game-time-to-subscription  
---
It also seems as of legion both of us are wrong.  It changed, with huge opposition, from game time to subscription based play in China under NetEase, and they are charging $11 (RMB75).
---
 Read the first book in the war of the ancient trilogy. Only Warcraft book I have read. Found the story ok but the writing felt very amateurish. Considering it's a book based on a computer game I didn't expect a masterpiece.  Still felt it was underwhelming. Read a lot of fantasy when I was younger and that book wasn't anywhere close in quality to the fantasy books I used to reads. I guess if you really love Warcraft it's worth a read but there are so many better series to invest your time in.
---
What are doing with your life mate, you’re born to be a comedian, stage is waiting for you
---
Right? Seeing things like the Unreal trailers people made demonstrating things like Goldshire in photorealistic graphics has always been really appealing to me.
---
"Hey team,  I'm oom, I know we still have 70% of the fight but I gotta melee unless i get innervate plz"
---
Glad you liked it mate
---
To be fair, if you’re American you don’t really have an excuse for not being able to at least read Spanish. 
---
And since Euros constantly boast about how many more languages you know over Americans...shouldn’t y’all be able to read Spanish too?
---
You have to click on unit frames regardless to heal.
---
That just makes hunter sound trash

I chose night elf druid because of the appearance in this trailer.
---
Honestly the massive amount of individuals that are talking about wow classic around my office (huge corporation status) is very much hype train. I love how it seems to be a mostly "older" crowd
---
How is paying for a subscription to a game useless? Or a micro transaction? take the tinfoil hat off man, they’re a company trying to make money and if they see tons of people resubbing for content they want, they will make more of that content so they can make more money. 
---
It’s okay that you’re broke af and can’t afford $15, I’m sure you’re from some euro country that has a standard living wage or some shit that can cover it so you’re good. Just stop trying to understand basic economics because it’s way too complex for you
---
Bravo, struck me right in the feels
---
As a sidenote, be sure to keep a gearset of intelligence+spirit gear in your bank. Even as feral spec, you can easily heal all dungeons up to BRD (which is still very possible, but it gets a little harder here).  
---
Being able to both tank and heal basically ensures you a spot in all dungeon groups.
---
*Keep yer feet on the ground!*
---
Exactly this
---
TS always felt like garbage.  I always preferred Vent over it.
---

---
Not hunter or warrior?

Not worth it to me to resub 2 weeks early just for the stress test.

Sure there is, Elywnn. It’s nice and peaceful, like being occupied by Germans.

---

---
Your phone is also blocked? Talk about shitt work env lol
---
Lol, but they're actually most likely only going to add 8 servers or less. How did they listen?
---
But with TS the server license is the product and not its users' data. I hope the upcoming TS which will be a lot more discord-like will stick to that.
---
Those sound like robot names, not gnome names. When gnome NPCs have names with tech or tool words in them they tend to be two words (or partial words) mashed together, like "Sparkfizzle" or "Cogwrench" or "Fusefeather." Note that not all of the words that are used for this are tech related. Also this tends to be the surname - gnomish first names sound like generic fantasy names, mostly.
---
The boosts were added because players screamed for them; the devs were (and remain) opposed to them in principle. What generally happens is “game begins at max” players buy the boosts, grind to the end, find that there really isn’t much there, and quit. At least this way, SE gets a bit more money out of them before they inevitably move on to another game they’re guaranteed to hate.
---
As for the other mogstation items, they’re thankfully glamour-only, and the vast majority of them are event rewards from previous years. Since FFXIV has a different seasonal event each year, and the rewards from those events are different every time, they wanted to make it possible for people who missed those events to have access to the items without trivializing the participation of those who actually did it. I’m not sure I agree with their solution, but that is their reasoning.
---
When I see comments like that I don’t want to give up on hunter and it makes me motivated to play one. Then there’s comments like hunter loses to every 1vs1 if the enemy is good..
---
Blizzard is a company and cares about the game's servers and having it be stable than to have "but muh imershun and new werld!!1"
---
Get over yourself. You're being a dumbass who thinks Blizz is conspiring against the players just to screw us over. You're not thinking of the other person's pov at all and taking it into account. The ONLY "positive" of your way (having 100k people in each starting zone) is being able to see a lot of people and ... that's it? Fighting over mobs, chests, hard to click anything, server's crashing, tons of people lagging, etc. Majority of this "anti-layering" crowd have an iq lower than the chair they're sitting on I swear.

Use what you get while leveling, but you'll end up mostly wearing cloth as a healing pally anyway.
---
I won't.  A, I'm working, b. I don't want to resub 2 weeks before classic.
---
No...
---
Optimal is unnecessary if you aren't playing from a competitive point of view. Tons of players and guilds cleared all the raid content with unoptimized specs, gear, no consumables, no world buffs, and clicking all their abilities while back pedaling. The thing that got them through that content was teamwork and passion! I've seen other people say it, but play what makes you have an interest in your character. You may not be part of a guild working towards fasted Naxx speedruns but you'll still get through everything with a dedicated group / guild!
---
I have to take the car to the shop during the stress test :(
---
Yep... I wish this stuff would be posted elsewhere (or not at all) but it’s only going to get worse before it gets better. 
---
I bet most of the care packages we see are going to be filled with diabetes-inducing, heart-stopping processed junk too. People really need to research the “food” they eat. This crap is terrible.
---
I see no reason we can't have both options because it is a instance. Just have the battlemaster let you pick either one.
---
Maybe check out Brang’s videos from back in classic.
---
Keep in mind, he edits out the losing fights (not all of them) for the epic ones. But he was a very skilled hunter, and shows you what it’s capable of.
---
I'm not invited, for some reason. I was invited to the last one. Sucks.
---
I'll take the ice. Thank you
---
Also my 20s... and early part of my 30s...
---
No I think guilds will turn down all sorts. I just think there will be other guilds out there that accept all sorts. I actually think I’ll be happy playing the game as the class and spec I want to
---
Tbf classic has been throughly explored and the pve is set for the skill levels of players in 2004.  So it really only has pvp and if there is one thing I learned after 15 years of playing mmos is. People hate pvp.
---
Yes it's hard to find a guild that will take a shadow priest.
---
Some will take you as a healer and value you if you put up shadow weaving.
---
Fewer will take you as a dps.  Plus your dps is going to suck.
---
I spent 5+ years playing Pserver vanilla wow, I’ll wait for launch.
---
In a raid environment? Sure, not in a party.
---
Either way, by using target to heal you get much more control over *when* you use your mouse allowing you more freedom to move.
---
Her new BF is gonna be a lucky guy
---
Classic has already inspired a generation of mmos. 
---
For a decade every game that came out in this space was a “wow killer”. They all iterated on wow and they’ve all failed. 
---
The mmo space will not see innovation that takes root until wow is over. An mmo requires players, so long as blizzard keeps the player base players are incentivized to not jump ship to competing mmos.
---
Happened to get an endoscopy scheduled on today exactly. I’m currently sitting in the lobby of the facility waiting for them to call me back for it, i guess good news today is worth missing the stress test though and I might be able to play later on if there’s nothing wrong.
---
ofc it is.
---
Be a guild masters girlfriend, it’s easy
---
&gt;My hope is that they will eventually roll classic into TBC and achievements will come then 
---
My expectation is that someone will either come out with an addon, or a separate website, that tracks your character and awards 'achievements' that can then be shared.
---
I got my hunter on p server to like 22 a year ago. A few months ago my friend and I were feeling the hype and got to like 32, but to avoid burnout he stopped playing. I made it a goal to get to 40 before classic so I can get my mount and stop. So I did that just a couple weeks ago. It was a really enjoyable weekend.
---
Not going to resub just yet, but i'm excited to see how close we're getting!
---
I didn't say I saved them up and turned them in all at once......
---
You don't think it helps with detection radius? I have messed about with and without and it seems to make a difference.
---
Same.
---
No, we get to keep these characters.
---
/s
---
Honestly man, unless you have a specific goal, choosing your talents as you level on the fly feels like a very authentic wow classic experience to me.
---
Definitely start off with wand specialization though lol
---
Everything will be wiped
---
By the beard of fucking Thex, yes characters will be wiped.
---
So do holy priests with shadow weaving, and they are still useful
---
Just added game time. Didn't bother try sign up for the other events since it was chance. I needed to sub for character creation in a couple days anyway so now is good.
---
Cata was badass too. 
---
Just the cinematic though. Definitely not the actual expansion.
---
You mean the wetlands town not menethil I'm assuming?
---
Even with layering.  We shall see - maybe, maybe not.
---
I love Chinese man.
---
Its not you just strafe away instead of run through
---
dae too mature and refined for filthy *pvp* servers? now that am refined sophisticated adult playing world of warcraft, i cant be playing with *young people* who make *immature jokes* on the internet. one time i saw a character with a name that *wasnt* from lord of the rings, and i was simply shocked, appalled, and to be honest, quite hurt.
---
Whats the difference between them?
---
Also, as fun as it is to use charge, get a ranged weapon early and always have ammo, and use it to pull from camps. Much safer to get one guy without charge rage than 2-3 with charge rage.
---
It’s aged remarkably well. I remember thinking 15 years ago that one day video game animation would match that level of quality. Now there are plenty of games that do, but I just want to play that one from 15 years ago lol
---
I'm reporting this for spam.
---
after watching the last year of sea of thieves, and the huge number of people that cry about being sunk. yes having non pvp server is a very high priority of some people that want to enjoy a game without fear of losing their life to another person online.
---
In the pservers I played the mobs ran to the nearest mob, so they would always pull another one.
---
If in classic is a random direction it will be easier.
---
Yes they are still viable. They do the least damage but hunter bring so much utility you always bring at the very minimum 1, but most likely 2-3
---
Pretty much the only reason. I will wait for release.
---
Everyone with an active subscription can participate this time
---
I can so audibly hear that loud "*whoooooosh*" of a missed 2h melee attack.
---
But it's happened several times already..?
---
No, it remains unclickable forever. They are just baiting us with the stress test.
---
I like how your thinking green here. A bioproduct.
---
Just join the elvui bandwagon like everyone else
---
Well you're going to have to resub in a few days for early name res..
---
Just an exaggerated personal taste trope.  
---
Funny A.F. that the comment is getting downvoted imo. :-D
---
Poop sock
---
Even without raid achievements and shit like that, achievements are just bad. They tell you what to do so you get a shiny title or point, instead of you doing awesome things because you want to.
---
Its just a launcher stress test today
---
Priest.
---
They should be on the linked list of reserved names.
---
We had some guy named Illidan on our realm during vanilla. I think he was forced to change his name right before TBC with some famous demonhunter was released.
---
warrior is only good at 1v1 with healers/support,  hunter i guess but theres not really many flashy plays to make when you can aimed shot auto shot multi shot KO someone
---
Believe it or not, LinkedIn has the best targeting and best ROI of any social media marketing I've ever seen, even though their per-click and per-view prices are quite a bit higher.
---
It really depends on how "optimal" you want to be, if you want to min/max your leveling speed, you're going to be melee weaving, if you just want to chill and have fun you don't need to.
---
But then I have to pay to use voice chat
---
ElvUI is also not ready for Classic

#  &lt;Encore&gt; |Horde| [NA-EST-PvP] Recruiting Raiders and Social Players 
---
Our raids are scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday, from 8pm EST to 11:30pm EST. After the release of BWL in phase 3, a third raid night dedicated to previous tier farm content, and 20-man raids will run on Sunday, from 8pm EST to 11:30pm EST. We are not competing with any other guild on our realm for progression first kills. What we offer are well organized raids on a lighter schedule led by highly experienced, level-headed players. We have clearly defined goals for the raid team, and as a community we work to help our members reach those goals. Distribution of loot in raids is governed by the EP/GP system (Effort Points &amp; Gear Points). Encore's effort point system incentivizes attendance, and punctuality. A loot council assembled from class officers and raid leaders will establish class priority on a narrow range of exceptional BiS raid epics, and player priority for legendary weapons. Recruitment is open to all players. Whether you want to raid from Onyxia all the way to KT, or you're just seeking a friendly community of WoW veterans to level and pvp with, we welcome everyone.

To apply contact the GM on Battlenet (Delphi#1393), or through Discord (Delphi#4818). Then take a moment to complete this form. [https://forms.gle/BqJYaz6fGDV1twNk9](https://forms.gle/BqJYaz6fGDV1twNk9)

---
I don't ever use actual pictures or art as my phone lock screen but this is amazing. Definitely going against my normal policy to put this as my lock screen!
---
so does this mean i have to download the main WoW to actually do the stress test?
---
Anyone saying that is just being ridiculous. From a super competitive area-style PvPer *maybe* that's the case... But this isn't BFA, that kind of mentality doesn't apply to 90% of players. There's going to be tons of people in raid/leveling/farming specs and not PvP specs. Hunters have the huge advantage of having viable raid AND pvp AND farming specs all in one; which gives them a huge leg up in PvP. 
---
Even then, hunters have huge range and can land ridiculous crits with aimed shot; and they can kite the hell out of any melee class if they get the drop on them. On my PServer hunter I was easily winning 75% of the times someone within 4~or so levels ganked me. Only class I've played that was better at winning open world 1v1 ganks was UD SPriest which is an absolute unkillable monster.
---
yeah yeah yeah yeah
---
I first saw this trailer after installing the game (as I'm sure most of us did since YouTube and online streaming videos pretty much didn't exist). As the white faded in to the dwarf's face, I legitimately thought it was real for a second. 
---
So damn well done, and very high quality for the time. Still high quality 15 years later.
---
So, do what I was already doing. Got it.
---
You don't have seal of command past leveling though.
---
Yeah, download BFA.
---
Høres bra ut!👍
---
Honestly, it comes down to how dedicated you can be. Guilds will take 1 at most Shadow priest with the expectation that that person has near 100% attendance. If you're that hardcore, you can probably find a guild. If you want to raid casually as a shadow priest...you're gonna have a bad time.
---
holy shit
---
Common sense is uncommon.
---
as vaktas says it puts them in combat, you can also silence them with imp counterspell and prevent their intimidating shout (fear).
---
That's my plan, I don't want to ruin anything for Classic.
---
I also leave for work in 30 minutes when it starts lol.
---
Well thanks for your insightful comment about that expansion then.
---
Whaaat, no way, shadow i s superior, you dont need drinks. PW: Shield  &gt; SW: Pain &gt;  Wand.
---
oh thank god.
---
I used Luna on a vanilla pserver.
---
Allods was awesome at launch before pay to win and all the garbage bloat associated with it was introduced. I would probably play a classic Allods server even today but I know it would never be done properly knowing who the publisher is. They would probably take the Rift approach and use the current patch but time-gate content.
---
and just remember, these are the large percentage of the people who will be playing the game, god help us
---
I literally don't know what?
---
Are you talking about the figure or the notion of a full realm? Because that has already been covered in another post in the reply chain.
---
There's a search function on Reddit.

Silvermoon EU must be around 95% Alliance
---
&gt; regular PvP gear has high stamina but as a glass cannon in the back lines you care little about this.
---
PvP doesn't really work like that.
---
I know I want to heal, play horde but not play priest, so it's between a shaman and druid. 
---
I think I'll have a better, more interesting rotation on a shaman + gear competition and I LOVE everything about female orcs (my favourite animations) but druids just have so much movement utility and general annoyance in the open world and bring so much to a raid. I just wish they had an ooc rez :(.
---
I was horribly depressed throughout highschool and honestly wouldn't have made it had it not been for WoW and the friends I made through it.
---
You did see the /s right?
---
&gt; I also recommen turning off smart pivot in the came options.... this way if you let go of your mouse look — the came won’t try snapping back to the fixed position. Increase your max camera distance and zoom out
---
These are all great adivces, i actually didnt knew up until now that you could zoom out more, the way you could in retail. This was the main reason to actively use the hold left click thing. Now that i know about this it might not be very necessary.
---
Today is an open stress test. It is not a soft launch of any kind.
---
Whatever faction your friends play.
---
It’s weird you actually have to buy and download every game on the blizzard launcher before you can access the stress test
---
yes
---
So, my experiences with RPPvP: While walking through cities like Orgrimmar/Stormwind, you're very likely to see people in random spots typing out emotes with /e to describe their actions and playing out in-character conversation. For example, you're mounted and running through Org and you pass a hunter talking with someone and manage to catch 
---
&gt;Grothnak's worg impatiently nips at a small leather-bound pack hanging from his belt. "Yeah, those knife-eared elves ambushed our caravan to Splintertree," he continues, firmly pushing the canine away without breaking eye contact. The worg obediently sits in defeat. "We were victorious, but I would've taken an arrow to the chest if not for Grimhowl here."
---
&gt;Grothnak then unstraps the pack, lifts a slice of venison from it and tosses it to his loyal companion. "He's a good dog."
---
And it's very likely this is someone taking a skirmish they had in WPvP and incorporating it into their character's story while they're having some downtime. These sorts of people make the server feel more lived in and immersive.
---
When you're out in the world, you're a lot more likely to have someone help you out and then chat with you for a little bit in-character as well. You might even stumble upon a bunch of people from the same guild in a certain place and come to find they're currently using it as a base of operations. Join a guild with some structure and you're very likely to be spending a lot of time in contested areas trying to hold territory, scout out enemies, "take" other areas, etc. all to advance your guild's overarching storylines. Rivalries with opposing factions guild form, hunting parties gather up, large scale battles emerge from them clashing. It's just a lot of fun that you don't really find on other servers if you're into some casual creative writing alongside your PvP.
---
That wasn't the question, and ElvUI isn't ready either
---
Rogue. Warriors, even the dps wanna be ones, are frequently thrust into the tanking role, which makes you the defacto group leader. In that role knowledge of the game is very useful. Not saying that you can't go straight in as a warrior and learn as you go, but you'll have a smoother experience starting out as a dps, learning the ropes, and then trying out warrior down the line.
---
wait no, really?
---
Cant MoveAnything handle this?
---
&gt;Low Pop Soon To Be Merged RP-PvP
---
I don't know about NA but Defias Brotherhood EU has always been a hugely popular RP-PvP server, along with several others, so I'd be surprised if it doesn't take off in Classic
---
This is true as well. But I remember rolling horde when 10yo noob because it looked more badass / dark and edgy. So I guess both sides will have their part of "bad players"
---
Yeah we will get to keep characters, so you better hurry up to lvl 15 before they close the servers. But just imagine those in the beta!! Some of them will start at lvl 40 on the 27 august. And some of them even have thunderfury !!
---
But there is nothing to cry about. Its been like this with every beta and stress test throughout history.
---
Deny. It is however deactivated when backpedalling.
---
Yeah kinda nuts you have to buy destiny and call of duty and Starcraft, but I don’t make the rules
---
Yeah that was my understanding as well. Reason why I didn't bother to read any other Warcraft books.
---
Oh I was questioning how that person in one breath criticized ESO specifically for letting you play as any role with a single  character, then celebrated FF14, a game which lets you play any role with a single character.
---
He makes the fights 4 minutes to get a more accurate average. DPS for every class is much higher at the 2 minute mark. 
---
Mages still pull ahead in Frost. 
---
The difference is marginal at best in a group setting, especially before T3.
---
alright nvm ur fukin with my donger
---
Search function brainlet.
---
First 5 points into Spirt Tap, then go holy. Shadow is overrated for leveling. Holy does just fine opening with Holy fire, tossing on SW:P, and throwing out a few smites before you finish mobs off with your wand. Holy has some really great talents for boosting your holy damage.
---
Come and feel my reckoning bomb
---
Dominos is fine tbh 👌
---
The stress test is running through Steam, not the Blizz launcher.
---
ah, only if the game was really like this
---
Elwynn Forest gets me every time. Unreal nostalgia chills.
---
Update: There's a real champ working on it, but he's already fixed it for the low res version and promised to do the high res as well (we had some miscommunication about the high / low res). 
---
Once I receive the high res version I will host it somewhere fore everyone to download!
---
ELV is more customizeable, TUK is a finished general UI that requires out of game changes to LUA.
---
Same framework, but TUK isn't as easily customizeable / shareable.
---
If you just want something that looks good (though still has a fair bit of customizability) TUK is a fine option for now.
---
The most current version is [here](https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6233)
---
There is no other download, other than the super secret download only available to people who post simple questions on this sub that have been posted dozens of times before. 
---
 Congratulations, you unlocked it!
---
perfect.
---
I can work with this, thank you!
---
I think you're probably just around older people. I'm around younger people and it's still pretty hype.
---
All Stress tests so far have lasted about 26 or so hours (I've played in all of them), so you should be able to play when you get home from work Friday.
---
based on prior experience, the test will end about 4pm pst on Friday (so the next day).
---
Well, when you ask a question that's been asked a thousand times and can be found in a search of the subreddit or an easy Google search you are going to hear about it.  Not sure what that has to do with salt, age, or legacy.  Also, you seem no issue accessing this website so why lie about being able to use the internet?

Really? Well, seems like I know what I am going to do tonight then :D

As someone who was an adult when wow was launched, I can still relate because I went through the exact same thing with the first Diablo. Apparently "but Mom, you fight the devil" wasn't a good enough excuse
---
Go check dude, CoD and Destiny are in the launcher, at the bottom.
---
This is why I'm not going to bum rush the game in the beginning. Why even bother?
---
If you're able to play 25 hours a week (hooray for having jobs now!), it'll probably take 10 weeks to hit 60.
---
What difference is 10 weeks vs. 10 weeks and a few days?
---
I feel you Bro I lost my Dad at the age of 11 and the guildie's and friends I had helped me through it and made it so much easier and I dont think they even realized how much they helped me through it. Sadly lost contact with them but i'll never forget Dogs of War on Alonsus greatest guild I ever joined.
---
cool, that early edited map was kinda broken
---
Demo is fine for leveling. Imp DS is very nice for sustain, but in order for it to be good you need to stack a ton of spirit, which is not where you want to be gearing on a pvp server. Demo has strong leveling skills in Demo Embrace and Imp VW, better summoning, better pet damage, and the MD buff is crazy good. What you lose in sustain from Aff you pick up in versatility and the pet doing more of the work while you just wand things down.
---
I still level Aff because I like the spec, but Demo's totally fine for leveling.
---
Ah I'm so sorry. I seriously can't give enough praise to this game though.
---
Usually 24-26 hours depending on how the first two hours go. The first 2 are the Stress Test portion and typically the tests go 24 hours, however there was one or two where they extended it due to issues logging in the first 2 hours.
---
You could ride that build to rank 11 with no problems. Do not worry about frostbite, honestly it's good but not required and your idea of saving 58-60 for frostbite is good. You can also still aoe grind with frostbite if you round up mobs and tightly pack them then cone of cold and arcane explosion spam, even if one gets frozen you are circling the mobs and they stay packed, harder to control if you cant mount first to tightly pack them, so consider that.
---
On the wow page in the launcher, there is a dropdown menue to switch between retail and classic.
---
naw, just already planned and waited to appear more customer focused
---
I played every moment of vanilla with music volume at 0%. Did I miss something?
---
Another post asking me to go do work. 
---
Nah bro you can research yourself.
---
i'm gay
---
An actual good piece of art on this sub. Well done, sir/ma’am.
---
Rogues aren't broken at this point in the game and warriors require a ton of gear to really dominate. Even then, they're still pretty killable via kiting if they don't have a pocket healer.
---
PVE they definitely are tier 1 dps with Mage, and get extra raid slots. But that means they compete with more people for gear.
---
I'm hyped for my druid :)
---
Kk thx. I assume you mean anger management, cruelty shield slam with those numbers? Or 31 in arms?

… that's different.
---
DAE WASD?!
---
This game is much more to me than just a game as its been apart of my life since I was 9 and im now 22 never regretted starting wow and i'll never quit :D
---
I've searched a few terms related to this and couldn't find anything.  Thanks for being a huge help.
---
Very good point. The challenge in tanking 5mans isn't the mechanics, it's that you are the defacto group leader who has to keep 4 randos from fighting amongst themselves while still progressing through the zone.
---
I haven't played retail Wow in over 10 years, I have played Retail Vanilla have been playing Vanilla private servers for the last 5 years this is not just something I remember it's just how the class was designed in Vanilla. It's an unfortunate reality, it is not viable however if you want to play it then have fun just know you will not be elite at anything end game.
---
If not... you can always make addon that works in a same way... or hire someone who will do it for you. :)
---
Thank you! Will definitely do that
---
Hah, I work in the wrong environment for sure!
---
There's probably more old people than I realise. It's an old game that's coming back, just like I imagine the demographic for the classic RuneScape server is considerably older than it was at launch.
---
Doesn't work on Classic
---
Not sub numbers you bellend, the players per server.
---
&gt;friends 
---
Haha...
---
An karanir thanagoooor
---
thanks
---
thank you
---
Quit trolling
---
Holy fuck, did this for fun and it gave me the class/race/gender combo that I was already decided on.
---
The Fates have spoken. Female/tauren/druid it is!
---
I think high burst damage counts as flashy
---
Nah your 120 will split in to two 60's at august 27th, so people who played retail don't have to level in classic.
---
There are dozens of us. Dozens!
---
I remember re-compiling WINE so many times just to try a new feature hoping it would push performance on my cheap desktop.
---
Madlands on a PvE server?
---
Close enough for game purposes at any rate
---
Haha. Neverr!!
---
It would still be a fresh game anyways
---
&gt; MoveAnything loots like its not updated for classic?
---
Will mara be open phase 1?
---
Already exists no?
---
tyvm this makes way more sense
---
Tauren /moo is OP.
---
So much wasted potential. It was doing fine on its own until cash shop was introduced
---
Yeah, but each patch is like a new expansion now. You can do older content, but you are not really supposed to. If you come back in a later patch, you do the content of that patch, which is what the gear is designed for as well, and where gear progression exist (normal-heroic-mythic, pretty much).
---
No way these questions are real.  I just don't believe it
---
You even said it in your post, today is a TEST.
---
Well good for you, but this isn't grinder so no to advertise.
---
Stoneform lets you get out of Blind, something Clense can't do. Human paladin has pretty much nothing going for them other than +wep skill if you're looking to live the PvE ret dream.
---
As for priest specs, the most popular pvp healer is more of a trispec like so: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGs0bZfVzbZAMMpcz
---
There's quite a bit of flexibility within this build, but it's fundamentally built around Imp Mana Burn from Disc, Holy Nova from Holy, and Silence from Shadow.
---
Sadly I will be rolling Alliance so I will not be able to name my Orc Female Shaman Cunderthunt.  I give you all permission to use this name if you wish.  Hopefully you will dodge filters and reports in my stead.
---
Lots of big damage bosses have parryhaste removed so it's not that bad.
---
See this is why I'm rolling Troll, you all have serious issues with blessings you need worked out!
---
jk, nice job on the math I had no idea that it was that 1 sided, lvling my paladin on LH seemed like might was never worth it, but i had a biased sample for a lot of reasons.
---
Are people with jobs really the target audience ?
---
They might just not be able to if the data from 2004-2005 wasn't recoverable.
---
Trolling in full force today.
---
People forget how unlucky vanilla can be with upgrades- stuffs handed out in retail these days ya never have to worry or sit on an item
---
That's not true, once zg and bwl gear comes out they become very strong. Then with aq40 and naxx they are top end dps.
---
No. Vanilla music kind of sucked. It was ambient, but nothing special.
---
The blessing situation is much better in 1.12 with Greater Blessings and 15 minute durations. It still somewhat frustraiting during the leveling process, but at least there's an end in sight.
---
Ok so i need to remove those lines right ? : [before](https://i.imgur.com/22SP9Oi.png)
---
[after](https://i.imgur.com/eTw67Ap.png)
---
if yes pretty long job but easy gonna take me few hours
---
Dwarf priest seems as popular as warriors/rogues in classic it seems LOL
---
People always say this about RP servers. I've played quite a bit on two RP servers and honestly. If I didn't already know it was an RP sever because the login screen told me, I wouldn't have been able to tell that it was an RP server from how people acted in there. It looked just like a PVE or PVP server.
---
I wish the threads i was mocking were trolls
---
If I were to set up the keybinds and macros on a different computer than the one I'll use on release, will these settings still save to my profile?
---
Or are these settings saved natively to the computer and I'll have to transfer files from old to new computer?
---
Lovely video, thanks for sharing. (Damn and now I sound like most of my mom's FB comments)
---
I'm honestly betting on them applying some balance changes long term, but that's probably more wishful thinking than reality. Realistically you should pick the class you want to play based on how they are today, not how they might be in the future.
---
The people who will take my raidspot.
---
r u ok?
---
I think you are missing the point
---
&gt; In that sense, it "matters", but that's obviously not what he's saying. 
---
I'm pretty sure that was what he was saying. 
---
I know that you only talk about gear being used at 60, that's why I replied with my comment to show you that's not the only way stuff can "matter".
---
Also the staff.
---
If you don't value immersion you probably didn't.
---
I mean you'll also get to have a character made so that when launch comes you don't have to spend that extra time and can get right into game which is invaluable for getting ahead of the first big wave.
---
I thought they said it would be ready for launch?
---
Good, it's nice having noobs around
---
k
---
You just made me feel old af...
---
No, bear tanks are fine.  You won't be able to mitigate damage like a warrior, so you probably won't be main tanking anything above Blackwing Lair, but bears are kings of threat (especially with an item called the manual crowd pummeller) and they're great at tanking adds.
---
Druid can tank most things apart from a couple of raid bosses, however for the most part you have a lot of options. Personally I think it is worth going with what you actually want to play and finding a group that fits.
---
As for PvP Vs PvE, player vs player might well be more like what you are familiar with from Albion line with everything outside the starter zones automatically flagging you as attackable by the other faction.
---
RP servers are very easy to get in, there is no test or anything. Just pick a sensible name, don't be a dick and you are good to go!
---
thank you &lt;3
---
If you want to MT, roll warrior. If you want to OT and heal situationally roll Druid.
---
Rolling on an RP server is as simple as selecting one and creating a character.
---
&lt;3
---
Don't worry about the meta,  just play
---
Will be playing tonight, then missing most of tomorrow to go visit the in-laws. Still, better than ruining the actual launch by getting to play too much.
---
thank you :D
---
Cool story
---
You can offtank as a bear
---
If you want to play a druid and tank 5 mans as a bear, that perfectly doable. Joining an RP server is as easy as making a character on one.
---
You can bear tank in Classic if you want, however it's maybe not the best choice for a first time player. Maybe make a different main character and then play with the druid on the side.
---
PVP servers basically mean after a certain point, if you run into an enemy faction player out in the wild, you can attack each other, no matter your level. On PVE servers you have to "flag" yourself so you can only fight other flagged players.
---
You don't need to "get into" an RP server, it's just the server type, you can just join and then find some people to RP with.
---
I mean you could probably make it to 60 as a shaman "tank" paying out the ass on AH upgrades every 2 levels or so and getting everything enchanted.  I think it really requires a mature server and leveling partners to make it work.
---
I think it's more of an issue of how Freezing trap works.  "Freezing" something isn't an effect on its own, so "under the hood" so to speak, it had to fall under one of the existing DR categories; most likely incapacitate or disorient, since both break on damage, just like freezing trap.  Because of this, it may not have been INTENDED to DR with scatter shot, but it DID.
---
Later both abilities effects were separated into more distinct categories that did not DR with each other, but that wasn't in vanilla.
---
No one I know even knows what WoW Classic is..
---
I cant believe people type these and hit post
---
It’s not so much that Druid is bad, but just that warrior is better. Warrior has 2 optimal PVE builds but only 1 optimal PVP build. Druid has one optimal PVE role (healing).
---
Ultimately everyone will tell you play what you want to and will enjoy. I’d rather have a feral Druid tank that knows what he’s doing and is fun to be around than an angry elf prot warrior that isn’t good at their job. So live your best WoW life.
---
Famous moments from vanilla... Leeroy Jenkins PVE, Serenity Now PvP, etc.
---
The folders will be created when you first launch the game
---
Of course they are
---
It's Classic
---
You don't have to lvl up in 2 weeks.
---
You can take your time.
---
People with job have enough money to buy a pre paid/credit card and simply play this game for fun... :)
---
'high mobility high control' definitely not warrior.
---
Hunter fits for sure though!
---
This post should be stickied. It exemplifies all of the posts we've been seeing today. 
---
10/10.
---
I'm just going to continue playing on a private server a bit tonight, not going to pay for a sub until the actual game is available.
---
love it! &lt;3
---
Thanks! Answered so many of my questions that I couldn't find ANYWHERE ELSE!
---
No, we don't have to.
---
Yes it'll be saved, because we'll be doing this particular stress test using the release client.
---
Awesome bits of info!  Didn’t think about skinning to start. Unfortunately I won’t be there when servers go live.
---
Slower. Not harder.
---
Shadow priests melt faces in pvp.
---
That's always a hazard yeah. On Nost my friends had to wait for me to catch up because my gf didn't want me to play. 
---
Fixed that for Classic so it's all fine!
---
I remember how much hate the attack speed normalization patches got.  So many people were pissed that they had to get new weapons cuz their current ones weren't the best any more.
---
This reminds me... Looking forward to explore 100 of all maps in Azeroth again!
---
"Retail vet" lel there's the problem, if you've been playing this game for years like many of us then you wouldn't be having such a hard time instead you chose to play garbage expansions with watered down solo gameplay.
---
Those characters will be created in an invisible realm though.
---
SOON(tm)
---
I have had reports of some links pointing to the BfA version (thanks, Will It Classic). If you find any more of these, please report them to me!
---
Also if there are any I missed I am taking feedback for updates :)
---
Yes it's true, you also get to keep all of your spells that weren't in classic
---
Survival Hunter is a ranged dps spec for super late tiers where the agility talent becomes super valuable.
---
But yeah, melee Hunter is just for fun/memes.
---
Blizzard TAKE MY MONEY!
---
Bear has been gaining some attention and with enough effort you can pull it off. 
---
The difference between PVP and PVE servers is that player vs player combat is active in contested zones(all the leveling zones from 15-60). PVP is only horde versus alliance, so you can choose to kill the opposite faction, you can choose to respect the opposite faction, sometimes there's group fights etc. Lots of fun moments, and sometimes there's bad ones where you can't get stuff done. PvE servers are different because you have to activate pvp in order to be attack-able, so typically opposite factions ignore each other. Now just because a server is PVP does not mean that people only PVP, all the PVE activities are just as active as on a PVE server.
---
RP is roleplay servers, it's available for anyone that likes to participate in roleplay.
---
my thought exactly xD
---
I think that's pretty much correct.  Cast speed also did weird things like increase casting speed, but not reduce channeling speed (that tech wasn't in the game yet).
---
You have to buy all the expansions, then open up bfa and there will be a server called classic
---
I agree. However, the Wow servers really showed that it's doable to have kind of a free-market approach and have individuals just set up servers. 
---
What if Blizzard themselves once WoW is less profitable creates a toolkit that allows people to modify the game, add content etc, then took a portion of the profits from the pservers, kind of franchising out the product. 
---
Obviously, that is more ambitious and an unproven way if doing business, but again pservers show that independent groups are capable of hosting large servers.
---
I love what this is becoming. Its like, every week nearing launch there's funnier and funnier posts.
---
thenk you &lt;3
---
Cow that needs more Calcium.  
---
LOL
---
smh you didnt put a lot of effort into this, if you want to hate on streamers rolling on pvp servers you have to make a backstory that your character remebers the streamer character from his previous life and has unending furry to try and end his life for revenge!
---
I thought it was mostly unemploymed people on LinkedIn. That's the only time I use it atleast.
---
Sorry for the question guys but could anyone explain to me how breathing works?? Sorry again for the question I just think I’m running out of air so it’s really urgent and I couldn’t find any answers anywhere sorry if it’s a noob question that gets asked a lot sorry
---
everyone please upvote
---
Its not harder, its just slower. People need to know the difference.
---
&gt; By the beard of fucking Thex 
---
Now this is proper use of the meme.
---
All my old guildies names so I can pretend we are still playing together.
---
We've been looking into making alternative routes so to speak for dungeons, however, we are of the mind that this is a social game and it should be very easy to find a group for the dungeons we have chosen to include. Additionally, dungeons are an integral way of keeping your character's power high while leveling. They offer the highest density of xp per hour if you have all the quests as well as the best possibly loot options for your level.
---
&gt; You will keep your character from the stress test at launch of Classic 
---
Almost had me going until this...
---
&gt; (or probably just one faction next expansion if they really do get rid of the horde/alliance) 
---
Dafuq u say?
---
This is why the “good beers” from the motherland are often served at cellar temp. Or the thousands of other beers that aren’t Bud Light-ish. Everything has its place. Bud light type beers are drinkable but meant to get you drunk on a budget. Going out to sit and chill with friends? Get something nicer.
---
Feral is actually really good and one of the better DPS in build 1.12 when played and geared properly.  One kitty or bear can provide LotP and isn't at all hurtful to a raid to bring along.
---
You get to keep these characters, also you get to use your characters from bfa even if they're level 120.
---
Sylvanas EU was (and still is, I think) decidedly an alliance server. Might not have been as early as vanilla though.
---
Breweries on top of breweries now.
---
HYPE!
---
Don't play dumb with us.
---
Never go full rtard op
---
As a druid doing world pvp, I would recommend the 1/29/21 build (basically skipping leader of the pack for nature's swiftness)  
---
It is probably the hardest class in the game to kill in world pvp (besides bubble+hearth obviously), but the killing potential lacks a lot to be desired.  
---
Your best bet to kill someone is initiate from stealth with ravage, shred/rake, rip, go human, insect swarm, moonfire, go bear, feral charge, bash, go cat and try to finish them with shreds.  
---
The tricky part about world pvp'ing as a druid is mana management, and not eating a stun/fear while out of bear form.  
---
You also really want gear that has all the main stats on it or you will go out of mana super quickly and thus die. There's not a lot of that stuff in the game (the PvP set is really good, and relatively obtainable if you do a lot of BGs).  
---
The huge upside is when you get good, you just won't die to solo ganks anymore, but don't expect to kill much either.
---
If you've practiced character creation theres now way it would take more than a minute. 
---
Also, you could subscribe a day before launch if you really want your character ready.
---
I did this last time. Run around, have some fun. Then before logging I traded all my stuff to another dude. They were stoked and I had my fix.
---
Well classic isnt out yet, so you got time to wait :P
---
Hmmm possible, if you use Windfury the weapon reliance could perhaps be more then hunter and would be a 6 instead of 5, with flametongue I don't see the importance of the weapon as this high, also depends on what kind of abilities and how often you use them while balancing downtime/killtime.
---
See there's yer problem:  Druid's trying to melee with a warrior instead of kite.  No wonder he lost.
---
There’s also several packs and patrols in aggro range of that gate. Even if it was pickable, you couldn’t get the cast off in time.
---
Would one be able to make something like this?  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/VAVpYB7](https://imgur.com/a/VAVpYB7)
---
It's okay, you can get carried for quests like WW axe because when you hit 30 everyone lese will be 40
---
I won’t be playing at launch but even if I were saving 5 minutes isn’t invaluable to me unless by invaluable you mean close to worthless.
---
That would be awesome if you can remove them from the full resolution images. If you're motivated I've heard of some good Photoshop/GIMP plugins that will reduce the screening moire effect.
---
Well have to see what they have adjusted regarding the layering system on launch day. It could potentially be problematic but I'm confident that blizzard will do right on such a controversial topic where there is no way they can make even 2/3 of the community happy. Certainly the biggest question mark in my mind regarding the entire game and thus far I think they've made the right decisions.
---
Only until BWL is actually open. Once you clear past Firemaw you can just go make all your flasks for the rest of the week.
---
pvp was good in vanilla. anything after that it turned into a circle jerk of "arena brah club"
---
we know
---
Yea cuz they get fear ward which is OP af.
---
How times is it happening?
---
Mmo's are expensive and 60% of mmo's that get announced never actually release and when they do they are filled to the brim with nickle and dime strategies ranging from bag space to upgrade items requiring gems that cost real money. 
---
The basic structure of mmo's have changed from P2P to F2P and unless its an established universe with a huge fanbase having a P2P option ends up killing most games and even then if they aren't done correctly they end up being dumped by their players either way.
---
We won't get another wow and the closest we have is ffxiv and Im more comfortable with 2 - 5 popular mmo's than 20-30 semi popular ones because games like wow need a big population to keep the cogs turning for the Economy and raiding and pvp. 
---
unless the structure for how MMO's are changed back from F2P with a pay to win shop we will never ever get a game such as wow or ffxiv ever again.
---
When they start casting, run away. You can out-range it and the debuff doesn't apply.
---
As much as I'm sure it will scratch my classic itch, it will probably just make make me yearn for the actual classic launch even more.  Also I don't feel like spending hours leveling n stuff just for it to go away.
---
I have waited years, whats another two weeks.
---
I think you'll find moonfire and insect swarm from max range to be more effective.
---
Just sell it as you need gold. You can always go grind more for me later. Thanks.
---
If you to just get drunk, just pour some win in your ass.
---
Come join my guild we don't care about your spec! send me a message if you want to know more.
---
I.e. - Nothing you do at max level matters.
---
I understand what you're saying, and if you like it, you like it. But, to me, it's just instant gratification followed by instant gratification. There's no motivation and nothing to strive for.
---
What I love about this trailer and the TBC one compared to the later ones is that it's not showing off faction leaders, or important lore villains. It's showing a random Night Elf druid running through the groves of Teldrassil, a undead warlock summoning a fierce demon, and a dwarf hunter wandering through the mountains of his homeland alongside his ursine companion.
---
It's showing players. It's showing -us-.
---
There are some pserver tactics to get around this, no idea how much of it works on classic though lol
---
Thinking about rolling a mage. Will aoe grinding still be viable or has anything been announced to combat this?
---
 Mr. u/pastagains, what you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic  things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent  response were you even close to anything that could be considered a  rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having  listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your  soul.
---
Could it lead to TBC, Wrath, etc? Very likely.
---
To new expansions not connected to retail? Unlikely.
---
The problem is, in EVERY response I've acknowledged that leveling to 60 matters. That the journey and experience are important. I've said that over and over and over and over.
---
The OP's EXACT words were: "My main gripe - Nothing you do pre-max level matters. There is no gear you get while leveling and want to hold on to. No reason to worry about gold."
---
He's *clearly* talking about gear and money. Materialistic things. Not the experience, not the journey. I can't keep having this conversation over and over again.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
You get to choose how your paladin would respond. I could see an argument that when you see a lowbie in the world, it's your duty to slay them. Failing to carry out your duty could result in that PC gaining strength, and then when stronger, killing members of your own faction. In order to protect your faction, you MUST gank lowbies. 
---
Similarly rogues have a lot of different motivations for why they do what they do. I don't think anyone is suggesting that you should extend RP into ninjaing items. But you certainly could have an RP event where you were playing the thief, for example. I'd think that could be fun in the right setting.
---
If I'm guessing correctly, it's the treasure chest under the falls on the other side of "hidden path" in the orc starting zone. It leads to Ratchet, and on the way there you have the chance for a chest spawn. It's an easy way to get the fp for Ratchet and head to crossroads then Mulgore for the first set of flight paths.
---
His name is Kyle dude he’s probably special needs just chill
---
Ill start working on it and ill update you tomorrow
---
Just to forewarn you, if your rolling priest and planning on being 100% shadow, you’re going to have a bad time.   
---
Not because shadow isn’t fun (it is) but because your going to struggle in a lot of situations where holy/disc is much better.  If your interested in priest, you will be a much better shadow priest if you understand the nuance of the other talent trees.   Priest is strong because it has offensive and defensive flexibility.  You have to really internalize that.  It’s really only very rarely a fun time face melt party.  
---
Shadow is not as strong in pvp (against a halfway competent opponent) as the forums have convinced themselves either.  Remember you have no escape mechanics and you will run OOM very fast.  Expect to have to carry mana potions to really compete.  If your already full on mana you can 1v1 burn down some classes, but you will lose hard in most 2v1 situations as you have bad sustain and basically zero escape mechanisms.  
---
That being said, i love priest, it’s an amazingly fun and complex class.  Just be sure you want to play a support role because that’s really where you shine the most (even when playing shadow).
---
&gt;So far, i think i'll level up with 2 gathering professions - Herb and Gathering
---
You mean herbing and skinning?
---
And hunter and priest don't have gap openers against warrior + paladin. BoF for warrior to negate wing clip and traps, cleanse for viper sting and cleanse and zerker rage for the psychic scream.  
---
If the warrior connects once (charge or intercept), the hunter will not get the warrior off between HoJ stun, hamstring, BoF, intercept stun.
---
Also the hunter may be able to run away when 30+yards away, but if he actually engages, he won't have the health and especially mana to outlast both classes together.
---
A warrior being healed with a paladin not wasting his mana on offensive spells is a very hard to crack nut.
---
"good RvM duels"
---
1st Duel-
---
\&gt;Mage doesn't blink the ambush
---
\&gt;Gets Gouged when he uses nothing in the first Global
---
\&gt;Refreshes Ice Barrier instead of Novaing or trying to break 
---
distance on the rogue
---
\&gt;Doesn't use any trinkets at all it looks like
---
\&gt;Isn't running mana shield and loses with 60% mana, having not used a mana gem
---
2nd Duel
---
\&gt;Doesn't Blink The Ambush
---
\&gt;The Rogue uses a TIDAL CHARM ON GOUGE??????
---
\&gt;Doesn't refresh defensives before he nades
---
\&gt;CS's the rogue because ????? ALSO indicating that he's improved CS instead of Ignite barrier when they're in naxx gear (gear that favors the rogue here, the mage has 3.8k hp FFS, you can have way more in phase fucking 2 and the rogue has T3 FFS.
---
\&gt;Tries to Sheep the Rogue when he's been dueling him and should know insignia is up
---
\&gt;FOLLOWS UP THE SHEEP WITH A BLIZZARD???? When he hasn't used cone or nova
---
\&gt;Dies without using block
---
It is difficult to do much as a mage- like I just wrote
---
&gt;a dagger rogue will threaten your HP to the point where you have to use CDs early if you don't play near perfect which will flip the matchup outside of your favor.
---
But citing duels where the mage is asleep at the wheel, not noaving, not running the best spec in what IS a hard 1v1 for the mage, being outgeared, and not even using his FIRST iceblock, nevermind the second is just a terrible reference for understanding the matchup, esp in Naxx gear.
---
On the one hand I like the way ESO handles combat.  "This tool comes with these abilities..."  It allows for off the wall builds that still "work".  That said I agree, after the shiny wears off, and you're accustomed to the weird builds, and things people can do (Nightblade Heals for instance).  It kind of falls flat, and I think in large part it floats back to the "invested feeling" we're takling about.  I could careless if I'm playing my DK Tank, or NB caster DPS.
---
Same! All of my wow experiences before were horde and I’m switching to alliance to play Paladin and and get a new experience
---
Upvoting for visibility.
---
I'm baffled there aren't more of these threads and no sticky for different european languages for helping them concentrate on a single server since character creation is just 5 days away.
---
You're not allowed to play. Daddy Blizz decided.

Rumor has it the alliance scum dwight, cruniac, brevi, sunapple and casseya might show up
---
&gt;I.e. - Nothing you do at max level matters.
---
My two goals in the game is to kill raid bosses and clear as high m+ dungeons as possible. That's what matter to me. The path to reaching those goals is staked out by how Blizzard design the game, and often involves progressing my character. But character progress is not a goal in itself, it's a means to an end. I'm pretty sure that's where we are different. Because as a means to an end there is even more progress than there used to be (you need to gear up for *every* raid tier now). But there might feel like there is *less* progress if that is your only goal, because it gets resets all the time, so your goal is always pushed back. 
---
When I kill the last boss of a raid tier (which to be fair, I still haven't done), it doesn't matter if my gear is reset, I have still reached my goal.
---
Ok yeah, that sorta what I was thinking. Because thinking about it and doesn't really matter if I level up engineering during the leveling process so I'd be better of doing 2x gather.
---
You think mining/herb are gonna be relatively equal? Or would I be better off herb &gt; sell them &gt; buy mining mats?

You could try time travel into the future.

The game will be released on August 27th.
---
The up coming stress test will begin later today an only accessible to players with active Subscriptions to WoW.
---
Hybrids don't really play as hybrids in 40 man raids, sometimes a little in 20 man raids. With 40 people, there's just no room for hybrids when there's so many specialists around. Then with how gearing works, you can't really gear for cat and healer at the same time, either your dps will be a joke or your heals will be. Vanilla neither has the good hybrid itemization or talents like Nurturing Instinct to push the hybrid nature. You'll either be full time healer, or Feral OT who goes cat form after their mob is down.
---
Blir dette samme server som Skandinavia-serveren jeg så nevnt her i en tråd for kanskje en liten uke siden? Håper det!
---
Woooowwwww this just takes me back! It has a very Barrens/Stonetalon vibe. Thank for sharing!
---
I laughed. Won't even lie.
---
Ferals have advantages warriors don’t especially when you first start raiding and your warrior is in prebis.
---
Real answer: it starts in 2hr &amp; 20m
---
Troll answer: you need to have a level 110 BFA character to unlock it. You can buy one by visiting WoW’s website.
---
I did at first, but by the time I'm leveling my 8th character I just played my own music.
---
The license is free for up to 30 users, so no. But sure, there's a server cost - a sufficient VPS is generally ~3e a month. If you share that with your circle of friends, I don't see that as a bad deal at all.
---
I'd recommend leveling skinning/mining.    Collecting ore is about as time consuming as collecting herbs and you can bank it on alts or sell it and level up engineering when you hit 60.   
---
It's a smart decision not level engineering while leveling due to the costs involved, but you will miss out on some of the engineering leveling fun like target dummies and exploding sheep.  Not quite as useful on a hunter as it is with a warrior, but still fun.

If not that would be quite dumb
---
Herb Mining has the Problem that you’re only allowed to track one of both
---
Engineering is like 150-200g in mats it's nothing compared to the pain and misery that is leveling mining. Go skinning + herb until you want engineering.
---
on what kind of paper it was originally printed matte or glossy?
---
Oh god, duh!
---
believe it or not we really like vanilla and want to play it.
---
I rarely ever wear a tie, but this sounds like a great idea. For the super subtle among us, I see some faction tie clips for sale online.
---
Does that mean you just run classic on the battle.net launcher to access it?
---
Maybe, quite likely!
---
This is what I want. Blizzard would never split their playerbase even further having two different games but damn it a man can dream!
---
*Laughs in Druid*
---
Thanks bro. Now I have a goal.
---
WoW subs maintained huge numbers through Wrath, so I’d hardly say you can call that a destroyed the game. I’ve played some every expansion and the game has always provided an opportunity to have fun. WoW was never going to grow and provide new content without making some people unhappy, but it’s never been ruined. 
---
It makes very little sense as a business to devote two teams to two separate expansion timelines when you can re-release TBC and Wrath at minimum, make a lot of people happy and make a lot of money, and put more people towards quality expansions for retail that provide bigger opportunities to make even more money.
---
Is grass green and close to the ground?
---
My argument is to keep classic as close to vanilla as possible, which includes no retextures for druid animal forms
---
looks awesome, you gonna try remove lines from both sides (with flight points and without) ?

I’m looking for someone who has extensive healing experience with Holy Pal, Priest and Druid.Heads up, medium/longer question with background.
---
So here’s what’s up. I’ve been healing on all classes on retail stretching back to late vanilla/early BC. I’ve always been a healer, it’s just what i I do.
---
I’ve also regularly done raid leading dating back about 12 years. I just find it much easier for me to do call outs, position and move groups when I’m healing versus tanking or dpsing. It just comes naturally. 
---
Lately on retail, I’ve gone full tunnel vision on my hPally and haven’t done much raid leading since a raid tier ago. Mind you, part of that is my disinterest in retail. 
---
I’ve been thinking about what I want to accomplish in Classic. Specifically, I want to raid lead, maybe even run my own guild. I also want to heal. Classic presents an interesting challenge of having 40 people to lead, versus my usual 15-25 man raids on retail. On retail, I have the benefit of knowing my class (hPally) like the back of my hand, so I can direct traffic while popping off heals.
---
Which of the 3 classes do you think would be easiest for me to quickly pick up and master and enter “automatic healer mode,” so that I can focus on raid leading? Holy Paladin? Priest? Resto Druid?
---
Bears can’t block or parry but make up for it with a higher HP Pool and armor right?
---
How much more HP and armor do you need than warriors for that to be effective? I heard they can’t push crits off the table.
---
fuck yea Team Speak ! u know if there is still servers running?

---
Same here. Just saw the wow classic "Fedex and Four" googlesheet guide. One section has you level to 6 just by exploring. May be the best for the first few hours of the server start.
---
So in short, you’re a streamer streaming, lol. People use twitch for a variety of reasons, some just like you described.
---
You want to play with frustrated raging noobs or informed experienced gentlemen?
---
https://youtu.be/mHXDKJcUGdo
---
I really like retail. Play it all the time and am not planning on stopping any time soon. 
---
But levelling is shit, and I really wish Blizzard could change it.
---
That 3% figure comes from a poll where the options were PvP, PvE, and RP. Players who want RP-PvP mostly want PvP first and RP second. That’s why interest in RP-PvP is much higher than the poll can represent. Only players who want to RP in a PvE setting would vote RP. The rest voted PvP, meaning that a chunk of interest in PvP servers can be partitioned off as interest in RP-PvP. 
---
My guess is about 10% of people who said they would be rolling on PvP servers will choose RP-PvP.
---
I don't think you can fit that many letters into a name.
---
&gt; VP is only horde versus alliance
---
The Arena in STV is free-for all though, you can kill your buddies!
---
Well, the way I see it honestly, questie is just enough to show you all the quests and where to do them. Therefore i dont understand, what do people needs guides for. Like literally, you have everything you need on map with questie. Guide provides you with the most optimal way and tips along the way. Some people argue, they need it for speed leveling. But I dont see a person, who constantly reads each steps to be any close to other speed levelers... i dont know
---
My expedience with vanilla wow is casual guilds take anyone who meets matches their culture.  There's always some high level recruitment of raiders into their guilds since casual guilds can't raid without around 20 people who are really into raiding, but for the average player it's just if their personality fits or not.
---
I don't remember the max number of players in a realm, thanks to layering, but it was really high... In any case, I'm glad such a realm will exist!
---
Live wow world first raiding is done by professionals. It is literally their job. Azshara was just killed this tier by people who raided 18 hour days 11 days straight, after preparing for the raid tier for 5 months. You can't compare a mid expansion tier release with today's level of competition to vanilla ragnaros for which everyone had to experience the entirety of Azeroth prior to even attempting.
---
Awesome, just take your time and enjoy making music

yeah all these skilled players running around in poorly chosen level 49 blues while these noobs all somehow have high end bis raiding gear.

Wasn't patch 1.12 for D2 LOD also like a 7 year gap?
---
Whenz the weddin?
---
Do i have to try it later with Beta Client or WoW Classic Client?
---
I won’t be on until 4 PM EST today. I’m really hoping it just gives an accurate depiction of layering and what will happen on release day. 
---
The last one had some complications, so I hope with more participants it will have been corrected. 
---
I don’t expect it to be perfect, but I’d rather just see how everything performs.
---
Not a problem just make a macro to swap which your trackung and smash it while you run around. Or just sit next to the three rich thorium and single lotus spawn in Burning Steppes  all day.
---
Most of the guilds built on people being good people grow naturally in game. You group with a player you have fun, they invite you to the guild they are in, you continue having fun. It is much harder to get a feeling for 'nice person' on a forum or application, better to leave it with them.

Peoples expectationa nowadays are a little skewed for a long-running mmo that requires a personal investment. 
---
People want to kill Nefarian, full epic, gain rank14 and win the AH. All in 2 hours played... on their iphone!
---
Many of the potions are as powerful in PvP if not more then a lot of engineering utility. The only reason everyone goes eng over alchemy is because non-alchemist can use the potions.
---
It doesn’t have to be equivalent to have merit as a comedic exaggeration, nerd

I don’t think I fit within the “Streamer” category. As in the streamers people are trying to avoid. I’m just a player.

I recall a video of most infamous players in wow or something on YouTube, no time to search for it atm. But somebody got a ban for having peon in there name as it's derogatory. Despite there being mobs called lazy peons in game.
---
the quests give gold though
---
Yeah I mainly just want to be there. I don't plan on actually leveling, but I might just do elwynn to test the waters. I won't really be spoiling anything since I'm going night elf.
---
This has nothing to do with brexit. If immigrants want to be (productive) members of society in the country they arrive they will have to communicate with that society. If they can't they will never have the same social rights and thus will keep people united into not granting them the same civil rights.
---
You're proud of something incredibly stupid though. I hope you get swarmed by people with a hard to know language who don't care about you or your society. We'll see how quickly you come around.

This is really good. I love the shadows. All the feels.

*There’s travel on your future when you hit level 30 and you get your travel form!*
---
where can i get the latest addons?
---
Hey guys! 
---
If you havent already.. please consider joining this NORDIC guild movement to pick the same server(PvP) aswell:
---
http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/
---
Currently 23 guilds and growing.
---
This is how I've always done it, just seemed  common sense.. it's how mages kite away from a frost nova too.
---
Don't listen to the nonsense about intellect. Here's the actual issues:
---
Pet doesn't scale. A naked level 60's pet and a full T3 hunter's pet will deal the same damage, minus the 50 AP the pet gets from T3's set bonus.
---
Ammo doesn't scale. You'll be using the same ammo in MC and in Naxx.
---
You get strong weapons and gear in MC/BWL, but very little upgrades after that. You'll be getting practically nothing new in AQ and you'll be using the same gear post-BWL until Naxx. Your weapon progression is pre-bis--&gt;Rhok'Delar--&gt;Ashjre'Thul--&gt;Nerubian Slavemaker. You get no weapon upgrade between BWL and killing the last boss in the last raid, Kel'Thuzad.
---
Hunter falls off compared to other classes. They get massive upgrades while hunters get barely nothing.
---
good question
---
Spara den hemsidan ifall du är nyfiken på vilken server skandinavia servern blir senare i veckan!
---
&gt; I love how it seems to be a mostly "older" crowd
---
Average age of WoW subscribers in 2006: 29. Those same people should average age 42 right about now.
---
Anyone that committed that has a job where you wear a tie is probably taking some PTO
---
Seems idealistic and as other people said lacks a competent rogue's point of view in the video and you should have collabed with one of the top rogues from pservers or something for input. You make it sound like mages have a clear advantage and that just isn't true as the rogue has 2 to 3 openers at his disposal - your low HP pool is at risk and it takes a lot more skill as a mage to beat a less skilled pvp oriented rogue.
---
The level squish wouldnt fix the problem. Its inherent in the story. WoD we were the commander of horde/alliance forces there.
---
In legion we were the top mage/pally/DK in the world. 
---
You cant go back to being an average adventurer after that. 
---
Imagine jaina or thrall having to do basic quests of 'gather 5 keya from that ogre mound' . It doesnt make sense, they should be in management positions, not basic labor.
---

---
I'm 25 and I'm starting to feel like I should be spending more time on my music career than this game.
---
I was so sure that was vanilla.  I remember shooting rainbows during raids and I didn't raid in cataclysm.
---
O rite! 
---
(On a serious note, rushing straight to fish for groupers in Darkshore isn't a bad idea, 'cause you can probably sell them to people who want to skip the time intensive part of the quest, so not only are you leveling your skill, you're making a little extra money besides! If I didn't wanna get ahead of the pack a little bit, that's how I'd enjoy the launch!)
---
Such a weird time to do a stress test. People will be slowly trickling in after they get off work. Hmm no. It's not a weird way to do it. It's a bad way to do it.
---
I'm almost positive that's not true anymore, and nameplates are interactable for friendly and attackable mobs.
---
I'm interested to see how you'll break the imposed level 15 cap.
---
What language are they singing in? Is that Latin? Or is it some Azerothian, made up thing?
---
Awwwwh man this is good. I hope you have more in the work ;)
---
As long as people attribute the work to me, I'm happy to let anyone use them! Heck, I'd even give them a download link if they asked!
---
are you daft?
---
Potions are just as prevalent in pvp as engineering. Bad info here.
---
They have stated they will you queues if layering is not sufficient.
---
Cancelled.
---
No gnomes.
---
It's assuming too many of us went on to live somewhat successful lives.
---
Bus adverts guys, god damnit seriously. So many of us are still bus wankers. 
---
Also is this an advert or is it targeted advertising to those already looking at wow classic subreddit/forums and being told there's a news article up about it? hm.
---
Herp-a-derp, it’s hard for you to understand isn’t it
---
I never played Classic and I want to play because my SO did, it was a huge part of his life and I just wanna experience that to feel closer to him.
---
So I expected to find, like, no one to play with since he's move on since Cataclysm, but work colleagues are actually starting a guild for casual play. We spend a lot of time on LinkedIn because we're an ad agency. I can tell you that a lot of people between 30 and 40 and are on LinkedIn know about WoW and maybe played Wow. So yeah that content is a bit geared towards under the hood stuff and team prep as well as maybe some juicy tech tidbits for them engineers like my SO who is one, but judging by the state of Slack as we inch closer to release everyday, I can definitely say this piece of social media content is absolutely pure genius.
---
Then boss finds out your the opposing faction.
---
Then...then war begins.
---
can somebody suggest a good damage meter?
---
Epic stress test today plus name reservation next week!
---
What a beautiful piece of art.
---
That thing they use to automatically translate to the users pc time is a godsend. More websites should have that as standard.
---
And then crashed harder then Paul Walker did when Pandaland was released
---
Not saying I'll hate it but I don't really want to go down the same route that's lead us to the point we are at now. 
---
It's taken more then 2 years for Classic to be in the works and for what. To end up back on titanforging and LFR..
---
except you will be stronger in combat by ignoring professions entirely and focusing on leveling
---
Are we so starved for content that we post ads?
---
Advertising have never been this easy.
---
Most pserver players probably won't pay the monthly fee, so that's a thing.
---
Common sense, but thought I’d share this Blue post anyhow. No indication of when the Stress Tets will end yet.
---
Also hopefully (some) people stop asking when Stress Test starts with the Title...
---
Players will flock to your cause to deny stitches his bitches
---
Thank you for this. Super helpful.
---
Are you? How do you not get what he's saying. 
---
He's not a celebrity streamer with a video overlay or anything. Just a guy quietly playing his game. There is a difference, despite your failed argument.
---
Gotta redo the census now
---
Thanks so much! I'm really trying to make them with the feedback I've received in mind. I really appreciate you listening to it!
---
I dunno, my discord server is entirely free and I've got my guild / RL friends of about 50~ in there. I just like the hassle free, clean and easy to use interface over Teamspeaks very 90s, not free interface.
---
Not really. There will be enough players running around to keep their numbers in check for the first 3 months
---
Hes saying hes not a streamer, when  he streams, seems like youre both retarded
---
In Canada it doesn't release until Sept 9th.  Maple syrup sanctions effect it
---
The true gold is that people like it!
---
Please tell me the hardest class to level then.

---
The vast majority who still plays games knows about Classic because of Reddit and word of mouth.  People who quit for work, don't browse Reddit, don't talk to gamers, don't go to fan sites, have no idea.  But they do browse LinkedIn, and now they know about Classic.
---
&gt; will there be actual guilds that recruit people simply based on if they are chill and fun to be around?
---
Absolutely, but they're not the ones who are recruiting in preparation for launch.
---
It's kinda like driving an old car with gauges. Old cars didn't have good gauges for water temp, oil pressure, etc, so many people installed aftermarket ones that were more precise, or changed the way they look.
---
Pointless reference, but ok.
---
I’m not even saying it’s what I want them to do, just saying as a business decision it doesn’t make a ton of sense to go a new expansion new timeline route. They’d be better off just making WoW 2.0 or something like that, or like I suggested taking the free money from the two other most popular expansions they can re-release and continue to do more with retail.
---
Now stating my personal hope, I would love TBC at minimum. After that I don’t care much
---
It's fine tbh.  Lots of people are still going to log in simultaneously when they get home.
---
6pm EST on the 26th
---
I'm re writing the melodies by hand in a tracker. If i'm lucky, I'll find an arrangement or some sheet music somewhere, but I have to do some parts by ear. And sometimes, I have to do a lot/it all by ear.

Johnnyotron, as in john tron? that's a real person and literally what they said not to do. A gnome name would be Penny Sprinklesprocket, or Gannodo Fizzlebang. Ash3000 could be a mech name that a gnome built, but never a gnome name.
---
Exactly
---
Oh you have austism

I'd love to hang this in my house... Do you sell this or have a high resolution available?
---
Most Europeans learn English as a second language, followed by something like German or French. Spanish just isn’t a thing to learn unless you’re intentionally going for something more obscure (from a Northern Europe perspective) or just have interest in it.
---
You can still get into the client to set up your video settings by running the exe in the directory
---
i LOVE this... any chance of a high res image or a print to buy?
---
I really appreciate it!
---
So does NA have one already or does only EU get one?
---
Yes, you can download classic right now from the launcher by switching wow's game version to classic. The drop down menu to do this is right above the play button you would typically use to launch current wow. Should be playable in about 2 hours.
---
Oh lmao did not even think about that
---
Depends on the song. Some is latin (most "human" songs). NE / BE I think are in their own languages. Orcs just grunt a lot for their music. Guess that's their language though. Goddamned green skin savages.
---
Make your Bear Tank on Hordeside and you'll be cherished - there is always a bit of a tank shortage due to no Paladin. And Druids in general are rather scarce, but they're a jack-of-all trades. They're versatile like no other class, and  have some of the richest lore as well.
---
RP Servers are interesting, I rolled on one just to play with friends with basically no understanding of it and I was happily surprised with how much more immersive it could be with various little events happening and people getting into their characters a bit more than the usual. Worth trying for sure.
---
Look, I get the sentiment.  You want to prove people wrong.  You want to show people it doesn't really matter if they play a meme spec they can bring value.  You want to challenge yourself and you think that if you put in the effort you can make it work.  Right?
---
But have you ever taken a good look at shadow preists on a mechanical level?  
---
Here is a quick rundown of their dps options:  a 1.5s cast Nuke on a cooldown with a high cost and double threat, a 3 second channeled damage over time skill, and a long duration DoT.
---
Now first thing to note, none of the spells have particularly astounding coefficients.  SWP @ 16.6% per tick, mind flay @ 45% (over 3 seconds), and Mind Blast at 42%.
---
compare that to mages with frostbolt at a 81% coefficient on a 2.5 second cast.  42% on a 3 second cast doesn't feel that good.
---
Now also consider another fact, while all other casters get 200% damage from their crits, priest so only gets 150%, but it's not that big of a deal because out of all your damage only mind blast can crit in the first place.
---
That's right.  Not only are your coefficients low, but your main sources of damage, mind flay and SWP can't don't benefit from crit at all.
---
This leads to serious scaling issues.  And while a shadow priest might be able to hang out with the warlocks in MC on the meters, they don't scale effectively at all.
---
Now, lets talk about mechanics more.  In classic we have 16 debuff slots.  Most of those are taken up by things that benefit many people.  However two of the shadow priests main damage tools are debuffs=SWP and Mind Flay.  
---
So to even do even remotely respectable damage, you need the guild to give you personally 2 of the 16 debuff slots.  What this also means is that your damage spells will potentially be pushed off by other players using their own DoTs.  This is much more of a problem in a more casual guild where debuff slots are more of a free for all.  I know SWP will be pushed off but I think mind flay will too, but I've read inconsistent claims that it won't.
---
And that doesn't take into account the fact that shadow priests are not particularly mana efficient.  While they aren't as bad as oomkin, their efficiency will particularly tank if your SWP ever gets pushed off making you recast it.  Yes, you can potentially manage with mana pots, runes, and dreamless sleep pots, but that will also be risky and potentially tank your dps.
---
In short, there's a reason why shadow is only ever brought for shadow weaving, and in those situations usually they are made to heal.  It's because their damage is really not good in a raid setting.
---
is it an actual linkedin advert or one of those google targeted ones?
---
Commenting so I can find this tonight. 
---
Thanks.
---
Ugh I dunno, maybe some people prefer customising their UI to taste?
---
That's just one reason why.
---
Your 120 isn't going anywhere.
---
Your pokemon red save file isn't going anywhere either.
---
Cause they're all different games.
---
same T.T
---
If I get 2% wouldn't that be enough? Maybe cap it with some random item?
---
When they get home? So slowly as they trickle in from work? That's not exactly a stress test now is it? 
---
People are taking time off work for launch day. Having them slowly trickle in on a workday isn't exactly simulating anything. Why didnt they do this a bit later on Friday?
---
It's not a single image, but this is the most comprehensive guide I've seen for Druids: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-oXmau5zcI\_hRD\_Kt0XnwJV80gwUBLRwqNBaLoSKBQ/edit#gid=712996361](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-oXmau5zcI_hRD_Kt0XnwJV80gwUBLRwqNBaLoSKBQ/edit#gid=712996361)
---
Dalrends are hunter Bis, roll need
---
There is not one best build so there is going to be conflicting opinions on some talents.
---
I really hope they don't create new content for classic, and, at most, release TBC on new servers.
---
The current design philosophy blizzard has for WoW it goes pretty much against classic, I don't trust them at all to create new content. Everybody that was involved in vanilla no longer works in wow. TBC, a expansion I like more than vanilla, is (in my opinion) a lot worse in almost all aspects, you can see how the design shifter in that expansion (altough it was wotlk that put wow in the current trend).
---
A lot of people here just say "the community should vote in what is added and what isnt" and my reply is always the same: Cataclysm.
---
Early Cata, for me, was as good as TBC, but then the community wanted easier PvE, more "balanced" classes, etc, so early cata become the cataclysm everybody hates. Cataclysm is what happens when the community have a decision about the game.
---
Are you seriously accusing tbc and wrath of destroying wow?
---
Not that I know of. We might very well need one! &lt;3
---
Their website has all the info you need...
---
Touching storyzI was so young (10-11) i only vaguely remember a few names and stories of my vanilla experience.
---
Well for one, the vanilla interface was created for standard monitors, before the spread use of wide screen (or ultra wide) monitors. I never used add-ons in vanilla, but on my ultra wide monitor, it seems essential.
---
For me its less about looks, and more about my information being easily available closer to my screen focus point
---
Agreed, but it’s very similar to a shadow priest where one is great, any more than that ehh..
---
I was comparing with Retail experience.
---
In a pug I'd roll need 100% of the time.
---
In a guild run I would pass the mh to rogues/warriors who have the offhand before needing on the mainhand.
---
At least your notoriety was real and recognized by actual people instead of some smoke the game blew up your ass.
---
Cool thanks! And it’s expected to be up for a full day?  In a similar situation to OP at the moment with drinking activities getting in the way!
---
It's called Trial Account retail. Same shit. Also. Black Person... Really? Its called SKIN TONE. You either get it from genetics or burn your body in the sun.
---
Aren't some of those already realms?
---
IMO melee weapons should be melee priority and ranged weapons should be hunter priority
---
There are darker skin tones and different face templates to choose from. You can try going to wowhead.com and trying out the character creation menu there to see if you can come up with a combination that suits what you're looking for.
---
How many days are there in a month on average? 30 ish How many months are there in a year? 12 And what year are we on? 2019.
---
So Americana schwine, are you all using MM/DD/YY??? KIND OF AS FOOLISH AS USING THE FLIPPING IMPERIAL SYSTEM!!!!!!
---
No one is forcing you to use the addon and how you "enjoy the game" isn't the same as others.
---
Because the people working at Blizzard also have lives? It's easier for them to stress test during their normal working hours. 
---
There will be plenty of people trying to log in.
---
Hi all, let me just start of by saying me and my friends are HYPED AF to be experiencing classic again with all of the pros and cons (even cons are pros).
---
 I am playing warrior to be able to tank for my group of friends, I am planning on playing Nelf (i know humans are better but I have always wanted to have t3 on nelf as it looks too sick). 
---
now I have somewhat of a plan of what I wanna do but would appreciate advice on any regards. I plan on playing nelf male/female not sure, was thinking of going mining and enchanting just because I dont like the aspect of engineering or blacksmithing ^^. I was just wondering if you think nelf is a bad idea but IMO I just think play what YOU feel like will be fun. 
---
Appreciate any sort of advice regarding any of what you have read. Thank you for even being on this subreddit. My love for this community is growing more and more as we are all just wanting to feel like we felt when young (or want to feel what all of us experienced as players who never played vanilla. 
---
Much love
---
I would say casual would have 2 raiding days 3 or 4 hours each. 
---
Also they usually have a huge amount of players spanning many lvl ranges which is great for dungeons while leveling.
---
Wrath did destroy wow. 
---
Oversimplifying wotlk (it would take a huge wall text to explain everything)
---
Double specialization killed any chance of not having cookie cutter builds.
---
Nerf to the old world levelling + heirlooms made leveling not relevant, this affected the social interaction while leveling and loot progression.
---
Nerf to almost everything the old world had, the only things that survived was the net that drops in westfall and Scarab Brooch.
---
Raids were made a lot easier, this means that dungeons should be even easier. LFD was created thank to this. Dungeons become a step between a fresh max level and raids. Before this it was endgame for the average player.
---
Strand of the ancient and isle of conquest.
---
Huge talent trees with the most important skill (almost always) in the bottom, so you couldn't really choose two talent trees, as you had to put a lot of points in one to be competitive. This was blizz last try to kill that kind of theorycrafting before they just said "fuck it" and locked you in cata to one tree.
---
I know I'm missing a lot, but I think I made the point clear enough on how wotlk started destroying wow
---
are you aware of timezones? The entire world does not revolve around america
---
So you’re posting on a classic sub about why people would want to play classic over BFA. Someone is looking for a circle-jerk
---
Why? Dal's are much harder to get than HoJ. Plenty of warriors will be spamming lava runs for IFs and they'll happily take anyone who can't use it.
---
RUNE is phase 2. Came out patch 1.5
---
I wish it wasn't made, doesn't mean I wish people didn't use it ... I see why you need this add-on now
---
I don’t think most people participate in RP, but the amount of people that do will obviously be higher.
---
Honestly I'd say the same, a weapon you use to deal dmg should have higher prio than a stat stick, but not sure if it's just BiS that matters so I've asked to see what people think.
---
You say that yet it is well known that the wow head classic is wrong about patches. So no need to be a dick about it lmao
---
The small thumbnail looks like a picture of a bunch of galaxies
---
wow thanks for making a thread on this there was literally 0 info on this topic anywhere on the internet u are a godsend m8
---
I’m posting on a classic sub for those who started long after classic was a thing. For people who may not get why it could be perceived as better.
---
mean while the danish wow classic reddit only have 330 subs :( [/r/klassiskwow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/klassiskwow/)
---
This is concerning indeed, afraid layering is here to stay! Why do Blizzard hate its community so much?
---
Jesus I need this for Shaman, thats a godly guide.
---
Of course! I'm running a guild where we will have opportunities for people that want to raid, pvp, or just chill and be friends. No pressure to do anything or be a certain class / spec regardless of what you want to do. Send me a message if you want to know more :).
---
Kul Tiras is black I guess
---
If I wanted a loot game, I'd play path of exile
---
The first color complexion is pale enough to classify as Asian combined with dark hair. [Example.](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#sz0z0zJ89mz9MR9m87wMbC808Mbt808Mbv87k)
---
This is quite useful and I haven’t seen it posted before, so thanks.  Perfect time to test a few in the stress test.
---
I just don't have any desire to play this stress test really... I JUST WANT THE REAL THINGGGG ;_;
---
There are a lot of alternatives for weapons, whereas HoJ is BiS for most of vanilla.
---
Once a quest turns grey, it grants 20% less Reputation for each additional level, up to -80% (20%) of normal gain.
---
\^ This x100. If guildy has 1 dal rend already, let them complete it. They won't forget the gesture. 
---
Plus you can always remind them of that time you were super nice to them later on if you need leverage /evil laugh
---
So you do the exact same shit, but with a better backstory?
---
Wow isn’t a loot game?
---
We also had to beg for Classic and here we are. I grew that it’s weird that they thought it was going to be such a monumental flop that one extra server per region was too much. But I’m just glad it’s here. Things like this give me faith that there will never be a wow token in Classic.
---
I remember the 40 man priest Onyxia raid lol
---
22% of our population speaks a language other than English at home and 9% don't know English at all. We're doing just fine. The government is legally obligated to provide translators and attorneys for all of them.
---
Agreed it's basically that with a lesser healer in the rain and the better DPS it works out better once your ehlers know what's going on they would generally be fine as opposed to taking a full another healer who is not going ham anyway and having a lesser DPS
---
Nah you haven't hit full mom-mode until you're doing mixed-case RiPs and stacking five prayer emojis 🤣
---
Do I need an active sub to participate?

Don't worry, we understand

Agreed. Cata cannot happen again.

but when naxx comes, I'm just on the bench :(

This is crazy fucken good.  I’d buy a print.

I'm aware that shadow priest is a bad PvE class to play and I don't want to prove it otherwise. People always bring it up, but my post has nothing to do with the viability of shadow priests.
---
Well that is assuming they even exist - and if they don’t you could be the first to export and create them ;) The by-hand way is definitely a great (albeit lengthy) way to do it. I’m sure it would come out with a more personal flair if you do it entirely by hand/by ear
---
I like the BC and classic paladin as it's all about being selfless and sacrifice for others and it really respnates with the class.
---
They’re getting removed for being low effort like this one
---
&gt;Your vulgarity and insults does not strengthen your arguments. 
---
They are not meant to, it stands well enough on its own.
---
Anyway, the speedrunners are the spreadsheet kids, you dummy. Speedrunning is simply minmaxing leveling.
---
Seems that people have divided opinions on this topic so it seems best to just talk with the other members and tell if you plan to roll no something to avoid any conflicts.
---
unplayable
---
Loot is not the main appeal of classic.
---
Community is.
---
If you pick a specific skin complexion, hair color and face combination you can make an far-eastern looking human.
---
There's no mob in the game you can't pick pocket without MoD. Talents are about making you more powerful, not lazier.

Looks pretty Asian.
---
TBH Asians can be more pale than white people are, just less pink in their skin hue.
---
I'm falling a bit short of that, but 49.5 y.o. and still playing. Not as much as when it first came out. Happy to be here, and part of the WoW Classic family!
---
I have a friend who plays healer like you for as long as he remembers and I remember him saying holy paladin is best because they can make sure that all blessings and what not are being directed properly in the groups and the more knowledge you have in that class the more you will find raid leading easier. Hope this helps if even a little.
---
Said the same about shaman
---
For you maybe.
---
For me it was the journey and gearing up my character.
---
The problem with this though is that you're never going to get the dalrend weapons as a hunter if you're always passing on them for other people. Someone will almost always need them.
---
Yeah you might be right, but even so it will build a server community and rivalries in some ways. I'm looking forward to that phase, but I can also see how it will annoy people who have PvE goals and get camped regularly.
---
Nope, I said it crashed at MoP.. (Pandaland)
---
Yes they would but others would argue " You released all earlier expansions, you need to follow the story now" or " You gave them Wraith, why can't I have Cataclysm" 
---
And they will not create multiple "Classic wow servers" like Private servers with different expansion.
---
So logically it makes sense (Still speculation) that they would either follow the same path or make WoW 2.0
---
Just use the Remote Desktop chrome add-on. No need to make it complicated.
---
We had mana back then not focus.
---
Unless your group specifically states that you can't roll on them, it's not really reasonable to consider it "ninjaing" to roll on your BiS weapon &lt;.&lt;
---
Move Anything from BFA works on Classic.
---
Why would anyone do this?
---
Aside from the joy of murdering swedes in pvp... OK I'm sold.
---
Yet hunters are still strong in pvp right?
---
This had me giggling hard. I used to work at a LAN center in 06 and can distinctly picture a preteen customer fucking losing it and screeching at Hulking Mountain Lion
---
And that's why you won't be communicating while trying to somehow be cool.  LOL
---
Keybinds are server side, your client just caches them, if your clientside keybinds differ from server side, they're overwritten, however this might differ in the scenario where there are no settings found on the server.
---
Contributions outside of raids is not something that guarantees a raid spot in good guilds. If you want to join a casual guild that will do MC, Ony, BWL, ZG, AQ20 and maybe a few bosses in AQ40, it's fine. If you want to clear all of the game's content, you will face serious troubles when looking for a raid spot.
---
There's a blue post confirming RP, PvE and PvP servers for EU, and a post that confirms german PvP and PvE, and French PvP and PvE servers. So for EU, it's atleast 8 servers with RP-PvP.
---
Live with it.
---
Tbh, and I *loved* original AV, while I don't remember it well enough to say definitively, I imagine that no matter what Blizzard released, people would find a way to zerg through it to make the "grind" more efficient. Basically, the people just wanting the quickest AV rep and/or BG weekend honor would probably still ruin it, OG or not.

It's just a higher res version, and not even by much.

Uh, no. The EU has protections against discrimination for not knowing a language. If you're in the UK, the state MUST provide an interpreter that speaks one of these languages for all government activities.

you are going to give up tactical mastery, sweeping strikes AND 1 rage per 3 seconds with tactical mastery? okay sounds like a good idea to me

Atari 2600 when it was brand new. Remember when Space Invaders was the latest arcade game, and lost a number of quarters into it. D&amp;D 2nd Edition, BattleTech table top. 49, and gaming with a wife that accepts it, and games with me! (not to mention she's 30). AWWWW YEAH!

I'd be happy to let people download my work! I just don't know a good way to share it. I thought i'd be shouting into a void with these, but you guys really seem to like them!

Casual Guild - a wow guild which recruits members to be part of a loose association (guild) while having no explicit requirements on what character they play, how they play it, or what guild activities they participate in. Members enjoy the freedom to play how they want when they want but may encounter challenges participating in content that requires adherence to more rigid gaming structure, planning, and optimization strategies.
---
i agree with genoshock it seems against the entire idea of classic with less quality of life things to then just add all of the quality of life changes that made the game bad in the first place right back with addons. you will enjoy the game much more without a quest helper pointing you exactly where to go and really wont lose much time taking 10 seconds to read a paragraph
---
Paladins didn’t exist irl bro. They were just called crusaders.
---
just change the damn icon yourself
---
&gt; IMO taking HoJ from a melee as a Hunter is an asshole move though
---
IMO if you invite a hunter to BRD your expectation should be that he needs HoJ and as such it's up to you to clarify that you're reserving it.
---
A rare Wedding Singer reference. I see you.
---
Totally unplayable. Getting matches and gasoline now. Posts today....
---
Literally no one else is disappointed in this.
---
&gt; No offense but you really do not know what you're talking about
---
What are you talking about, nothing you said about how layering works contradicts what I've said, you've just described how layering starts up, you haven't said anything about how closes down
---
That being said I tried to find a source on layer sizes and was wrong, it seems like Blizzard does intend to keep layering sizes at 3k right from launch.
---
So yes, I was wrong about layering caps at launch, I'm right about how layering works though
---
It's a different game with different challenge that just appeals to me ( tbc would be even beter IMHO).
---
Best thing is ofc we get bfa and classic!
---
Im so disappointed
---
Yes, that is all you need - an active sub. BFA is not required.
---
Responding to your shit posts is actually kind of entertaining, you started off saying I was easily triggered but your posts are pointing to you actually being triggered lol. Like it matters to you what I do with my time, huh? :)
---
Yep that's the backend data that you're seeing. The finished product will have a place for all that extra info and won't display the raw backend data on mouseover.
---
Uh, same game, different version.
---
How do you plan to pass aggro, only pull while vanish is available x4, or just die

Why Grandma's Homemade Apple Pie vs Marie Callender's (RIP) frozen mass produced Apple pie in the grocery store?
---
That's all fine and well but it isn't *your server*.
---
Other GM’s with helpful feedback and the game isn’t even out yet. All this content is 15 years old chief, the strategies for every boss are already out there if you just search.
---
- Why wont any raiding guild take my meme spec? This sub said to just play what I think is fun
---
the true has been spoken.
---
Ooo have they announced character creation day?!
---
Are you short on arguments, friend?  
---
I have already played through the content and I know very well what's ahead of me. Nobody is saying that you can't clear MC with a bunch of retards who put points into talents based on what an ouija board tells them. However, that has no bearing on the fact that a good progression guild is very unlikely to have open ret spots.
---
Most important thing to note: people leave guilds, nothing you can do can prevent this, it WILL happen, don't take it personally, however you can mitigate the rate at which it happens, whenever someone inevitably leaves, ask them if they have a couple minutes to talk about why they left their feedback will be incredibly helpful.
---
Hey, you do you. I'm just saying you can get by without them, and not to worry too much if you don't know what you need yet.
---
I don't agree with the assumption that you will enjoy the game more without a quest helper, some people just want to reach the end game and questing is tedious for them. Quest helper addons were around in classic so I'm fine with them, I am worried however that more game/culture breaking addons will pop up such as a LFG tool whether its in the game as an addon or a dedicated website. Hopefully the community as a whole rebuffs any attempts to make those popular.
---
No you cannot play it, if you spec into Deep Ret after 3 days Blizzard automatically deletes your character. 
---
Ofc you can, just don't expect to be elite at anything they are the worst pve dps class in the game and also below average in pvp. Probably the weakest spec in the entire game and I not exaggerating (btw I mained Ret in Vanilla retail lol had no idea what I was doing)
---
Yep
---
If you have hard times multitasking, just roll Ret Paladin. Right click a mob then go do other stuff for a minute lmao.
---
Yeah it’s not great tbh. But it’s the only classic wow data base that mentions phases. So want to know what one is correct.
---
ventrillo was the shit, my friends would just type in a random server number or whatever and join randm ppls until they would kick us out. made for some hilarious interactions especially with how popular soundboards were back then.
---
The 3 important ones in holy are the interruption reduction (which you can get) but you miss out on the 15% mana cost reduction and the .5 second cast time reduction.
---
If they had wiped our characters 13 years ago I think the human population would have taken a dive for a bit lol. I don't think the tone would have been so optimistic :p
---
If it sounds like it could be an NPC's name, it's probably fine, and tons of NPCs have noun-noun or adjective-noun surnames. You just have to choose thematic words.
---
What level are these quests? You dont start getting gold from quests in classic till your in your 50’s this isnt retail.
---
You obviously didn't read OPs post. They are complimenting the differences and outlining stupid shit in BfA that likely makes people want to play classic more.
---
Eh, more like Marie callender went out and bought grandmas home made apple pie and resold it as trash.
---
Pally is a B tier healer for launch.  They dont shine until P4+

Oh lord just know what your getting yourself into best resources are gonna be good officers that make life easier delegate when you can or you might burn out very quickly.

---
This is a very interesting setup.  I'm genuinely curious after reading it and am going to give this a try.  Very cool and (I think) unique!
---
R-tard for sure
---
Okay sure, but none of that stuff is progressive itemization. That's progressive patch stuff, which was already mentioned and differentiated in the comment being responded to. 
---
/u/Mellisco is correct in stating that Classic won't have progressive itemization but is being downvoted by stupid people who don't know what the term means.
---
Why would anyone do try this.
---
Sometimes Reddit Save doesn't work.
---
This is amazing.

correct with the wand spec, 100. Incorrect though with mind flay. Mind flay is the worst DPM, until rank 3 when it starts to overtake holy fire and smite.

You see, I know I'm a dick, but I also have no interest in streaming.  With each reply you demonstrate your rhetoric, piss-poor attitude, contradictions, and most importantly how unappealing your brand is.  Congratulations streamer not streamer for playing yourself.

Unless you're looking for an opinion, in my case classic is hands down "better'.....
---
Noice I get off @2 and stress test goes live at 1!!! It’s only up for like 20-24hrs right?
---
Oh hell yeah! I love you guys on Emerald Dream. Are there applications yet for Classic?
---
You will want every single weapon in the entire freaking game!
---
Setting are only character specific if you make them that way... I thought.
---
Hope you get in there, Thex!
---
functionally there's no difference as far as i can tell
---
you may think it's the longest patch cycle ever but let me tell you; The company I work for has them beat haha
---
Are they planning to name servers prior to name reservation? If not how will name reservation work? I'd imagine it's on a per-server basis.
---
.
---
Exactly lol
---
No clue - probably. I definitely didn't cross check active realms before i posted this.
---
yeah, i'll pass lol
---
I don’t see a difference at all..
---
Exactly, this isn't an ad it's just a post from Blizzard and you see it because you follow their Company on LinkedIn 😅
---
Unless it's valve, I doubt that lol
---
Oh there used to be an old YouTube channel I think called tanks pot with strats not just from tank pov but dps and healer.
---
Trying to build relationship outside of wow is a good way to get some good team bonding so discord Facebook page and so on is great maybe even a WhatsApp group once you get there.
---
I can’t decide between RP- PVP or just PVP.
---
I want to be a hardcore PVP player, and want PVP to be a serious thing on my realm. I love RP but I’m afraid the PVP realms will have more of the serious pvpers.
---
What are y’alls thoughts on that?
---
I like how you spent more time on your grammar and word choice there, really got me that time xD
---
In today’s terms they’re called containers

this couldn't me more accurate from what I experienced

MEKKATORQUE!

Do you think it makes you an adult drinking expensive alcohol?

i endorse this addition to the analogy

So I don't think your situation is all that dire since 91% speaks the same language at least to a point of understanding. In my country 59% speaks Dutch, 40% French and 1% or less German. Now we expect people from our own country to speak the language of the place they are living because it is actually good manners to do so. We expect immigrants to follow the same rules we do. It would be a ridiculous expense to provide free translators to everyone for 3 languages because if we provide them for immigrants we should also provide them for our own people.
---
It actually is really simple because ultimately it comes down to this: If you live somewhere learn to communicate with the people already living there. Communication is the basis of a civilised society. To expect the majority to adept to the minority is foolish, unfair and impossible.
---
Neither take time.
---
1.12 is a reproduction, and perfectly and intentionally reproducing an error in a reproduction cannot be reasonably understood to be itself an error. Were they to implement this feature, it would not be a bug.
---
Could you imagine if they had done, and this while thing was a rerelease 13 years later?
---
Classic and retail are about as close to being the same game as league of legends and chess.
---
You can change skin color but the facial features are still Caucasian.

I just had a realization that resilience won’t be a thing.
---
The Vanilla and TBC cinematics were *montages.* But the WotLK cinematic was *story.*
---
Nah it’ll be fine! Layering is GOOD! Let me justify its existence for you with a really long and elaborate reasoning that doesn’t change the fact it will damage the user experience!  I’m a retail dotard!
---
It’s true. People would overpopulate them.
---
I'm pretty happy this douchebag named Sexy on a pserv won't be able to carry over his notoriety over to whatever server he ends up on Classic. So that's nice.
---
Ya I don't even know if that's true. Blizzard is mostly situated west coast no? Like what you're saying is actually just incorrect.
---
you are a scrub if you are going into the office on the 27th.
---
You can change the appearance of any icon on your computer. &gt;.&gt;

Sure thing 👌🏼
---
In a sort of toxic dick way maybe...
---
I’d like to double down on this.
---
I was thinking Rogue, Warlock, or Shaman.
---
I'm gonna run Horde on a PvP server. Will play alone sometimes, and with RL friends other times. I wanna do dungeons a lot. Be able to handle myself in world PvP 1v1. Maybe even raid eventually.  What do you think between the 3?
---
Thanks, I will try to locate that YouTube Channel. I appreciate your input!
---
yeh but rogues can kill single target faster and use blade flurry
---
Weapon score was maxed IIRC.  I think there was something bugged about that particular mob.

Haven't played since Legion. Even then, it wasn't much. I just traded all my gold for tokens, that's it.

thats amazing!

Thnx bud

Bro half of your points don’t even make sense, this isn’t a quality post.

no it is just kids using their mom's credit card, oh wait that is fortnite.  thank you fortnite for taking all the kids out of other games like cs, pubg, apex, bf, wow, eso, gw2, even cod has less youngens.

Uh, that’s a terrible comparison.

This is the base version of wow. (Somewhat)
---
I doubt my name will be taken in the time it takes me to create my character. What are the odds someone wants your name unless its a super popular name.
---
All ur min maxing before the game even launches will kill it in no time mark my words. Back then part of the fun was not knowing everything and feeling awe and wonder in the world. 
---
Now its all "no dude u cant play that class u wont get raidspots" and "how to be max level in no time because everything else doesnt matter" (aka the reason the same people say retail sucks so much)
---
Thanks, I wasn’t look at it in that perspective. I appreciate your helpful insight!
---
Its like asking if I could use my tongue to clean out a toilet, I can but why the fuck would I want to

Felix will not be getting his tools.

yes, it is called Maraudon.  Google solo Maraudon farming, or in a few months google solo lasher farm.
---
op is just an idiot

The tool has been released in Beta. Much of the functionality is still being implemented.
---
1) We intend to have a header bar with Race/Class selection that you can select/deselect while you use the guide.
---
2) We have "Progress Quest" as a direction and we use it quite a bit.
---
3) We intend to tie progress saving to your account.
---
4) We have Navigation in the pipe. Didn't quite make it in.
---
5) Highlighting Class/Race quests dynamically is a bit tricky. It's on our priority 1.
---
6) The mobile issue is well known and something we're working on site wide.
---
Most of the time, yes
---
You can pretty much tame one pet once you hit level 10 and use it to 60. Once it's loyalty is max, which only takes a few hours, you don't really have to feed it. You will probably want to tame pets every few levels to upgrade their abilities, but that's about it. Honestly feeding your pet is the least bothersome part about the pet to me.
---
Seconded
---
Now this is the target audience I want in this game.
---
https://willitclassic.com/view/Trku2I2MBwuzm5ZEf4YG
---
do a quick google on how to copy your WTF folder.
---
There are tons of people who get by just quietly being a part of the background and barely ever actually participating in the RP aspect of it, yeah. As long as you aren't going out of your way to mess with people on your faction or in uncontested areas for the opposite faction and stuff you're generally fine.
---
Copying my post from another thread:
---
I will be playing Classic with approximately 10 IRL friends.  At some point we'll remake our old guild.  Friendly players we encounter while leveling will be welcome to join us.  There are no requirements other than not being an asshat.
---
Once we hit 60 -- ~1 month for the fastest of us, ~5 months for the slowest -- we will have fun doing 5/10 man content.  Maybe we'll do some MC/Ony pugs.  Maybe if we're feeling really ambitious, we'll host our own pugs, unless we're busy leveling alts or PvPing or something.
---
I expect there to be a lot of guilds like this.
---
Makes sense. Not every gaming subreddit represents the overall community to the same accuracy. This one maybe not so much but I look forward to meeting the casual players in game.
---
What exactly is a min max? I hear that term all the time but don’t know what it means

I got flying a week ago, it's so refreshing. I like they're current trend of not unlocking flying right away but letting you get it later. Makes it easier for ults to level through content you've already done.
---
lol this is shaman symbol bro
---
It actually is. Majority of Vanilla WoW players are now professional adults who may have lost touch with their old sources of video game news.
---
cuz engineering is op as fuck?
---
True, but you’d be surprised what some players buy.. doesn’t hurt to try to AH it once. Then vendor...

&gt;don’t take on shifts if your boss asks for extra help in the workplace
---
Ha, work. What a casual
---
Well the key thing, I simply added that in because it’s true. You need keys, but you could exploit around them.
---
Flying was available in the burning crusade bro. It’s been around for a long time. You may have had to wait to fly in the new zones, but once flying was allowed in the vanilla zones, that was it.
---
World pvp has been easily escaped since the addition of flying mounts.
---
I haven’t had a character one shot me since vanilla, so okay... threatening out there...
---
Random stat loot? Uh dude have you ran a dungeon? Titanforging, this item has mastery and haste, shit I needed mastery and crit...
---
Where you been? You even play wow, or you just hope over here once in awhile from another game?
---
Are all these addons confirmed to work with the new classic client (that's based on BfA) ?
---
You are asking why they can’t do it later on a Friday? Do you want to start a multi-hour job at your work right before you would normally leave work on a Friday?  
---
It makes way more sense for them to do it in the middle of their work day.
---
Well mostly PvE related tips, because I don't plan on doing much PvP.

Is weakauras still not updated for classic? everytime i go to WillitClassic and search weakauras and follow the curseforge link it displays the 8.2 version... that seems wrong to me
---
Yeah op is failing to understand that just because he enjoyed the aesthetics of course that he is opening himself up to a huge mess of potential problems (which are ten fold more likely to occur on an out of date operating system ) instead of just upgrading to a supported version and just setting the look to be like do. 
---
OP mind explaining why you’re so hard stuck to windows xp?
---
improved drain soul is a trap talent, but fel concentration can be a lifesaver if you end up in a bad position with your potions on cooldown or healthstone unusable.  Shadowburn is an incredibly valuable talent if you can bake it into a leveling spec.
---
I think he means things like Discord can take it away from you at anytime, where with the server i self host for Teamspeak, no one can take it away from me, ever.
---
I have a question regarding the stresstest. I have downloaded the Game but the „Play Button“ in the launcher is greyed out. Is this normal? Will it be „pushable“ when the stresstest starts?
---
and less fuzzy
---
No. The community is too split on having the pure vanilla experience vs going the route of RuneScape.
---
If you want expansions, play retail, it isn't a hard concept.
---
It's not even slightly like that
---
You a clearly mistaken sir
---
I mean you even *knew* the other guy got wooshed, and yet you still felt the need for it to happen to you.
---
So you just want to level mining to level engineering? That's a very bad idea. Sure leveling engi can be somewhat expensive, but it's nothing compared to the pain of skilling up mining. Only do mining if you actually plan on using it at 60.

&gt; Still cool to see a bunch of suits talk about the morlocs in Westfall

scared of the lack of horde.

So I’m set on being one of the healers for my friend group that I’m playing with, but I’m stuck on what to make a final decision on. I played priest last time I played WoW so I’m not looking to repeat that. I’ve heard paladins can get pretty boring so that’s out too. I originally settled on resto Druid because I’m a fan of the hybrid play style, but I’ve heard some pretty negative things about resto druids (no regular rez, HoTs not stacking in vanilla, long cast times) and I’ve started looking into shaman a bit but I really can’t decide on which one to choose. I’m looking to do mostly PvE stuff if that helps.
---
it's because reddit is full of homosexuals that enjoy jerking off toether in a big circle. i call it a "circlejerk" for short.
---
And he got a life time supply of xena tapes and hot pockets
---
rofl, "destroyed wow". Because Classic is the end-all-be-all, right?
---
Horde...living life as intended connected to the earth mother unlike the more "civilized" factions
---
This is the first time I'll be around when it actually starts. The other two began 15 minutes before I clocked out at work.

I just like to go in and kill that dude I was going for. Don't care if I die after that by 10 ugly orcs.

\#Whatclasstogo #indecision

Where exactly did I seem upset? 
---
Sorry if I triggered you, but it's not exactly a secret that RP servers have even more drama due to the BS that I mentioned above.
---
Are you trolling?
---
It doesn’t matter if flying exists if you can’t use it.
---
So because you can’t get one shot world pvp doesn’t exist? You can’t be killed? Being one shot is the only way you feel threatened?
---
That’s not random stat loot genius, the stats don’t change. Even if you don’t like titanforging that still isn’t random stats.
---
Simple if it has intellect as its main stat give it to the pally.
---
Hey did you post the macro?
---
Hi Reddit therapist, unfortunately I don’t really see your points of view here, as a person I don’t mind if people want to see how I am doing, if they want to waste their time watching my slow warrior path to max level, let them waste their time. 
---
As just a person in general, who just happens to play a video game, and wants to record that play time, twitch will save that game play for me, and I have easy access to it! It’s amazing how technology has allowed me to do that. Yeah maybe in the future I’ll make a decent low quality pvp video too with the footage I recorded via twitch.
---
I dunno, sometimes I feel like I’m trapped in a world where people care too much about what other people do. You know?
---
Yes, they should fix that. Every detail counts, down to the desktop icon.
---
Oh my LOL.  That debuff is real!
---
Be a Hunter. Look up Dysphoria's Hunter vs World video for soloing the instance.
---
ClassicShell is a god send. Windows 10 would be so unbearable without it.
---
But it didn't crash at Pandaland, it crashed at Cataclysm, then again in WOD, then again in BFA. Or do you not understand how to follow a graph?
---
I could sneak in as a Swede and potentially make it...
---
Saves hundreds of gold, so how is it a bad idea?
---
the WoltK cinematic, to me, represents a change in the direction of WoW that has led to the gradual decline of the game.
---
the original and TBC cinematics? pastiche of difference character classes and races, with one looming nemesis in the later. but the point was it was an unpainted canvas, the story was your gaming experience and what you chose to play.
---
wrath became about Arthas. there were no characters in the trailer. we started getting more and more NPCs driving the story line and being the focus of events, where we were supporting cast. Wrath was about Bolvar, Tirion, Arthas, and to a lesser extent Jaina and Sylvannas.
---
the cinematic itself is incredibly well done -- its powerful. but it denoted a change in the tone of wow, which is only really evident years later in retrospect.
---
Roger Wilco anyone?
---
Ok Amelia Bedelia, "gold" as in "silver", as in "copper", as in "money"
---
Yep! But one guy missing it won't be a big deal in 95% of raids.
---
Guildie raider to halfway through nax healing as a Ret pally.
---
Yeah and now add like 40% of the population who would need a translator. Can you see how we would never manage? Also I'm practically sure your local government doesn't have all 300 people standing by in every office so immigrants will probably need an appointment but they can't make one because they can't communicate properly. First appointment if they didn't specify wich language they spoke you can make a second appointment and you waisted the time of at least 2 people. 2nd appointment you will be able to get started, knowing people in general it will take multiple appointments to get anything done anywhere. Now you need those for everything the government does, if your health care is provided by the government like here you need translators there as well, the watersupply is governmental here as well again you need translators, I could go on. It is impossible to provide this service for a dual or trilingual country with an even spread.
---
Where are you from? I'm from Belgium. We don't even have the population to get decent legal translators for every language in courts only.
---
yeah, coincidence - those hours are convenient to Irvine, CA and the people working there.
---
Blackcrow is never best-in-slot for Hunters, nor is Satyr's Bow.
---
Think of it as RP-friendly more than RP-required. Outside of names like Cookiekingx.

Yeah the edges are clearly sharper, idk why others can't see it.

I approve your life choices.

I don't the specific links or names of addons but here's what you want the addons to do. You can google that or look up on curseforge and that should help you:
---
Energy timer, you want to know when your next tick of energy is coming, this is super useful.
---
CC timer, rogues has ton of CC, time them. Add on a diminish return tracker for bonus points.
---
Swing timer is pretty nice, I've been a bit out of date with beta, but have we found out yet if sword proc or windfury resets attack timer? If it does then you want a swing timer to use abilities right after.
---
Proc and buff tracker, something to keep track of your slice'n'dice duration and windfury procs(if you are horde). 
---
Combopoint tracker addon might be useful too if you don't like the blizz version.
---
Sold everything (vendor, not AH -- ha ha ha ha ha!) on 16 different characters, except for the clothes on their back. Consolidated all the gold on one character of each realm. Logged off.
---
The antivaxxer movement has spread to operating systems!
---
I wish I could do the same for swedish players but swedes are so fucking annoying, childish and retarded in online games.
---
50 ap and 1% crit from weapons? Passing on that to a random pug when your guild needs you to get strong for raids? Not a chance
---
Any guild I join becomes  de-facto casual.
---
Believe me, I am extremely grateful to the people at blizzard that worked on and made this happen. I’m grateful for their integrity, and have been pleasantly surprised at every point of this project.
---
But it has been a BATTLE to get to the point. Endless ridicule from forum cretins. Dismissals by Blizzard. Forum post after forum post deleted for even mentioning legacy servers.
---
It’s been a long road, but now? We can finally play the game we’ve wanted to for so long :D.
---
Yeah, probably why you got down-voted. Who the hell talks like that?
---
Technology is grand streamer not streamer.  However, you move away from documentarian the moment you advertise in an advertisement thread, and become an amateur streamer, albeit, a poor one.
---
I don’t really understand why this wouldn’t be literally any server
---
I'm going to roll toons on a plain PvE realm, plus the RP-PvP realm, and level a bit on each and see which one I have more fun with.
---
I hope all of the servers are safe places for people of all diversities, who you are behind the screen shouldn't effect who you are in the game.
---
Takes a LOT of bronze early on which aint exactly plentiful.
---
Time is money and the time it takes to level mining is not worth the couple hours in maraudon.
---
ElvUI does not work for classic yet.
---
Are you unemployed? Well have we got something for you to play.
---
It’s a random process, and yes if I can get the same loot 3 times and the stats on the same named item are all different, that means it’s random.
---
World pvp most certainly exists. It’s a lot less threatening when you don’t have to worry about being killed within 5 seconds of stun. Nowadays I walk briskly away while if they do kill me, it’s minutes later.
---
What’s all this can’t with the flying thing? My characters have been flying for literally years. Need some gold mailed? I got you.

It's going to be really easy actually. 
---
Many many groups won't even be able to fill out 40 mans, and the dps will like that you aren't competing with their tier gear.

And if the dps druid can also tank and heal then they are even more desired and valuable

Stop pretending vanilla raids are retail-level difficulty where class composition actually matters

Lungs are overrated.
---
Oof. You're in for some tough times then, my friend.
---
Of those 3 classes, with their respective "cons", you're probably best off going Hunter in a raid guild, PVE server. You won't have to deal with melee/range weaving nearly as much, esp when maxed.
---
Why not make the thread when you can give it a title with an actual server in? Or servers you can discuss at least? The communities are going to organise themselves through guild leadership of guilds with similar aims and then everyone can follow them. This thread at this time serves no purpose, and will just be lost.
---
Thank you. That's the intention of this post.
---
Or you could just wait for AV to become the AV you enjoy in a later patch, just  like in the original timeline.
---
They are based in Cali. So that's not even right. They aren't working on some normal everyday stuff either. I do start massive things on Friday at work. They spill over the whole weekend and I end up working overtime. Installing new software? Looks like I'm coming in Sunday. It's not all the time tho. Neither is this.
---
Gills are as well
---
Honestly I'm trying to find out the details and boundaries behind picking the names of our characters.
---
We’ll likely see in an hour
---
You probably don't need to pass aggro.  and if you did need to on bosses there's vanish.
---
When you meet someone out IRL through school, job, friends or what have you. How cool is it to say "I play wow", "So do I!" What server??? And find out its the same server and be able to play together. Also grand guild meetups. Also yes, 95% of norwegians speak fluent english. Why not want many of those?
---
Frivolously use DoT/fear combination (if there's no danger of pulled adds killing you), pet tanking, bandages/HS/health potions with Life Tap and you can grind at a very quick pace with little down time.
---
Trailer of lies. Tauren never got 2H totem weapons. :(
---
Druid has gills. Moo.
---
Shouldn't have to deal with popular streamers. Player interactions will be more self aware towards building a community.
---
Back in vanilla I rolled on a pve server because I didn't know any better. I was a dwarf hunter.
---
One day I had to run across the barrens. I landed in booty bay and started running. For the first few minutes I was super nervous, because I was in enemy territory, the heart of the horde's training grounds. But then I realized nobody could touch me. I was completely immune to my sworn enemies. The game felt so boring at that point.
---
That evening I rolled on a pvp server and I've never looked back.
---
Oh nice!
---
Cashing in my gold for tokens and uninstalling
---
News flash.  Streamers will be on every server.  Just avoid the mega streamer server and you will be fine if you want to avoid "them"
---
Ah, I wasn’t entirely sure of when pets were changed. I just remember having guildies camp that cougar.
---
To be honest a big downside was that hunter minimum range that I’m not sure when was removed either.
---
Either way I’m still super excited.
---
That's generally just because english is the language to speak on the western internet. I don't think a lot of brits know much more than americans.
---
Proudmore was an original sever, wasn't it? If they use Vanilla server names, I'd expect Proudmore to again fill the roll you're talking about.
---
Mmhmm
---
Yes. Leeway isn't activated if the mob(s) are snared/slowed and you aren't.
---
That said, *some* of the AoE farm spots won't be (as) feasible. Like Blackrock Depths solo farming, due to net throwers, which reportedly did not throw said nets on most pservers.
---
Not a streamer, but I am planning on making YouTube content. I plan to do the opposite and take things really slow. I've been doing the same with FFXIV for the past 3 months (just hit level 35) and the details you get to enjoy by planning slow are extraordinary. MMOs should be about the journey!
---
Thanks nice list
---
As i've already replied to someone else:
---
The entire point of my post is that it is possible that if populations don't drop by the end of phase 1 as they've predicted, they will be physically unable to turn layering off as they've promised they would.  The entire plan is contingent upon a huge amount of people not logging in after the first few months.
---
Honestly Stoneform is probably better than all of the nelf racials combined. Roll away, friend dwarf!
---
It sounds like it would be difficult to pull off, because 'rogue aggro' is simply damage done, so the rogues in question would need to have their eyes glued to omen.
---
Community.
---
this is nice. Any chance you can share a high-rez version? Would love to print it for my set up.
---
I was unaware that the streamers got together and decided this is what they’re all gonna do. Seriously though, if they pay the subscription they can level their character however they want, I straight up don’t even understand your point. Are you gonna 100% the game before 60? Complete every single quest? How is dungeon grinding “skipping content” if you don’t also consider not 100% the game to be “skipping content”. Are you not planning on playing the game yourself, and you need to play vicariously through streamers?
---
He only said free to download not free to play.
---
Maybe start it up yourself when the server names/types launch :) and advertise through reddit. I understand being ridiculed/harassed for being your authentic self around some bigots (and they do exist in the WoW community). Wishing you and your friends the best
---
Your friends haven't picked a faction yet? Shaman would be most in demand after Priest for PvE. If your friends are melee they'd be much happier with a Shaman as well. But of course if they go Alliance none of that matters.
---
Druids have great independence compared to the other healers but suffer from all the things you've mentioned. If you exclusively wanted to group heal you might want to pick something else, but being able to fill in the tank slot as needed can be very useful.
---
Druids are also a buncha hippies
---
I can't jump onto a server to then discuss which server to play on. 
---
Correct; server list isn't out yet. Maybe eventually this thread will Garner attention from other people with a proactive disposition and they can take the reigns once the names are out.
---
No, again you're incorrect. They will not keep layering when world bosses come around, they can't, they won't. You're worrying about something that they already said they wouldn't do.
---
Just after I thought I was settled... unfortunately I’ve heard TBC vs Vanilla SPriest is very different, and in general the class balance was much better in TBC. Pet management was what scared me away from Hunters in the end, but I felt that the Warlock micro wasn’t as bad as Hunters... we will see
---
Most of my British friends are only fluent in English, but they have a passing understanding of German, French, Spanish and Italian. Enough to know when they are being insulted and to get through basic touristy shit in foreign European countries. 
---
I can make out signs. Sometimes.
---
Must be a troll.
---
There was a troll in the TBC trailer.
---
I used to live in Leeds and was around when the Tetley's Brewery closed down in 2011. I knew a fair few guys in pubs around that way who refused to drink it when the brewery moved down to the Midlands. To be fair, a large part of it's identity was just being northern so it kind of sucked they moved it! A part of Leeds died that day!
---
I think they stated they will not use any existing or past server names for the new ones in Classic, expect a whole new list.
---
I think this is a great idea, but poor timing. Get a server list, don't give your thread a cryptic title so you actually attract the right people, and try again when the time is right.
---
Are you guys going Horde or Alliance? If you’re Alli, Shaman won’t even be an option.
---
...wot? None of that is true m8. The word "paladin" comes from chivalric romances mythologizing the court of Charlemagne. No one called crusaders "paladins" (except maybe as an allusion in poetry, basically the same as comparing them to other mythical heroes like Hector of Troy or King Arthur) and it wasn't a "rank" for knights in the middle ages.
---
&gt;What possible course of action does blizzard have available to them in this scenario other than to leave layering in longer than they said they would/indefinitely?
---
Opening new servers, free transfers from overpopulated servers to newly opened servers. 
---
This is their best case scenario. They would absolutely love it if the game is a huge hit and they need to open more servers to accommodate the number of players. 
---
If their estimations are correct, everything is good and nothing has to change.
---
If they overestimate how many people will play long term, it will lead to dead servers/having to merge servers. Which is a worst case scenario.
---
Obviously they're going to err on the side of caution with the number of servers and layering, which either works fine or gives them good publicity if their game is so popular they need to open more servers.
---
They will not keep layering in phase 2. This is when they will add world bosses, and if layering still exists, it will break the game. They've explicitly said that there needs to be one world, when a world boss respawns, there needs to be one world boss available in the game, not multiple on different layers. 
---
Don't worry so much and chill out, it'll be fine.
---
:)
---
Love this, you have a beautiful vision! More ASAP :)
---
Sui
---
Funny enough, its actually *most* realistic to heal without Mana tide earlier on, than later. 
---
If your guild at least halfway attempts to gear out pre-raid BiS, rather than showing up in dungeon sets and random crappy blues, you're going to blow up MC. Mana tide hardly necessary.
---
AQ+ is where I'd expect that to be more mandatory.
---
Oof, shoots fired,!
---
MMOs should be about whatever the fuck you want it to be about. Stop with the gatekeeping.
---
For those purposes you could get by with all three of those classes, with the caveat that some PvE Warlock and Shaman builds are pretty terrible in PvP. Rogue would have the hardest time finding groups.
---
I would say "minimal progress". Maybe Ony kills with multiple pugs, and eventually a rag kill. Beyond that probably not. One step up from casual would be 'progression guild' which has formal raid times and mostly can avoid bringing in pugs but the laid back attitude towards consumables and raid awareness and knowing the fights stops them from completing all the content. I was in many progression guilds. In TBC our progression guild made it to halfway thru SSC. Casual guilds were probably still struggling on Melchazar or Gruul. Wasn't till wrath that I got into a "semi hardcore" guild which had specific raid times, enchants and consumables were required, fights had to be researched ahead of time, and loot was given out by council to benefit the raid most effectively. Happily we downed Arthas the first week the raid buff came out. Although we would have beat him without it on that try because everyone was playing really well.
---
No, they'll simply have queue times, the solution is free realm transfers off the over populated realms.
---
What can I say, trees are pretty cool and stuff.
---
What did he say?
---
No, sure isnt. But if someone writes something you or your friends find homophobic etc, just ignore the player and you cant see their messages anymore
---
I live in Taiwan but have decided to play on NA servers. I work for a European company so I have strange hours. My main play time will be in the morning here which is prime time for West Coast US.
---
We might be able to make an English guild but I think we'd be reliant on pugs for raiding.
---
I want to see a screenshot of Thex getting his name
---
&gt; I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by a wow trailer
---
I quit playing WoW in TBC (came back for 3 months during Wrath), but whenever a new expansion was coming out I'd still always watch the trailer because of how incredible they always are.
---
Not every DPS will be Rogue/Warrior/Mage.
---
And honestly as much as this sub talks about engineering there should be a few jumper cables in your group.
---
Damage Meters for leveling?
---
Raids got cleared with keyboard turners, spell clickers, coordinating tactics mid fight through raid chat, shitty internet, and even worse computers. It was extremely casual.
---
So watch some smaller streamers. Plenty of streamers with a smaller viewerbase that are worth watching.
---
Should be more disappointed in the viewers that dont leave them alone.  They are being forced to do dungeons in order to level if they want to stream.  Stream snipers and same faction people following them around and tagging mobs before them.
---
Thanks! This is my hope for this post; that the now-known desire for such a thing exists, and that getting the word out in front of the server list facilitates organization.
---
If there's absolutely no dropoff (which is laughable, but hypotheticals), the issue still solves itself extremely quickly.  Layering is necessary so that there aren't thousands of players logging into durotar all at once.  If there are 100k+ players concurrently active on a realm in two months, the servers can handle it organically and without layering *once those 100k+ players aren't all in the same 6 starting zones*.  Layering is necessary because expecting Blizzard's servers to successfully handle many thousands of players in Elwynn is unreasonable, but as soon as they diffuse out to SW, westfall, duskwood, Redridge, etc the servers will be fine handling it.  
---
Layering is not an attempt to segment the community and even though it will do so for a bit, it's incredibly necessary from a hardware perspective.  Once the hardware issues naturally solve themselves by players spreading out into the world, layering stops being necessary.
---
It's not the streamer that I mind, it's their followers. Ever seen twitch chat on a live stream? Cancer everywhere.
---
Why dont you just buy healthy food and drink plenty of water instead of all that junk? Christ how old are you, 12?
---
Empty pitchers of water
---
Hes also said he'd go on a PvP server too so he's probably still up in the air
---
Get a dmg meter early, tbh its hard to tell how well you do in dps when you got 8 dots rolling and you can't do the math. 
---
Cast Curse of Agony first in you lvl rotation, it needs time to build up and if you cast it last you lose a lot of potential dmg, and waste mana.
---
Get a threat meter early, its a huge thing for our class at 60, and by experiencing how your threat works at you lvl will improve your skills at that at 60. Practice makes perfect argument for it. 
---
Kill 2-3 things at once, VW after 2 taunts I usually feel fine sending him to then next mob. Remember how useful fear is, the less dmg you take the more mana you can make with it, so taking dmg yourself rly sucks for efficiency. 
---
Do elite quests alone, a lock can solo almost every elite (similar lvl) in the game, dot-fear-wait-repeat.
---
Carry more SS than you need, if your bags get full simply delete some, but its better to be over kill and have them when you need them than not because you wanted a few free bag spaces. 
---
Always have your SS up, always have a healthstone up, and always have your buff on, the armour and hps are actually amazingly good.
---
Remember your utility, and use it. When your looking for a dungeon group mention the summoning, healthstones, soul stones, ect. Promote your utility.
---
Look up warlock quests before you do them, some have shit rewards with a high cost that are simply a waste of time, resources, and fun.
---
Take tailoring, its simply one of the easiest to lvl up, while also giving you good benefits in terms of gear in the 40s and pre-pre-bis (lol ik)
---
Look on the AH frequently for lvl 55-60 greens with shadow damage, most of our BiS as locks are random ench (PvE raiding)
---
I like going herb as well, at 60 it is very nice to be able to farm your own mats for the potions/flasks you will want. The lock herbs are in particular more expensive than most other class herbs, as they spawn in quite small, and unfrequently. 
---
When you hit 60, farming in the demon area in Northern Winterspring is a great place to: make a large sum of money, through the demons as well as the frost giants and even bears. The farming relies on our unique ability to enslave "wild" demons and is very efficient ive found when you master your grove.
---
You can use warlock bubbles (spellstone and VW sacrifice) to take no damage from hellfire (warlock firefart) and can be a quite useful AoE dps
---
The stats to look for while lvling in order imo, should be stam-int-spirit-sp-crit. Stam = int in our case except stam offers survivability vs crit from int which in my opinion is much less important while lvling Afflic
---
OP If you have any specific questions or want to know more about something lmk, also this is all my just my experience lvling about 3-4 locks. Bloodthirsty redditors I aint the lock encyclopedia or almanac, plz dont evicerate me because you dislike somethign I wrote.
---
This is not a LinkedIn ad, FYI. This is just simply a post on their social media, which they probably crosspost on all of their platforms. If this was a paid ad, where it says "2d" it would say "Promoted".

Since they all do GTA rp i wouldnt be surprised if people do a wow rp
---
I feel like you're either still not reading my post or just really naive.
---
If ten thousand people are still logging in at a time on a server at the end of phase 1, how exactly do you expect them to turn layering off?  Do you think just because they promised they would turn it off around that time that magically they will destroy the play-ability of the game on the exact day phase 1 ends?
---
Ah okay, I guess it would probably a gamble that we'll all have to take because there isn't any better options other than offering transfers.
---
Oh definitely, you are right! But they didn't pay for targeted ads is what I meant 😛
---
Nah it will just be a collection of streamer highlights and gifs. Pretty much like any other gaming subreddit aswell.
---
You advertise this in english, and promote it by saying "find norwegian players for your guild" yet ban international guilds trying to so exactly that. Corrupt leadership in this disc, be aware
---
Thanks! I’ll try this when I get home. It says 7.0 which should be the right client I think
---
Probably just free server transfers to a lower pop realm as they did in the past with high population servers for people fed up with super long queues. Obviously it might be harder to convince people to take the transfer if there aren't queues or other QoL issues associated with the overpopulation that make people want to leave on their own accord
---
Layers definitely introduce issues and this being one potential problem area. Mostly for me since it's been very clear this would be in the game for quite some time now I try to focus on the benefits, but there are definitely drawbacks too.
---
The short answer is: No, you most likely will not be down-ranking with most characters.
---
The long answer: Some classes and specific spells are useful for down ranking but this will apply to only a handful of classes, spells, and situations, typically a caster of some kind.
---
But you can easily make it to 60 without concerning yourself with this information. You may want to consider it for your class after reaching 60 though.
---
Yep. That's their whole purpose. To troll you. Just you.
---
Thank you guys, I'm glad you like it. :)

I’m gonna kms

This time around, I expect mostly adults playing classic (non-RP) anyways. The teens and first timers will be on retail. No reason for them to play some unadvertised game with poorer graphics, fewer character options, and a smaller world.

It's been thirteen years and four months,

Since they took my WoW away,

I just sleep every night and work all day,

Since it's been gone I can do whatever I want,

I can play whatever I choose,

I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant,

But nothing,

I said nothing can take away these blues,

'Cause nothing compares,

Nothing compares to you.

It's been so boring without WoW here,

Like a bird without a song,

Nothing can stop these weary tears from falling,

Tell me baby why have you been gone?

I could put my cursor over every game I see,

But they'd only remind me of you,

I went to the doctor and guess what he told me,

4 rogues and a Druid could do some fun stuff in 5-mans.  People are saying trash won’t be easy because of lack of AoE, but you can stealth past all the trash and hit the bosses directly. 
---
You can use feint as threat management prior to relying on Vanish in a rogue tank rotation. 
---
For those mentioning 4 saps, sap has a 10% chance to break stealth when you are specced into improve sap, otherwise you will always break stealth. Rogues trying to do something like this won’t all have a spec with improved sap. Really, no rogue uses a spec that has Bladeflurry AND improved sap. Besides the crazy ones, like me.
---
The prevalence of homophobic sentiment may be higher than you realize.
---
Feint?
---
Thanks bro! I’m gonna take your word for it. It’s been a really long while since I played my hunter seriously.
---
Tailoring is your friend, probably more important for warlocks than any other class.
---
Always keep first aid up to date.  
---
Level as affliction.  It's too good to not do.
---
Succubus is very strong despite void being main leveling demon.  Her CC makes her invaluable against humanoids.  
---
If if your fighting ranged enemies Imp is a great option because it can keep you from over-pulling.
---
Doesn't matter, you can't have multiple world boss spawns on 1 server, kills the whole point of them.
---
This is the right answer!
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
I was getting 150ms on retail. I think that's pretty acceptable. I've not really noticed any lag on retail playing on EU at 350ms ping so we should be grand!
---
They're banking on having a greater boost in #s over other streamers not doing dungeon leveling, once they hit 60 and are doing the end-game dungeons sooner than others.
---
They're probably right.
---
Fun and exciting, well, when you play as Alliance you really get the feel of a wilderness adventure. You're commonly far away from support or civilization in a world heavily colonized by the horde.
---
* Your only flightpoint and mailbox in Stranglethorn Vale are in Booty Bay.
---
* You don't have a base in Badlands.
---
* You don't have a base in Thousand Needles.
---
* You don't have a base in Swamp of Sorrows.
---
* You don't have a mailbox in Arathi.
---
* You don't have a mailbox in Felwood, and the flightpath is so far from the quest givers you may as well fly into Astranaar while questing in Felwood.
---
* Your base in Desolace is quite far away from Mara and the GY.
---
* Speaking of Desolace, Rexxar's patrol through Desolace and Feralas can generate plenty of emergent exciting fun as he charges up from behind to one-shot you while you're fighting a mob near the road.
---
* Your fastest way to Dire Maul? Fly to Thalanaar and literally run through the middle of Camp Taurajo praying you don't get dazed off your mount.
---
* You're in contested zones for leveling from level ~20 on -- there is no Barrens equivalent. That includes Alliance's equivalent of the Orgrimmar zeppelin hub. Alliance's boat hub is in contested Wetlands and there aren't guards around the ships or flight path. Even getting to Kalimdor can be a fun adventure!
---
* Speaking of the Barrens, if you want to run WC, RFK, or RFD you have run there, either past all the level ~40 mobs in Dustwallow Marsh or all the way south to Booty Bay and then over to Ratchet. Barrens isn't contested so exciting fun times can ensue as horde pick and choose their fights with you around the instances.

For those who have online storage sites such as dropbox/box/onedrive/googledrive blocked at work - any chance we could just get a listing of the addons in a post?

What does the language column mean? My name will end in ["anus"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-anus), but it's a latin name, and it was my name in retail. no one ever complained about it.
---
when you first get you're pets there special abilities wont be spammed by them on their own unless you go into you're spell book "P" and then go to the demon tab at the bottom of the spell book panel and then right click on the ability, this will cause the ability to glow meaning the demon will spam / use on CD that ability. So basically as soon as you get you're imp if you notice it isn't attacking anything with fire bolt its because it hasn't been toggled on

I had "Fashionable" on Emerald Dream for like 6 years and am still fine. And that character was, let's just say, uhh slightly famous for a time.

&gt; I am excited to try their new 'layering' feature - it sounds so high tech
---
I know this is satire but oof. I hope they don't keep it around longer than they say they are because "reasons."
---
That numbers arent accurate. Never seen a single pserver peaking over 13k, and almost half of that were chinese gold farmers.
---
Exact players for Classic is uncertain, but im sure Blizzard can adapt and add/merge servers
---
Wordperfect ;)
---
I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure they stated that modern infrastructure has improved a lot and the issue leading to layering was not at all a hardware/server capacity thing and a more a community longevity/server population thing.
---
link broken
---
Whatever floats people's boats.  Personally, my most enjoyable moments is the random pvp that happens while leveling.
---
Unpalatable.
---
Agreed - I used to play on Burning Legion (EU) which generally was a English speaking server in TBC, however once wrath hit, it was practically a Polish speaking server, which ruined it all for me and eventually I made a realm change purchase.
---
I think the best anyone could come up with at the moment would be based on private server data and prone to inaccuracies.  Did any of the databases pull live data from the beta?
---
What else do you expect from the cringe lords of reddit

That's for pve raids.

Why does the LGBTQ population have to be so annoying? No one during a normal WoW interaction cares about your sex or sexuality but you’re going to let everyone know. It’s sad that you think you need your own server because getting along with straight people is just to awful. I actually play on Proudmoore and have no issues with the LGBTQ community other than the fact they have to always be screaming in your face how they are LGBTQ.
---
I dont know what patch it was but once they made teleport a goddamn rune spell I was outtiefivethousand
---
Oh fuck off.  Companion pets.  Go play retail.

You just ruined cows for me.

Here is my attempt at the front. I'll see what I can do with the back with flight paths. I'm no expert at this so I'm sure someone out there can do it better but I think it's pretty clean.

I realized a very important addon you missed (especially for Warlocks)...KLH Threat Meter. Warlocks have no threat reduction!

Oof, thanks. Fixed.

Racism is rampant in the eastern kingdoms. It's gonna take years of education to completely remove it from their culture. And the alliance are the 'good' guys... riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight

Pretty smart monetization idea from Blizzard tbh.

Great video, that's a whole new series of classic videos to work through!

Tuesdays/Wednesday

In the comment I responded to you literally said the point of the discussion is to dissuade them from relying on layering for more than a few months. Are you confused?
---
Anything is possible.

I was 15. Barely could convince my mother to get the base set, let alone collectors. RIP

Oh wow, you’re actually serious. This is next level shitposting.
---
As good as the modern infrastructure is, it would still be an absolute shitshow for thousands of players to be in the same zone at once.  It's not an issue about what the tech can or can not do, but creating a positive gaming experience for as many people as possible.
---
Everyone in here is talking about what class they should play, and I got that set. I'm playing a Rogue because I've always wanted to and just never really got around to it after leveling my first rogue to 27 right before BC launched and I switched to belf pally for 12 years or whatever it's been.
---
What I need to figure out is if I want to play troll or undead. Troll appeals to me because it's a bit rarer than other races and, after BoA, I kind of really like all the troll stuff. Undead appeals to me because I can really lean in to the edgelord aspect of the rogue player's psyche. I don't care too much about min-maxing, so racials don't matter much. My goal is to figure this out with the stress test. But any thoughts and opinions would be appreciated.

I had the same experience except CATA burned me out on dailies.  There were just way too many.

I want to play paladin so bad but BLOOD AND THUNDER pulses through my veins. What do.
---
This is the only reasonable reply in this entire post.  Thank you.
---
I imagine that opening new servers is the only option they'll have in the scenario I described.  Blizzard is notoriously sluggish with things though so I do worry they might not be willing to add new servers soon enough to spread out the population before the end of phase 1.  Though I agree the introduction of world bosses should be a hard deadline for them, which is reassuring.  I imagine they could still always delay the implementation of world bosses if they can't turn layering off yet but even in that scenario I can't imagine it would be large enough of a delay to meaningfully detract from the experience of playing.
---
same..
---
Well we're all out of ice. We only had 3 bits and didn't expect such a rush!
---
Now you tell me.
---
Alternatively run 2 druids and 2-3 rogues... tank heal and dps. Speed of stealth runs and no weird aggro swapping.
---
I know my flair says alliance, but we’re not really dead set on a faction yet.
---
If I were him, I would go on PVP. The extra spontaneous content is just fuel for streaming. Even if I didn't have a personal army following me, I would still suffer through it. As long as that money keeps rolling in by the truckload.
---
I think I'll be going to the NA servers. I'll be playing 8am to 12pm Taiwan time during the week which is 7pm to 11pm West Coast US  time.
---
I'll play more normal hours at the weekend. Let me know if you guys end up on NA. Do you live in Taiwan?
---
Also, for the Horde!!
---
In the same boat, actually worse since I have no flexibility. Sunday raiding seems like the best option.
---
May host my own pugs.
---
I would still do it. You can’t really think about it.
---
Is this a litteral shitpost?
---
Your post assuming thing's that can and will not happen.  It's like assuming that if there are too many players after phase 1 they will just shut all of the servers down and scrap the whole thing.
---
I was just joking
---
Seems to me like you worry a bit too much about streamers.
---
Piss jug is standard but cmon man this is disgusting..
---
That would be a tertiary stat that was added on a titanforge. Random stats are not a thing. Random upgrades, yes, but not random stats.
---
Almost like you can epic mount up, and run away....
---
For the people that are afraid to start on the same server as us, we will limit the Norwegian talking to the Norwegian guilds, so the Generel chat etc will still be in English.
---
Have you considered just moving your PC set up into the bathroom and just sitting on the toilet?
---
How is what they currently have a bad plan? No one can predict the future, what we can do is look at current data and trends and make a well thought out prediction of what will happen and how to best prepare.
---
If you take all options into consideration than the current plan they have in place is by far the best because the pros outweigh the cons. 
---
So what if a few servers don't ever die down? Then once they remove layering there will be queue times and Blizzard will probably offer free server transfers off of that server, they have done this in the past. This gives players the option to either wait in queue or go to an entire new community, but the choice is theirs.
---
If they were to not have layering and server populations die, then you have completely empty servers and Blizzard is forced to merge servers. This option does not even give the player the choice to server transfer, they are basically in a position where they have to leave the server they are currently on because there are not enough people playing on it to maintain a healthy community.
---
Citizenship =/= residency. About 10% of our population (~30 million) are legal non-citizens able to study, work, drive, and receive all protections and rights under our laws. Even more are illegal non-citizens that still receive most if not all of those benefits.
---
that Mage was litterally casting fireballs at the Infernal. What a noob
---
Does not affect leveling since, afaik, threat from Torment is not quantified by any threat meters.
---
"The original *Bloodscalp server blade server blade* recently sold for almost 4 thousand dollars on Ebay."
---
I’ll be doing the same man. It’s a solid idea!
---
We’re leaning alliance, but nothing is for sure yet. Which is why I was kind of looking at shaman as a possibility. If I tell them that shaman would be a better option for us to have, switching wouldn’t be an issue.
---
^ if you're NA
---
For EU it's Wednesday/Thursday.
---
That is actually awesome. Did they sell the hardware for all the original servers like that?

So you’re telling me I can’t have 2 of the same item and one have different secondary stats?

Familiar maxim-  "the best time to find a job is while you still have one".
---
They have spoken time and again how they are going into launch with only a few servers but with many more on standby in case things get out of hand.
---
Honestly, I see them opening up new servers for transfers from grossly over-populated servers BEFORE phase 1 is over, since this solves every issue you could think of.

Okay, progressive item availability then?

Not that many Cable jumpers on release though and even then it's not necessary a high chance.

Think the census numbers here are at all indicative of the player base as a whole, or just of Reddit? I remember LFG in cities being pretty bad if you needed a healer or tank back in Vanilla. None of my friends want to play a healer so I might step up to do it, but I also want to do a rogue as well. Might go that route if as many people play healers as say they're going to. Can't really remember a single MMO where 1/3rd of the population was healers, to be frank.

I mean tanks will always be desired, people won't be too picky anyways plus I'm pretty sure nelfs are actually a pretty good choice for tanks. [here's a redditor who did a good write up on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9glow9/night_elf_vs_human_for_warrior_tank/e661g9z/) so you don't have to worry *too* much.
---
However if you plan to do anything other than main tank human is better... And also don't forget that humans have diplomacy and 10% +rep is huge in a game that's very grindy and rep really matters. 
---
Basically if you're sure all you'll do is tank and you'll probably be main tank go for it, but if you're not go human. T3 is a long ways away and you'll need to be hardcore to get it so may as well pick the most optimal race.

It’s really easy to tell he talks about pets tied to $$$ instead of pets tied to .. playing the game.
---
I get your point, but to be fair, Enh shamans kinda get priority on Sulfuras. 
---
Most of them will be Nightfall bots, so giving them a status weapon is a form of "appreciation". Same with Ret paladins. 
---
It's not that they're good, it's just that no other class/spec cares about Sulfuras.
---
Also NE have easy access to the best early pet, the owl in teldrassil, just make sure you get a vulture in westfall so you can teach the owl screech.

What about a safe space for Atheists?

A safe space for good boi Christians?

Dwarf all day. I personally like NE, but a fully geared dwarf looks so bad ass!
---
I am disapoint!
---
Whoop there it is!
---
If there's a Stranglethorn Vale pvp server I bet it will be the most popular choice
---
EITHER. Unlike trolls who have the +bow skill there isnt a clear winner. Dwarf is arguably better for PvP because stone form makes you more resistant to rogue ganking. It also has some use in getting poisons off I'm ZG. There are almost NO GUNS to take advantage of that would make the +gun skill mentionable.
---
Night elf has shadow meld. Shadow meld in vanilla cannot be used in combat so there isnt an option to set traps mid combat. There nature racial isnt much either except in AQ but even then....
---
Personally, I would go dwarf. The mount is more unique and the bow animation is acceptable. Stone form is sexy as hell and I wouldn't want to be another wannabe legolas
---
I get an error about no realms being available, but I can start the game through the client.
---
The only people who will regret rushing the 60 will be those who suddenly feel burned out, and they will not come here to tell everyone they regret it because now they are burned out, they will quietly fade away

Now I’m assuming you just don’t know how to communicate clearly. This is a pointless discussion, you are throwing out bs hypothetical examples of you chasing down people on the same speed mount and yet you catch them. Good talk, I’m done.

Your privilege, in this context, is your IRL status as a straight (presumably) white (presumably) male who doesn't need to worry about having an environment you enjoy ruined by other players denigrating your existence or making you the butt of jokes or constant abuse. You can happily join any server and not give a second thought to whether or not you will be abused specifically because of who you are instead of how you play.
---
You're correct to say that nobody needs to know anything about your sexuality, and an LGBT+ player is under no obligation to disclose that in-game, of course - but why should they have to keep a part of their identity secret, simply to share a space with other gamers?
---
By identifying a server where that community can congregate, they increase the chances of playing with others who won't engage in abuse or homophobic banter, and can act to report/ignore trolls that do.
---
This was super useful and answered all my questions I had to roll a warrior. 
---
Do you have a talent tree or leveling guide for what to spec as you're leveling to follow?
---
I would look at MadSeasonShow’s introductions.  Flavorful and informative.  I believe it could work for noobs.
---
I got to 45 on Lights Hope in about 3.5 days played. Nothing crazy or anything just enjoying the world and leveling as a warrior.
---
Pretty common. Just bring a Druid.
---
4 rogues is pretty overkill tbh. Druid+rogue can kill most 5 man bosses, assuming there is not unavoidable trash.

Corsair Scimitar Pro is by no means perfect but probably my pick of the bunch available right now.  The software/macro button assigning is not straight forward, but you eventually learn to work with its quirks. The shape is decent, along with movable button grid/large distinctive buttons being the big drawcards for me. Only other annoyance is the textured rubber grip on the outer edge is difficult to keep clean. No reliability problems with the two I have on separate PC's, one is \~2 years old.  
---
Actually miss my old Saitek/Mad Catz MM07's, ended up going through 3 of them as they're insanely unreliable! Their thumb button layout was so unique and easy to ingrain in muscle memory though, and also loved how flat a mouse they were.  
---
Original Razer Naga, and Logi G600 I've also owned, but the buttons always seemed too finicky and small, I'd find myself more often hitting the wrong button.  
---
Had the Roccat Nyth for a month, at first was so hyped on the idea of 3d printing buttons, but quickly realised you didn't have a chance making buttons on your home 3d printer, or designing your own buttons without being a 3d design pro since it was on such a small and accurate scale. So using the Shapeways (iirc) printing service and their pre-designed buttons from the store was the only real option. Lame. The whole thing was also just so damn big it handled like a boat, and I really hated the thumb resting position/macro key grid location. Just an all up weird feeling mouse to me.  
---
Used the Steelseries rival 500 for a couple of months at one stage too, shape was okay-ish, but for my hand the thumb reach on some the macro buttons was difficult in the heat of play, a huge problem because I was already sacrificing thumb buttons compared to other "grid" mice.

* Territory system is broken when a 30 man guild can hold more terries than a 3000 man alliance.

Three of my roommates.  It's ETSY and Zulily instead.

16 mins EST or PDT?

Thanks for the input. I will put one talent point on each school of talents so I get the 2% and seek after an equipped 1%.
---
Appreciate it!
---
There's a couple clothes lines to the left of my desk I pin them up on. Better than just tossing them over my shoulder like I did during WOTLK launch
---
Work that morning then come home and try it out :) maybe try for level 10 on a few classes
---
Possibly.
---
No pants, hot pockets, energy drinks, a piss bucket and poop sock
---
I'm ready
---
Anyone just want to suicide run to Booty Bay and party?
---
It's just a stress test, chill

Yes. Approximately five billion people will record the first 10 minutes. Because twitch is not a new thing at this point.
---
I think the only rules enforced by blizzard are the naming rules. The idea is that you are on a server with other like minded players, but not everyone will want to be in character all the time so blizzard let's the player base make their own standards. A lot of guilds on RP servers require you to be in character in any public chat as long as you're logged on, some only say in character in g chat, some only for doing guild functions, and some guilds don't have any in character rules.
---
I see someone doesnt like educating themselves ;) Cya
---
I’ll be drinking on the beach and come home with food to play at 6 when the realm launches.
---
Thexthethex
---
This has literally happened in previous expansions, they offer you the option to transfer off the server or you can stay and wait in queue. This is the perfect solution to a potential problem.
---
The inverse problem is if they do not have layering and they release a ton of servers and then if people do in fact quit like Blizzard is predicting, you are left with empty servers and Blizzard is basically forced to merge servers which worse for players because they don't really have any say in the matter.
---
Better to happen now than on release day
---
if someone paws your thigh you MUST moan ( and yeah people get salty and mass report non-rp names)
---
Where did you get this? I want one!
---
I plan all my shit breaks during flights and long, straight auto runs. If I die while running... oh well, shit happens.
---
Shh. There's dozens of us.
---
In the top right it lets you toggle which version you’re installing the mods for based on where you installed the main game
---
Turns out the 2 test are US servers. guess oce better go fuck themselves.
---
5/7 literal shitpost
---
What are the names of the test servers? They're probably NA or EU. NA servers are Stalagg and Barov
---
I keep a smart microwave next to my computer with a macro to set the time.
---
servers still down REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
thats for the main game mate. you cant get on the stress test
---
GRAB it like a *************
---
Has anyone told you that you’re gorgeous ? If not we’ll at least you heard it from me.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I don't see the Classic WoW client... is it one and the same with the regular WoW client?
---
It would be strange to have to download the ginormous regular WoW client just to play Classic...
---
Ironic, he could test the stress but could not control his own.
---
I hope they only do neutral zones as realm names. If theres an Elwynn or Stormwind realm it will be a 90/10 alliance/horde ratio. Same for horde zones.
---
Thanks. Think I will do that then. Just feels better not having money drawn from my card automatically.
---
we’ve been cheated
---
IT'S BEEN 1 MINUTE BLIZZ WHAT GIVES ^^^/s
---
Someone in yet?
---
It wont let you connect. 
---
Or It will let you create a character but not log in.
---
For retail, you can log all the way in to the character select. When you choose a character it then yells at you for not having a sub. 
---
Wonder if its the same here
---
Haha that makes more sense
---
Offline for everyone?
---
Same, I'm wondering if the servers will just stay grey for us
---
Troll or dumb either way no need to respond to these idiots
---
Weird Thex but okay
---
Figuratively unplayable
---
This. Is. AWESOME.
---
Just fyi. The stress test is running for a day. You dont just have the 2 hours to get your addons running and config'd. 
---
I updated my mods from the last stress test last night. I'll be hopping on the stress server after work in a few hours to see if anything needs to be reconfigured.
---
2:01 and servers are still down, 0/10, game is literally unplayable
---
It's a trap!
---
Still offline
---
twitch is lame
---
Kultakunnassa tavataan!
---
How does the poop sock work again
---
Don't use the name you plan to use...I may steal it.  Names are hard.
---
yep
---
yup
---
Its pretty easy to get banned on an rp server. I can see actual gtarp rpers going there but not tourists like soda.
---
It's 401 and servers are not up. rude.
---
Go to twitch. There will be thousands of people streaming it and you can watch most of their vods afterwards
---
Plus this is the time to test this sort of thing so you’ll know for sure on the real launch!
---
In my guild the only class thats full is rogues and we have 3 out of the 10 healers we are looking for. I'm pretty sure reddit poll numbers are not generalizable.
---
is this an open stress test?
---
2 for United States also
---
WHAT THE HELL
---
Having heart palpitations here blizz!!! COME ON
---
When you try to retrieve character list afaik.
---
Offline, Reeeeeeeeeeeee
---
scammed
---
\#nochanges
---
Do we need to restart the game or can we wait in server list?
---
Blizzard you lied!! 2 minutes now, still can't get in!!! (lol)
---
LET ME IN!!!!
---
Server where are you
---
should we wait on the loading screen or reload?!?!
---
edit: wait on the realm selection list

---
as long as you have sub yes
---
Stress test delayed indefinitely.
---
Its 2:01 and i cant get in...this is terrible and the game is terrible! /s
---
What names ?
---
There isn't enough agi to make it worth. Your agi with that gear is about 250 I'm guessing? And I don't know how you're losing crit, that's the highest crit spec you can get. But you're still no where near crit soft cap with that gear even with world buffs.
---
OMG ITS NOT UP, WHAT AM I PAYING FOR??????
---
.................obligatory /s because its the internet
---
I always learn all skills lol
---
Yes, for subbed accounts

Refresh again

Should be able to wait in Realm Selection screen.

---
WTF servers are offline. This game is an absolute disaster! /s
---
:02 blizzard wtf everybody unsub
---
They really thexed this stress test up.
---
Pfff.. Rogues!
---
Will they turn online while you have the server window open? Or do you have to close and reopen?
---
The game which comes out in 3 weeks, they said they'd announce servers closer to the character reserve date, just be patient.
---
20:02 STILL OFFLINE
---
riot?
---
2 minutes have past no servers, unacceptable :)
---
it will turn green when it's up
---
I am stressing out about this stress test.
---
Come on yaaaa sea wrecks, there's knife work needs doing ere!
---
top kek.
---
Now this is the real classic experience.  Waiting
---
OPEN ZE GATES
---
I’ll be sleeping until about 2 hours before launch so I can wake up, shower, make coffee, and get ready to sit down with my piss jug for a solid 4 days of no-lifing Classic.
---
Just throwing in my two cents- I have a first generation Razer Naga Epic, which I have used as my exclusive daily driver for six straight years now, and it literally has no issues to speak of. I lost the wireless receiver in a move, so it’s been exclusively wired since 2015, but the Wireless is never what anyone complains about anyways.
---
You could also just buy a month of game time from the store for the same price so you can't forget to cancel the sub.

---
What server-area are you connecting to?
---
yeah it does show me that a little after the servers actually went up. Are they allready not sure about the servers haha
---
I also still see offline - I'm in the US. The Realm Selection window has two tabs - "Oceanic" and "Test". All three servers show offline.
---
yes, you need to download the client.
---
1500 queue club
---
only /coolboys/ allowed!
---
Although past game launches tought me, that it is impossible to play something "new" on launch (or pre-launch in this case) ... but I was hopeful...
---
Don't worry though, official launch will also bring servers to their knees.
---
It gives me the "need active subscription" error
---
Same bruh
---
Locked 😭
---
I can get to the realm selection screen and see the locked status. Don't have an active sub though.
---
Let us in, LET US IIINNNNN!
---
- All EU players rn
---
lmao. 20:03 roughly, servers was both offline for me in eu. 6 past I try again and locked xD. RIP  
---
Wonder if blizz is shitting their pants now, about too few servers for launch lol
---
ah i see
---
Second Class Citizens from the EU once again not allowed in yet.
---
I CANT JOIN REALM. OMG
---
Does the stress test require active game time? If so that is insane.
---
will characters be saved for launch?
---
working on NA. its a mad house right now. In a group of 5 and we cant get anything lol
---
I would throw gold at this GOAT shitpost if I had any
---
My desk is right next to bathroom, go me!
---
Great way to expect how the game is going to possibly launch.
---
Position in Queue: 6002.
---
August 27th?
---
queue in EU counting down now, was 252 now 229
---
so I should be able to select an server and get auto logged in? or do I need to know some credentials?
---
no, they want as many people as possible on one server to 'Stress Test'
---
Yes all active WoW subs have access to this stress test. Also happy cake day!
---
&gt;I'm guessing they want max stress for this test.
---
Can't really **max** stress something if you block 95% of people from joining.
---
The pre register. Will that be done through the client or website?
---
That's the goal of a Stress test.
---
Can we get past 6500?
---
Cause you need an active sub
---
Same here, locked, saw the servers full for a while but was stuck in logging in
---
nopers
---
is there anyone in here who actually gets to play?
---
Queue 3200
---
Yeah, thought it over. It is a stresstest after all.
---
same :(
---
No way haha unless everyone was spamming it as it came up
---
Of course not.
---
It's a stress test, they want the servers to be stressed
---
yeah me too, lol seems like it was a bit too much for their servers, does not look that well as a final stress test
---
EU
---
This is quite a popular opinion. And I'm starting to agree with it. I think they're underestimating the classic fanbase.
---
&gt;active
---
Same here. Have two subbed accounts, both get the same error.
---
STFU
---
it's just luck
---
Everyone is having that.
---
just log in and choose a server
---
No ya dingus they're *stress testing* meaning they limited server choices to artificially increase stress on the log in servers.
---
Then watch youtube live, or mixer, or the youtube vods when they upload?
---
What sort of recording do you think the guy was asking for? Do you imagine he wanted us to mail him a camcorder video? Vimeo? Facebook live?
---
They got instantly locked I think.
---
I'm under more stress than their servers right now...
---
This is the kind of statement that makes me happy. Just a bunch of dudes being dudes, I’ll see you on the battlefield my friend piss jug in hand.
---
No.
---
In my game it says "population: locked". LOL
---
yes it does.
---
Post a video.
---
That defeats the point of a stress test
---
Currently 1200 in line and it’s going down very slowly!
---
Yeah they should probably open some test servers to gauge the demand for classic
---
Position in Queue: You're fucked lol
---
EU players are in. Locked means the queue is full. So your one step away from being in a queue of 5k :)
---
I'm stuckat character creation, nothing happens when I accept my charchter. any advice?
---
I just went for Oceanic because US seems stressed enough
---
I was stuck in that for a few mins then the queue popped up
---
I really likes It, but why forseken drink and eat? Aren't udead? This Is not a critic to the art, that Is based on WoW, where forseken drink and eat, but there Is a lore explenation to the forseken's strange behevior as undead?
---
You are low effort!
---
Bro... what do you think the point of a stress test is?
---
'Stress test'
---
Do you think they will be on reddiT?
---
They are not "locked" as in locked, they are full/overloaded, some people are playing (some in my guild got in).
---
I think it's safe to assume, the servers are stressed this time ;)
---
Edit: Im 10512 in queue, layers works well, lololol.  
---
Edit: 7237, 7min estimated.
---
If true that's lame. Oh well
---
I doubt people who are in are on reddit. Know a few guildies who are in.
---
Lol my server list still shows offline on EU.
---
I would think that they are busy playing and not on reddit, my two cents
---
I was spamming the shit out of it too haha, I didn't even get put in a queue, just instantly DC'd and now I can't even click the server as both are locked :c
---
Same, haven't see them full yet (Europe).
---
Love the vanilla cinematic, but the voice overs take the TBC and WotLK ones to another level.
---
I'm in!!
---
I'm in queu in Thandol Span, really smooth to be fair
---
They overestimated the intelligence of some people in the classic community.
---
Houston we have a problem.
---
It makes so much more sense to just have one of those portable jons for camping right beside you and just pop over on that when the time is right. It has a sealed lid and a bag and everything for disposal, plus you won't be sitting in your own shit.
---
Dude, you are stress testing it!  You're a part of it
---
its like every greater patch, or release from Blizzard
---
It's a stress test. They are not worried about supporting everyone. They are trying to determine various server settings and limits. They can do this monitoring and screwing with 2 servers. I've never actually made it into the game on the other stress tests. It usually quiets down later after the 2 hours and then can make it in. I'm at work right now., so not getting to try this one in the initial 2 hours.
---
If I want to be a good community member/tester, what actually needs testing?
---
Never played classic wow before, im killing wolves klebolds but nothing is going towards my quest progression, is this shit broken?
---
elwynn forest general is nothing but  INV TO ASMONGOLD LAYER PLZ spam
---
Is the client that will be used tonight available now? Or have we been getting it through retail updates?
---
You could check this video: https://youtu.be/gcFc05av_W0
---
Yeah, at the end of the day, this is a test, not a finished product.
---
A bit cheeky of them to require you to pay to help them test it through.
---
My bet is this lack of capacity is entirely on purpose. Building capacity to handle that large of a push is extremely expensive, and if launch is completely smooth and we don't push their servers capcaity to the limit, they've spent way more money in preperation than they need to.
---
They're probably trying to find that sweet middleground where it's barely enough to run smooth 6-12 hrs into launch. Sucks for the players, but Blizzard is a business.
---
Ya, made it to TB but can't interact with any npcs... Still amazing :D
---
I can’t even get into a queue lol
---
You got to make sacrifices and work hard if you want to be the best. I give him mad respect, I might do the same.
---
Just got logged into Swamp of Sorrows server? I'm like the only one here? The other two are down lol
---
I will forever love these meme. Cannot get enough.
---
also called popup respawn when a population in a given chunk of the game gets culled.
---
grind routes usually prioritized small areas whereby you knew you could force this to trigger like the howling vale in ashenvale. You could invade that place with 40 mages and spam arcane explosions and you would still be unable to clear the area of all worgens

Sure, but where other than starting areas, and possibly AQ opening, will there ever be that many players killing the same mobs at the same time?

Yeah but I can’t seem to find a download button?

I was 2000th in queue and now 1500 after a few minutes. Seems to be going down, not sure if they are opening capacity or people are DCing.
---
BY THE LIGHT, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THERE
---
Uh, Holy Cleansing
---
I wonder why is there even queues? Isn't the server supposed to just fire up more layers? Like on-demand?
---
Why would it be any good on a feral druid?  They don't proc weapon procs because they aren't hitting with their weapon. Their damage isn't based on weapon damage and the stats on rag aren't anything to write home about.

Im playing classic this time around. But after naxx, if there isnt an improved (QOL and bug smashing) classic, or CTBC, I wont stay subbed.

In which region are you playing? I you are EU, I can try to get the name as well and I can pass it to you if I get it by accident (as it's extremely low chance that someone won't ninja it).

9,999 people in goldshire
---
1 horde player.
---
Yes, and they're both Locked right now. And more aren't opening it seems.
---
They used AWS for last 2 expac launches, I'm willing to bet they will for Classic so they can hard cap the amount of money they spend if they want too. 
---
Gone are the days of buying hardware well in advance and guessing demand/need. Cloud tech expands and lowers as needed in seconds new instances and servers spin up.
---
There's a limit to how many log in requests it can take at once.
---
It turns out 20k is that limit.
---
It's possible you're both right.
---
Depends. Imo, bugs that add gameplay should stay, while those that remove gameplay should be fixed.
---
Okay Mike Tyson, have you know I was doing the Thex then, not talking about it.
---
Yeah the first letter is auto capitalized and is the only letter that can be capitalized.
---
They are reducing the number of layers and capacity to test other systems to begin with.
---
need active account
---
Open to everyone subbed
---
Interesting to note if you try to launch retail while you're logged into classic you'll get DCd, and I'm assuming vice versa too. Was actually logged in on EU as well :(
---
We’re fucked m8. I won’t be testing any stress :(

EU servers are locked for me, when i try and connect it brings me to the old login screen and when i login with my blizz account it says the account doesn't exist. anyone else getting this?

I would imagine they have an idea of how may layers they want to create per server, filling one server with 50k players will never lead to a usable server in the long run, it will always be massively overpopulated.
---
Oh didnt knew they cant proc weapon effects.
---
Would be pretty good with their fast attackspeed.

Who takes photos of their screen in 2019? Just hit prtscreen and hit Ctrl + V in paint, crop it and save. Takes less than 10 seconds with practise. Then you have a much better picture.
---
But yeah, hyyype, I'm #6755 in queue for the last 10 minutes.
---
Yep. This isn't good news at all. Plus their plan also involves opening more servers when one fills up its layers (so a fixed amount of layers)... so I don't see how on the final stress test, this close to launch, both the servers, layers and login servers are choking. Or how 2-3 servers for a global stress test is a good idea.

It's a stress test allright. Stress enducing.
---
Where is the quote from?
---
Threat meters while leveling is pretty irrelevant. People are all at different levels and people will be varying in skill and gear so threat will get ripped often. It’s much less coordinated than a raid. You can get a threat meter if u want but i guarantee you’ll find yourself barely looking at it in your dungeons
---
God damn I love this sub
---
Just wait 2 hours for the initial testing to end.
---
&gt;You're correct to say that nobody needs to know anything about your sexuality, and an LGBT+ player is under no obligation to disclose that in-game, of course - but why should they have to keep a part of their identity secret, simply to share a space with other gamers?
---
I'll bite the other way - why should being LGBT+ be a part of your identity? It's 2019 people, we can look past petty differences like race, religion or sexuality. We're all human, let's just be nice to each other.
---
*What if I bring my desk to the bathroom and use the toilet as my gaming chair?*
---
same here.  Keep in mind some mod makers have not made classic versions of their mod
---
lol
---
Do you need to put them in the _Classic_ folder structure?
---
I started as 11k in que, estimated time 11 min. I’m now 6710 in que, estimated time 16 min.
---
Edit: I’m obviously trapped in a space-time vortex.
---
Wait in the realmlist for 3mins then try again, worked for me
---
Phone authenticator? Are you pressing the ”enter code manually” in the app?
---
&lt; 1 min
---
Any second now!!!!
---
I'm going to be in San Francisco after a Napa weekend, enjoying a baseball game with the wife and flying home the next day. Classic isn't a sprint, it's a marathon and I'm in no rush to get started on the good times.
---
Your server queue tells you there are a half a million people in it?
---
His bum
---
Man I wish I had been able to snag gorgannash US or dragonmaw US before they sold. Such a piece of history.
---
Quit your whining, and be persistent in trying to log in.
---
Is there something like this for warrior?
---
Gotta create drama to prove his point
---
No, you can’t. It’s a stress test
---
Skip stuff like eagle eye, beast lore (plenty of online archives for spells ranks), multi shot ranks (rank 1 scales and costs less mana), wing clip ranks (rank 1 is pretty effective) etc and also skipping some resistance spells from the pet trainer is fine as well. You can also skip on most tracking but I recommend picking up humanoid and beast tracking in the very lease, also Track Hidden can be very helpful when fighting rogues and druids.
---
same, wtf.
---
You can stress.
---
I believe the name grief would be okay. It doesn't appear (to me, at least) to violate any of the three rules in the blizzard post that I linked.

It might be somewhat outdated. A lot of addons are just on curse now. Set the game version to 1.13

Got into a queue now of a bit more than 10k ppl however the estimated time is over 20 mins

I was in queue as 10k or something then decided to try the PVE realm for shorter queue. Now I am getting constantky denied a new position in queue. Feels bad.
---
Servers locked, no way to get in
---
A little insulting to assume this is a troll. This guy obviously put a lot of effort in to this to help other speedlevelers.
---
He's probably not getting the tags.
---
Nothing against streamers, but I learned something watching this launch.  No way in F am I going near a server with a streamer.  Ruined.
---
I can’t even get into queue :( just says logging into game server for me then it disconnects

The servers are being torn to shreds right now with so many people trying to get in. That's kind of the point of a stress test. Launch day probably won't be that different too, there's only so much that can be done to stop what's essentially a benevolent DDOS attack.

Keep trying to login, I got in after 20 tries

Not generating a code meaning you are waiting for "Approve" "Deny" 4 digit code? If that's the case, switch to "enter code manually" and enter that 8 digit code.

---
How are there a ton of people at level 15 already?

Over reacting much? It's a stress test where they are testing a massive amount of people logging into a couple servers. They aren't going to have 10+ realms to begin or the servers wouldn't be nearly stressed enough..

Understood your willingness to sacrifice your own enjoyment to spend time with your wife is admirable. I am however on the opposite thinking , I will be disgusting, grotesque , absolutely worthless.
---
Nor do you want to now. Might have to have an original thought if you did. Eh i'll stop wasting time, you can't make yourself do it.
---
Stress tests can and do have different objectives. The first stress test (Stress Test 1) was chokepointing everyone to 1 server with limited login capabilities (20k at a time). It is why the level cap was 5. It quickly became locked and people spent 3-4 hours just trying to login, creating a character, and trying to enter world with that character.
---
Stress test 2 was different,
---
This final one, as they say in their Blue Post, is meant to observe what players do between levels 1-20. They specify this. To not login isn't good news for anyone, assuming their objectives haven't changed from 1 hour ago.
---
Does this make sense to you?
---
Fuck wearing ties every day I'm glad I get to be comfortable. But as a SE I am taking PTO regardless, so yes, we are taking PTO to play.

I get thrown to logon screen and states can't find account wow51900319...retail loads in fine though
---
It actually means that the population is at maximum.
---
Unlike the original WoW launch, they have plenty of time between now and release to aquire and spin up new servers to meet the demand.  
---
Also, stop with the artificial drama. We have no idea how many are trying to log in now.
---
Thank god for internet anonymity amirite?
---
It's a fucking stress test, it's not supposed to be enjoyable.
---
You have to tag the mobs before anyone else to get credit. I'm guessing you are not able to do that due to the thousands of players in the starting zones.
---
It's just a random number he pulled out of his ass.

Been in que for 30+ minutes. Gone from a position of 9800ish to 6200ish. Keeps flicking between 16/17 mins ETA. 
---
Not complaining,just adding to the discussion :)
---
im not saying that he is right but many people like me don't even get to the queue. I was in the game before but then i relogged and now i cant even get to a queue.
---
It was very difficult not to delete this as aid to the horde.
---
This is so awesome! Look the art style. Any plans to make an alliance poster in the same style?
---
How? Can you specify?
---
*Huch, seid Ihr aber groß!*
---
Nope you’re locked out forever
---
Yeah I did, there’s four options there and I’m wondering which is the best.
---
on EU there isnt even a queue -.-
---
&gt; Classic &gt; Interface &gt;  Addons &gt; actual addons with "-master" removed
---
For example
---
\_classic\_\\Interface\\AddOns\\QuestieDev and under this folder should be .toc and other files.
---
I feel like such a fool...that's how we used to do it. Haha, thanks man. It is still disconnecting me but I think because the servers are locked. Authenticator working as intended....
---
15 minutes... for the last 45 minutes. At least I've got time to put away my folded clothes so that's a plus?
---
What happened?
---
honestly don’t be so quick to judge. I admire this guy’s dedication to being number one. Some people are willing to make sacrifices to compete, get off your high horse.

I lol'd irl. I had a cat during vanilla that puked in my CRT monitor... I was standing in Wetlands and afk'd a bit and just when I got back in the room she threw up and the screen immediately died and there was smoke coming out from it. 
---
That was when I got my first LCD screen. :/
---
Por que?
---
Sadly such fun things won't happen anymore. everything is patched. wish i was there though.
---
So there’s multiple server blades for 1 server ? How can one be sold for 4 thousand and you have no association with it.
---
Are you sure yours is real?
---
This is a stress test, not a beta test. That being said, if you notice a bug, report it. The main purpose of this is being online.
---
/invite "friendname" not working?
---
what? screenshot please
---
doesn't matter, click on it anyway and u might get into Q, I did and now I'm from 8k down to 2k
---
Yeah there is lol
---
Try using your Data to login. 
---
I couldnt log from bnet Launcher, but typing my Mail and password helped.

Are you joking? There's easily 1 billion players trying to login, and that's just from EU!
---
I will tell you what I told the other guy, and maybe you should think this through.

---
I tried 30 minutes later and lo and behold, I'm 10k in queue now down from 12k.
---
It DCd me too, keep closing the game and restarting it. Don't close down bnet though no need.
---
Yea i logged in 30 minutes ago and played for 5, I just tried logging in now and zero q, just logged in immediately
---
I went from 7934 to 10451 now....
---
FML.
---
Blizzard wanted everyone to flood their servers for the first few hours.
---
&gt;All servers are locked due to being full.
---
Mission successful!
---
I'm at 8k right now, started at 12k....
---
This is absolutely stunning. Is this a high enough resolution that I can print it off and put it on my desk?
---
It's the same exact client, but k buddy.
---
good luck to everyone with your queues. Game actually ran smoothly when I was playing which was cool. Hopefully with more realms we will have a good launch
---
Quite the stress test they have going on, if they are capping the players at mid day on a Thursday :/
---
Do you guys not have wait what.
---
What makes you think Classic HAS a marketing team? They've done no marketing whatsoever and you shouldn't sit there and think a very specific targeted advert about a news article counts as anything.
---
It's facebook mumsie pyramid scheme level marketing it's just bull.
---
You have no comparison to make to argue the "better than blizzards" comment do you? so why say it?
---
With what gaming has become, you all think this is a shitpost...
---
If only you really know how bad things were...
---
Are you for real? Lmao
---
Aight thank you, I will keep trying.
---
Just wanted to see if my PC can still handle WoW, might be pretty much the same setup I had back in Vanilla :)
---
Oh I don't think the content is going to be worth your time, and didn't mean to come across that way. I just meant at the very least you will see in about 10 seconds if it is worth your time or not and can bail right away.
---
Guess I don't feel too bad I'm at work.
---
Someone ass pulls or the tanks chain pulls or someone takes aggro and you end up spending more mana than expected. You do go OOM and you do need to rest.
---
No one in EU who wasn't there in the first 3 minutes can get into queue. 99% of players cannot get into queue servers just show as locked and it dc's you trying to log in. Just check forums literally thousands of posts already

Stupid question for someone who has no idea how technology works: can you so something with this? Like set up private servers or stuff? Pls explain to me like I‘m 5
---
This right here is why I'll never be the best at anything. There are some psychotic dedicated people out there.
---
Just a heads up if you’re looking at this. Trolls can’t be warlocks as stated in the thread.
---
You should thank your cat for giving you the kick up the backside to upgrade to an LCD :P
---
Is this really what we can expect on launch? Not even being able to get into a server select screen, nevermind a queue?
---
Absolutely beautiful!
---
I have the HORDE version.
---
IT IS MUCH BETTER!
---
FOR THE HORDE!!.!.!!.!. !!
---
Yeah I had a bad analogy, I agree with your take on it.
---
Really seems pointless when theres 20 others just trying to tag it
---
The Black Death killed 25 million Europeans.  I seriously doubt that the survivors of that tragedy are worried about a stress test for a video game.
---
Yeah, RP are much more willing to move to the active community because that’s what they play for. One RP will emerge as the big one, and 85% of RPers will be there
---
Sell*
---
Make sure to close the window if you aren't able to even get on queue. I experienced an update that finally got me in line
---
**To all the people who cannot log in:**
---
Steps -
---
1. Log in to your account.
---
2. Enter the authenticator code (if you have one attached). The one you need is the 8-digit one.
---
3. Select the server and try to log in. Disregard the "locked" status.
---
4. Keep waiting at the pop-up "Logging in the server...."
---
5. If you don't get a message that you are disconnected, you will eventually get "In queue" message.
---
**IF you constantly try to relog, you will waste time - so patience is a virtue.**
---
Ok they just opened 2 new servers and I was able to get in with low pop...
---
Thanks for your help!
---
Better yet, just dismiss them.  Seriously.
---
Two more servers for EU. I'm in!

---
Is there anyone who has a list of/knows which servers they will be on?
---
joined 45 min ago into a 6.9k queue, now at 2.5k...
---
thank god i didnt relog to "see if more servers are coming" xD
---
Rekt [ X ]       Not Rekt [   ]
---
You DID complete the Queuefinder Part II achievement first, right?
---
But how many hours =)
---
I think I will just time my poos when I need to go back to the trainers.  I plan on streaming my race, although as a paladin I doubt I'll get world first but I'll be the first pally that's for sure.
---
Plan is to play for the first 40 hours or so straight through and then like 20 hours a day after that for 4 days.  Should be 60 by then.
---
I only got 2
---
I'm doing this on the race to 15.
---
Many bugs that even were fixed later on will be fixed from the start, so just because something wasnt fixed before 1.14 does not mean it will work on the 1.13 server.
---
It seemed to be working in the beta no matter the distance. I read it as you will no longer be able to cast it beyond 100 meters.
---
Yes, spec doesn't matter in pre-raid content.
---
All your healers will be shadow priests using healing spells, and all your tanks will be DPS specced warriors throwing on a shield.
---
Hey my old character is inside that!
---
Bad bot. I thought you were learning. I'm disappoint, son.
---
2 NEW SERVERS FOR EUROPE, GO !
---
IM IN LATER BITCHES
---
what happens if i get too close and start attacking with my sword, and i kite away i start bowing again right?
---
edit: wait im dumb i havent played wow for so long, when i move i cant shoot?? so i cant shoot while kiting ?
---
" While soulbound items generally aren’t tradeable among players, there’s a two-hour window from the time an item drops from a raid boss where you can trade it another player in your raid group, provided they were present when the item was acquired. ""
---
I thought they backpedaled this so it only applied to raid epics after a lash back?
---
PvP Server, logged no issue @ all, 20 min que. On Character screen right now. Might roll a filthy Alliance just for the jokes.
---
Edit: Didn't do it, in Durotar killing boars. This is life now.
---
Edit: Many, Many orcs
---
I'm really pretty pissed about having cross realm BGs. It def killed a lot of the BG fun for me. I got rank 9 I believe (Centurion) and learned many of the regular names. Knowing your opposition and being able to make a name for yourself was so much fun and gave more incentive to win those games.
---
I wish we could try out single server BGs and make a switch to cross realm if needed. :(

no.
---
People like this don't actually exist right?
---
Right?
---
Underwhelming. We've seen higher.
---
pumpthosenumbersup.gif
---
This is the kind of quality post that this sub has been sorely lacking.
---
They're phasing in honor system, BGs, and different raids. This is a stupid argument.
---
Great perspective, and the tree shadow ads a real sense of depth beyond what's pictured.
---
Looks like steak is back on the menu boys!!!
---
Thought about it, but I got pulled into 2 big calls to go along with my 4 other meetings. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Took care of that temptation!
---
Literally no one i know IRL
---
I don't know about you, but some of the pets were 'cool' at the time.  Speedy the turtle was one of my favorites.  The one I wanted more than anything was Murky. 
---
# Because. He. Danced.
---
2 more servers on EU side, got straight in!
---
&gt;I read it as you will no longer be able to cast it beyond 100 meters.
---
Everything listed under "Confirmed Fixed" is what the bug was doing. So like the entry that says 
---
&gt;The Hunter's quiver may occasionally appear in the  Hunter's hand instead of the  Hunter's equipped weapon
---
doesn't mean that it was changed so that the quiver will now sometimes appear in your hand instead of your ranged weapon. That's what was happening and now it's fixed. So when they listed 
---
&gt;Eagle Eye and Farsight abilities will fail if targeted on a location that is more than 100 yards from the player
---
it doesn't mean that they changed it to work like that, it means that that's what the bug was doing and now it's been fixed.
---
I'll not strictly follow a leveling guide. I played classic quite extensively, so I should still know what regions are good for what level and will just cruise along on my own speed. I'm working full time, I won't be in the leading group of the server anyways.
---
For my spec, I already checked out a few guides, but really it's quite straightforward. You wanna get down the arms tree as fast as you can to pick up sweeping strikes and mortal strike, when you're there sink the rest into fury. There are few obviously completely useless talents, and a lot of situational choices (PvP server? Improved Hamstring might be worth).
---
2 new realms just opened in EU, so a total of 4 now.
---
this is the stress test, big brain.
---
Hæstkuk
---
Lol wut
---
hey that's what I did but from org
---
&gt; Why would they only give us 2 realms?  
---
Because they are STRESS TESTING.

---
The oldest supported is Intel HD Graphics 4000.
---
So many troll posts today
---
The part where there are only 2 servers. But, it's ok, there are more now lmao
---
We know it ends on Friday.  go see the official blue post announcement soupa
---
Big brain, they said the realms were going to be before the stress test
---
can you think?
---
In such a short time, this post did not end where I expected when I began it.
---
Thanks, I got that.  I may not know how to use it.  I figured the timer would only show up once you start attacking but it's always going for me.  Is there a way to change that?
---
Same here!
---
You're welcome. Exchanges like this are part of what made vanilla so great! For whatever reason, they seemed to stop happening after wrath.
---
Try clicking the spell in spell book.
---
Im in and playing as of 1 minute ago.
---
Yeah, but wouldnt you figure this out in like, oh, say... the first five minutes of playing? Upon launching a new game do people not instinctively use their left and right mouse buttons almost immediately just to see if they serve any function like camera operation?
---
when they make their choices public, they will be on avoidstreamers.com
---
Just use steam link to play while on the toilet with your phone? Go on a flight path?
---
Vanilla wow has a draw timer that only active while standing still. There are two internal timers that only addons can show, based on your range weapon speed. There is a "cooldown" timer, if you will, which triggers after a shot is fired. This cooldown will occur even while moving. The other timer is a "Draw" timer, essentially pulling the string back or the hammer back on the gun. This timer is similar to a small cast timer, and is interrupted and reset upon movement. Ideal way to kite is to shoot, move, stop, shoot, move etc. etc.
---
Hope that helps a little :)
---
I plan on sitting on a Home Depot bucket. When it touches my balls, I’ll know I need to get bitch mummy in here to go dump it in the garden.
---
I never got to experience Emerald Dream in vanilla so I can’t speak to that, but in its current state I feel it’s filled mostly with dudebro PvPers who will sometimes “RP” by walking around godmodding and pretending to be Sergeant-General-Lieutenant-High-King of the Alliance with the power to one-shot any miscreant that gets in their way. Not speaking for everyone on the server but that’s been my experience, at least.
---
Because the second they were created, they got locked.
---
Sounds like an incredibly pointless endeavor when you would drop dead to the shadow bolt volley and you could just use the unkillable mobs by the Dark Portal instead
---
Fun story; me and a friend had a D2 LAN back in 2010. As more or less a check to see that we had the latest version we logged on to bnet, and the latest patch at that point was like 3 or 4 weeks old. Had no idea that the game still got patched back then.
---
He probably makes software for corporations. 
---
You can have a real long update cycle there.
---
I don't see EU servers, only US and OC.  How can I access EU servers?
---
As someone with an OG account, I'm assuming that I will have these pets in Classic tho, correct?
---
I literally quoted what the blue post said for you but I guess you did not understand it. I suppose you are correct since you apparently know a lot about globally launching a video game. The servers being locked are not an issue as they can still collect log in data to estimate numbers better than any stress test before and see how a capped server can function in this stress period. Do you not realize that locking the servers is necessary if you have that many people trying to get on? There would be an even larger queue for people like you to complain about if they didn't do this.
---
Goldshire was for the normies, the really depraved shit happened in the tram tunnels.
---
And they can be hunters. It appears the list just switched out hunter for warlock.
---
Keep trying. I got in after about 10 or so tries.
---
Literal shitpost. Grats op.
---
good thing live isn't like private, it is even more dispersed population.  and that is because they use queues and layers, instead of dynamic respawns and server merges.
---
Just made some new friends for classic. I got right in (Tristfall Glades) and spammed general to make a group and we were all able to get up to lvl 5 in about 45 minutes by getting tags first. 
---
That hour brought back so many memories I can’t wait for launch!!!
---
What does "record your level ups" even mean?
---
Diablo breathes fire and the panda cub sleeps. 
---
Mini zergling was for pleebs tho
---
No, I see US and Oceanic and no EU though.... I would love to see the EU servers instead lol.
---
That's really awesome. Played on Bloodscalp EU for years. Never knew they sold them. Nice!
---
Same. Hoping I can log in without a queue when I come home and play
---
so what you exit and reopen client and hope that you're in queue  ?  i might try the same
---
We're all at some stage of burning out LOL
---
Its not impossible to level without shadowform. Its really not much slower.
---
Shadowform certainly helps at level 40. But you can go into holy and disc and pick up spirit tap in shadow and be fine. Most of your dps as a shadow spec or holy when leveling is swp and wands. 
---
Shadow has more mena efficient dps spells (mind flay) but holy gives you access to meditation earlier and for the entire leveling process (as shadow you repsec at 40 and lose meditation).
---
Regardless of your spec while leveling, healing in dungeons is totally possible. And considering the low dps and mana problems shadow has, regardless of spec, youre most useful as the healer of the group.
---
Yeah, but they'll be tracking logins and playtime. If retail has 2 million players at peak times and classic has 3 million, they'll notice.
---
Guess I missed something, thought NA wasn’t until 3:00 PDT?
---
11/10 with rice
---
Can anyone tell me how the interaction of logging in before servers went live and waiting for them to turn green worked?  Last stress test I needed to relog to see them green, but normally this isnt the case.
---
1 hour and 10 minutes since joining queue, 800ish position now and dropping rapidly (well quicker than it has since I joined). Hope to get on within the next ten minutes. /yawn
---
doesn't matter, I joined a locked realm and it's only a 600ppl queue  
---
edit: nvm, relaunched and 0 queue
---
Haha jeuzz, such a simple fix.  Thanks!!
---
Jeez man, spoilers!
---
I never asserted that? I literally said it was 'a ranged dps spec for super late tiers'.
---
I never said it was the only option. You're the only one stating there's only one choice. I'm not trying to prove a point with numbers anyway, I was asking (nicely in head at least) if you had any good sources I could dig into since you are confidently stating that one is better.
---
Cooking trainer is amazing and useful in SW. Alliance cities are nicer.
---
Jeez bro.. that tape coming off, yikes. Just do what I do and stick your dick in one of those gas siphon tubes straight to the jug.
---
Yeah, once it fails to log you in, launch it up again and click to enter realm.
---
Please make a YouTube video
---
If true, that's bullshit.  Bad, Blizzard, bad!
---
Did they increase the respawn rate of mobs? It seems significantly higher than usual.
---
What server crash stop lying
---
Yes, but people can also be stupid. It’s pretty silly to be on a... say it with me... stress test and wonder why it isn’t working. The point is to literally break it.
---
Are addons disabled during the stress test? I'm not seeing the addon button available at the character selection.
---
Wish it wasnt $30 for a pdf or Id buy it.
---
MOM! BATHROOM!
---
I thought about placing a couple props for my stream like a 2 liter with a bit of darkened lemonade and a sock stuffed with something and tinged brown for effect.
---
Too much?
---
Gfx looks real good. Updated ones?
---
Don't think ret aura and thorns work together (not sure about fire sheild) for being a better aoe tank I'd say druid threat wise until later levels when warrior goes furyprot.warrior would take less damage during aoe tanking tho and can use grenades for extra threat
---
I'm using it for 5 years (with windows 7 skin) and nothing bad has ever happened to me... if you aren't downloading cracked games from shady sites nothing is gonna happen to you anyway... i hate those useless cluttered tiles and adverts in a software I paid for, fuck it
---
This and your other tracks are QUALITY!! Thank you for doing this!  This is so cool how you've done this creating/conversion. I am really looking forward to your future tracks!

Paladins are the best aoe tanks but they don’t have a taunt. Druids are second and warriors are 3rd.
---
Fuck
---
Do you need active game time to participate? I have no game time but I was able to download the game, but I can't select a server. Says I need game time. :(
---
Sitting here waiting for the one or two people that made a Thex for the stress test to post so they can reap that dank karma
---
If you are on a token. Set up a recurring sub with a CC
---
Cancel it tomorrow
---
There's no data on that old server hardware, correct?
---
They used to, I made a warrior named Boneyballs and was messaged by a GM before I even got to my first quest marker that I would have to change my name immediately
---
Probably should hand wash these.
---
Yeah just don’t tell all the players that have been using them for years
---
Husband got in, got a mage, now I am 1190 in the queue and need to rethink my plans of being a mage... Damn it...
---
I will report if I make it, if not, create an effigy of me with wolf pelt.
---
Oof as in "Ouch", as in, that's a tough situation.
---
And when I said PVE server, and then raiding, those were two separate points. As a hunter not wanting to mess with ranged/melee weaving, I wouldn't not suggest a pvp server.
---
I would of loved Dragonmaw US too!
---
The servers automatically updated to green and then we were able to hit connect. Then I stared at a “logging in to game server” screen for about 4-5 minutes, then voila, character creation.
---
Anyone else unable to add a new payment method?
---
I am on a token aswel, and not experiencing this problem.
---
I live in PDT time zone and play on PDT servers and have encountered a few alaskans there. probs best/your only hope
---
Yes, you do.
---
Thorns, ret aura, and fire shield do work together.
---
Now that I finished reading it, I totally agree. I would love to read a similar book about TBC / WotLK

Logging into game server, for the 100th time 😭wtb queue
---
Edit : I had to close classic and update it and now I am in queue let’s gooo
---
He's not making it up. It was fact and a big part of the community lost interest in BGs after crossrealm implementation. BGs were part of a server community and helped build alliances and rivalries.
---
With crossrealm there is no rivalry. You will not learn people's names. You might as well be fighting Horde v Horde. It doesn't really matter as long as it is 10 v 10 or 15 v 15.
---
\u\Hazkem
---
Yes actually, I am logged into the stress test right now and am testing my essential addons, I've been quiet on the front but that's because I had a lot of prework to do. Build a new pc, get a new VR HMD, build two one handed controllers for use with WoW. I'll probably have a post out next week or the week after with more info but I am still doing it and will hopefully be able to use a two pc setup to stream it.
---
My bathroom is in my room and 5 steps away. Will have to limit my self to breaks while on gryphons or waiting for group
---
Had to look up "piles"... you are for real aren't you. This isn't even a joke?
---
Nice find mankirks wife.
---
Right now I’m working on my pedal powered cooling fans. They are like 6 feet tall each and I modified my basement to handle this. I need them bad cause when I WPVP I get so intense and sweaty I can’t hit my keybinds. I used to use rock chalk but then I couldn’t see what the keys were anymore after a while.
---
Can you send me your Linux results as well when done testing?  Also, how the rest was conducted?  I would greatly appreciate it for my data.
---
Then you should go to change your diaper.
---
Ah that's a bummer, but thank you for the response!
---
Using Shadow Meld + Stealth Pet to lay and wait allows for some truly SAVAGE PVP encounters. So NE is my vote.
---
Same here. 1:11 min for me to drive home. I think it will be worst once 5pm start hitting the US
---
The good macros allow you to heal your target if your mouse isnt hovering over something, and/or yourself if you have no target at all
---
you and I play different games then. 
---
OSRS sub is filled with pvp memes and cries anytime pve content gets placed in pvp zones. In retail wow people cry every time one faction has more people in a zone in WM. Even in games built around pvp like archeage was people bitched that they have to go to high risk pvp zones for the best rewards.
---
That was definitely me 15 years ago.
---
Now, the very thought of doing this has given me diabeetus.
---
Can I use the twitch program for addons like I do for BFA?
---
Socialize with your guild, and have them funnel you some green/blues they dont need as leveling. Keeping on top of the gear curve helps. Get some aspirin too and pace yourself lol.
---
Top is the original screenshot after creating my main character (european release day)  
---
Bottom is the recreation in the stress test today
---
I was thinking about going spellpower route, it uses gear most people dont want and judgement set is basically BiS Ive read
---
Yes, in the stress test, there was someone running around with the Diablo pet.
---
Hahah you should have waited for those NPCs to pat back. Still awesome tho. Can't wait till we can all play again.
---
Vanilla was like that in starting zones.
---
That's part of what kicked of my worry; that's the first place I looked.  The clipping is there and very prevalent, but looking at some old screenshots from the era it looks like it was actually working to prevent clipping.
---
I'm wondering if Wowhead's engine might not be correct, which is why I'm trying to memory-mine the older players here who may have had long-haired clothies back in the day.
---
I thought i was alone, it's weird
---
everyone and their grandma knows about this already, but thanks. tons of streamers are not listed there so I have my doubts it will list them all...
---
Yea. Just got a Disconnected from server message after like 1 hour in the queue and I was about ~1000
---
The 2 new realms have shorter queues, I am trying to join Razorfen and started at 1800 and went down to 750 very fast. I recommend ye folks to try the new realms if you get DC!
---
This isn't actually a targeted ad, it would say sponsored or promoted if it was. Just a regular organic post.
---
Source? Kevin Jordan stated on a live stream that spawns were dynamic in vanilla.
---
It’s a display item
---
nah, this just means my layer is dead
---
bnet
---
Pretty sure like game-wide. It’s similar to a Discord-type service. I think you have to be the same faction though. Not sure if it works the same in Classic.
---
##NoChanges?
---
I love your inconsistent scale.
---
Hoping this is a joke
---
There is no way 61% of people who took this survey played on a Vanilla WoW private server before. I don't believe it.
---
A lot of people roll on a RPPVP server because its the best of both worlds. However from my experience most people come here to grief RPers. That was my personal experience having spent a considerable amount of my time on one. The realm I was on back when I played WoW during Cata had a pretty vibrant WPVP scene however there use to be this one guild and another that would go out of their way to just grief any RP event on the Alliance. They would have spies in other guilds on the Alliance and then find out the upcoming events and then crash it.
---
yeah ppl were asking for inv aswell but it was fun to see tho :D
---
The "reason" is that there is going to be a lot of people on launch day. In the past, before layering, the solution might have been to increase the amount of mobs, (which would add strain to the servers alongside the massive amount of people) or increase the rate at which they spawn (which has already been done).  
---
It's temporary. This type of technology is undoubtedly detrimental to the core social aspect of the game, but necessary so you and the 5000 other people in Elwynn Forest can actually make it out of Northshire within a reasonable timespan.
---
Please dont tell me this is turning into am art sub like r/wow
---
Ugh, i could have clicked that so long again and had no idea there was a queue.
---
People can relax a little bit in Desolace; Rexxar isn't aggressive.

There's videos from 2006 of raids on Rexxar where they're buffing up while walking right next to him. He doesn't care.
---
Doody review
---
I'm at work, kid.
---
Man if only it worked like this. Thatd be dope
---
Erm no? No one thinks they want to roll on a streamer server.
---
It would be funny if Asmongold decided this is the server he is going to play on.
---
Energy timer
---
It really isn’t needed anywhere in raids. If a rogue goes hard on a raid boss too soon(as in too soon to blow vanish) it’s better to just stop attacking for a moment than to use the energy for feint. 
---
I’ve used it in dungeons with newbie tanks to make their job easier. 
---
Lastly in PvP if you feint an enemy faction player, by law, they have to stop attacking you.
---
Is there an official place to buy the book? I was looking for it the other day, and the kickstarter page just said it was targeted for release in September '18. The only place I found was Amazon but all it has is one bad picture of a cover.

You are at work so you can post on reddit but you can't type in the search box?  How the fuck does that even make sense?

No shit, if you're arrested or something you're going to be given access to a translator on the phone at least. They aren't just going to throw you away without giving you a chance to speak, same goes for any other first world nation.

Pvp server eller ?
---
Don’t drink caffeine after 3pm
---
Calm down Rosie, you'll get some food for dinner
---
Dude I started wow 2-3 months before  bc, so I didn’t get the full experience but I played bloodscalp ever since! Bloodscalp not and raised all day!!!! Such and epic server to be apart of and I’m so glad I choose that one!
---
Tell him if he keeps his character drunk things look better.
---
Why would shamans get prio on a druid weapon?
---
Lol i dont understand people who use this as a reason. Retail isnt exactly something to marvel at itself in 2019.
---
I think Details! The dps meter addon has a threat module
---
I don't know if it's worth mentioning, but in Burning Crusade, they had a group of players tag a bunch of mobs, and then let one guy tag the whole group and he got a TON of exp. Enough to get him world first 70 in less than 24 hours (If I'm remembering it correctly).
---
Vanilla most likely has the same mechanic because it wasn't abused the way it was until BC.
---

When your ass gets home from work, you can look at the nice big post about hunter macros.

Eastern Kingdom had some pretty open warfare.
---
In Hillsbrad Foothills, you work with the Forsaken to attack the local alliance army and slaughter local townspeople.
---
I'm sure, I was in Orgrimmar and didn't see a single person
---
That was a good read thank you :-)
---
I don't think he made it up but I can guarantee only the hardcore of pvpers enjoyed it more. I think it's great to be able to do a pre-made but having to wait 30+ minutes often way more before getting into a bg sucks a lot and is pretty awful for the opponent if they aren't premades. It sets the system up for failure because getting smashed is considered unfun.
---
Now I heard a lot more complaints, even among the hardcore of this reddit, about the waiting time than I did about the loss of rivalries wich leads me to conclude that yes the pvp scene got shook up and the few who did pvp before disliked it but most people disliked the queus more.

Keep us updated bro, we are listening 👂🏿

Dude, people can get real salty about anyone that has even an iota of competitiveness in them. I've had people crying about how much of a tryhard (or "hacker") I am in ***TF2 and CS***.
---
The truth hurts sometimes. :)
---
It is in the sense that there are more than one layer per server right now. But it's not fully active, they currently aren't creating new layers to deal with the queues. This is probably so they can test things with less players for the first few hours.
---
Yes I believe so
---
He is retard, please understand
---
It's not just arrests.
---
Late to the game, but is a non-nyc local allowed if I’m gonna move there? I’d love to join if so! I’m east coast either way
---
I don’t think people call BFA “Too dumbed down” or “Easy”. I think a lot of people here just don’t like the way WoW has gone, or have a specific gripe. It offers as much difficulty as you can possibly want, and also as little difficulty as you could want. It’s just not everyone’s cup of tea, as shown by the dying interest in it. 
---
Or are you making fun of people that use Addons? I’m not entirely sure
---
Yea dude monkeys don't comment on Reddit posts like an idiot so I guess they got YOU beat when it comes to not being a retard
---
Didn’t miss it.  It’s still going on.
---
Alright, thanks I must've missed it
---
Excluding character models and some buildings, there are new graphic options that'll make the game look way better than it used to be. Most notably talking about shadows, water, and environment detail / view distance.
---
I tried my best, there was no point...

Aren’t they offering the updated graphics currently in retail for vanilla? Like you can switch between the two if you want?
---
Will Teremus the Devourer be leashed?  I suspect so but I just remembered my horde guild used to kite bosses to SW then log on alternate accounts to feed him bodies.
---
I think we might have even had GM intervention once, unsure, this was usually get lit and dick off day in the guild.  Been far to many years.

How long does this stress test last?
---
Character models are one of his main gripes unfortunately
---
His videos really aren't horrible, but his stream is unbearable.
---
There will be at least one meme raiding guild, find it.
---
How do you know it'll be PvP?
---
I mean I changed servers by GM request in Vanilla. I bought it in plenty of other early versions.
---
I am basically just going to pick a mid pop pvp server that has good NA guild statistics.
---
This sub, man...
---
Same, don't remember the last time I watched the opening cinematic thing
---
Isnt it Sinead O’connor?
---
You'll be fine.  Do some dungeons, let them all fight over gear.  They'll have a blast.  You can always run the dungeon multiple times, and most of them have quests that give some gear, so it's not a total waste.  Plus you'll be getting XP as you go.
---
You're fucked.
---
&gt; Does he not like any game made prior to 2001
---
Most people don't. Retro gaming is a very small niche that has a cult following.
---
Yeah, most people are going to take at least 200 hours to hit 60. 
---
Pulling that off in a month means you are playing WoW more than your fulltime job.
---
What happened to the classic team being an offshoot, a blizzard lovechild if you will? 
---
I've seen NO marketing and I don't think you have either. Even though I don't count this linkedIn post, can you name me anything else? I'm banking on them pulling finger out closer to launch but I find it very unlikely. They don't want classic to overtake retail and that much should be obvious
---
Word, We may have cross paths lol, see you on 3 weeks maybe
---
Is there any point in subbing now and trying to get in or EU servers locked so I can't get in anyway?
---
I hope that layering won't shard us into zones with less people than what we experienced here. After the initial rush it is really easy to quest. More aggressive layering than this will just "benefit" people who want to rush to max level as fast as possible at the expense of community for the vast majority of players.
---
At launch of the Division 1, the tutorial had you speak to an NPC in a cramped apartment. Unit collision was on for other players. You could not get in the front door, let alone move once you lucked out and squeezed in.
---
How can any game still make this mistake?
---
I mean...people were already using amulets or weapons with teleport charges and just repairing them lol.
---
WoW choices are like onions it seems...  
---
I have never watched a streamer before, so I cannot give advice as to who is more deserving of the two.  
---
Being said, I did see something about Asmond yelling at people about loot and how he deserves it as a streamer.  So that's 50DKP MINUS!  HANDLE IT!
---
Erm, thats a shitty joke, because you make the assumption that people want to in the first place, but the reality is that no one wants that, ever.
---
2 hours ago, I was put into a 31 minute queue. Now it's only &lt;1 minute left 😂

---
Hey did you ever find a solution to this? I'm in the same boat - I want an AddOn to simply show me \*where\* starting quests are, especially the super long bread-crumb quests, rather than telling me where to go / what to kill; I want to figure that part out myself, it's part of the immersive experience to me.
---
Many mobs turn around a bunch and can cause you to be spotted, PvP wise having the extra detection advantage helps you as well. I like the talent personally.
---
Currently 3000 in the queue for me. Brings back memories sitting in a login queue
---
Only casuals eat and drink two days before release. No need to wear diapers when there is nothing to piss and shit!
---
Good friend it is being handled with the utmost importance. I will be parsing 98th percentile thx to these big bitches.
---
Im pretty sure there's a interface option for scrolling combat text
---
Are there Savic for humans? For some reason, I am only finding that brand for pets. I live in Colorado in case this is not a U.S. brand. Thanks!
---
&gt;no one wants that, ever.
---
there are people who WANT to go gank the streamers, please don't say NONE when there are obviously SOME. But I agree more people will want to avoid them.
---
Thanks this is also helpful for me because I want to play on a streamer server.
---
ya, retail graphics are about a decade behind, u can't say u won't play classic over graphics but also play retail
---
Game looks great. Glad he's not playing Classic.
---
Why are you taking PEDS?
---
It's not about ad revenue, it's about the YouTube recommendation algorithm favoring videos over 10 minutes in length.
---
Wtf, the dream mug... PepeHands
---
This is what the internet has turned into. Someone has first hand knowledge of something, doesnt matter because the dude doing classic wow said so like that stopped the people that played back then from reading... or experiencing the game.
---
Even with all that said, yes they did change the spawn timers at the start of classic. That doesn't change the fact that the stupid long respawn timers back then were in its "fixed" state and they didn't touch it until wrath as I correctly pointed out.
---
Nice troll though.
---
bada bing bada boom put some suga in your coffee with the brooklyn style pizza
---
Every server is going to have streamers lol. Better to just avoid the bigger ones
---
How many people have working addons? Half of the addons I downloaded that should work in classic, dont work at all. maybe like 6/20
---
Avoid streams as you will most likely not be able to kill them. Other then Asmon and Esfand they are top level players who are normally surrounded by top level players. Who can also summon a mob. I would just avoid them. It's not worth it.
---
Thex RP PVP
---
Same. I'm hoping someone will comment with one.
---
what action bar addon is that then ? struggling to find anything useful.
---
Well, its the first one ive seen where someone actually manages to create one
---
I really hope that this is a shitpost (no pun intended). No-one can have this little of a life, surely!
---
Shit in a bucket like a normal human being
---
I've always played Horde until I tried Alliance on a private server. Just off the top of my head it has cleaner city aesthetics, I love some zones (Darkshore especially), female nelves got the best animations in the game, cat mounts are sweet, armor fits well, your spine doesn't show and is straight for a change. It's easier to get to Blackrock Mountain, too.
---
On the other hand there are paladins and gnomes everywhere, it's a pain in the posterior to access the Scarlet Monastery and Razorfen instances, there's no Barrens with its chat and the Wailing Caverns, and Westfall isn't the worst ever zone solely by virtue of Desolace existing. I prefer Horde flight path layout. Oh, and Fear Ward pretty much locks you into playing an ugly dwarf. Cloth looks ridiculous on them. Fuck Fear Ward.
---
So tired of these cringe posts
---
Erm, can't tell if serious or just a terrible troll...
---
Imprisoned for 10000 years....banished from my own home server...
---
&gt; You'll be fine.
---
Yay!
---
&gt;You're fucked.

Fuck. We really just need a rogue or hunter in the mix.

Holy shit dude, you can hold an entire WORLD in your hands. That's amazing, you absolute fucking Titan.

Might be the sheer number of people talking to the NPC. Try killing monsters until you can go to the first quest hub out of the starter zone.

Or u lack brain

Vote this to the top

All ready to gank some raiders!
---
The Thex thing is old and stale. You can let it die.
---
Get into the habit of getting up and stretching your legs for a bit every hour that you're on the computer. It makes a huge difference both healthwise and feelingwise.
---
OldSkoolCool, WoW edition.
---
I never understood peoples hang ups about small things
---
When I first saw the wotlk trailer I thought arthas was the good guy summoning a dragon to fight the zombies lol
---
Most people will are going to get tired and be very inefficient at 12 hours of a day.
---
7 days /played requires very efficient leveling.
---
Bro, this is legit the saddest thing I ever read
---
Dude... Thex is gonna be pissed.
---
That godamn dagger from Rend in UBRS? The drop rate on that is so ridiculously low that I had around 30 UBRS runs as a rogue back then and I never seen it drop.
---
see? my fellow stream sniper! let's ruin their days dude, are you going horde or alliance?
---
Right after you create your character, go vendor your stuff for some copper and then train Immolate from the Warlock trainer.
---
It's not going to be as bad as you think.
---
Look at it this way:
---
Healing gear: Priest prio/only person to use
---
Wands: Priest prio on first wand, then the best early wands are either crafted or quest drops until Cookie's.  
---
Warlocks just take the second and third drops/crafted ones early on. 
---
DPS cloth:  Warlock prio, priest leftovers
---
DPS other gear: DPS warrior prio, tank leftovers
---
Tank gear: Tank prio, dps warrior leftovers.
---
It's honestly not much actual competition.  The main things that'll be competed over are caster staves and 1h melee weapons.
---
Go skin some critters.
---
I've had an update of 1150 currently in queue
---
there will be so many updates to addons by the time you're going to be seriously using dbm that i would just wait if you can't get it to work immediately. questie is another story though
---
That was 1.10 and was way early in diablo 2 LODs lifetime.  It was the patch that added skill synergies and made everything have a lot more hp and more monster immunities.
---
WTF?
---
Under the races Troll can be a Warlock
---
We are going horde atm!
---
I still play on bloodscalp (made my first toon on it in Cata), so this is awesome to see. It's crazy to think that my character may have been stored and processed on this hardware at one time.
---
Like others have said you get to look forward to a more mature community and events within those communities. And also you get to see these RP take place throughout the world. So for example you might see a farmer and his family in town selling stuff and going out to dinner. Or an elite ranging party going to scout for horde out in the wild. Then you might go to gold shire and find yourself in a night elf strip club.
---
WoD trailer is so amazing and the expansion was such a letdown so much untapped potential
---

I will make that promise to everyone housed within, especially since it's the same for me! I treat it, and everyone in it, with the utmost care, respect, and dignity.

Hot babe wallpaper. 2004 confirmed.

Bit of both. Its hard to see myself as some joe blow adventurer if im some assasin, grand wizard or some nature conservationist. Ill probably try and find something that feels like itd make the most sense just running around the world and is fun enough to enjoy.
---
Bang on bud . Avoiding that shit like I avoid retail.
---
Pirate it.
---
Quick question for you, What's the difference between borrowing someones copy and pirating it? Exactly ;)
---
There's no drives on it, it's really just a compute node that connects to storage over a fibre network where the actual data lives.
---
It doesn't. Have fun running from Darkshire, say hi to Stiches along the way.
---
Get raiding, then.
---
Or Kurt Angle.
---
That... actually made a lot of sense and gave me a lot of relief haha.
---
Mostly I was looking at it like "Three clothies, two mails/plates, and fucking weapons abound...."
---
What did I just read!?
---
The opening cinematic with people everywhere is a sight to see :-)
---
Too blurry my dude.
---
It’s a worlds of difference. You mind letting me borrow your copy for a little bit ? ;)
---
Think the new engine «broke» that.
---
I knew i recognized that video, have it saved under "back issues" but havent used it in a while
---
From where are you playing? In EU, it is really decent.
---
Okay, so I tested things today with the stress test. Upon first booting up the game via the bnet launcher I was met with a crash. There was no .sys error, the specific error was: VIDEO SCHEDULER INTERNAL ERROR. So after rebooting, I tried running the game in Compatibility Mode with Windows 8, and I also launched the game using the client itself rather than using the bnet launcher, and was able to play the stress test for a solid hour, with no blue-screen crash. At first I thought it might be bnet, but it runs BFA and Hearthstone with no issues so perhaps it's an issue with one of my drivers and the Windows 10 update, not sure though.
---
&gt; Priest undead CC wont help since we ill be Alliance.
---
No, shackle undead doesn't work on undead players.  It works on undead NPCs, like ghouls and shit.
---
I remember playing on a great PC and realizing how “detailed” the ground was. Lol
---
When i walked into the barrens and heard that music...I knew I was home.
---
is it different then it was in vanilla or just first time you are hearing it?
---
Was this image uploaded from an Edge capable flip phone?  
---
Damn, you're really living up that Nostalgia.
---
Yea, I know lol. 
---
For some reason I was under the impression the game could be played for a day for the stress test. Guess I was tired or something.
---
All right, here they are, I've been going back and forth between all of them. Also, dunno if I wanna do horde or alliance (barrens chat tho) I've heard roll horde if you are on a PvP server, alliance if PvE.
---
Druid: NE/Tauren
---
Warlock: Gnome/Orc/Undead
---
Priest: NE/Undead
---
Hunter: NE/Troll
---
I'm kind of set on druid for how fun they are to play and to level, but they aren't very good for PvP or endgame I've heard. Really torn between NE and Tauren. The only race I've never played is tauren, so super tempted to roll that out
---
Warlock, never levelled a warlock to 60, really good pvp class, easy to level. TEMPTING! Might make this my alt after I reach 60 on something else if anything
---
Priest, Ok Really curious how good shadow priests are at PvP, I've heard they are absolute monsters at pvp but also they are hard to level, don't know... but also always top pick for raids.
---
Hnter: Mihgt just make this the first character I level to 60 due to simply how easy it is to level one of these bois. Also heard druids are just as/almost easy but also more fun to play. Wouldn't really want to have one of these for endgame tho... idk I've seen some good pvp gameplay with these guys (kiting etc).
---
Ya, any other arguments for different classes would be good, but also main question I gotta ask is WHICH FACTION! I DONT KNOW! HELP! IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY!
---
2.3? (i think) gave items with +healing spell damage equal to (i think, again) 1/3 of the total +healing.  wrath was when spell damage and healing were totally combined
---
Exercise.
---
Sooo.... where can I buy it?
---
Google search shows that she covered the prince original
---
K
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll see if that helps :)
---
You can move between shots, but theres a .5 sec cast time where you have to stand still.  The most effective way to do this is actually to strafe to a side as opposed to back up, and move your camera such that you still are facing enough in the right direction
---
If they don't have a PvP server called Stranglethorn Vale, it is a missed opportunity.
---
As someone who hasn't played and Classic will be the first time, is RP-PVP noob friendly-ish?
---
I don't have it sadly :P
---
A little less would be fine. Waiting thirty minutes for my quest mob was really a pain.
---
awesome idea! would love to join the discord!
---
Seems a lot more likely that you just accidentally started on the wrong server.
---
Yeah, my sound was maxed out and all I could hear was boars being stabbed
---
Nah, a main blade and usually 3 paks.
---
It was regional and also game specific. Like for instance Eastern Kingdoms had it's own server set, as did all the continents until like wrath I think. 
---
There was a server for each main country too. U.S Bloodscalp, EU bloodscalp and I think Australia? Kinda fuzzy atm though.
---

I remember doing AQ 40 at a LAN center with friends while tanking and my Druid friend would literally go and do food runs in the middle of raid while I would tap the odd regrowth or rejuvenation on his keyboard while he was gone.
---
Several others would be straight up AFK auto following and we managed to clear.
---
Just do /who 15. One guy said there's a bugged quest in Mulgore but there's also a lot of level 15 Aliance.
---
Did the same thing except I was an alone undead and went to the Thousand Needles. Didn't make it to the shimmering flats though...
---
It's $10 for the Kindle edition, which you can read on the free Kindle app.

Some guy said there's a bugged quest in Mulgore.

We actually tried to go in to LBRS before remembering there's a level requirement.

Possible, but two of my guild mates plus a random stranger also did that?  Eh, I'm skeptical.
---
 Has anyone tried ClassicAuraDurations? I made a warlock and learned immolate to see if it would track the dot timer, but it doesn't seem to be working.
---
Thank goodness you finally made a thread, we’ve been waiting on you to discuss it!
---
Oh, wait...no we didn’t. There is a megathread. Go there.
---
That's not de way of da Troll, mon.

I totally forgot that the final stress test is today ;\_; here we go waiting in the queue :D

Holy fucking memory lane, I completely forgot about that video !

Thanks for the memories

so you got 222 fps back than?
---
Here we go let the bs begin
---
Definitely different.
---
Keep a good wand around. Best way to lvl is to just dot let pet tank and wand. Destruction for raiding. Affliction or affliction/demonology is probably best for lvling, but all you really need is improved dots and mana regen. Improved life tap and life leech, void walker. Raiding is pretty boring with warlock tbh, spamming shadowbolt 95% of the time.
---
Check what server all the streamers are going to play on and then join that server.  I enjoy extremely lively servers and am excited for the cool dueling, wPvP, and other events.
---
Minimum specs is a mac os.
---
Not yet, PM me so I don’t forget, I live in a rural area and Comcast has had my internet down since yesterday for some stupid reason but they said it should be back on by the time I get home from work today.
---
“him” would be correct in this case, but worries, still understandable. The sentence as-is just makes Leeroy sound like a robot or something.

Glad I could help. 
---
I would also add:
---
1H weapons: Tank prio, dps warrior leftovers
---
Shield: Tank prio, dps warrior leftovers.
---
Most of this stuff is honestly common courtesy/sense anyway and a group of friends won't have any issue figuring it out/doing this naturally anyway.  If you're still concerned I would recommend talking it over with your group and maybe even laying this stuff down as "ground rules" before you get started that way the 'locks don't get whiney about wands or the dps warrior about 1h weapons or the priest about shadow gear.
---
Found the 13 yo suburban white kid.
---
don't matter, because someone is going to fall behind, another is going to have to work, and the third is going to realize that classic is not for them.  You won't all level in a 5 man for the entire time.  If you are sure you are going to stay online at the exact same times totally in sync for 4-9 days of in game time played?  Well if that is the case you can dungeon grind from 30-40 in razorfen and sm.
---
Thanks! I dont know a lot about WoW lore, would that be a problem in a rp server? Should I properly study about it?

When you're doing dungeons it helps you pay attention to if you're contributing? If you're below the tank it might be good to look into what you're doing wrong. I'm not saying get the dps meter so you can blast it every pull, but it's definitely good to know if you're able to hold your own.
---
sorry you feel that way. I know friends that have had different experiences for sure, particularly with Lilfit's, but this is just my personal opinion.

That's Samwise Didler, Blizzard's art director. He's been with the company forever and is responsible for pretty much everything you see in a Blizzard game. He also created the Pandaren (first as an April Fool's joke) and is the frontman for *Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain*, a Blizzard-employee metal band that has many tributes across various games.

Would chosing an elf be smarter since I can have that small dodge chance?

anyone got pitbull or another good unit frame or all in one ui working?
---
Thank you :D

When using all the items and tricks warriors are the best because defensive stances threat modifies it all and having a shield to block attacks during aoe tanking is huge. Next best is prot paladin once again has a shield and if you are just using baseline and no consumables prot paladin aoe tank is probably better than warrior. Righteous fury only modifies the threat of holy damage. The worst aoe tanking is druids no shield to block all the little hits (this really adds up on damage taken) can only use consumables pre pull although they can also utilize hurricane which is nice. Swipe only hits 3 targets.
---
Not saying druids can't aoe tank because they definitely can, but this is the ranking IMO.
---
Gnome. I ALWAYS pick races based on PvP and not PvE since you can overcome PvE through gear, consumes, and rest of the raid. You can’t always do that for PvP, especially as Rogue where your less likely to play with a group (usually defending or ninjaing caps or solo ganks). And closing distance is the number one issue for a rogue vs high level players. Escape artist is insanely OP for a rogue.
---
what the fuck did I just read

I am getting close too, so close! SO CLOSE DON'T STOP!

Anyone got Luna Unit Frames to work? I downloaded it from the Will it Classic Website. Was marked as "updated" but can't get it to show frames. Was some patch right before logging in to the stress test maybe that is what caused it?
---
Yeah I definitely will do this, and like another poster said at least one of us is probably gonna drop off/quit before level 40-60 anyways.

&gt; Activity reduced A LOT obviously at least for launch, I think most here are here to sate the classic hunger while we wait.

Screw that, I need to shitpost all day at work to keep sane

If I'm setting up my ui, will it be saved automatically for launch or do I need to do something special?

some google-fu returned the following macro that just barely fits within the macro limits, so it would have to be a separate macro from your drain solo spell
---
/run for b=0,4 do for s=1,GetContainerNumSlots()do local n=GetContainerItemLink(b,s)if n and strfind(n,"**name of soul thingies**")then PickupContainerItem(b,s)DeleteCursorItem()end end end
---
Replace "name of soul thingies" with the case-sensitive name of the soul shard item (Ive never played lock so idk what it is)
---
the drain soul macros that you probably have seen delete shards from the 4th bag slot because they assume that you will have a felcloth bag there, so soul shards will automatically go there.

That's sweet! I have an old Tankard of Terror that I keep my spatulas in.

---
Thank you, Im starting to feel more confident about my inicial choice
---
Been decided :)
---
Yeah yeah, we know that ship has sailed a long time ago, still woulda made for a better game.
---
Nice =)
---
Thank you, that one
---
The comments on this post are incredible
---
Yeah, sadly it's probably true.  That's one reason my wife and I aren't trying to coordinate with IRL friends this go-round...we know all of them will quit :P
---
Silver lining at least:  Maybe it'll be one of the warlocks.
---
I was part of the main alliance premade on my server back in retail vanilla. There was a horde premade that gave us great games, and another not-so-good premade run by a Tauren warrior. Well I guess he got tired of losing and respecced prot to run flags and and would bring 9 warlocks with him. Most games would end in them camping their GY with the flag and us just letting them win to continue our honor farm
---
I got a 5 min wait for 1000 places not too bad
---
Does not seem like it would be an easy thing to fake at all
---
I'm new to WoW and have no idea what 2 professions I should do. I was thinking about doing mining and blacksmithing or gathering and alchemy. Which ones would be better? I really wanna do alchemy or blacksmithing, are they good and what other professions are they good with?

Yeah I think regardless there needs to be an unfucked with 1.13 on a 2-3 year seasonal cycle until blizzard is no longer a company. 
---
Im open to CTBC or a re imagining of wow post naxx in some sort of classic+. Im even okay with a classic+ that doesnt add new content so much as it tunes and refines what is there already (Dropping debuff limit and buffing boss health for example--we get gbanks and auto dismount)

DAE KNOW HOW TO NOT BE A LITERAL PIECE OF HUMAN GARBAGE?!

I came here to troll you. Well played sir
---
So I didn't realize that like blizzard gave us legion and the other ones for free or whatever. Last time I played was Cata
---
So when the test is over I'll go play a Demon Hunter for the first time while I satisfy my itch lol

I thought it was serious until the "complete disregard for my health" part. Then doubt settled in... but the scoring system... That gave it away but it was still hilarious.

Well, pack the sub up and kill the lights. We had a good run.
---
It was a joke though.
---
They put it in your interface options under camera. slide it to high
---
Trying to decide which to level first: tauren druid, undead mage or undead priest. Druid has been my main for over ten years, but I've played mage and priest extensively throughout my time playing WoW. I will play them all, but not sure which to spend the most time on to start.
---
Sorry, but I draw the line at putting stuff up my wee wee.. That's utterly gross.
---
Have they fixed the pet command lag bug? It took like a full second between commanding a pet to attack and it actually doing it on the beta. Seems like an enormous bug and nobody is talking about it.
---
Shit. I'm devastated. Better pack it up and head home now. I can't handle this internet fire.
---
Depends on the monitor. My MSI monitor has a button in the back that I press and it shows the refresh rate
---
Check to see if your display settings for WoW is set to unlimited FPS (if that's an option idk I'm still at work)
---
Nvidia GeForce Experience has a setting that can show your FPS and you can download a program like fraps
---
Same, I liked it a lot more back when Classic first got announced. Everyone seemed a lot friendlier and patient willing to take time to explain the mechanics and the Mods seemed way more lenient and there was no Thex. I really do hope people start Realm specific subs but either way once the game launches I doubt I'll swing by much.
---
It's a digital world. OP didn't say his friend won't play Classic because the fire looks bad, or the clouds look bad, or the hair effects are bad. Those would be small things to complain about. If you are paying in time and money for a digital experience you are allowed to have an opinion about the way things look to you. Would you pay $20 for a movie title you'd like to watch in 4k but the resolution caps out at 480p? No, but you might pay a few dollars.  I'm pumped for Classic, and accept the graphics for what they are, however I prefer to play AAA titles at or close to max settings because a great looking game brings me more enjoyment.
---
Me too. Log queues, disconnections and a general inability to log in. Exactly like vanilla! :D
---
I agree, ideally you would als get only premade vs premade but I think xrealm is just more enjoyable because of the waiting times.
---

Only lists two of the three types of Leatherworking.
---
I have not read a post from blizzard anywhere that states they are trying to observe what players do between level 1-20. Please let me know where you see that.
---
Got it. I'll get to working on "Operation: Halloween in August" right away!
---
I'm gonna dabble for the first time. Probably only running 3 or 4 though. 5 just seems intimidating. Hoping healer, tank, 2 dps would be able to 4 man most lowbie dungeons
---
Serious question to anyone who’s used diapers for gaming (if those people exist).

Do you guys just feel the poop on your butt the whole time? That seems gross and distracting
---
There's a whole dwarven mortar team back here on the road. I do not remember this being in the beta OR original game.

Isn't that level 2 required?

Sadly, that actually happened. I keep my drinks that I'm going to use on the floor as my desk is too small to have anything but 1 can on at a time, also beneath my chair is more diapers, wet wipes, and some food (i eat crisps ((chilli heatwave etc))).
---
It's a Battle.net feature, baked in to the other games in the launcher, too. 
---
It's there for the same reason that the game uses a down-ported Modern engine: it has to be, by company policy. All Blizzard games in the launcher need to have full Battle.net integration. Communities are a Battle.net feature, so they need to be present in Classic.
---
Not that it really matters, because nobody uses it over Discord anyway.

Do you think I needto get a lot of knowledge about the lore before getting into an RP server or is it enought with whatever I can get from the quests?
---
&gt;Priest undead CC wont help since we ill be Alliance.
---
I mean shackle undead, Alliance gets it too. Banish is just a nice touch, and works on elementals and abberations as well. You're also leaving out succubus seduce, which is a long duration CC on humanoids; so you've got ways to CC humans, elementals, undead, demons, abberations, fear almost anything, off tank anything. What's even left, other than beasts? And those you can still fear in a pinch, or off tank. I can virtually guarantee that lack of CC will not be an issue.
---
So i know warrior leveling is awful, but how solo content at 60
---
I see, thanks for clarifying that!
---
of course
---
I would he happy with this, but i’m pretty sure they will take the easy (brainless) business decission, which is.
---
Large team handles retail and future expansions. Business as usual.  
---
Small team handles classic and future re-releases.
---
I'm not playing any of my 5 Thex's.  Just wanted to steal the name from you unoriginal scrubs :P
---
Nvidia control panel for monitor settings. Then just make sure you have uncapped fps in game
---
What can I say, I'm a Vanilla player to the bone. I can't stand playing any other version of WoW. Been playing Vanilla exclusively since 2012 until early 2019. Now I stopped to prepare for the Classic release.
---
I enjoy all the little things in Vanilla and if Blizzard force TBC or WoTLK down my throat, without any option to continue to play Classic, I will unsubscribe and go back to private servers. I want to support them and their decision to bring Classic back, but if they shit on it and me for that matter, then I won't support them anymore. They have a golden opportunity here to bring back all the old players and make them happy and everything, if they screw it up, they must be pretty retarded.

Why do you think it would be difficult to me and what class do you suggest to a newbie?
---
About RP servers, I am mostly concerned about me not really knowing about wow lore as much as I would want to
---
There are SO many people whos going to pick skinning that the marked will be overfloaded for a very very long time. Maybe the vendor silver will be okay for the very short term. But with the ammount of people going to raid while being undergeared and people needing to level alchemy and so on, you are much much better off picking herbalism or people getting new gear like every second enchanting mats is heavily needed and so on.
---
I obviously cant know for sure, but I am pretty damn sure that skinning will be massivly overrated.
---
that's heccin cool man\~!!!
---
A long time ago I had a girlfriend who talked a lot about how successful a raider she'd been in wow. She had a TON of very rare raiding stuff, so I figured she was legit.
---
Eventually we played together and she was awful. Just awful. Constantly stood in the fire. Constantly bottom damage. Constantly telling me to stop pulling mobs so fast because she had to keep moving.
---
It came out over time that almost everything she'd got from raiding had been given to her by her then-boyfriend, who'd been the guild leader. She'd basically been carried through every raid from vanilla through lich king, and got nearly every mount or legendary item. And because of this, she honest to god thought she was amazeballs at the game.
---
What're the specs?  Did they tell you what went into one blade?

Finnish guilds have formed a coalition and they all will be going on the same server. It is still undecided if Finns want to join the nordic server. This is mostly because people are sceptical whether the server channels will just be a shitfest of swedish/norwegian/danish instead of english. 
---
Here is a link to the finnish discord: https://discord.gg/RwX8Mth
---
I have no idea, but makes sense
---
No idea when they came in, but my warr leveled 5 levels going for the tiny crimson welpling.
---
You do realize you can and will be made fun of on the internet for just about anything right? It’s not about keeping your sexuality concealed on WoW, it’s about keeping anything concealed on WoW. 
---
If I love anime and go into trade chat to talk about that you don’t think I’m going to get called names? If I get engaged to a woman or man, and announce it in goldshire you don’t think people are going to talk shit? What the fuck kind of privilege are you talking about? I get made fun of almost every day on the internet. 
---
If you don’t want to get made fun of, don’t open up a piece of your personal life to strangers on the internet for no apparent reason whatsoever. There’s no such thing as this “privilege” you speak of in Azeroth. We all have the privilege of anonymity outside of your virtual toon. 
---
Moreover, I would argue that by creating a server specifically for LGBT people is not only pointless, but will actually make it more of a target for by trolls... thus making it counter productive. Why not just play the game and stop associating homosexuality with everything you do?
---
Hey, I was there!

Make sure the folders are actually correct. Sometimes the addons will be named “Addon A” but then inside that is the addons folder and then inside that the actual addon files.

grind some gold and get a free month of playtime for classic!
---
Jubjub best cosmetic pet don’t @me
---
This so much. Felt like a dream lol
---
Def has them. You could buy roaches from undercity etc. 
---
Some were drops. Emerald whelp from swamp of sorrows for example
---
Grinding mobs for tiny chances at pet drops was my favorite side project in vanilla!  I farmed intensely for a whelpling of every color, and I had a couple friends kind enough to kill oozes over and over and over again in Felwood to help me get the lil oozeling guy.  I totally expect to find myself doing it all over again in Classic!

Since I'm too lazy to do anything after work I started a habit of working out in the morning before work. And since I'm too lazy to cook every day I spend an hour meal prepping on Sunday which lasts the whole work week
---
How can you kill someone who has no life? lets get that sword of a thousand truths boys!!!!!!111
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
depends where you exp 40-60 and farm 60+ but once you get to a bag vendor its good income, even before you can always drop items, and you can postpone skinning until lvl 20 or 25 if you want, the first ~25 lvls can be skinned at lvl 1 skinning.
---
The community is ass.
---
What do you mean? Im already in que, is the server oceanic?
---
You couldn't link abilities in Classic.
---
I don't think that happened until late BC.
---
I think that is done correctly. I have for example Details-v8.2.0-v1.13.2-... and inside I have several folders: Details, Details_DataStorage, Details_RaidCheck, etc.
---
IMAGINE NOT KNOWING ABOUT DISGUSTING OOZELING ON CTHUN
---
Do you not have a job or any responsibilities?
---
I don't remember politics in 2005 WoW chat though.

Epic shit post. Or should I say.... classic.

Hawaii, same thing, we’re three hours behind Pacific. But we don’t follow daylight savings so will only be 2 hours behind in fall.

Should be resolved now, can you give it another look see?
---
Wasn't there another patch just a few years ago? I seem to remember reading about it and it caused me to reinstall it.
---
Chuck Norris is so powerful that Mankriks wife needs to find HIM
---
Dosent change the fact that there is gonna be way way more leather than people will need for a long time, so selling it on AH will be close to vendor prices. You will make short term money by vendoring your leather, but if you herb or disenchant while leveling, people will need it in massive ammounts as soon as they hit lvl 60, and they will change gear constantly needing new enchants and so on.
---
This is old news
---
This should be fixed.
---
as much as I love classic the Woltk cinematic still sends shivers through my spine
---
Nice, im going horde. @Aliengal, I´ll be going priest, so if you wanna pop some alliance off feel free to add me
---
Imo Gnome helps deal with the classes I think give you the most trouble: Ranged and snares. You could argue the same thing for bleed / poison as well, I guess it comes down to do hate being kited or hate not being able to vanish immediately? I think for the most part I feel I’m more at detriment being slowed and having to waste sprint with imp sprint or PvP trinket, and also size and engi is added bonus. You really can’t go wrong with either
---
That's awesome!!  What a happy surprise :)
---
This has been fixed.
---
Its all fun and games untill a pet drops some1 need rolls and breaks the group up, but yes im more excited to get westfall chicken then i am for christmass this year
---
You could always just ping a GM and have then do it in Vanilla. They're just streamlining it for classic
---
Not me, I'm running to the front tagging and baging
---
Props to my Horde brothers who fought off Asmongold’s raid in Durotar. Got em so good he went and made a new character to get back to Elwynn.
---
It is a thing.  It's not a top dps class because it's a hybrid.  Rogues and mages can't tank hits and heal themselves
---
Ony and MC are both launching with the updated loot tables, iirc. No tier 2 armor sets from MC, and Ony drops Viskag and other goodies.
---
Has anyone actually confirmed that addon is compatible yet or is that a placeholder versioning ?
---
Sure do I currently work full time but, my brother only works about 30 hours a week and, he will be helping me with my stream by making youtube videos. We figure youtube is the key to success since everything you make is evergreen and, gives people a good taste of what your channel can be.
---
I knew we'd get the right answer if we went deep enough ^^:)
---
A normal person probably could, but streamers will get enough spite reports that they would probably have to change names.
---
and I can't give a single shit about it.
---
Say it with me:  "I'll be playing Classic in LESS THAN THREE WEEKS!"
---
For Garrick it's like Edge Of Tomorrow. Not his day..
---
&gt; we're going to get the real Vanilla experience 
---
I cant wait for your shrill attempt at virtue signaling to inflict every area of the game ;)
---
Yes, under realm selection at the bottom click oceanic then click swap of sorrows its the only server. The ones on americas are locked.
---
Hahaha, as a pet lover not winning the role was gut wrenching.
---
You overestimate the number of people that are interested in WoW in general. Retail doesn't have millions playing and neither will classic get to 5 mil.  If they delay the cash shop, it might get to 2 million but that's pretty much it. Zoomers don't like the slow gameplay of MMOs.
---
leave the poor kid alone
---
I got it on the AH years later.
---
I have seen people post screenshots with addons from this stress test.
---
Same here. After playing other games that had racial only weapons and such I figured surely the Tauren would get a totem weapon.
---
Sorry, this doesn’t feel like vanilla.
---
True word spoken
---
It creates it when you log your character in for the first time.
---
I wish they all came that easy. I wish the winterspring saber grind was that easy.
---
LOL you didn't confirm if they were ONLINE in the game...being online on a Discord server doesn't equate to being online in-game.
---
Its really hard to follow abject retardation like yours, my mistake for trying to out logic your berserk hatred for vanilla.
---
Oh, hey Hakuma.
---
It's just like the people summiting Mt Everest!
---
Its fun to see once of twice, but its the sort of event that gets old fast.
---
Demon Hunter is fantastic, it ruined me for any other class. I jump off cliffs to my death on my Shaman all the time.
---
Exactly. Cringe heaven.
---
That worg pup from lbrs. I hope its in vanilla like I remember.
---
Yes it is. Still not near done but it seems usable so far at least.
---
You can get this version from the development git repo [here](https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic/tree/development)
---
Wrong game
---
WTB Spinebreaker server blade PST
---
You know. If you think about it, with a slower weapon and thusly longer between auto attacks, you spend less time attacking when that buff is up and therefore miss less over all.
---
That's how math works right?
---
Kirks wife noooooooooo
---
IMAGINE BEING TOO LAZY TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO YOU LITERALLY SHIT YOURSELF CONSTANTLY
---
I tried watching his stream and couldn’t stand even 5 minutes. He seems so whiney and immature. Must be mostly kids watching.
---
Yeah, me too but that has no Aura-Timers.
---
I love it.
---
wtf does 14,5 mean?
---
I also through that it was weird they didn't have a better picture, but the hardcover on Amazon is from the author.  It should be a legit copy.
---
What's that? The mystery I mean...
---
IMAGINE HAVING SO MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH SHITTING YOURSELF AS AN """""ADULT""""" THAT YOU CAN RATE DIAPERS
---
Um have you played overwatch or league of legends? Lol
---
It'd have to be a bug if they are from previous stress tests, I maxed out in the last stress test and none of my characters were there today.
---
Plot twist: Classic will be actually reskinned BFA
---
Or, and I'm just spitballing here, you just keep a laptop next to your toilet?
---
&gt;your abject retardation
---
[Here's a dictionary](http://www.wikipedia.org), champ.
---
Sooo many pets to get or sale. By the time I get a really rare one, there might be a stable economy. 7 levels of grinding for 100g Haha.
---
Messed around, hit level five on a rogue with leather working skinning and fishing. Felt excellent. Lag matched my expectations, could be worse on launch day and that would be fine with me.
---
Completely jazzed. Ready to get in on the ground floor and build a community on the server I choose.
---
so you don't know if this works for classic beta?  I tried this exact one in November.  It did not work.  I am asking Specifically for the stress test that is going live on the 26th/27th.
---
Nope, you’re the only one.

Create profiles, then you can just load those for all your characters.
---
How did you go about doing this if you don't mind me asking? I absolutely love it
---
Haha very fair. I would argue that Dwarf racial is just as good in PvP as gnome, but for different reasons: mostly being able to vanish vs some classes and reduce dmg while you catch them. But if you can’t stand any of them, Human is still great in PvE, just gets no real racial bonus to their class.
---
Yes. I wish I could play more but that's life. Just gonna enjoy the ride. Probly hit 60 sometime next year.
---
I'm only going to play occasionally, probably going to take me a few months to hit 60.  Slow leveling, mostly in dungeons for fun and not going to worry about it.
---
!remindme 6 months
---
Thanks brother
---
tauran
---
No, servers will be empty when you log in.
---
Doesn't feel like private server I think you mean.
---
It would be pretty easy. It's an HP ProLiant BL25p server blade. Just add a replica cover and there you go.
---
I played there, were you horde?
---
How did people level to 15 so fast?
---
I have no idea what some of that means, but I do know Asmon is a streamer... so props indeed.
---
Commenting so I can download these on release
---
What part is based off memory? He is talking about Pserver vs classic. NOT Vanilla back in the days...  
---
And yes, having tried both Pservers are harder on warrior players.
---
This is the type of content reddit needs 11/10
---
I have been debating multiboxing my War + Priest together so I can have them both to 60 and merged them into the same account after. Not decided yet though.
---
Man, good thing I'm playing a dwarf anyway.

Big meanie head uses ad hominem when he can't argue anymore :(. It's OK I'll still invite you to my groups to do your 11111111111111111111111111111 rotation on dungeon bosses when classic launches. Maybe having some friends will make you a happier person :)

I feel your underestimating the “replica cover” part. It’s pretty detailed on the right

Lol I bet. Sucks that they can't actually just fly as a mount!
---
Super easy to prevent: just inspect the player next day to see if they have it. If they don't and someone else does, welp, consequences go out.
---
In all my time playing since this was instated on retail I don't think I've seen it abused once.
---
&gt;dynamic PvP
---
50% chasing down people who don't want to fight + 50% Total chaos 
---
Call me crazy, but I value consent. ;)
---
I suggest picking the server you want to join regardless if a streamer is going to be on it.
---
For one you won't always come across them, it's a big world AND they gotta sleep to. 
---
Two they won't play forever. And the fans won't always be around them either, a good chunk of them will probably end up quitting to.
---
What UI addon are you using?
---
There's been a lot of propaganda saying Danes exist
---
THIS IS THE INTERNET, WATCH YOUR FUCKING LANGUAGE KID
---
That's not what he's saying at all.
---
yeah me too
---
All of these fearmongering posts of how hard it’s gunna be to level are totally unfounded. All the way through there were only about 5-10 people fighting for mobs, I didn’t even bother to grind mobs between quests. Instead I helped point people in the right direction of whatever quests they linked in /1. 
---
It’s going to be so much easier when we have more than just 2 servers to choose from guys..
---
&gt; EQUIP COMPARE
---
Apparently this is in the stress test right now.
---
So is night elf the accepted worst rogue class? Goddamnit, they are definitely my favorite, in close second is human. I’d say it’s night elf &gt; human .... dwarf &gt; gnome for me based on appearances although dwarf rogue could be kinda cool.

&gt; We are talking about a triple A developer and publisher. 
---
Surely they wouldnt screw up a massive launch of a game like BFA or Diablo 3.
---
Who in the right mind joins a guild with chicks?
---
They said late this week a few days ago. Try the google machine before posting on reddit.
---
A trophy shop should be able to do that for you...if you can find one willing to do copyrighted material. I'm not suggesting someone make a replica, only that it's *possible*.
---
He's saying that some people choosing to level faster than others will damage the community experience for those slower leveling people. The community experience is what each person makes it. 15 years ago we had hi population servers and very low population servers, each one had its own individual sense of community based on what the players there made it.
---
Ur disgusting m8
---
Tomorrow I think
---
Had I had the money I would've tried to get my hands on one. I played and levelled on Arthas (PvP NA)
---
&gt; Blizzard of 2005 didn't have any marketing for WoW either.
---
they had continuous marketing that was not on tv.
---
Why stand in line?? Just grind mobs until you can get out of the zone.
---
Its because it's not instant.
---
That’s now what you suggested tho. I never said it wasn’t possible you just said it was easy which it isnt
---
I think he means that tanking is hard, harder than other games or classes due to a lack of taunts and other easymode. Also with druid, to be effective, you will likely end up power shifting whereby you switch from one form to another and exploit talents that give you rage on shift and the helm, meaning you dump your bar switch forms and go back to bear and dump more in one global. It's tricky is all and tanking off the bat as a first character might be discouraging,  but that's conjecture, nobody will know except you so do it up. 
---
As for lore,  play through warcraft 3 and read a wiki on warcraft 2 and you'll be as caught up as everyone else was on day 1 back in original release.
---
Jepp
---
I’m probably going to roll Hunter and Dwarf, but recent duels kind of had me thinking NE. Stone form is great against rogues, warriors, druids, other Hunters, and since you can’t always have your pet stealthed it kind of turned me off from NE. And then the other side is I plan on playing NE Druid so don’t want to roll two NE haha. I’m thinking Stoneform may be used more frequently and actively in fights and Shadowmeld may only be used in duels, wpvp where I can plan out an attack... but are you using Shadowmeld more actively and in most fights?
---
To be honest Blizzard has a successful word of mouth model. I also think the video game market was still maturing into the juggernaut it is today and marketing was limited in general. It's only in the past 5-6 years I've seen video game advertisements on ESPN or other mainstream areas. Before that, marketing was limited to GTV and whatever gaming magazines were around and transitioning to the internet. Things still had yet to go truly viral as F.B was still nascent, the best smartphone was a blackberry and people were still literally playing on Dial Up. 
---
Now it's just a rehash of old assets. The product was already successful, this release is just a way to capitalize a second time with no marketing needed.
---
Do they play BFA now?
---
You have to take out the root of the problem, leave him and overtime more of his fans will come.
---
This is if he wants to play there, i believe most raiders will pick normal servers.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rsfWJjG4A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rsfWJjG4A) 
---
Apparently amazing to listen to on headphones in the frozen lands of the north.
---
It'll be a Scandinavian server, not a Norwegian server. A small distinction maybe, but there's a difference all the same.
---
Besides I don't think Scandinavians would mind communicating in English in official channels and stick to their own languages in guild chat etc.
---
I can't wait for the Human Orphan pet
---
I hope they at least killed the mob in groups of 5
---
Qq
---
I Agree... league is like the worst as far as community goes imho.
---
It really doesn’t matter if your top priority is class fantasy and visuals. A good player can overcame many PvP match ups with: skill/knowledge, gear, or consumes/engineering/items. It’s really not a huge deal at all. From a PvE perspective yeah Humans will do the most damage usually but it’s not too crazy and both Humans and NE have the same situation in PvP. Play what u like.
---
I was considering just doing the 2 characters that i wanted at 60, but figured if i'm doing it for just 2, i might as well do it for all 5 and dungeon grind.
---
People on the server you choose to play on will also have a similar schedule. You just have to reach out and find them and get together with them.
---
Everybody knows serious competitors drink Bawls.
---
I did, saw no sign of this. Link?? All i saw was them saying we would have "plenty of time"
---
yes officer this comment right here
---
That's awhile before they put in children's week I think. But who doesn't want a human pet?
---
Awesome - been wanting to check this out.  Thanks for reminding me.
---
I sincerely hope with all my heart that you just made this up
---
There is a really, really big difference between this launch and the launch 15 years ago.
---
Generally speaking, if you were playing on launch day 15 years ago, you planned on sticking around for some measurable period of time.  you just dropped 60 bucks on the game and another 15 for the subscription, you aren't going anywhere soon.
---
This launch is MUCH different. For only $15 (which is worth even less than it was 15 years ago) anybody can play, and if you already play retail then you get it completely free.
---
There are going to be literally millions of people who log in on launch day simply to experience it and then never log in ever again.
---
Let's be generous here and say that 25% of the people playing on launch day actually plan on sticking around. It is actually going to be much lower than that, but lets just say that for the sake of argument and be generous.  that means that in order to have a satisfying launch day experience, Blizzard would need to launch with 4x the realms, simply to satisfy the curiosity of 75% of the players and leave the other 25% spread out across 4x the servers than they otherwise should be.  
---
Layering allows them to essentially create "temporary" servers that the curious people will use, after which point those servers can be spun down and never used again. This will leave the remaining players spread across an appropriate number of realms.
---
It was 3 hours ago.
---
You mean all the people playing together and having fun on a stress test?  Yeah, they must be retarded.
---
Not all kills give loot afaik
---
Imagine having a couple hours a day to play and you spend it waiting in a digital line for quest mobs lol

They actually were. Some of the more popular realms got more bids, but the average realm was like a couple of hundred dollars. You have to remember that there was a lot of realms, and each one of them consisted of 4 server blades.
---
I disagree with your initial comment, but this one is on the dot. :D

This was equal parts helpful, and concerning lol. Thanks for this.
---
It's like people have a complete lack of comprehension of math. When you take the rush of people you see on pservers and split it over 30+ servers it's not a big problem anymore. Even if ten times as many people show up for Classic launch cutting it down to a third is a massive difference.
---
Hi mcconnel
---
I was here
---
Just for the record. If folder contains **only subfolders** that indicates these subfolders should be pasted into WoW Addons folder.
---
this addon at the top that tracks/gold/durability etc what is called?
---
Huh, I didn't know that.
---
nah, figured it out. There is a left click to interact with npcs setting, i must have goofed around and disabled that. works fine now.
---
pvers
---
To be fair ,thats like taking a 3 hours long movie, watching it in the middle for 5min and say "seems shit" :D
---
Damn, Gnomes look way better than pserver Gnomes
---
Ya I understand the idea of rolling on PvE servers. I usually do PvP events with guilds and stuff. Part of the fun is protecting your lowbies. Helping them out when they are getting ganked.
---
Makes the world feel alive and full of danger to me. To each their own. I see people multiboxing and I can't understand the fun it that either. Feels like they are just rushing through the game with as little player to player interaction. To me grouping with another guy to get something done, or to fight off the horde/ally scum is the game!
---
I know no one that plays PC games anymore lol
---
Please go away with this ugly douchebag.
---
city layering seemed weird compared to outdoor zones in the previous stress tests. Like there were more cities, or they were separately broken out or something.
---
Is classic live now?
---
Mankrik's wife cheated on Mankrik with quillboars and Mankrik killed her when he heard about it.
---
Don’t wanna sound like a douchebag, probably do, it’s just my opinion it doesn’t feel like it felt back then, layering ruins it completely for me, just funny to see all those people here going balls deep here on me for my opinion.
---
I’m used to it, it’s reddit, i don’t care about those pixels voting me down :))
---
You’re my hero now

They just jacked the respawns in starter zone. And thank god they did.

What’s RP in a world of factions without pvp?
---
Super-thrilled to see a "Norwegian" server!
---
But a request to my fellow countrymen: keep the norwegian out of general chat. There will be other nationalities present and its super-annoying for everyone else!
---
Yes won't have much time to play due to commitments. Would love someone to play with, I'm on EU though.
---
That’s simply not true, Druid isn’t nearly as weak at healing as people credit it for. It’s incredibly mana efficient, has fantastic group utility, strong buffs, and the hots enable you to get through situations where other classes can’t cover them.
---
I plan to be a fairly casual player and will be running a fairly casual guild with friend from life and retail wow. You're more then welcome to join us as we quest through wow at a leisurely pace and then hit up the end game with a less the optimal comp.
---
There's a metal insert so the drink never touches the wood i'd hope
---
Oh no, it has a lot of mobs disappearing mid combat. People getting killed being taken off flight paths because they accept a group invite. A rare spawn disappearing because they invited a guy on the same layer as them. If you took the time to watch it maybe you wouldn't be so in love with layering.
---
Ah yeah I went all the way to the back at the beginning lmfao. Was really fun
---
Can definetly confirm this. Mob spawns are near instant if there is enough players around. It was NOT like this in vanilla. The fact that they have dynamic respawn makes me optimistic in terms of layering; layering should be gone very quickly if they have these types of respawn rates.
---
Please do a /who and report the number of players per class here. 
---
This way can get an estimate what classes might be over-populated...
---
Doing a quick /who in the undead starting area on a EU server showed there is a massive amount a warlocks, maybe 25, followed by mages ~20 and priests ~15. no warrior and only 4 rogues!
---
Dynamic respawns was a touted feature for burning crusade, and they improved it with wrath. I don't have nor can find proof about vanilla starting zones having faster spawning with more players other than a few original devs saying so.
---
My game is stuck at 3840x2160. I cant change the resolution. Very annoying
---
No they were not, you could only transfer from high pop to low pop.
---
Like what? Most of the marketing was a banner on D2/WC3 Battle.net and gaming magazines/websites covering the game. 
---
They didn't have buses with Warcraft wraps or a crazy display at Times Square like they do nowadays.
---
&gt; each one of them consisted of 4 server blades.
---
One blade each for Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor   
---
One blade for instance groups if you could find them      
---
One blade for authentication, and in the darkness bind them.
---

Which is the best AddOn for tracking your energy? I tried NugEnergy but I couldn’t seem to find any evidence that the AddOn was working in-game.

Did the bad stream man hurt you? :'(
---
Hey McConnel looks like somebody got all the horses
---
Yea, not sure I understand why these lines form when you can kill like 6 level 3 jobs and get the same exp from the quests.
---
I remember these going for thousands of dollars. That’s awesome
---
That's... crazy talk. It's really frustrating to complete 2 quests per hour. It's like layering wasn't even turned on for this.
---
I got mine working, questie was the one having issues due to where I pulled was the github area so needed to clean some stuff up.
---
Yo this is some ayahuasca type shit man
---
I love it :D
---
They are guaranteed scarab lord no question about it
---
what do you mean?
---
I disagree. You had tons of video games ads in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s. 
---
Hell, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance had a tv commercial, but WoW/Warcraft didn't.
---
You're not allowed to switch. You have to play with the same faction until the sun blows up.
---
I did a run from the Tauren start to the troll one, just to see how bad it would be lol only 3 deaths is pretty good for lvl 1 I’d say lol
---
Content is gonna explode post launch
---
BiS Imp name?
---
I was just thinking about how they were selling/giving away these the other day!
---
I've enjoyed some of Asmond's beta content. It was fun watching them try to do Cathedral at level 30, but the guy is insufferable most of the time.
---
Mine also has two.
---
Honestly...this is a non-issue for me. 
---
If we lived in a world where Discord didn't exist, this might be more impactful (for good and for bad). But, we don't.
---
Just took down hogger with seconds to spare for the restart
---
I don’t think he’s trolling...
---
&gt; That’s simply not true, Druid isn’t nearly as weak at healing as people credit it for 
---
It's weak enough for most average/serious guild not wanting to bring more than one or two, mostly for buffs.
---
&gt; It’s incredibly mana efficient 
---
Most average/serious guild don't have mana issues because most fights take literally less than half the time it used to take. On top of that, the average player is much more serious about consumables, making mana even less of a problem.
---
&gt; has fantastic group utility, strong buffs, and the hots enable you to  get through situations where other classes can’t cover them. 
---
I agree. It's just not enough for people to want to use them over a Paladin, Shaman or Priest, which beyond doubt have much more raw healing people.
---
SERVSERVER DOWN!!!!!
---
omg blizzz
---
I’m much more pve oriented however I will definitely dabble in world pvp. I don’t really run very many premades unless I’m super bored. I do prioritize class fantasy however not at the cost of getting my ass handed to me consistently and wishing I had escape artist or stoneform on my side to get that vanish off. The main thing I don’t know is how often I’ll be relying on these facials out in the world or how much it would turn the tide of a duel/battle. Like will these racials be saving my ass a lot of is more of a situational thing that will rarely come in handy.
---
Any idea how long it’s down for?
---
Ye, I wouldn't say questie is working fine... it's functional, but not in great shape.
---
No way in hell I do that.
---
just got home from running errands and log in. server shutdown 10 seconds later. tons of fun.
---
Will the serves be back up?   
---
Or was that it?
---
where do you get that?  I don't see it anywhere.
---
more like skip the line
---
People are acutely aware this is just a stress test with a cap of 15. I don't think most people are playing what they plan on playing at launch.
---
Stun resist is the best racial for PvP. You're not "relying" on it, but it'll be more significant on average in PvP than any other racial ability.
---
Lol there was like a 20% modifier that slightly affected rates in vanilla. Nothing like this 500% spawn increase on a launch zone. But a worldwide simultaneous 2 million day one player launch never happened in Vanilla either so it's a pretty good compromise to make the game not frustrating for the first 20 minutes.  
---
It's definitely not *vanilla like* though.
---
Does that have to do with spell batching perhaps?  I still don't have a complete grasp on spell batching so I could be WAY off base here.
---
Human starting was like 50% warrior 30% mage and 20% the rest
---
I got instant disconnected when i tried to log in, anyone else had this problem?
---
its over?
---
I was the mage in my guild with the most dkp. I bid like 10 dkp over the max dkp of the next closest caster dps in the raid for claw of chromaggus. Our guilds first one.
---
A resto sham outbid me by 5 and got it. I felt so robbed given that Lok' amir drops from the next boss. I g quit and sold my account my for $850 on eBay and rerolled a druid on alliance the next day.
---
I am convinced that if you have more than 10 people in one area in classic WoW there is literally a 0% chance that someone WON'T be jumping

That definitely seems off.
---
Depended on the area.  There used to be an island in Loch Modan that was set so there would always be 2 mobs alive on it no matter how fast you killed them.  Was really frustrating because it had a pickup on the ground you had to get.

its over

What? i even called him a newbie instead of a noob. Everyone has been a newbie! ;) It's a path we all take.

Leveling a warrior as your first character is torture but you’ll get a ton of groups if you tank.

I don't know. I choose a class I won't play in classic just so I don't do the exact thing I will do. And a class that is good in the first levels (hunter)

EU PvE is down for a min while they fix some bugs

Easily Orc, 25% + 5% base means that you have around a 1/3 "fuck you" against the biggest threat to you in PvP, plus it's also massive for Enhancement if you want to mess around with that.  
---
Taurens racial can be basically replaced by picking up a Tide Charm.
---
Just don't do that on an RP realm... or maybe... do.
---
Ah gotcha, thanks!
---
That was so awesome
---
Trully a travesty
---
have you heard about screenshots?
---
everyone was a pala
---
I'm doing carnivore diet. the efficiency of eating only meat will bring me to only one BM every 3 days.
---
I will also be in incredible shape. No diaper can do that.
---
Yeah I'm playing a Hunter just so I can speed through and remember everything when I roll my rougue
---
funnily enough, it's more because there were many posts complaining about not seeing any advertising for classic
---
This stress test is stressing me out.
---
Diapers weren't meta after Cata, since flight times were too short and too infrequent. If you were remotely hardcore for mists you needed a catheter and porto-potty pit under your chair.
---
Classic has plenty of flight time/autorun time to change diapers and take power naps. Can't wait to take the tube out of my peepee.
---
Bro fuck you
---
You play the game to have fun. Play the faction that you want to play.
---
I was half-way running my Troll to Ironforge :\
---
Switching the game to Windowed mode crashes the game. The error reads "world of warcraft was unable to start up 3d acceleration"
---
LOL, I have it on my mage. Haven't played in so long though.
---
The part about auto shot and melee seems a bit vague. Can anyone on the stress test comment more on the current feel of melee weaving?
---
I might be wrong since i didn't start before later in vanilla, but i think these we're in the game in the beginning of vanilla. Or are they in retail aswell? Not playing retail.
---
No it's not, they're just applying some hotfixes and restarting.
---
Is test over? Severs just went.
---
Aye, same.
---
kinda disappointed they didn't move her around lol
---
Hey mango. I'm running a casual guild in NA. We out here.
---
RIP the naked troll stormwind raid
---
Looks like the pile of people right at the front to me
---
nice, got the old decoy boyfriend to distract her for extra playtime, eh?
---
Nope just a quick shutdown it’ll be back up soon
---
I was the guy that started the cut my life into pieces thread 3 minutes before shut down. /wave
---
You know how long until it’s back up?
---
Indeed, I just created a warrior because it was the default choice. I'm only here to set up my hotkeys and such.
---
I have no problem with streamers either. It's their shithead pathetic in-game, worshipping fanboys that are the problem.
---
Legend!

Looks like you died 50 times. well worth it.

---
How about no
---
They were, it's a leftover from the original beta, but it was in vanilla.
---
No, because that is straight out outrageous!!!
---
There were also dynamic respawns
---
No. As far as I know, the general consensus is that it has to do with the fact that they are running classic on the current WoW engine, rather than the vanilla engine.
---
Vanilla had spell batching and didn't have this lag problem. But currently BfA has it.
---
The big problem is, hunters are really really going to suck in high-skill-level PvP if it doesn't get addressed.
---
It’s just a restart. It’ll be up soon!
---
People are very chatty and groupy. This is good.

Figures, as soon as I get home from work to log in and try it out, the servers are down.

the server message said very short downtime, try again in 5!
---
Yeah. It wasn't like this on the last stress test at all. I was able to complete all starter quests even with tons of competition. Having to stop to drink (mage) or wait for regen in between pulls anyway made it really seamless and honestly fun! A warrior and I took turns helping each other kill kobolds in the Fargodeep Mine. They weren't respawning as quickly there as in the starting zone, but still more than any one person could handle without eating dirt.

/who is capped at 50 and I do not believe having a matching class ratio is part of the criteria for what you see after typing it. I wouldn't use this method to estimate class numbers.
---
HOW LONG'S THE RESTART
---
I thought it was a subtle read until I read monster, ruined it for me tbh
---
This makes me curious: how many 70 year olds do you know?
---
It is not over, just a restart to hotfix
---
It appears so :(
---
define....
---
"quick" ;)
---
MUH IMMERSION
---
who buys enchants prior to 60?  most enchanters give enchants away for free while leveling.
---
Got home from work, waited my fairly quick 600 person queue, started selecting my ballin'-ass Troll's tusks, thinking I'm about to type in Thextra and click create character......boom, servers GONE and didn't even get to dip my tusks into Classic...
---
Those eyedrops indicate that there is at least one bag missing from this photo..
---
[They were HP ProLiant BL25p's](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/WoW+Server+Blade+Teardown/9389)
---
nah they're just restarting don't worry, you can see the server list now
---
spotted the br hueauehueaue fdp
---
Hard to say, but I’ll add some. So you can spec imp sprint in one of the trees that will remove slows and snare once used. My recommendation is if you don’t want to roll dwarf or gnome but also want to try to rig the dice in your favor you will want engineering. To be honest, without engineering and racials you may have a tough time vs a few classes (but everyone has a hard counter), particularly rocket boots, mind control helm, goblin rocket helm, and of course grenades. Just having grenades vs some classes or skilled players can mean a lot in terms of getting away to vanish or stunning to close distance or stunning to wait on cool downs.
---
Send u in a PM
---
Don't be silly. The GMs gave a server wide warning pre timer. It's a reset with a few fixes. Jeeeeesus
---
IT'S ALREADY OVER?. What kind of cruel joke is this? It ends the second everyone gets home from work!
---
Having a weird error - the game is in fullscreen windowed mode. Whenever I try to switch to regular windowed mode an error message pops up saying "World of Warcraft was unable to start up 3D acceleration" and the game crashes back to desktop.
---
Anyone else getting this?
---
Oceanic server :( happens to all starting areas lol, stress test destroyed
---
&gt; You don't have to lvl up in 2 weeks. 
---
Lol tell this to the numerous guilds in the looking for group threads who advertise that they're all about work life balance, they're made up of older people so they understand you can't no life, yet they want to be clearing MC by the 3rd of 4th week after launch. To even be lvl 60 by the end of a month you need to be playing for about 8 hours a day, so a full time job. People's perception of how long it takes to earn something is warped as fuck these days, and it's going to come as a shock to many that simply hitting level cap takes longer than you devote to most other full games. Then you get to actually start playing wow!
---
I just double checked and I couldn't find anything extra.  I copy and pasted directly into wow and it cut off the last e, then I put it into a character counter and it's showing 256 characters.  Is the space after #show and /use supposed to be there?
---
Sens?

stuck about 1/5 from end of loading bar

---
&gt;THE FINAL STRESS TEST MEGATHREAD! August 8th 2019 [2 PM US Eastern]
---
WORLD SERVER IS DOWN
---
I also am stuck on loading screens
---
I appreciate the feedback but I actually don't understand-
---
I have contingencies for what to do if the fight goes wrong at every step-
---
Does the rogue open on you when you're not ready? Run.
---
Does the rogue catch up to you after the opener? Block his kidney shot, wait for blink, try to break distance again. Make sure you refresh iceblock before going in range of him.
---
Does the rogue reopen on you with a sap, trying to reset? Use Iceblock because point above.
---
Does the rogue open on you with a sap and you have no iceblock because you used it for a bad reason?
---
Blink away after and use your kiting tools to reset- sheeping if possible because that's the only way you're going to keep him off.
---
If you can't do those things- you die. Maybe I should've been clearer about that? I'm not really sure
---
Really appreciate the advice here. I’ll be primarily rolling with a feral Druid out in the world so I’m hoping that would provide a bit of sustain. And ideally I’d go alchemy herbalism due to fadeleaf and I feel like it fits my style better, either that or skinning leatherworking. The idea of a nelf rogue herbalist just feels right thematically. I totally understand engineering being the ultimate pvp tool due to grenades/rocket boots/battle chicken &amp; dragonlings etc etc, but I’ve heard it’s a total money sink and isn’t great at turning a profit. I feel like everyone and their mother will roll engi and I like the aspect of fulfilling a niche on my server and being the go to alchemist or master leatherworker in my guild. So I guess I’m realizing as I’m writing this that my priorities are much more aligned with pve and class fantasy so I’ll most likely go nelf or dwarf because humans are way too overpopulated, although it’s hard to say no to that raw dps increase. It’s a lot to think about. Knowing what you know about my priorities, the fact I’m rolling with a druid for most of the leveling process, and the rest of my situation do you have any final bits of wisdom for me that can help narrow my lens for choosing a race? Thanks again for taking the time.
---
"World server down"
---
Correct, I had to modify the folder. A lot of the addons available for download need to be slightly modified to get them to work. Some have additional text in the folder name, some have a "master" folder that needs to have the actual addon folder and option folders for that addon taken out of said master folder and then put into your interface folder. It's a lot of toying around, but you'll figure out if the addon works, it works a little, or not at all.

I will look into again - I just saw the tooltip, so I assumed working correctly.

regular windowed mode for about 2 hours, then switched to windowed fullscreen.

Plenty! I'll play anywhere between 3-10 hours a week. I imagine lots will be the old hardcore that now have life responsibilities.

Yep same
---
Loading bar stops at 75-80%, says world server is down on Stalagg.
---
Whow don't put that voodoo on us.
---
yup, go ahead and call me a casual
---
Finreaver here we come!
---
Seems to be that way on a couple servers
---
Learned this the hard way. Dinged 60 on whatever private server you all know about and decided it was finally time to hit up Valley of Trials for that sweet Orgrimmar rep. Each quest was giving like 20 rep.
---
I don't recall exactly, but I want to say somewhere around $400, maybe $450.
---
Me too man.  I played less than 30 hours of WoW total while being a gamer my whole life.  I started playing p99 in March and when I heard about classic I was hooked.  Can't wait to explore all this legendary content for the first time!
---
Just hope to find a NA PvP west coast alliance guild to that is okay with only two nights a week of raiding for me.

Gnome Mage here I come!

---
The sad truth

On my way to goldshire
---
Level to 10 real quick lol

does anybody have an actual idea how long the servers will beu up?
---
I love it when people say that like they’ve never heard of innovation and R&amp;D.
---
I tried installing ClassicCastbars but I can't seem to get it to work.  Using the little test function in-game works fine, but doesn't work for actual NPCs.
---
Iv watched  too many episodes of pawn stars haha
---
no just you
---
Why don't you try a ticket to get it renamed to your name?

sometimes there is some rewards for old players

Is there a current EU Horde guild recruiting?

I’m planning on playing with others this time.

“Each Faction has access to nine classes”
---
Doubt.
---
Same result here
---
You're making this way too difficult.  Just get a condom catheter and a fecal management system and you'll have zero reason to stop the xp grind.
---
&gt; Is reading really that hard? 
---
No, and being condescending is disrespectful and against the rules of this sub
---
&gt; people will need it in massive ammounts as soon as they hit lvl 60, and they will change gear constantly needing new enchants and so on. 
---
This implies that players will be constantly changing gear - while leveling - thus "needing new enchants".

zPerl with titanbar and domino. It'll look more like this https://imgur.com/LO9X46l (but not lopsided) once Icehud and bartender get updated (bartender is way better than domino)

Me as well. I can make a new toon and play it, but I can’t log back on to the toon I had already been playing
---
I make Classic WoW vids and 100% of the thousands of people who watch them are between the ages of 25-34. People around here talk about their old time raiding and balancing it out with high school or how their "hardcore" guilds were just a bunch of 14 year olds screaming into the microphone - I'm going to assume that most of the very dedicated raiding crowd back in the day was comprised of the teenage end of the age spectrum. Hence why we see almost the entire "hardcore" fanbase of Classic being aged 25-34 today.
---
I'm in, a GM is giving out gold and that special gm mount.
---
About 24h
---
That's great, thanks for the info!
---
11 pdpt tomorrow
---
This is the real classic experience as I remember it
---
&gt; does anybody have an actual idea how long the servers will beu up?
---
Probably will come down at some point on Friday.
---
Fun fact: you can insult people (even their intelligence) without saying they have a disability that actually impacts people's lives
---
I am getting the same error
---
My guess is that they are testing the "name reservation" mode of the client. You can make toons but can't log in.

Go RP PvP, I don't think any especially big streamers will be on there

Could report it in game.

I got outbid on a Maelstrom server like a second before bidding ended by $5.  Still pissed about it.

No, he's saying that Layering (which is for the benefit of those who wish to level faster than others) will damage the community experience of the rest of the players.

No gold on retail to buy month token &amp; adding all your bnet friends. Also if you have a vanilla collectors edition you won’t get the pets on a new account.

Cake day and stress test day. Lucky dude.

Did you play the stress test? Because it was waaaaaaaaaaay worse than this pic

Thanks a lot

Anyone else looking at the chat in-game and just lul'ing at the people that have forgotten what a grind the game is going to be? I remember it being smooth sailing until about the mid 20's and then the game became a slog.

I lul.

Thanks a lot got a good boom mic for it.

If you play in fullscreen your resolution gets maxed out too. No idea why.

I have a vega 56 and my card isnt enjoying fighting with wow rn

I've heard it's possible to rename your account once (maybe through support). Might take a look into that! I know it's possible as a few people on my friends list changed name

It was working fine for me and my friend.

I'd honestly suggest Northshore Megamax or pretty much anything from ABU. Abena and Tena are solid middle grounds that offer quality and are decently priced.

Don't go cheap with those awful diapers from Walmart or your local convenience store. They're just not worth it in any way.

Yeah there's a issue with full screen right now. Mines stuck at max resolution
---
does it stop at like 90% through the bar? thats what im getting
---
I don't have a down message but the world load bar got to about 90% and stopped, and the music stopped too. Which is generally a bad sign.
---
Servers are....stressed

Looks like a proto dynamic zoom was just added! O.o

No luck yet

As someone who played old school runescape for the first time in 10+ years, I can definitely say people will not complain about this. OSRS far more grindy and monotonous than classic WoW, yet I still was hooked and sunk in many many hours.

I think thats what they want, failing fast like this so they can learn their limits and avoid it at launch is the name of the game

imagine not skipping this quests due to the time it takes to accomplish
---
With a cajun French accent it's more like Blo-mow
---
not gonna advertise for free
---
I dunno how you PvP but that's nice of you to queue yourself out of my way! 
---
Good luck raiding with that baby mentality, maybe you'll hit T1 in a year or two if you queue up enough.
---
My Bagnon doesn't seem to be working. Does anyone have a link to where they downloaded their working one?
---
Super authentic - feels like it’s 2004
---
SAMWISE STRIKES AGAIN!
---
I won't be satisfied until I'm stuck in looting position floating around for a solid 10 minutes before the game spontaneously crashes. 
---
Also persistent dead bodies.
---
I never saw that in any mmorpg lmao
---
got discord overlay enabled?
---
Question about layering. Let's say I login and the game assigns me to layer 2. Am I stuck on layer 2 barring another player inviting me to another layer, or depending on when I login and how the population is at the time of login, can I get assigned to say, layer 1 or layer 3?
---
That's a very heart-warming thing to know!
---
ClassicCastbars
---
Leveling time for 36-40 always seems longer than 40-44 because of mount.
---
Wow, 3 GB of RAM and 2 dual-core processors.
---
It’s there now available to download
---
What is your nameplate addon? :O
---
speed means everything. the faster you are on the go, the faster your XP comes in. warlocks are good because they are kitted really strongly, and have low downtime so theyre always on the move. hunters are kinda lackluster in strength compared to a warlock but have the cheetah which can be good when used correctly going from place to place- not for mob grinding.
---
I feel a warm spot.
---
From what I’ve seen strafing is off when you are targeting something. Your torso stays aimed at them
---
hmm, didn't know that...
---
World Server is Down is the next sub meme fellas.  Threx is dead.
---
wow forums are experiencing intermittent issues as well, 502 errors and this error message galore "Due to extreme load, this is temporarily being shown to everyone as a logged out user would see it."
---
I said "throwing money at" not simply subbing. People who give him hundreds or thousands of dollars hoping he'll be friends with them, hang out with them, etc. Or for attention.
---
That's what I'm talking about, and that's pathetic.
---
I love that people use "borked" and virtually no one has any idea what it has to do with, even though it was only 32 years ago
---
Wait, no, it makes me feel old, and I hate it
---
It is known.
---
Thanks dad
---
You've never sat on the toilet reading your phone only to discover your legs are numb?  Toilet seats don't work long term.
---
It's likely a bug from when they implemented that behaviour for Hunters animations to make more sense in Legion.  
---
Worth reporting.
---
I’m playing on a real machine real monitor. My dell xps was pure trash and my internet constantly would drop me since the computer was in the basement. This was not good for 13 y/o me trying to OT MC and other raids lol

They said before the weekend, most likely Friday after the test concludes

I hear you. I really wanna ding lvl 15 before tomorrow so that I can run Deadmines, at least once, before the servers go down.
---
World server is down currently. I was in but logged out cause of addons :/

Idk about that but I just piss in jugs since my battlestation is in the basement.

Watching EU play while US is down -\_-
---
I don't know.  But I do know that the a majority of players will be from retail.
---
This actually reminded me of the great gnomeragon (good god that's not even close to the spelling) last year in October.  I came across some dude who was walking the entire thing, not just no mount but actually walking.
---
I joined him and chatted. More joined. It was fun. 
---
I'm really excited to just meet people while traveling and chatting. 
---
Were so close!
---
Midwest just got home. Wait till west coast hops on...
---
That was my home. My life is on that server.

Lol nice name. What does it mean?
---
I too was there on launch day back in 2004. Can confirm this is the authentic classic wow experience....10/10

---
Yup - stuck on loading screen.
---
Started a new character and still stuck on loading screen on new one
---
I would say quite a bit of people considering he averages 15k+ views on a dead game and there are a few posts about him every week.
---
not quite. The world record is  4 days 20 hours PLAYED... not real life time. The guy who did it slept every night. 
---
So its longer than 5 days in real life time... if you try and stay awake for 5 days straight youll kill yourself and if you dont, well staying up that long (even one night) messes up with your  metabolism and reduces its effectiveness which in other  words makes you poop more often. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
"We're bringing back Vanilla.  We're going to need that back.  Any backups on it by chance?"
---
Tomorrow.
---
You’re right that Engi is a money sink, but so can alchemy, it’s just alchemy has great QoL benefits and does get some good recipes later on, but I feel you also want herb to maximize this. But engi will never make you money really, it’s for personal use. As for thistle tea/fade leaf it’s a very low level mat and could be bought on main and made by friend or alch and farmed with a alt herbalist as well, so Alch is never needed just nice to have. Stay away from leartherworking unless you want to try and compete for devilsaur leather which likely will be a pain but definitely in high demand (this is where all the PvP tryhards and engineers will be); I think Lw makes more sense on a Druid or Hunter because the prebis pieces you can make are good and not needing Devilsaur so could even make a little money on that and craft your own set. Overall, herb/alchemy is a good combo and maybe your buddy wants to roll skin/lw or engi or something.
---
Also big note on your human vs dwarf/NE, maybe this is a given but I’ll state it again. So overpopulation is largely a class matter and not racial, but the human race can help to differentiate against other rogues competing for a spot, but that isn’t an issue I feel until like BWL, and overall is a factor of your guild style. So don’t plan for that, just play what you like. The people that only roll PvP races and engi I think are still the overall minority of players so again it’s not a huge deal.
---
One thing I did not tell you about NE is you can use Shadowmeld to eat/drink and stay stealthed in place and will have great synergy with your Druid buddy as well doing the same thing. And since he can cleanse poisons, the need for Stoneform dripped by 50% (other is to clear bleed). So honestly NE rogue and Druid looks really interesting for wpvp.
---
I don’t get much into steamers but like ‘how many subs did you get bro’ ‘gifted subs or sub subs’? Lol is that funny?
---
How crazy is that! I went from feeling like WoW was a magical world to being so tired of the grind. But yes, I can still remember being up in my friends attic game room and thinking how amazing it was to walk through a WC3 map.
---
Nothing to do my friend but wait :) Or you know, you can play with your wiener meanwhile. Always a good alternative.
---
Could you elaborate for those of us who don’t know the details? The models are the same right? But there are some changes I guess?
---
Make an easy script to click for you. Now if they randomized the location of the button on the screen, so you had to find it, move your mouse and click again, 10,000 times. I dont think many people would do it, lol

Need more dwarf tunes, Syn. You know what must be done.

Yup. Exactly right. There's a lot of people who don't understand that this is for the game and not for the players.

Except it s not intentional as it got fixed

From the game itself when you login, or from another player? Or both?
---
They’re noobs?

It was in vanilla though. There's footage on warcraftmovies of it working from 2005 if you somehow happen to have premium and can d/l the vid.
---
oh damn RIP
---
its literally stainless steel lol.
---
The new character models are so much better.  It's sad we don't have them.  My dwarf hunter looks fucking amazing.

It is the weekend

which one in the picture is that person i want to hate the right person not the other normal people also in the picture who you seem the be ignoring
---
Yea Asmon thinks he's some god among gamers, and feels cool for knowing about everything in Wow.  It is cool.  But you know when it isn't cool? The 99% of the rest of your life that doesn't involve wow.  I saw an IRL stream of Asmon and someone else in public walking around downtown, this guy has 0 social skills and cannot talk to a girl for the life of him.  It was the cringiest thing I've ever seen.

Awww, this was my wallpaper many years ago. Might have to use it again for old times sake because it's probably the closest I'll ever get to seeing naxx.

Nah, just toss in some psyllium husk.

They announced a server shut down for a hot fix, should be up soon
---
Yeah it's a bummer but I prefer an actually decent game over visuals
---
&gt; A++ number #1 shitpost
---
Can confirm.
---
They would still get +5 even after capping. They would have 305 for swords/maces effectively.
---
Yeah I was giving it some thought, atleast elemental shamans won’t be overpopulated haha, I can always pvp and dungeons then level a second character aswell if I find the free time
---
I actually studied under Carlo in college. The guy is a freaking beast. Literally. He's an absolute artistic madman who's built like a brick house. In the event you haven't yet, take a second to check out his other art on his art station https://www.artstation.com/carloarellano
---
He's also a total bro and came to my wedding this past March.
---
the requirements are insanely low, anything made in the past 10 years will run this on ultra
---
It's just all the hardware except the drives. Think of it like a full computer that used to host vanilla servers. You take the computer, remove the drives and replace the case with a shiny plexiglass case signed by Blizzard employees, and you auction it off for cash.
---
There's "lazy peon"s in the orc/troll start area.
---
Bad bot
---
I wouldn't even play the game....
---
just here for the gold
---
Cant even get on.
---
Is the world server suppose to come back or is the trial done for good?
---
That I did know.  This for a human male mage though.  When using the dressing room on Wowhead anything but bald and short cropped hair stick through the magister and arcanist helms on the back and sides.
---
Without a barbershop I have to make sure there’s no issue or play it safe with short hair.

Likely not, but i wouldn't mind that.

We will this weekend
---
where is everyone getting thier classic addons?
---
FYI You can do the same 'fix' on the blizzard launcher to, just expect text and images to be smaller.  Again this 'fix' is only applicable to though who run their desktop at above 100% scalling so likely only a small number.
---
For Shadowed Unit Frames to work you need to remove the "-master" from the folder name, and move the Options folder to your AddOns folder then rename it to "ShadowedUF_Options". I got it to work after doing all of that.
---
The Windows results are on [https://rk.edu.pl/en/benchmarking-and-analyzing-world-warcraft-performance/](https://rk.edu.pl/en/benchmarking-and-analyzing-world-warcraft-performance/) while Linux will likely have to wait to launch period.
---
More like why...
---
I’m glad there are no new models, I don’t like the new look of any race except maybe orcs. I really don’t like the fact that retail dwarves can’t have big beards without beard jewelry.

Holy shit I really forgot that it looked that way
---

WHOOPS.

[I wont forget about you Classic wow reddit bros!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kGV1-efddo)

It’s a stress test.
---
The servers were up and I was sat for a good 5 mins thinking they were offline still.
---
I believe it's ending tomorrow from what I've heard.
---
This is amazingly awesome.
---
Should go to a Horde then, because I don't think you can get there faster than the Zep ride.  Possibly jumping out of Orc and taking the boat to Booty Bay.
---
I literally cannot tell if that is or is not Macaulay Culkin, and I wouldn't be surprised of the answer either way.
---
This is an unsettling feeling.
---
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM  D:&lt;
---
IF there are 3 million concurrent players on 8 servers there would be roughly 38 layers populated at 10k per server. Double that if they are populated at just 5k. However if the concurrent for classic drops to just 1 million, then across 8 servers there will still need to be 12 layers per server. Idk how layers could be eliminated at that point with just 8 servers. Weird when you try to do the math. Time will really tell it all depends if the playerbase sticks around for longer than a month.
---
Ya I guess I should really get back to work
---
Disregard, it hasn’t been clarified. I’d guess midnight it ends tonight https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/what-time-friday-does-the-test-end/242611/9

Well, for fun, I made some more toons and they all saved, kinda felt like playing, good time to reflect on names too
---
People on EU are playing. US is not
---
Reminds me of adventure time
---
I'm sure they're expecting it to have more.
---
&gt; if you try and stay awake for 5 days straight youll kill yourself 
---
as a former alcoholic i met plenty of meth heads while in treatment who had gone 10+ days by the time they got there. were they loopy and unpleasant? sure, but still (for the most part) functional. they’d stay up until their most recent dose wore off and sleep for a solid 3-4 days, only waking up when the nurses would show up at their bedside to take their vitals and give them their meds.
---
Do you still need to hit level 55 before you can make a Deathknight?
---
Just like the vanilla experience to do this when people get off work.
---
It's all good man. I liked your video. Would be cool if you could show some full duels and commentate them as you play.
---
This question worries me. Having not played much since TBC, are the playable undead not known as the Forsaken anymore in retail?
---
&gt; Posts about leveling time

---
How do you break up much longer numbers? Say you were writing fifteen million and a half, would you have to write 15000000,5? We would write 15,000,000.5 which seems much better to my eye as it's more easily parsed
---
Like 30% of your time is spent travelling, maybe more. That being said, Warlocks are incredibly strong and benefit from not having to dabble in some farming to get their 40 mount. They shouldn't ever beat Hunters on a completely even playing field but otherwise they can definitely compete with fast leveling times if the player knows what they are doing.
---
Same story for mages, except they have the potential to AoE grind so they can actually beat Hunters in ideal circumstances.
---

Is 'need before greed' actually a real option to pick? If so, how does it interact with BoE patterns/recipes?
---
word, thanks
---
Y'know, mine did the exact same thing actually, but that was definitely not the norm. Every single tuesday I sit on the realm selection screen until it turns green. It may of been because they moved the realms around to different tabs and it broke the refresh?
---
This is exactly what i was thinking
---
It is lol!
---
No, blizz said that they were ["back"](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/groups/blizzard-tracker/activity/posts?category_id=172) an hour ago, this isn't part of the restart process.
---
Mobs in the starter zone are supposedly slower than those found in the rest of the world.
---
Well when you get some gear.
---
Dude! We did the exact same thing horde side Daggerspine. 
---
15 hunter AB's were wild. I actually have a screenshot at home, i'll try to remember to post it when im off work.
---
Wait how big is it?
---
Don't worry, this is part of why we are all trying to stress test.  At least you weren't like me and really confused as to why it was not launching, then spending a bunch of time going through Linux code only to remember maybe you should check server status. :)
---
And here we are.
---
Went to Chromie, chest spawned, got some silver, truesilver bar and some consumables. Likely around 50s. Respawns every 2h and with luck could contain things that vendor for gold...
---
I thought starting zone respawn times have always been way faster than the rest of the game, even in Vanilla. But I may be mis-remembering.
---
The moment that becomes possible, levels become cheap and meaningless to me, so yeah I would. I'd also stop playing classic pretty quickly.
---
Thought the same thing
---
It wasn't that long ago and so what? Not everyone's seen it so who gives af. If you've seen it just keep on scrolling its pretty simple.

It's over, pack your bags and go home

Nope! However a Death Knight doesn't count for anything until it hits either 58 or 60. I *think* that includes posting on the forums

But you can always level a toon to 10 for free, as you don't need a sub to level up to 20

---
Ok forums are getting blasted by nerds having issues so I can't freaking post my bug report. By chance does anyone here know how to fix the 3d acceleration crash? Everytime I launch the game the top half of my screen is blocked off by a nasty black bar, then it disappears, whenever I try and change any video settings the game crashes. 
---
I have uninstalled the game, ran it in compatilibilty mode, deleted the WTF folder, uninstalled and installed again, and again, to no avail. WTF do I do? (not trying to sound pissed but I am)
---
Playing devil's advocate here - people probably mean a few months post launch when they say stuff like "less than 200k". Not that I think the number will be that, just saying.

I used to roleplay for years and literally NEVER did i see roleplaying done in public channels. Even to this day after quitting i have never  seen it happen.
---
Its always either private channels such as guild chat or simply /say and /yell. And even then mostly done in secluded places away from the eyes of trolls (not the race but the playertype).
---
My server horde rp-community used to hold storytelling events in thunder bluff (infront of cairne) because it was secluded and most people never went there so trolls were at minimum. Had it been done in the middle of orgrimmar there would  have been significantly more outsiders being able to troll while waiting for their battleground queues.

---
Is it still down? I’m almost off work
---
They throttle login during the first part of the stress test. Once they are done with the initial period they open it up and all the issues go away, at least with the other tests.
---
Hi, I'm a diaper enthusiast from /r/abdl with some actual diaper advice. Everything you listed is crap. Barely better than the Depends garbage they carry at the drug store.
---
**Pullups**
---
No pullup can come close to the absorbency and leak prevention of a quality taped diaper. But if we're talking leaks rather than floods, or you're scared of learning to tape yourself up, NorthShore has two good options. These are comparable, trading blows primarily based on how they fit.
---
* [NorthShore GoSupreme](https://www.northshorecare.com/adult-diapers/adult-pull-ups/northshore-gosupreme-pull-on-underwear)
---
* [Abena Abri-Flex Premium](https://www.northshorecare.com/adult-diapers/adult-pull-ups/abena-abri-flex-premium-pull-on-underwear)
---
**Medical Diapers**
---
These diapers are intended for incontinence. They're much better than what most hospitals use, and will hold up to a good flood or two without leaving you sitting in a puddle. Again, using NorthShore products. Remember this company if anyone you know ever has incontinence issues, call them, they'll give great advice, it's an awesome company.
---
* [NorthShore Supreme Lite](https://www.northshorecare.com/adult-diapers/adult-diapers-with-tabs/northshore-supreme-lite-tab-style-briefs) - Thinner, lower absorbency, cheaper. They now come in colors!
---
* [NorthShore MegaMax](https://www.northshorecare.com/adult-diapers/adult-diapers-with-tabs/northshore-megamax-tab-style-briefs) - Among the highest absorbency diapers on earth. These can hold a lot. A bit more expensive.
---
* [BetterDry](https://www.northshorecare.com/adult-diapers/adult-diapers-with-tabs/betterdry-tab-style-briefs) - Notable for being the most absorbency per dollar of any diaper currently available (out of &gt;100 tested). They also come in printed versions, called [Crinklz](https://www.northshorecare.com/adult-diapers/adult-diapers-with-tabs/crinklz-tab-style-briefs-adult-printed-diapers).
---
**ABDL Diapers**
---
This is the good shit. Made by people who love diapers, for people who want really good diapers. They're expensive, and worth it.
---
* [Anything from ABUniverse](https://us.abuniverse.com/) - Notable are PeekABU/SimpleUltra (same thing, different print) for highest absorbency, BareBum and PreSchool for being the cheapest, and Cushies for being the cutest and also my favoritest.
---
* [Tykables](https://tykables.com/collections/diapers/products/overnights-adult-diapers) - They have velcro tapes which are refastenable more times if you're bad at diapering or take them off to use the potty.
---
* [Rearz](https://rearz.ca/incontinence/incontinence-disposables/) - Lots of people like them, but their tapes aren't as good as ABU or Tykables, and they've been involved in some sketchy trademark bullshit so some people boycott them. Probably the best option for Canadians.
---
* [Bambino Diapers](https://bambinodiapers.com/) - These were more or less the first ABDL diapers available back in the day. Their quality and pricing has fallen behind the others in my opinion.
---
Please let me know if you have any questions, and enjoy!

Spoilers:

The Lich King doesn't die and gets full of wrath because Illidan was not prepared for his burning crusade.
---
They do fit!.. but they ARE mildewed and smouldering, which is fine, if you are ok with fundamental differing.
---
Nax-Xmas-ramas
---
they're not nearly as bad as the average pirated server player though
---
yikes
---
Reminds me of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW9pGZAUEAU
---
usually cloth gear is reserved for healers (including pallies btw) and mages/locks. if youre an offensive caster outside of the "main classic spec", you will almost never get lootmaster loot
---
It still is unavailable to me though as "world down."
---
Yeah I got that working without an issue
---
Yeah, which means I had no excuse to order out and am now cooking dinner...
---
I can't log on :/  
---
Just keeps saying world server is down (OCE).
---
yeah....
---
They were back for about 10 minutes or so then just crashed
---
It's "world down" right now.
---
Did the character creation go live?  I thought that was aug 12?
---
My husband resubbed to play today. I resubbed very late last month, had 3 free days and said why not, then decided to sub because I wanted to play Vanilla.
---
There’s a few streamers I watch as well, but they definitely would never say some shit like that or encourage it. Asmon is really something else.
---
don't have chatter :(
---
I'm using pitbull cast bar and it works great, only drawback is that it must be attached to the unitframe
---
I'll try both, currently updating drivers. Gonna preemptively close out Discord cause I did have it open.
---
Nah im in on us
---
its wood so obviously not
---
This was known when they announced the stress tests
---
This guy retards
---
Or just set 144hz in the settings in game.
---
Not sure this game is ready for prime time.
---
You can just set the foreground fps to 144 or enable Vsync
---
Would you care to elaborate?
---
I was definitely considering it. Asmongold brought his army of Chronies there today and we followed them out as they rushed Durotar.
---
Yeah it is, but I have no issues with it in Wow. I get no Tearing at 144 Fps on a 144 HZ monitor.
---
Ill take no tearing and maybe slightly input lag any day of the week.
---
I typically go for it if available and I have the funds to spend.. It's not the end of the world if you don't have them though.
---
Yeah mithrilfist is pretty much just a slightly different ironspine

It was fine before the hotfix.
---
This is probably intentional.
---
No, you didn’t.
---
its mad when you think of what a 'server' represents to the minds of literally thousands of people - and here it is, just a collection of hardware
---
Mannn :(
---
Not knowing anything about computers, what does this help exactly
---
dude you made a post about which brand of diaper is best to shit in and continue to play
---
i think its too gross for you
---
yeah that was why I quoted it, some people will definitely pretend that they regret it for karma.
---
Seems like some are in...not working for me RN
---
I was on Bloodscalpe ! 08-2014. EU met a lot of hungarians and scandinavian on that server :P
---
Dungeons you can heal as shadow or just go shadow 
---
Raids ... you can maybe her to be the only spriest who’s job is to make locks look good and you’ll be the bottom on gear prio
---
That's not classic wow though.
---
I'll be honest, I'm not standing in line if I come across something like this. I'll fill a group so other people get credit too but I'm spamming Fire Blast on top of where the mob spawns.
---
They did a server restart like an hour ago, everything is still down.
---
[*British intensifies*]
---
You'll be able to heal in dungeon as shadow in none endgame content.
---
No leave that shit out of classic
---
Does Spreist not use the same gear as a regular priest? Can u elaborate
---
Unnecessary. Just tweak this setting.
---
https://i.imgur.com/5olHody.png

Than try disabling all the other addons one by one until pitbull reappears? That how I found out Chatter incompatibility

fix your fucking discord overlay ffs

Yes but I wouldn’t want to be on a separate server. That instant 60 server would have a messed up economy because of the lack of lower level players.
---
They have no integrity.
---
You got to Chromie through the plaguelands??
---
This is actually really good for testing purposes. It will be great to see how different this release will be from the real release in two weeks.
---
I'm British.
---
No not at all.
---
Yeah, just tried to log in and still getting "World Server is Down" error.
---
Blizz edited their stress test post and removed the "will stay up until Friday" portion, I wonder if we broke something major and the stress test is already over :(

Lol it's pretty accurate so far tbh
---
This is why you need a group of 5 troll rogues to follow and grief the streamers.
---
Yeah sorry, pants still drop. Just not the whole set like when MC was first released.
---
input lag can get you killed, no thanks
---
Down for over an hour now friend, no rush home.
---
Someone should write an addon for this so that people wanting it could have it and leave the people wanting no change alone
---
Yesterday he went on a huge rant about pitbulls, and how they are vicious killer machines.  Fan of his since he was 8k subs on youtube.  Dropped him then and there, realized he's not the same guy I watched talk about the golden dragon store mount.
---
This is the 4th stress test we've had... it's also the most stable and playable for the first 2hours.
---
Vsync causes input lag. It’s better to leave it off and cap your fps at 144.
---
I mean unless you're setting me up to insult the british cultural standards of STANDING IN LINES. Not sure what this exactly implies.
---
 If you've got to travel, by the Nine Divines, stay on the road. It's the Daedra, you see
---
My buddy I was doing Stress TEst with had this issue and Closing Discord fixed it. He updated Driver and Direct X.
---
Link?
---
It doesn’t. OP is confused.
---
No because there's +healing gear, and there's +damage gear.
---
They don't cross over in Vanilla.
---
Not in my classic, fuck diaries. Your accomplishments are shown by your gear/renown.
---
Can you actually access the information on these?
---
Spoiler: It won't
---
Anyone got a working version of clique going?

this really doesn't seem bad to me

---
Well blizzard, consider your servers FUCKING STRESSED. We crashed the fuckers.
---
Wait.. is tool on spotify now?
---
Yeah, you're right. I remembered that they would split instances off into their own server as we would see people in raid instances surviving a whole realm crash. Given the fact that you'd be booted to a load screen on boat rides between CO tinents, that makes sense.
---
As for EU and US servers, I can't remember if they hosted anything outside of Irvine, CA or not.
---
Lol wtf
---
why
---
hey i finally got in (us pvp)
---
5 second rule works, you just have to rename the file
---
Where does the chest spawn? In the room with her?
---
&gt; You don’t roll specs in classic wow. You roll the class.
---
I wish more people understood this instead of trying to make their meme dreams come true
---
Oh god, so it's not just me that's annoyed by this. 
---
It seems there's two settings:
---
1) Really slow mouse cursor movement, but precise camera movement
---
2) Normal mouse cursor movement, but stupidly fast and disorientating camera movement.
---
Why?????????????
---
Agree to disagree.  I think parts of the new technologies and tricks will help reduce maintenance and upkeep costs.
---
Running server farms on Amazon Web services is probably cheaper, more reliable, and easier to scale than having your own hardware like Blizz did back in the day.
---
Using commercially available engines like Unity will offload much of the bug fixing (at least bugs related to the engine; unlike what Blizz had to deal with back in the day).
---
Updating content may be easier and cheaper now that you can buy graphic assets and use procedural generated environments.
---
The game theory for balancing game play is much more sophisticated than it used to be.  I'd bet there are even college courses in it now in game development programs.
---
A bigger threat to me is the lure of a cashout.  Something like Minecraft; a wonderful game with a wonderful community until Microsoft decided to use its cash pile to "buy" that game and community.  Any small developer with a massive hit MMO is going to be really tempted to sell out their heart and soul for the pile of cash.
---
for real, "OH GOD I NEED TO FINISH THIS QUEST OR I'LL NEVER HIT 60"

If they made an addon I wouldn't mind. It does effect anyone else
---
Equip your HS in your ranged slot and accidentally hearth from your dungeon run.
---
They are! All their albums plus the new single for the new album
---
If they want to give the streamer scarab lord, then at least you know when the gates are gonna be opened.
---
31 arms. Prot tree will give you defiance, imp shield block, and last stand.
---
I would rather play for 10,000 Days.
---
Is request a stop while on a flight path a bug? I know that feature is in retail but I don't remember it being in vanilla
---
Some of us will be poopsocking it.  Old school style.
---
Don't point! Don't even look at it.
---
&gt; once the threat is under control
---
lul.
---
You act like its WF verses nothing. 
---
Its 100% warchief's that lets Horde do better or well. And that has a significant CD and a life span on Classic.
---
Are they skinning things in wow like the league skins now?
---
And me too! FOR THE FUCKING HORDE
---
Kill yourself
---
If you zone into the raid you Id is locked and you have to wait until reset.
---
Update on ElvUI:
---
[No. It will most likely be Post Launch. As far as development goes on it.. This has been a really short cycle time and ElvUI is quite large. You guys don't understand the amount of under taking it actually is to make it work in Classic.](https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=4282&amp;start=30)
---
Can this get added up top, I know a lot of people are likely interested.
---
&gt; and the design
---
Yet you want to change the graphical design
---
Dungeons? Probably, but expect to be drinking a lot between pulls.
---
Raids? Possibly, but it will be hard to find a group. There is often room for one shadow priest to get the shadow weaving debuff. However, it’s possible that this is sometimes filled by the role of a healer who just specs into shadow. If the raid already has one shadow priest, your chances of finding a spot are basically nonexistent.
---
You need to install the Classic client then log in once for the folder to be there.
---
YAHT is working for me.
---
had to do /yaht and click lock
---
Time for a visit to the Otolaryngologist or Neurologist.
---
When was the last time they did?
---
Awesome thank you for the info.
---
I'm going to be doing exactly that this next week and I look forward to your thoughts when I smash rogues by blinking the ambush ;)
---
This is what we call an epic gamer moment
---
I installed WeaponSwingTimer and while it did time my swings, it completely prevented me from casting any spells at all while it was active.
---
I always thought this was a silly joke, guys? It's just a good ol silly joke right
---
Yes, you are. Asmongold, along with most streamers, plays a character in front of the camera.
---
I was able to do it without much problem right at launch.  Just make sure to grab a group of 5 from the people standing around and it's not bad.
---
This poster really captures that magic moment when 4 party members are sitting around, waiting for that 5th member to arrive and someone plops down A Basic Campfire. You're not on an RP server, but you just can't help but /sit next to it. Soon, each member joins in, chatting up a storm, spamming emotes and chilling out. 
---
Fun times.
---
Ripped from barrens.chat forums.
---
It's clear it's Windows 10 with a skin. Either ClassicShell or StarisBack++.
---
I'm using the same tools and UxThemePatcher to make mine look like Windows 7. Default Windows 10 is so disgustingly ugly.
---
Wasn't there also autoloot and CD timers on ability icons?
---
Yep modern wow, but it wont be long before they infect the vanilla crowd after launch.
---
JPG versions (lower quality) here: [https://imgur.com/a/B9GFGuc](https://imgur.com/a/B9GFGuc)?
---
Asmon is more of a tool and at least Soda is actually a very skilled druid.
---
I'm sure they both deserve ganks.  But I'd be more against asmon.  He was the historic vanilla/bc player you never wanted around.  He freely admits he ninjalooted often and was a dick in his old days screwing over guilds and server transferring after screwing people over.
---
He's not that anymore but he is extremely self-serving.  He afks' watching other people's videos "reacting" while begging his streamslaves to shard him into rare spawn kills for the rare chance at a mount.  Just the way he "plays" the game is pretty disgusting and his constant monetizing of other people's content (even if it does benefit them, which is arguable).
---
It really has, it’s incredible how well it still holds up.
---
Same
---
I know about 40 people who have committed, maybe 5 are active players. Mmall sample size, but interesting.
---
Why would he need to talk to other girls when he's already in a relationship ?
---
i've pointed out multiple times you don't understand how it works.
---
only very very rarely would there be another boss up at the same time for you to hop to.
---
Thank you for the comment! Wasn't that obvious for me, didn't pay much attention to the UI
---
It wasn’t in vanilla, no
---
&gt;What does it add to the game to have potato quality character models? 
---
Same thing the shitty OSRS models do. Gives the proper experience. 
---
I personally like the shitty models because it feels right.
---
no u

This is my pipe dream that I know will never happen. Split the timeline. Release an expansion to Classic WoW in which we go through the Dark Portal to an alternate-alternate-alternate Draenor. Keep the good, but tweak certain things that led retail to the path it eventually went down. Have the story played out slightly differently, in a way that continues to diverge as time goes on, staying more faithful to the Classic-style gameplay experience where we never become intergalactic saviors, but rather take on a slew of threats to Azeroth, some familiar and some entirely new, in the oldschool semi-sandboxy style of vanilla.
---
It's not remotely feasible. But I can dream.

Even the font looks like it's been reverted to how it was in Vanilla.

Rat man? A lot of people apparently.

you'll find the HIW Cosplay set available next to the Sexy First Aid Trainer cosplay set.
---
The seller may have been in the US but the producer of the cup wasn't.  The literal exact same mug is sold by multiple sellers, who put their own plaques on it and resell.  Who knows where the original materials come from?
---
In a react video I watched recently he was just begging his streamslaves to shard him into a specific rare spawn to kill and get a chance at the rare mount drop which of course would go to him and not any of his streamer friends who invited him.
---
His mount offs are bullocks when thats the way he "earns" mounts. And then he's all elitist about it lol.  Jesus this kid didn't succeed in vanilla and wouldn't succeed in classic except his endless supply of tools begging for attention.
---
I saw he had over 50k+ viewers on twitch today and I usually see him around 20k so quite a few lol.
---
CD timers were done by AddOns if I remember correctly.
---
There's almost zero incentive to actually do this quest so it makes sense people are patient. When people are actually trying to level, I don't think this will be the case at all.
---
As a psychologist I find that... sick ... sickness
---
I am from Norway and I find this very very sad. One of the very things that make wow a masterpiece of a game is community and the abillity to interact and play with people regardless of who they are in real life, regardless of their gender, age, religious beliefs or where they are from, we can all play together and create a community. Together. I find it very nationalistic and sad that you only want to play with fellow Norwegians in classic.
---
It's too late 
---
r/cursedcomments
---
1 polygon armor on 1 million polygon models, don’t see how stupid your suggestion is?
---
It wasnt in vanilla, but they added it because people would just log put to dismount Anyway back then. QoL addition.
---
Or just really bad at rating things.
---
Absofuckinglutely!  This game is too good to miss, especially on a fresh launch!
---
You tell us. You are an adult and should be able to make decisions on your own.
---
He might mean the react videos.  I have admittedly at first enjoyed some of his opinions, his championing of classic, and even some of his antics in beta that wind up on youtube.
---
However the more I consumed the quicker I realized how bad of a person he was and really how he was barely adding anything to the videos he "reacts" to so I started curating my own good youtube personalities that wound up on his channel and get it all from the source now.
---
He's just so selfserving it's painful.
---
They want a copy of your ID to change anything
---
Well, I guess thanks for being straightforward about it: But I knew this already and just want other people’s opinions.
---
Anything on kalimdor for alliance, for example lol

Nothing about this post is healthy and I hope you're a troll.

That's a cool macro, but how to you bind it to left click (while left click still functionning) ? :)

Salut,
---
Phonétiquement, le son « eu » fait partie du genre de voyelles dit « centrales ». Ça veut dire que le schwa (l'«e» neutre comme dans le») est assez pareil à ce qu'on entend par «eu» ou "oeu". Tu as trouvé un bel exemple mais il faut remarquer que la prononciation de l'«u» dans murder se mue à cause du R. Alors, bien que tu puisses le trouver bizarre, je dirais le «oo» dans «book» (une voyelle centrale plus ”fort" que celle du schwa) est le son le plus reconnu aux américains. Laid, oui. Mais si tu regardes le tableau API tu verras ce que j'essaie d'expliquer.
---
Bref, aux anglos : blow-mooh (blowjob, book)
---
Hvilken server er det? Jeg er dansk og vil gerne være med på Skandinavien serveren! :)
---
We queue.
---
Ah yes I agree with that.  I hope the mods do a good job and maybe this sub will survive launch and be an OK visit on occasion.  But I'm worried it's going to go south real bad.
---
It's like a new Tool album
---
How so?
---
yeslad
---
Crazy! I'm coming from a software engineering on the web background, we usually just have 1 load balancer going to a fleet of web servers (there are exceptions to this, but generally speaking), so the idea of dedicating a specific server to a specific task, or more specifically to a collection of ZONES, is pretty interesting.
---
I would focus on
---
- lion's strength (only 1 earthroot, melee dps tends to really care about their stats more than casters, very expensive replacement)
---
- ogre's strength (this is an insanely valuable recipe as it uses super cheap ingredients to make a potion that is not obsolete until level 38). there is no 15 strength elixir, so if you get the 8 str elixir, leverage the scarce recipe. 
---
- fortitude: this never becomes obsolete, so if people can't afford the wild steelbloom, just wait until they hit 60 and start raiding. This is THE REASON wild steelbloom is so expensive.  Make these, but don't sell them for too cheap and regret it later. 
---
- The 2 earthroot/2 briarthorn elixirs, I am a bit leery of, because it's tough for people to actually have the money to buy them in time to really care about them. I would focus on fortitude (because it's replacement is so expensive), and skip troll's blood in favor of it's big cousin unless earthroot is really cheap. Wisdom should have some volume as it's used in crafting, but I would test the market before going in, as briarthorn is such an easy way of powerleveling alchemy that it may be expensive for that reason. 
---
elixir of wisdom may have a suitable price as it's used in crafting, but I don't feel that it's as easy to sell elixirs to casters as melee. 
---
then there's the pvp potions, which you want to pay attention to (switfness/FAP). 
---
Anyways, best of luck.
---
Oh you good then
---
If you're okay with the possibility of getting sucked in, then yes!
---
If you look at it this way: it's $15 for a month of entertainment with no time limit within that month, like Netflix but you always know what you want to watch. Plus, you can see what all the fuss is about, and experience the launch, which you won't be able to do later on.
---
I think it's worth it for a month, whether you think you'll like it or not. Definitely worth it if you think you will.
---
I just had to log in and now its there, sorry im an idiot guys and thanks for the help! &lt;3
---
Clique does work with classic used it tonight
---
How helpful
---
OP pretending he’s too good to poopsock it
---
How long are your bowel movements? Might need a dietary change.
---
Because it's stress test and it doesn't matter.  Being internet "famous" in the line is more successful than actually hitting level 3.
---
If anyone does this on launch they're pretty dumb and extremely inefficient.  But we all enjoy the game differently.  So if enjoying lines is your thing.....  "Play how you want."  I use the word play loosely because sitting in line isn't playing.
---
That was /played though. He still had normal sleep schedule.
---
I genuinely can't tell if it's fake or not. It's so informative....Idk if I'm amazed or disgusted.
---
While listening to 10,000 days
---
Silly question, but where can I go to find addons for wow classic?
---
Shit so it's a lag issue? That's unfortunate. Odd that it worked fine back in 2005.
---
You mentioned a mouse with other buttons so I figured you could map it to one of those.
---
I agree with you, it was a good addition to retail, and I'd like it in Classic.
---
Why is it called a server blade ?
---
Actually, it did! If there were raids on one of the main cities and players from both factions swarmed in, it would crash the server. Good times.
---
I can actually make right-click fire another key to start auto shot using Naga but then I have weird behavior with right click, like not being able to release the button (virtually speaking)
---
Yeah this is probably true its hardcore wow players LUL
---
You know a lot of "fresh 60's" buying enchants on quest rewards and crap greens?  Most people only buy enchants for BiS and raid drops.  So "constantly changing gear" seems more like "based on raid drop luck, a handful of 60s will need new enchants every week".
---
I think its awesome to hopefully see players totally new to Classic (Vanilla), i welcome you all and excited to group up with you guys the 27th!
---
If you played warcraft 1- 3 you'll have enough knowledge to understand where the factions stand and what's going on for most of the game.
---
Having said that you sound like you like to learn more lore so you can either watch some wow lore youtubes/podcasts, pick up the expanded universe books, head over to /r/warcraftlore, or just go down the wowwiki rabbit hole.
---
People who are hardcore enough for this to matter should really have people funneling them gold for mounts.
---
Then how come others were in a queue?
---
I would be ok with it aslong as it's by choice. Not sure if it's possible on a tech level tho.
---
Yes. Classic and BFA are both worth checking out.
---
Y'all remember Simon sinek?  This time you gotta break that rule and prevent someone else from getting what they want.  The bagel

---
What do u mean educating themselves? Do you live in the woods or what? It's just sad someone in DK have a better view of our country than yourself living in it.
---
Curse, filter by "Classic" under the patch, then for each one, open up its page, go to its files section, then make sure its listed as 1.13.X in the patch. Many for 8.2 will work, but some won't be right
---
Also WarcraftTavern
---
In what universe does DFT have a proc effect?
---
when/where did they talk about this?
---
Fucking amateur. If you take enough opiods, you don’t need a diaper at all.
---
Idk this was years ago. The goal of the irl stream was to get Asmon a kiss downtown one night.
---
With your attitude you wont have a guild or a premade to join to, oh you retail babies will learn soon enough.
---
Please don't encourage people to not go on streamer realms so we can have all the retards in one place thanks! =)
---
Anyone aware of a windowed world-map addon (a la Cartographer) that's functional?
---
It. Doesn't. Matter.  There cannot be multiple spawns.  There can only be one and when it's dead it's dead until it respawns.  You can't have multiple groups/guilds killing multiple bosses within whatever the respawn timer is going to be.  These are not loot pinatas where there will be tons of different spawns on different layers all week long so everyone gets kills.  Stop trolling.
---
Blues are pretty rare while leveling.
---
You mostly see them in dungeons.
---
&gt; Once again the sentence literally says "as soon as they hit lvl 60 and they will change gear" 
---
It actually doesn't say that.
---
What it does say is this:
---
&gt;people will need it in massive ammounts as soon as they hit lvl 60**,**   
---
&gt;and they will change gear constantly needing new enchants and so on. 
---
It does not say
---
&gt;people will need it in massive ammounts as soon as they hit lvl 60 and they will change gear constantly needing new enchants and so on. 
---
The comma signifies two different circumstances not a combination.
---
This is awesome!
---
How is it not? You could have literally jumped into a moment where something just happened to him and thats why he was "whiney"
---
I mean with all the grunting she must be so constipated.
---
To be fair he's being sarcastic. I don't think he minds all the money the idiots give him but I think he would do without the hord of dimwits following him around.
---
Huh?
---
some classes move faster, some classes kill faster, some classes move fast and kill fast
---
there is no one 'true' answer
---
Nawwwww
---
#nochanges!! Jk. No pet tab, just take one at a time from bank.
---
Awesome! I was a Bloodhoof Hordie as well! I distinctly remember that guild name now that you mention it. If you have any other memories of our realm I would love to hear them. I was just thinking yesterday how I wish I logged more guild names, character names, etc that I now sadly forget.
---
One memory that sticks out was meeting an alliance human character named Starman. Usually I didn't help alliance, but this guy was having trouble with a cave of ogres. I think we were high 40s or low 50 in lvl. Well I helped him out, we waved goodbye, and a little while later he rolled a horde alt and I levelled with him here and there on an alt. Great times! Game kept me out of a lot of trouble as a kid I'm sure.
---
Not the time or the place for the convo. But youre out of your fucking mind if you think the streets arent safe lol. You must be absolutly terrified adn isolated to think thats the case
---
So there's going to be a whole new client to play classic? I thought it was just going to be a series of servers.
---
So wait, are we not allowed to name our character after, let's say, a famous character from a different Blizzard game?
---
Hemorroids on steroids
---
Soda throws [similar tantrums](https://youtu.be/eWAdB8IEb_o) over loot.
---
"top level players" xd
---
I imagine there'll be a addon very quick for it, possibly also keep auto attacking switching between melee and range.
---
do you want 15k+ reasons?
---
Imagine complaining about it to the point that Blizzard gives everyone their own personal instance, and then complaining that the game sucks because there's no point to playing it anymore, so Blizzard brings back the best version of the game that compelled players to interact with one another, and then complaining about it again 15 years later.
---
Server seems fine now
---
&gt;Is rolling on a PvP server asking to be constantly ganked and struggle to complete quests?
---
Yes. It adds to the danger of the world.  Learning how to counter a gank and avoid being ganked can be quite fun.
---
There's an option to turn on timer on action bar. Not sure where though as I'm not at my PC atm.
---

All I heared was I should get some cocaine
---
I'm already so fucking hooked. I levelled a human paladin to lvl 8, got 2 green items in the process, went to Stormwind and actually managed to sell some pants for 10 silver. Then I went to Ironforge and tried to walk to Menethil harbor but died so I created a night elf to walk around in Teldrassil. 27th feels so far away again.
---
U were in the guild called guild right?
---
you don't 'feel betrayed', you feel like you're 'betraying' others
---
If you're trying to sound clever it's not working, because you're wrong.
---

---
Definitely seemed to be some dynamic or reduced spawn rates on mobs
---
It's always worked this way in wow.  When an area gets overloaded the spawns increase.
---
There are groups that have more strict rules for their RP sessions, but you don't have to join in on those. The information you learn in-game is really all you need to know to get started. You can RP an average joe who hasn't ventured far from their home base until you recently, then build them up as you level. Some people use accents and more race specific phrases to talk with, but no one will look down on you for not doing that.
---
Do characters from stress test carry over to the full release? Please
---
Skååål
---
There's a unbloated version of Windows 10, Windows 10 LTSC. Its meant for corporate use, but there are ways for regular consumers to install and use it. It only gets security updates, no new useless feature updates and all the crap thats usually preinstalled.
---
Me too plz!
---
shhhhhhhhhhhhh don't ruin it for the kid
---
Community implies that they are somewhat civilized...
---
Feels like a hunters mark/ pet attack &amp; start shoot macro would be better
---
Resto shaman or druid.
---
I've gone back and forth for months and I'm almost exactly 50/50 on my desire to play both. 
---
As a R druid I'm concerned with HoT overlap and my effectiveness in pve and ability to get a raidspot. Only being a flag runner in pvp.
---
As a R shaman I'm concerned with the uselessness of full resto in pvp, and my unwillingness to grind to respec. And overpopulation with more gear competition. And totem twisting. 
---
I enjoy shamans in pve more
---
I enjoy druids in pvp more
---
Cant decide
---
Gonna just assume this is a fun post. If it’s serious?  You need help........badly.
---
That's really great news. Thanks for letting me know!
---
    there's any quest helper?? i was using pfQuest on private but doesnt work in this classic
---
Smelly?
---
No they don't
---
My man. have some tacos!
---
That video was insanely useful. Thanks a lot!
---
Most certainly not.
---
They weren’t worried about them being used, just that there was no data on them.
---
How did you get Dominos to work? It isn't even shown in my addon list.
---
&gt;Someone gave me platinum/gold, but I don't want it. How do i remove it please? 
---
Not only can you **not** remove it, /u/Ketchup_Sniper, but the awards caused your post to show up on the Gilded filter, so now thousands of Redditors with no intrest in Warcraft know you as the guy who shits in his pants for the sake of a video game, and gives people recommendations on how best to do the same.
---
Enjoy your Internet fame.
---
You can use Azeroth Auto Pilot. Only one I have tested and can confirm it works.
---
This is pretty funny.  No one takes the initiative to start a group.  We just huddled up on Sarkoth.  This might lead to some frustrating first couple days.

wtf does that even mean
---
yeah, but it seems like its not a buff on me, i cant look out for it..
---
Why is there just so many goddamn fanboys for someone playing a damn game
---
No. For me it's about the journey
---
Yeah same here. I'll take a look for it later. Thanks.
---
That's where good quest management comes in, skip stuff like this
---
Thank you! I do want to learn more and will definitely check these out!
---
Blauh moo

kek
---
Lol only pallys are fast tagging. Only ones with instant tag skills at that level, in that zone
---
This is not needed, you can only run wow in windowed mode so it will have the refresh rate you have set on your desktop. You only need to change your max fps in the settings. Don't PSA with incorrect information.
---
Dang man, the chill days of WoW before it became all tryhard and fancy setups. Miss it.
---
No, absolutely not. No Warcraft lore names, either (Thrall, etc).
---
Remember, sentimental value means nothing to others.
