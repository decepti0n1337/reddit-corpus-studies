I dunno, it just sounds like he's trying to cover it in some really poor way like "oh no that can't be it, I mean I wouldn't know but that's probably not what happened and that's not how it works."
---
---
---
Call me a masochist, but I've enjoyed leveling as holy. Currently I'm almost level 45
---
Are there any 1h weapons worth using whilst leveling a priest? At level 26 now and have picked up some pretty decent offhand items, but there are no 1h maces or daggers that seem worthwhile at all.
---
They sell that high due to inflation. That gold will have similar purchasing power as 10g does now by then.
---
What happened to target cast bars? Did they take this out? Or is it just me?
---
I think I just got lucky man
---
I honestly lite them away from my chicken, so it can keep going and make it faster. Tbh, never even considered them sticking around and wrecking someone.
---
It also makes the sky darker at night
---
That is actually what I thought happened - he took rend damage which broke the channel , but I didn‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs how it worked
---
that is in raids, not grinding.
---
This right here. This is why I play
---
liftedleaf_ gave you a laundry list of significantly better choices. Basically, aoe spells are tuned to do less damage to a single target than a single-target spell would be tuned to do. 
---

---
That Mage was just chucking instant casts at a full-health Priest in the hope that the inferior dps of them would win out before his mana pool was gone. Yeah, he used Fireblast and Cone of Cold, but he should've been throwing Frostbolts instead of trying and failing to style on the Priest with Arcane Explosion.
---
Depends on my mood. Easy 1 shot? Dead. Do i have to actually try? Not dead. Can they potentially kill me? Not gonna find out. Questing near me and I get fed up with them tagging mobs? Kill them when they take more than 1.
---
I agree that layer abuse is running rampant.  The difference between you and me is that I layer shame people at every chance I get and continue to play the game the way its meant to be played.  You're making yourself look bad.  Just stop arguing now
---
You should be easily able to kite every melee mob in the game across the world without ever getting hit with enough room, with just rank 1 frost nova, and rank 1 frost bolt.   
---
  
---
Frost nova -&gt; max range frostbolt -&gt; (run back and frostbolt) x3 -&gt; frost nova.
---
Shaman leveling ?
---
I‚Äôve heard off specs are fine to heal/tank for most of the du geons. I plan to make this a majority shaman healer dungeons alt character. Let him get rest XP in the meantime. 
---
As far as talents go will I be more useful using something other than rests up to a certain point? I‚Äôm only beginning at lvl 10
---
This might sound dumb but this isn't like the twitch app where the streamer are from is it?
---
Outside of the occasional murder spree I go on induced by Alliance ganking the shit out of me in an unfair way (groups, high level, ect.), I leave em be until they hit me. Sometimes I'll even help them. You try to kill me? You die, and your corpse is spat on. You try to kill me after I HELP you? You're gonna wanna log off buddy, cause the rest of your gameplay is gonna be corpse runs.
---
Oh, I told him.  He yelled at me and told me that I didn't deserve a tip at all.
---
As if tipping almost nothing wasn't clearly enough of an insult.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm having an easy time questing. Since it doesn‚Äôt take 5 minutes to get a level in the early game zones are still populated. Wow feels alive again. It‚Äôs a nice balance.
---
i went to desolace and only found like 3 quests there as horde
---
Mods please delete this thread it's getting in the way of all the dad gamers posting pics of their first 6 slot bags they got on classic
---
Fear cannot make you walk off a ledge, so there‚Äôs nowhere for the Tauren to run.  Fear taking people off the boat was a private server bug and never a thing in classic after the very early patches where they fixed the bug where fear could make you run off a ledge.
---
I vote Durotar worst starting zone.  The northern part with the canyon is just a pain to navigate around.  Some of the quests are really hard.  You're underleveled compared to pretty much every other starting zone.
---
Also, when they do this a new mechanism will be required to change layers. If you enter an area where your layer is not loaded, the game will need to switch you to another layer. The obvious problem with that is it gives people an even easier way to switch layers. This will definitely result in other exploits.
---
10k to 20k gold
---
Does he not understand what "less likely" means
---
that dude is taking the pserver mentality to a real server and hes going to regret it.
---
Just ignore it, or if it really triggers you, there's a report button.
---
Use the neutral ah
---
Yea. +9 Strength isn't nearly worth the Mats, so only the rich or the min/maxers are going to want it. 
---
I found a Pattern for Robes of the Void and was able to trade a Warlock in my Guild for 3 Arcanite bars. Fair trade I'd say.
---
If the top raiding guilds have insanely large amounts of gold, people will increase the price of raiding equipment (flasks, enchants, etc.) which will screw over you and other normal players whenever they're going to raid. And even if it didn't directly effect you, people shouldnt get away with exploits, that's a very selfish mindset.
---
It‚Äôs not a dick move if you‚Äôre willingly going into a pvp server. If you want no consequences play pve, otherwise expect the worst that can happen.

---
Still a shit dungeon.
---
Nah Warcraft logs is a good way to measure performance and find out how to improve.
---
Just happens to be that this log is funny as the mage only casts Frostbolt and is the top DPS, balance is a bit fucky in classic.
---
Half my friends list is people with full BiS and epic mounts... I got it like 3-4 days ago and I don't even play the AH at all.
---
I think he was just trash. Mage is OP as fuck in classic.
---
I feel like people are intentionally doing this now.
---
Wow, there's a wall of text that nobody needed.
---
Incompetence.
---
Anyone else just alternating between different classes and having a hard time picking one? I have about 5 characters at level 20 and can't seem to choose one.
---
Just reset everyone and remove layers. All the tourist have gone home. Make it a true and fair experience for all.
---
Ooof.
---
it was a whole week... you got some brown stuff on your nose btw
---
im confused, it seems like you just go to uthers tomb, how is that another continent?  Even from kalimdor, you just head to menethil...
---
Yeah, that's what I'm saying-- Remove it. It's obvious  WoW players can't resist things anyways
---
The mage watched too many Vurtne videos but had 0 skill to apply lol. You don‚Äôt finish with explosion unless it‚Äôs a class who can‚Äôt recover. The inefficiency will cripple you. Vs priest? Sit back and bomb.
---
Dude I get your point.  But a friendly reminder, you will never change someone's mind on Reddit.  
---
Exploits may have been used here but we will never know.  It is PLAUSIBLE that it's legit but I'd say it would require a insane amount of no-life dedication.
---
But yeah.. good luck making a point on this matter here in this sub.
---
Ok let me stop you there, i never played BC ever. I started in Wrath. I did however, play vanilla for 3 years now on pservers. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Druids are bad to multibox in my opinion because 1,HoTs dont stack and 2, no rez. All their spells are time cast besides moonfire. Very sub-par in my honest opinion. They also go oom super quick. 
---
If i was to multibox, i would always pick shaman because the potential is insane. All have ability to rez, heals can spread out with chain heal, this means if 4 of them cast chain heal on your main, it smart heals anyone else low on damage. 
---
You dont have to wait to cast starfall to kill someone, you can just 1 instant shot frost shock/earth shock/fire shock (same time) and the enemy dies. If they are farther away or in groups, chain lightning (with elemental mastery) and the first character will die, the second will get severly hurt, and the third will probably be half damage. 
---
5 searing totems. They alone can probably be enough to deal significant damage.
---
5 grounding totems mean no one can silence any of your characters, no single target spell casts from anyone. 
---
2 or 3 tremor totems spread out in 2-3 clicks back to back will prevent any priest or warrior from running up and fearing your group. 
---
Everyone gets healing totem, poison cleanse, mana totem. And you can have one be resto and have mana tide totem to restore everyone elses mana.

Lol we should just stop talking about it because you *think* blizzard is working on it?
---
&gt; When you're just grinding dungeons for levels (5 mans) you don't need healers.
---
This is just 100% untrue, and you'll discover that at higher levels.
---
You can't just run UBRS with no healers, and claiming otherwise just makes you look stupid.
---
wait... you are the guy who circlejerking about how easy classic is, right?
---
&gt;It is easy? 100 times easier than mythic raiding in bfa.
---
Why i prefer gearing in BFA?
---
Its more straightforward. content you do is generally more rewarding. As soon as you start raiding for example. You get upgrades pretty much every raid day until you are mostly maxed out. 
---
after 2-3 weeks of raiding, you pretty much have everything you need to kill a mythic endboss. The only thing holding you back is your and the groups skill. 
---
In Classic, you can kill a boss 10 times without getting an item because the boss only drops 3 items for a 40 man raid. And when a useful item drops, 10 people will roll on it because half the raid consists of mages. 
---
it's just so RNG dependent if you can progress the itemization of your character or not. 
---
In retail, you still aim for your BIS gear, but its not that punishing if you dont get it week 1 or 2, because you have other good options. 
---
I like that
---
I totally read that with Esfand's voice in my head. :D
---
Kill on sight.
---
Was great if you were a class with good CC. As a hunter I could solo CC most packs.
---
I feel like rogue is my worst counter, they are so annoying when they jump me facing a mob.
---
Just remember, there‚Äôs no cross realm so player-to-player reputation means a lot.
---
If you did dungeon grinding at 50+ (which many of the early 60s did) you can make a ton of gold doing all the quests in a few days.
---
Well the Frost Nova could be him trying to set up a Shatter combo... but then he just wastes it on Arcane Explosions lol.
---
Yeah it is, but there's a section for addons
---
You don't have mail or anything do you
---
When you cast stormstrike, it is 1 attack or does it reset your swing timer to cast your normal attack plus 1 extra attack?
---
Always fly back to Mulgore to go fishing in the rivers, it's quiet and peaceful. As a Tauren druid and my first character in wow Mulgore has a special place in my heart.
---
sure, you can say that if you want.. My point still stands, abusing layering in any way is not in spirit and bad for game longevity
---
Interesting ok thank you
---
I'm not going to chat with every newbie who's unwilling to admit they're wrong.  Once you start wiping on the hard 5-man content because you don't have any healers, think back on this, and realize how dumb you were being.
---
I did the same thing. I rolled an undead priest and got to level 10 and hated the animations. Now I'm high enough level that I really wish i Had WOTF for ganks.
---
very first character I ever created on my older cousin's account was a Tauren Warrior named Rayne :\]
---
Snagging "Rain" is clutch tho, a good name definitely helps me get hyped on a character.

Buy your faction specific pets.for 40s.

Go to booty bay and sell them on the AH for 5g
---
I'm alliance and made 60g this last week selling cats
---
The Attack! quest from Tyrion in SW is the same. At least you don't have to run an entire instance when someone in your group accepts the next step before everyone has turned in, but it's a 5 minute wait for the quest to reset.
---
SM Lib dagger should serve you well.

Nice dodge by the plague spreader tho

Wait that‚Äôs better then the Whirlwind Axe? Wtf, just when you think you knew something...
---
I knew they were smarter then we gave them credit for...
---
they've discovered the Matrix.
---
Move over to staves. Go to the weapons trainer to learn them and then go on the AH and grab a staff and a wand. You'll use your wand for DPS and your staff for +spirit +int increase. You can use your wand by opening the spell book and placing it on your casting bar.
---
When i go up on a warlock i just get dotted and feared literally nothing i can do at that point. My only chance to kill them is keeping them in a stun lock forever
---
Yep started in WoW
---
Ahh yes, pre-Worgen Sven Yorgen.
---
No, it's a Korean thing which is being referenced in WoW by the devs.

It was popularised by Starcraft where you'd often get kekekekeked when against Koreans.
---
Don't silk bags vendor for 20s?

risky comment
---
Alliance Bloodsail checking in. I look forwards to seeing the horde at work fishing.
---
You've doubled down on the whole "5-mans don't need tanks or healers" thing like 5 times now, which is completely stupid and wrong.  There's nothing efficient about wiping.
---
Wait until you're playing the 55-60 dungeons, and you'll understand.
---
Well, it kinda does effect it. It's a lot better now.
---
actual pepega right here folks
---
A lot of players are now playing classic that have never played any variation of vanilla. 
---
They do not realise that sometimes plate wearers wear mail, mail wearers wear leather and leather wearers wear cloth. 
---
Let them rage and get laughed at.
---
&gt; It is easy? 100 times easier than mythic raiding in bfa. Still a 1000x better game. We both know why you posted this im not gonna start playing this stupid game. You even call classic more of a "slot machine" game than BFA. Like what? Do you honestly prefer how gearing works in BFA over classic? 
---
this is my full comment btw
---
Just because there is an exploit doesn‚Äôt mean you have proof that certain people are using it. You can‚Äôt just see someone with better gear and more gold than you and accuse them of using an exploit. There are probably ways Blizzard can tell if someone used an exploit, but you don‚Äôt have that power. Unless they streamed themselves you have no way of knowing for sure.
---
I've got alt-itis pretty bad, so I have 3 characters in the teens and one close to 30. You've at least got stuff to play for different moods and you can take complementary professions, like tailoring on one and sending them all your cloth

In PVP for P1 you're looking at not many options.

---
Weapons for druids are mostly stat sticks so str, agi, stam are all great, crit, armor are amazing as well.
---
Later when we have more options druids can shift into 1hers + offhand.
---
I mean my marriage is a little rocky right now. But who cares. I use to have a family. Now I have a level 42 Warlock.
---
Buy only usefull skills, don't spend gold on the Auction house, make sure you are never throwing stuff away(visit vendors as often as needed) and you should be good.
---
You should get an add on like auctionator so you can know if some white items from mobs are worth more in the AH and try to sell them that way. For example: Wicked Claws and Large Fangs.
---
Also, remember you only need 90 gold if you are honored with your race faction(gives you 10% discount on everything).
---
The Arcane Explosion spam yells Retail baby.
---
On Fairbanks, there‚Äôs a trio leveling altogether to 60 names Ctrl, Alt, and Del! Thought it was awesome.
---
Winner right here
---
No
---
He's full of shit
---
Found the ninja
---
What's the alternative? Triple the number of servers? Layer is to solve a hardware issue.
---
Was probably a warrior
---
Except they won‚Äôt remove it in p2.
---
You should know that it‚Äôs not possible to remove layering if you played vanilla in the past. This is because some of these servers have 20k+ populations and old school vanilla servers capped at 5k. Lol.
---
Never
---
Hahaha cope, anyway back to mount farming.
---
Just can‚Äôt win with some people man. 
---
On a side note, what addon you got going on for the character stats there?
---
Unless you have the same  level of that class , telling them how to play is the same as a fan talking about how they could knockout the fighter they cheer for in mma :) my opinion .
---
Mage has so much damage and CC in their kit that they should tbh. The only way they don't is if you can survive long enough to run out of mana, or you're a caster who can out dps them
---
Where‚Äôd this get said? All I ever saw was the #cancelsouthpark campaign they did before season 22 and that‚Äôs not really substantial evidence.
---
Don't forget people that jump in a boat OMFG that's so cool to watch. The content on this sub is 90% shit it's scary.
---
Exploiting bugs is not "powering through levels"
---
Ret Paladin
---
that is the worst mage i have ever seen
---
Once you hit 60 all the quest XP turns into gold instead. So if you grinded 50-60 without doing quests and then go back and do them you get a bunch of gold. I did mostly questing myself and even with the few quests I had left I've made 2-300 gold purely from quest rewards.
---
&gt;Are they hurtful to you? If yes, sure go and report.
---
I must have missed the line in the TOS stating you needed underthingy's permission. I thought getting to annoy edgelords and nazis was good enough, but now we know better.

Eh, if you know what to do it‚Äôs really not bad. People tend to hate the longer maze dungeons yet complain about the tiny linear ones in retail.
---
Oh you sweet summer child
---
When a mob is 10 levels lower than you, his level will turn Grey, signaling you can't get exp from it. So your friend shouldn't steal any exp from you.
---
Someone's knotty.
---
Is it really? This is what im currently leaning towards to haha
---
Yeah, it is.
---
Layers are separate computers.  You go to the new computer, it says "oh, that Id doesnt exist, let me make it for you".
---
Doesn't need to be. Clearly you're retarded and don't understand the subreddit and after looking at your comment history you're clearing new to WOW. Go reroll for you 10th time before you cancel your sub and never return tyvm.
---
It also got brigaded by a certain sub that brigades any thread that brings them up
---
Oh, I know they are useful. Didn't I say they were useful? Because they are and I rather take a good feral tank than a shitty warrior one.
---
Eh, for 10$/month its a good place to go to workout with dumbbells and machines. The price per month on every other gym within an hour drive is 35$-72$/month.
---
Blood and thunder friend. They‚Äôre betrayal fuel you.
---
There will always be people getting there first. It's not like the raid AoE thing have them such great exp that they would otherwise only be level 40 now. People still levelled up without doing it. 
---
Those people still played a hell of a lot and would still be the first ones to 60. They possibly saved themselves a couple of days. Don't kid yourself into thinking that you would be magically on par with those people without them abusing the bug.
---
At the end of the day there are a bunch of people who now have dinged, have all their gear and are now just farming one easy raid every week because there isn't exactly too much to do at this point. How are they somehow ruining your experience just because they dinged 60 a couple of days before they otherwise would have?
---
"Mods are deleting all posts about this, too. Good job guys."
---
Really? That's news to me.
---
Yezzan.
---
May that name forever be etched in our memories. May he never find a group with Alliance and may he never know mercy from the Horde.
---
You could just stop being a dipshit and not post or comment at all, I think that's be a good alternative for everyone
---
I'm sure Blizzard doesn't care and hopes we all quit and play retail while visiting their cash shop.
---
What you are saying is true but only if your happiness in the game really is defined by others progress, as you call out.  
---
It certainly annoys me that people exploit these bugs, but I think most players arent really concerned with their "standing" vs others.  It's like, if there are 1000 people walking down the street.  100 of those people decide it's now a race, and all take off.  20 of them play dirty and trip other racers.  Sure, those 20 have cheated the other 80.  But the other 900 weren't even racing.  What do we care?  
---
If server economy gets fucked that's a proble but despite the problems of layering, haven't really seen that.
---
I always felt like warlocks were fun for a whilez but so so redundant and like, ezmode leveling it was so boring. PvP was a blast though and they are one of the strongest
---
I see you've been looking for a real challenge!

‚ÄúMaster Skywalker...‚Äù

Nah, Tuberculosis
---
You're getting downvoted by people who think they can heal just as well in a DPS spec as in a healing spec, which is demonstrably false.
---
Yes, healing in a DPS spec is "good enough" *as long as nothing goes wrong*.  But when something does go wrong, they're OOM way faster than a holy-spec healer would be.
---
Holy Paladins get +12% healing power, 100% mana return on crits, and +5% crit chance.
---
Holy Priests get +10% healing power, -15% mana costs for single-target heals, -20% mana cost for their big AoE heal, and additional +healing based on spirit.
---
Disc Priests get 15% mana regen while casting, -10% mana cost for instant spells, and +10% total mana.
---
Resto Druids also get 15% mana regen while casting, +10% healing, and a great emergency heal in Swiftmend.
---
Resto Shaman get +10% healing power, 5% healing cost, +5% healing crit, and the hugely sustaining Mana Tide Totem.
---
So when someone accidentally facepulls a group while the healer is drinking, or when a runner manages to pull a second group that you weren't ready for, those DPS-spec'd healers are going to run dry of mana *long* before a holy-spec'd healer will.
---
Ok? Yeah I'm new to wow, good work buddy. If you would kindly put on your reading glasses and take a look at that sub for more that 0.2 seconds you would see that it's for linking subs *outside* of reddit
---
Are you really this dumb?

Oh. Well I've been skipping some good loot then. :/

Gotta keep that lucky charm for the rest of your wow career now.

I played hunter in vanilla.  See an alliance try to pick a a rare herb.  I run in drop a freeze trap. Pick herb /lol and run off
---
I love the people complaining about raid xp.  We tried that for a few runs, hit instance lockout, then quickly realized 5 man xp/hr is not only better, you don't hit the lockout and force the group to stop for 10 mins further lowering your xp.
---
If you check the forums, MC has been a bit wonky on boats lately. Could have something to do with it. Last time I tried I got [target can't be charmed](https://imgur.com/a/iTFHHVF) even though the enemy was only level 37 (r1 MC works on enemies up to lvl44).
---
I see turtles in time everywhere
---
Nah, charging and falling through the world is blizzlike for vanilla.
---
Love it!
---
Blizzard just gotta remove excess xp / drops they earned during that time. Lot less 60's around then.
---
I don't buy it. Blizzard knew about this. It wasn't until they saw the impact that they actually fixed it.
---
PS: I haven't downvoted you. Stop being so insecure.
---
I have a Naga Trinity, with the detachable 2/6/12 plates.  I‚Äôve never used the side buttons.  I think if you grew up using it or forced myself to I could get used to it but I never got in to it.

&gt; The point is that getting gear should feel rewarding
---
well my point is to get gear to begin with. 
---
And getting new gear from a new raid tier is very rewarding. Getting your BiS items such as trinkets or azerite pieces has a big impact on your performance. You see it immediately. So i dont see how gear is not rewarding in retail. 
---
I actually dont care much about TF and WF. If i get one and its an upgrade, then fine. 
---
you have the chance to get mythic level gear from lower content. But the chances are really low and a mythic raider will generally have a much higher DPS than a heroic raider due to better items.
---
This is clearly a perma ban exploit. Come on now. If this isn't then what is? These guys are making bosses reappear non stop and they do it on purpose.
---
Where did the post with 900 upvotes go? :)))
---
This looks normal to me?
---
You're an idiot if you think because something can be done within the confines of the programming that you cant get banned.  Terms of service clearly have a "using mechanics unintended by the developers", maybe you should read it.
---
But honestly wouldn't expect anything less from someone who embraces maga.
---
And known since Beta. Blizzard didn't care.
---
He completely downplayed the strengths too.  There are multiple other talents that improve healing/mana efficiency.
---
Make a third faction that hates everyone including their own faction.
---
Not defending the mage in question, just want to point out that while levelling (as a mage) int and spirit have roughly similar values, so the hat you got is MARGINALLY better than the hat the mage was using. Certainly not better enough to be raising hell over.
---
Druid IMO, but i lack experience because i stopped playing WoW with TBC. But my favourite thing lately in world pvp is to randomly root Alliance players who are running away from a train of mobs. Also really useful against AoE farming mages, just wait until the snare runs out and then root the mage (maybe they can blink out of the root, but most of them panic and just get onehitted  by 6 mobs

If they steal a mob from me and are a lot lower lvl then they get stalked for a bit.
---
I only go for battle if they are already attacking another horde player or if they hit first.
---
If they have res sickness they get stalked because it's fun to watch them squirm lol
---
Is there any way to check the faction balance of my server? I always here people say PVP servers are horde heavy, but I was wondering if there is any way I could actually check. I play on Blaumeux if that matters.
---
THAT'S GOING IN THA BOOK!
---
No such thing as too much depth in an RPG
---
Hunters fuck with mages pretty hard. Good instant ways to interrupt their spells, high physical damage
---
And I did all ten like a peasant...
---
It actually does, the IRS a max number of people per server on at one time.  Lawyers multiply the amount of people that can be on the same server.  So for every layer you choose that held 3000 people, that's 3000 more in queue waiting to join the other full portion.  More servers in that case is the solution.  Layering very much so effects queue times with the same population per server.  Did you notice last week when they closed some and suddenly queue times went up?  Temporary because a lot of people are slowing down but you do see it in the queue.
---
Level 46 holy paladin checking in, it's been great.  It's tough to quest solo, but finding a friend out in the world helps a lot with that.  And in dungeons there's almost no scenario that I can't save from a wipe.
---
Did you tell a teacher first?
---
Starting to get the feeling you're a class A edgelord.
---
guys, it's still in closed beta. it'll be fixed!
---
guys... it's open beta. give them until release to fix it.
---
cmon, now they know about the issues and are working on fixing it post launch   (you are here)
---
just when will people realize layering WON'T be fixed? they added it as a lazy solution because they didn't want to merge servers (but then they added server transfers anyway lol)
---
It‚Äôs irrelevant in terms of PVE dps apparently, because his abilities do half the damage to offset his attack speed.
---
Gosh karazhan brings back so many feels
---
With that same thought process why would I care what 1% of the population does, I could care less how people gear up as it doesn't affect me much.
---
You guys sure are organized. I'm loving these 1v4 fights while I'm just chilling questing and I see 4+ horde players 10+ levels on me destroy me and then dance on my dead body lol
---
&gt; In retail, you still aim for your BIS gear, but its not that punishing if you dont get it week 1 or 2, because you have other good options.
---
so BIS gear doesn't matter as much as it does in classic, and you dont care about WF and TF. Sounds to me like you just dont really care about gear progression, other than having good enough gear for raiding, which is fine. But why even argue.
---
&gt; Getting your BiS items such as trinkets or azerite pieces has a big impact on your performance.
---
Okay so getting your BiS trinket feels nice. Wouldn't it feel better if you are always guaranteed a better one from Mythic compared to Heroic version, as a reward for doing harder content?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
You really dont think it would be more fun without WF and TF?
---
I have accepted that every Brairthorn and Mageroyal node in the Wetlands has a symbolic connection to Gnoll culture.
---
Not a priest. As long as everyone having fun , so am I :) I do miss Xroads chat , that‚Äôs my only complaint switching from horde to alliance haha
---
I actually returned mine because I didn't like it tbh.  It was uncomfortable. I prefer the one I have with like 10 buttons all on the top of the mouse rather than side.
---
... there‚Äôs this thing called global cooldown. after you use an ability, most abilities get put on GCD which is like a second cd where you can‚Äôt click another ability, the reason you can‚Äôt just press one button and buff yourself three times is because there is a GCD for all buffs, so you have to press it multiple times. It‚Äôs a sequence of spells, not just puts 3 buffs on you for one press
---
^this. For the longest time I had no idea intellect affected weapon skill levelling.
---
I don't know why people would think they're weak. I don't think they have the best damage output while leveling but they're damn hard to kill with all their CDs. A persistent pally can outlast most classes.
---
Do every quest you can in thunderbluff and 1k needles, as well as camp taurajo and feralas. Basically any tauren NPC that gives quests
---
There's only three good things about playing Horde:
---
1. Windfury

2. Obvious dev bias
---
3. Thunderbluff Music

Because [gayswillburn](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/188676225068302339/622744506642726943/unknown.png) isn't remotely appropriate.
---
Undead Paladin. Period.
---
Chocohunter-Incendius wanted for treason.
---
Low-level wands are about the only thing that's profitable in enchanting before 60. And it's not that profitable.
---
Don't worry too much about making money while leveling up crafting professions, they're all pretty much money drains until 60.
---
To you
---
Pretty much what I have always thought.
---
It's a bit silly, and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But hey, that's the reality we are in regarding this.
---
I personally believe it was miscommunication, a human error in sewing the game together that caused the quest to end up for warriors rather than shamans.
---
Probably nothing done on purpose.
---
Free pass? Anyone found exploiting is generally banned.

With so little time to play since release, I've only made it to level 7 - but I still gave my first gold to someone who was trying to buy their mount.  Little things to you can change someone's entire leveling experience!

I cant tell when they are actually casting it. Is there an addon to help me out or do i just have to look at their hands or some shit
---
Ah! Priests have mind blast that works in the same way. Great for pulling agro for no particular reason.
---
I'd wager over 85% of people cannot tell the difference between a prot and arms warrior tanking a 5man, or a priest being disc or shadow healing.
---
I have 2 characters on classic so far, both Taurens because they are my favourite. Mulgore is my favourite and after reading the comments here I'm going to see how far I can level in just mulgore I left at level 12 on my shaman my hunter is level 9 now and there will be green level mobs to kill when the quests dry up

‚ÄúIf you look in the cracks behind Golemagg you can see rag!‚Äù

I got people with that even in Wrath and it still killed them lmao
---
The elites in the village below SFK in silverpine. They like to drop 4ish per kill
---
traphouse or td?
---
Yeah, because layering in instanced content was an advertised feature. This is an exploit, they crop up in games from time to time, the system being "bad" has very little to do with it.
---
Then it's accurate to the original.  Enjoy! :)
---
This time I tried leveling as holy in dungeon groups. I've had the most fun I've ever had in any games and the moment I log in someone whispers me if I'm willing to run few dungeons. Guess who got T2 pants today from raids.

Horde players have more friends, confirmed.

why take the mod tag off when you respond to this one

No, it isn‚Äôt.

How short sighted can you be?

There are kids playing the game, and you think the onus is on them report homophobic and racist names? How about you act like an adult and take some responsibility?

Hi Bob, so happy to hear this! Cixi is planning more improvements and features to Puggle so stay tuned!
---
1g for your firs, then 5g. After that, every subsequent talent reset adds 5g, capping at 50g. It doesn't double every time.
---
That was a bug. They forgot to activate the raid XP penalty.
---
Hey look, layering was bad.
---
Go to :\World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\YourAccountName\YourServer\YourCharacter.  In that folder delete chat-cache.old and chat-cache.txt files.  That should reset your chat to default.  This is also how you copy chat settings from one character to another (copy those two files to another character folder).
---
If you want to reset the font, I think deleting the fonts folder in :\World of Warcraft\_classic_  that your addon may have installed will reset that, but I can't remember.  You may need to find the default font files and place them into that folder.  Googling how to reset WoW's fonts to default should help. 
---
The G S W likely mean "guild," "say," and "whisper," meaning those are the chats that are enabled for that tab.  Right clicking the tab will give you options to rename it and check which channels are displayed in it.

You said you'd looked so continue looking and report back to me when you find it. As a reward you'll get to pick between two items:

I hope you know what to do with them.

Immediately get ww axe at 30? You mean the super hard quest chain for lvl 30s in which you basically need a party for each part of the quest.  Maybe you can fight the lvl 37-38 elementals alone, but no way the 40 elite at the end of the chain. Anyone who has that axe by lvl 35 is lucky as shit.

having fun, what are you doing there? complaining?

Glad to see there are some respectable players out there who understand their responsibility to do the right thing for the community. Thanks bro

Um, he said tailoring.
---
No, threatening violence towards a group of people for an intrinsic characteristic is never appropriate.

Because he's mad the guy had actual proof and now he has to make up an excuse for it to stay removed. He's just bullshitting, it'll never be recovered. 
---
These mods are all shills.

You're ahead of where you should be. I had like 25 at level 35. Still got it at 40

Because I have to manually distinguish it every time I comment which I sometimes forget to do :)

Not a feature in Vanilla. You need to use an addon.

Where did you read that it‚Äôs BiS?

Are you ok? You have some serious issues to work through if this is how you react to being proven wrong

I guess we'll just have to wait and see

For end game you can drop growl on your raid/dungeon pet.

3g at lvl 21  
---
\#povertylife
---
Those people would be the dominating force on their server anyways. Layering, the Dungeons exploits and the farming of end game gear, that's not only a lot of work but also knowledge and skill/creativity. 
---
No "normal"  or casual player will ever be impacted or bothered by those "problems" because we play pretty much a different game than those people. Just stop comparing yourself or your progress to the top players and just enjoy the game.
---
Also, nah MMOs are  everything else than fair, the whole game concept is about boosting people who spend the most time online, with stats, items, money and abilities.
---
 Compared to lets say fighting games or even mobas where your skill is the most deciding factor, MMOs relay heavily on Gear, Money, Player Level and stats etc

Something tells me these people arent actually leveling warrior. Because you are spot on
---
Duuuuuude, thanks so much. I‚Äôm going to give this a shot once I get in the game (currently in queue). My character folder isn‚Äôt there yet because I just freshly installed WOW (twice...) after not being able to reset chat. I‚Äôll let you know what happens. :)
---
Lmao what an insane overreaction.
---
How do I unlock more than just cloth armor? Should I be buying the upgrades somewhere? I'm a level 7 gnome warlock.
---
I love you buddy.  Let's just play our own classic wow without all those dumdums. It will get better.  Hang in there. Those people,  much like this OP, will get bored of the game and quit or so something dumb enough to get banned.  (Hopefully). Until then,  just do you booboo.
---
Might as well be, sure isn't their own forum.
---
These are just from the last couple of days as I've been on. A lot of them are people hiding from PVP on PVP servers(which I don't understand) and some are camping mobs/farming shit. Imagine all of the ones that aren't asking for it in chat but are abusing them.
---
What is the official timeline on turning layers off? The longer it stays on, the worse the seems to be getting.
---
Good to hear that I'm worrying for nothing.
---
And then that one asshole who states the obvious ‚Äúthey should open up more lines.‚Äù No shit
---
I personally don't really care I'm enjoying myself a lot as a level 29 mage and I don't care what others are doing.
---
It was a real bad ZF run.
---
Well, all the guides i‚Äôve read reiterate that it‚Äôs negligible in terms of PvE, so idk who to believe man
---
What are the chances blizzard bans people for doing this? If they‚Äôre making thousands of gold from this and they don‚Äôt get banned I‚Äôm gonna hate myself for not doing it too.
---
You're speaking for everybody when you don't know in the least who was upset or not. Nights when it was a lock party in Goldshire could be fun followed shortly by very frustrating. 
---
This was fun in the day and I understand the locks who miss it but if you look at the dev notes Classic is a series of compromise decisions to create a usable look and feel experience emulating but not absolutely like Vanilla. It's like a remastered album. Purists want every scratch on the record but really, we'll be ok and still somehow manage to have fun without this one.
---
Yeah, good tip. I‚Äôll be doing that in the future after this incident. Also, do you know if /console cvar_default can fix the chat too? Because I did uninstall/reinstall WOW and the settings for chat files seem to have stayed. You think this is a server-side thing?
---
The economy does affect you though. And this ruins economies.
---
Now farming that pesky pre-raid BiS just became easy as fuck...
---
Press need on anything of substantial value.  If it's not that valuable and someone has a use for it then and there, let them have it.

Wtf mods.

Yeah still get a month ban or something ?
---
Why are these layering exploit posts getting removed?
---
I'm a behavioral analyst. I understand exactly what is happening. People are confusing a natural coping skill "complaining" as an inability to process stress. Thank you for being a kind person and reminding me to calm down.  The very idea of people saying "if you complain, don't subject yourself" makes no sense. Understanding the behaviroal processes here is literally my job.
---
Oops i dont know why i missed that you were talking about the mount and not gold
---
All good thank you for the advice
---
That's literally a 30% difference in healing. If something is 30% worse than the better option, it is NOT viable. I wouldn't drive a car that could only do 70% of the speed limit unless I was desperate. 
---
In fact, I'd feel like an asshole for doing that because on the road as in a raid there are people relying on you to do your part.

Are you seriously implying that removing the post would reduce exploits when there's a twitch clip showing exactly how to do it?
---
I love a bit of unending breath (even if the zone doesn't have water) - it's the thought that counts! Personally, I buff everyone I see with the appropriate buff as a Paladin. It's when someone asks in what I presume to be a rude or entitled way that I give them something useless. They sometimes still say thanks.
---
Thanks for writing that - it's so obvious but some people don't understand it, or at least pretend not to when it suits them.

It'll be off as soon as p2 is live. People won't reroll to a pointless server at this point.

You will get a lot of downvotes but just know a lot of people who actually wanted vanilla agree. What we got is more of a nostalgia theme park in the retail client.
---
It's hard to imagine them removing them unless the target realm gets to high pop.

so damn good
---
For me, it was when the server transfers first opened up. I was among the very first people on Heartseeker-US, questing in Arathi. There was a group of alliance there doing the warrior quest line significantly lower level than they should have been. I could have killed them all, but I helped them kill a few mobs. They all looked at me and /bow or /smile. It was a really cool interaction. 
---
Edit: if anyone is looking at joining Heartseeker, please do! It‚Äôs a healthy server with a good population. Everyone I met has been happy to be on the server and not have to worry about queues anymore.
---
Lvl 23 w/7g18s

Oh okay cool, I think I read on Petopia that it's for all families
---
The trainer for artisan alchemy is in darn, i would look there.
---
It's the same fucking thing.
---
you could probably just make makros to incoperate stop attack on spells, should work like this eg:
---
#showtooltip Mind Blast
---
/stopattack
---
/cast Mind Blast
---
The gold income rate increases pretty quickly. I had about the same as you, by the time i was near 40 i was earning 20 gold a level and could afford mount+skills.
---
I've now got 500g at level 58.
---
Bur is?
---
Good call, I probably will! I haven't determined what pet I will use for that purpose yet. I think most people use a Wolf for Furious Howl?
---
\&gt;implying Blizzard gives a shit
---
yeah because posting a bug or making it frontpage on reddit has the same effect, right?
---
Nah, you don't need that crossbow to reach the necessary hit rating and if you can get there using other pieces then this gun is pre-raid BIS.
---
Why not just open more servers?
---
I really like playing mage or hunter. I‚Äôm not really sure what the factions are. Do u have any recommendations?
---
Should‚Äôve started this at level 1, or as early as possible. You get less rep in the starting zones the higher level you are.
---
Saw this happen in Esfands stream. They got to clear MC twice in one  week(with Blizzards permission) with I expect this exploit. Albeit unintentionally I hope.
---
That's when the group steps in. This is a good way to fill your ignore list with people that you shouldn't play with. I had something similar with a huntard causing multiple wipes over and over. He screwed over everyone but himself.
---
How is that even possible, did he use a BoT to level/
---
It's not a tag. You can distinguish any post but have to do so retroactively.
---
You forgot plate wearers that only have viable options from leather and mostly cloth.
---
They're shit at it
---
Yeah it depends a lot on spec and situation, BM hunters have a talent called Frenzy (5 points = 100% chance for your pets attack speed to be increased by 30% for 8 seconds after a critical hit). 
---
Most BM specs go 4/5 in this for optimal uptime with a 1.2 or 1.3 attack speed pet, usually 5/5 for anything higher.
---
Broken tooth you can effectively go 3/5 in that talent.
---
This is kind of the only situation where his attack speed is beneficial though, he's mostly great for PvP. Wolf will always be the go to PvE pet for me for the damage boost to melee dps.
---
Lv 39 with 90g. It really isn't hard as people say. I had 30g at 29, so you're in good shape. I've even bought a few green items from the AH while leveling. Loot everything from every mob you kill, vendor it all, only train the skills you need, and just use loot from quests/instances.
---
I haven't done any hard gold grinding-- I've grinded maybe 1.5lvls on mobs, and other than that just done a mix of quests and dungeons.
---
Thats unhealthy.
---
Yes. I've been on Earthshaker since it was 2 days old. The server already grew quite a lot, we're hitting medium during peak hours. I'm constantly running my census addon, as of today we have nearly 4000 unique characters on alliance side. Also,  compared to how shitty the AH was like literally a week ago, I am actually starting the make  lot of gold from using the AH since so many new buyers/sellers transferred over. 
---
The server has a great population as of right now already! You actually get to know people, much more fun than my time on a full Firemaw.
---
I haven't seen Jokerd or those heroes in APES banned yet for layer abuse.
---
Not only did none of them have competition, they also hopped layers like crazy.
---
Reporting people's clever names. Unless it's a name that's racist or sexual in nature I don't see the reason to report names. I appreciate names that give me a chuckle versus some boring name like lindsey
---
Ehhh just run GY and find some good quest items. Do RFK too. You get all the gear you need. I have only bought two items for my war, both around 20s apiece and I am 35. Just running Lib and GY I already got some uncommon upgrades for back, boots
---
This is correct, but the primary use of attack speed in vanilla is to pushback casters, which is also helpful in PvE in many situations.
---
you need 225 to learn it i belive
---
Classic+ content right here imo.
---
Sheep the pet and blink ?
---
I started as holy.  Got the itch to try Ret around 30, so respecced.  Played ret until 40, but I missed the survivability from Holy.  Respecced to Holy/Reckoning and am now having much more fun (especially after learning about how to get Reckoning working - see  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c\_MHIkMhSfc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_MHIkMhSfc) ).
---
The only problem I'm having is finding groups as a healer - everyone wants dps!
---
At most, they hand out wrist slaps.
---
When you find a significant upgrade on the ah that is 10s more than the vendor price, yeah thats worth it.
---
Once I get my group in the dungeon entrance I explain the escort, then I give a warning we're coming up on him, then ask for confirmation every step of the way. Sometimes people still mess it up.
---
Yeah, I was about to say *pretty sure it's because of StarCraft Koreans*
---
It increases based on the number of resets. I believe it's 1/5/10/20/50 with 50 resetting down to 20 after a week.
---
So I've been playing mage, lvl 20 now. I'm extremely squishy. I played mage, hunter and warrior in vanilla. I never capped in vanilla and am leaning towards making a warrior or hunter. Maybe both. Any tips for being less squishy or should I just make alts and never actually get very high with a main
---
the only build you can mess up is your talent build. you can respec an unlimited number of times, though it gets more expensive each time, up to a cap. there's really nothing you can permanently mess up about your character in wow.
---
Maybe if there was some sort of holy infused undead that could become a faction leader if Sylvannas were to go nuts, but that's way too farfetched and unnecessary.
---
We didn't have a dedicated aoe group, 1 mage, 1 lock, and pugged a random  DPS every time. We just played efficiently.
---
I guess for a group of 10 people not being remotely efficient it would be better than wandering around STV without completing a quest for 30 minutes.
---
Why does this effect you at all. Like I get it, I am annoyed at both of those things happening. But neither of them changed how I play. Let the streamers and the hardcores go crazy and farm like mad and maybe get banned. I dont get why it's difficult to ignore them.
---
More servers. It's OK to admit that layering is and always will be bullshit. I won't tell daddy.
---
Well...that showed me! That option isn't in the version I use. Thanks for the tip-off
---
Even on Horde side, *as* a Horde player, the majority of undead players have been straight up rude and foulmouthed.
---
People see their pve dps and assume that has some relevance to pvp. It does not.
---
Pretty sure it just increases in price everyone you do it. I think it caps at 50 not sure if it decays over time.
---
What advantage are they gaining over you? Are they not inviting you to endgame content? Are they beating you in pvp battles that don't exist yet? Are they riding so fast on their epic mounts you can't get any herbs or mines.  Are they farming so many dungeons that you can't even get a group on your own unless you're willing to abuse mechanics with them. I know 300g isn't a lot as you pointed out, but I made it all by myself. I spent 7.5 hours in BRD doing full quest run and mc attunement. It took two attempts because tank quit at grim guzzler and it took a while to find replacement. I know not everyone has that time,  but the point im trying to make is... while these farmers might skew ah prices and corner markets on things and they might clear mc before you do and they might get fully decked out and be sitting in IF or ORG or wherever just for people to inspect because they've done all they can do.  That doesn't stop you from cursing them under your breathe and continuing to play the game you want to play.  I didn't participate in any sm raid farms or spell cleave dungeon xp runs and I've been happy questing.  My guild is going into MC on Tuesday with some pugs and some non level 60s (hopefully myself included). I've got all I need so far and I don't feel at that big of a disadvantage or behind.  Be mad about the exploits.  Demand change,  but don't let them dictate the way you play the game.  There are still loyal #NOCHANGES players that will play with you and eventually,  those other guys... they won't be around for one reason or another.  Im on Skeram which is absolutely a full server so I'm dealing with everything you're dealing with.  Im just still continuing to play the game my way.
---
Lol
---
That makes sense
---
40g @ lvl 35. Just grind on some humanoids or other mobs dropping high sell value trash a few levels below you when you get to lvl 40. It won't take long
---
I know it‚Äôs not exactly comparable but I came to WoW from ESO. These players would definitely be banned over there. If you find an exploit and continue abusing it on ESO you‚Äôll get suspended or banned.
---
Thank you I'll give it a go. I think one of the issues is that it gives everything a global cool down so my wands attack almost as soon as the cool down had finished.
---
Thanks for your input. I‚Äôll try do do that for now. I might play mage but i‚Äôm not sure whether to choose alliance or horde, types, etc. There‚Äôs so many options lol
---
Rather surprising that people have such a mindset. Everyone needing is how shit went down in Vanilla in my anecdotal experience.
---
Level doesn't matter, it just gets more and more expensive each time you reset them up to a cap of 50g.  It decreases by 5g each week (or month?) that you go without respeccing in the meantime.
---
The fuck are you talking about
---
you doomers are fucking sad as fuck.
---
The dungeon id should not be able to change without you using a dungeon portal..
---
I hear you!
---
I played with a guy from the US, Arkansas I think? His toon was called Kimmygibbler... We played together a lot and the first time he heard me on TS he was very surprised that I am a woman. 
---
... But dude, I talked about my boyfriend... Hahaha
---
Most boring dps in the game
---
Shes playing prot lol. However she stopped a few other hordies from killing me
---
i know. thought it was an escort so i didnt accept it. team starts it and im like wtf..
---
You should get a new girlfriend haha. Me myself could never be with a guy that won‚Äôt accept or understand gaming. Preferably I‚Äôd want them to game aswell.
---
Spam sunder for chances at overpower
---
If only we had a proper beta to find this shit prior to release rather than promoting streamers and other "influencers".
---
Can you move to the other high pop servers?
---
I made a free account just so I can go to barrens chat
---
5 minutes in, i was exploring a kobold cave and a dude buffed me and gave me a sword.
---
Low pop realm which I have said multiple times and have scaled it up with data from other high pop server data dumps.
---
/who 60 shows 19 hits right now
---
Rogues...typical...
---
Okay, I‚Äôll see what I can do with all the info you gave me. Thanks a lot!
---
Those damned addons should really put a special case for this quest specifically  (and maybe some other escort quests).
---
What a piece of shit.
---
Not really a dps class by most definitions.
---
SOMEONE IS ENJOYING A GAME
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Hey friend!

I'm leveling Warrior and Rogue and I found this macro and it makes my life alot better. 
---
Hope it helps you also!

I‚Äôm disappointed

Inversely, everywhere English is spoken, besides some regions of the modern USA, pat is a verb and pet is a noun.
---
k
---
This. Int is useful for melee and when playing mage I'll always buff all classes/pets.
---
I can't hide the fact that people are exploiting layers. This affects every server, whether you hide chat or not. 
---
This is a problem and the longer it goes on for the bigger it will be.
---
do it, you're missing half the game
---
Lmao do you ever go outside?
---
One of you needs to get an Orb of Deception
---
Yes because people will take someone seriously when the first words they utter is you little people as if you're superior in some form or another.
---
nice
---
Its a terrible weapon for hunters, way too fast.
---
I'd be fine with a two week - one month ban.  Since they aren't modifying the game client or whatever, they're doing it all internally.  And AFAIK Blizzard has only ever permabanned people for externally modifying the game, such as the staircase hack to get to C'Thun faster.  Internal exploits just earn temporary bans, like the Saronite Bombs trick on Arthas.
---
Plus, they'd come back after many more players are 60, the economy is harder to earn money in, and everyone else is more geared than them.  Seems like a fair punishment.
---
Would someone mind explaining the problem with this quest so that I can avoid it?
---
they already banned quite a few people for this.
---
Pepitos
---
Yeah I play an lock and it‚Äôs a sustain battle between the two gods of sustain. I fought one and I almost had him till he bubbled and healed then I almost had him again and he did the full health spell like what the fuck I thought using siphon and drain life made me sustainy af
---
What model mouse do you have?
---
Can someone explain to me what exactly layering is? Thanks
---
Lmao of course
---
boy you sure showed him. That'll teach him to play a class in a way that's fun to him.
---
Yeah I'm not trying to say it was the best way or it's unfair that it got nerfed. Just that I was pointing out that for alot of people the 10man grind would of been more efficient because they suck.
---
All horde on Fairbanks are KOS
---
Well obvs and I stated this above, but it's still a hunter weapon
---
Can priests use daggers in vanilla?
---
Okay, well you can't "scale" it to other high pop servers. That's not how it works, even remotely.
---
They need to shut down the servers immediately until this is fixed
---
Thank you! You're pretty great too.
---
You're wrong. You don't need the hit from the crossbow in pre-bis gear. I am currently at 11% with the crossbow.
---
Afaik they're at least superior off-tanks. Add don't crush or crit you as much, Druids have an aoe taunt, and their aoe threat ability hits more than Warriors can.
---
&gt;yeah because posting a bug or making it frontpage on reddit has the same effect, right?
---
Nope it has not indeed.
---
The first one (Reporting it) has the effect that it does not become widespread and probably prevents a ban if you have not abused it yourself.
---
The second one causes a multitude of community problems and likely causes Blizzard to take disciplinary actions against the abusers.
---
Ya.. that clearly isn't happening. I wish they would announce SOME sort of plan for handling this issue that isn't super vague. I think the bottom quote in that pic really sums it up. Layers and Mage sploitin AE farming dungeons is not classic. At least the latter is just using shit already in classic.. the former can go away any time now.
---
You realise for a lot of people the epic mount means nothing right? Especially for raiders.
---
Back in the day the toon I raised on literally didn‚Äôt leave the entrance portal to whatever raid we were up to.  Log in, do raid, repair via eng, log out wait for next week. What do I need an epic mount for?
---
Besides that, gold is actually very easy to get, you just have to be half efficient about it. The ‚Äúweeks of grinding‚Äù is a meme because people didn‚Äôt know how to play the game back then. That weapon is a rog/war gun. No hunter is going to use it.
---
I'm stating that there is difference of opinion between moderators. Strictly speaking this post could be removed under R4, however under the circumstances that it's already been circulated for several hours and appears as a VOD from a popular streamer, it seems redundant to remove it from R4 **in my opinion.**
---
I am merely suggesting the likely reasons that it was removed.
---
it's one thing to do it twice to show it. but he is clearly abusing it.  get a brain
---
You still don't get it. " To make your character the best it takes all slots, the best in slot item is not the best unless you hav all the other best of slot items in every slot. This is the problem that I think many people overlook and don't consider, your end game best in slot doesn't help choose the best in bags for each slot, the best overall stats based on what you have available, and most people will never collect all the items of those lists, I don't know how to better explain it

Why the F are you here?
---
Maybe they could allow transfers? I would love to transfer to a server that has layering off. I'm sure there are many who would.
---
Bout damn time
---
Going to STV before 40 was a mistake. SM groups seriously cannot be hard to find as a tank, make sure you've opted in to the lookingforgroup and /lfg chats as well as trade/world and you should have zero issue.
---
Na people usually fuck it up
---
I mean if you cherry pick the big ban waves sure. But overall Blizz is really light on bans.
---
level 59, been farming Felcloth from satyrs to craft Felcloth robes and legs, have 388g, and a pretty high bank value. 300 tailor. I no lifed the game tho
---
I also found a sweet macro where you simply combine two spells - Hamstring and Charge into one button. When you are far away from your target - you will Charge. When you are fighting in melee range - you will Hamstring.//
---
/cast Charge
---
/cast Hamstring
---
44 with 5.
---
howww
---
he didnt have to do it more than a couple of times to show it. that's the difference
---
This is the cycle for every game I've seen released that has any issue. The whole oh it's closed beta it's fine, oh it's open beta it's fine.. oh only one month till release it's fine. Oh it's released don't worry it's fine they are working on it and then sure enough it gets fixed but after all the damage is done and months after product launch.
---
Was at level 30 needed a new weapon bad but the quest for it was level 40 mobs. Another fellow pally ran passed and asked if I wanted help he ran me through the full quest chain and just said have a great day afterwards. Was happy and that weapon lasted me almost 10 levels lol.
---
It's always a fight and some days are better than others, but I'm thankful. That would be something to try - I never had a healer before! Thank you.
---
Isn't threat gen an issue if I'm dpsing?
---
I am 40 and only have 83g
---
yes. yes it is.
---
I‚Äôve had a different experience.  Frankly I‚Äôve been surprised by the amount of new people I‚Äôve played with and then actually played with again after adding to friends list.  Also have experienced quite a lot of friendly banter in chat during instances.
---
Thank you!

I ended up doing the same!
---
God dammit.  All my old WoW friends are playing in Whitemane, but every time I check the queue times are like two hours.
---
I just stay in my lane.
---
For real. Everyone knows never to take the free transfer to the dead realm - a complete and utter trap.
---
did you buy your mount yet.
---
Why is it framed as "wtf blizz u retards u cant do anything right" instead of "yo blizz layering works in instances, can we get a hotfix asap?"
---
I sold a bunch of the Azure set and made good money from bags, but realistically if you have heaps saved up I would just level it up as much as possible following the wowhead tailoring guide, it's nice being able to make gear that is an actual upgrade for yourself and some BIS pieces for mage comes from tailoring
---
Im lvl 17 and have 1 gold. So you're doing better than me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And bubble drops all your debuffs too. I hate that as a shadow priest but I'm sure it sucks even worse for locks.
---
Have you been slacking?
---
Fuck that‚Äôs genius. Haven‚Äôt started a alt yet but now I will just to put them in a inn. How many days of xp can stack?
---
I'm the same. I grew up learning how to type because I played WoW with my family. Retail has always been around but Classic leaves people to solve their problems with the help of others.
---
Maybe don't be That Guy?
---
I've already said this...
---
well i mean you are only level 17 lol but yeah why do you have only 1g at this point.
---
plz keep politics out, gun control is a very clearly split issue. But now that we're on it, if you are blaming guns, do you really think banning them would fix the problem in america? How is banning drugs working out?
---
I use classiccastbars to track enemy spellcasts. It places a bar on their nameplate and their target frame showing the cast.
---
Layering will be removed by patch two. Consider this the trial phase to establish the parameters for what they will need for a stable server set. Our ‚Äúauthentic classic experience‚Äù is in the pipeline.
---
How did we come this far to have classic ruined. Like for real I want to give them my money but they cant do anything right. Is this place being run by children?
---
For the Horde!
---
Just a heads up its really bothering you:
---
The WoW instant messenger addon shows you level, class, and server of anyone on your friends list.
---
2019 mages only know how to cast blizzard and arcane explosion it‚Äôs
---
Pserver mentality is a fuck ton stronger than real server mentality
---
How about that. I've always just said "ead-guh-beh".

well that is good to know :)

Correct me if I'm wrong but I understand hunters want a long weapon speed so they can shotweave, but this is pretty damn fast, you could probably shotweave twice as fast, right?
---
I am on a PvP world and I pretty much do all solo except dungeons and random grps for quests. Thanks
---
Not the first month but classic has 15 years of advertising
---
\&gt;would rather play with braindead blizzdrones 
---
Yeah, no thanks
---
I think (haven't played a wand class since TBC though) that you need to go into your spellbook and put wand attack on your action bar. You don't automatically attack. And if you were to right click to attack a mob, it would use your staff (or mainhand weapon) to attack instead.
---
Pretty sure most wand classes have wand as 1 on their bars.
---
yeah, its just completely shits on the constitution that is the bedrock of american culture and values. Strip the 2nd amendment is a big deal, last time it was attempted, well, I shouldnt need to tell you your own countries history
---
It's relatively easy to farm gold. Spamming dungeons with a good group (usually AoE farming) gives A LOT of money.
---
I'm surprised this works on raids, lockout timers should prevent that.
---
I did it no problem, it just takes a while. There are tons of other warriors trying to do it that you just group with when you find them literally *on location*.
---
And I am 99% sure that after clearing relatively small satyr camp he was just asking for new layer so he can continue farming right?   
---
That's what most mages I know did, and it's just as fucked.

200+ or so, but I did no life the Ah in my down time

Be a bad time for the horde to decide to raid SW. üí™
---
55.currently 7g because I spent 200g on myrmidons signet,129g on devilsaur gloves, and somewhat regrettably 80g on helm on narv
---
yeah well i am still in the process of figureing out the best farming spots and yeah honestly i got lucky with some drops and yeah i also just figured out some tricks for myself.
---
Most classes get access to learn a new spell from their trainer at landmark levels like 20, 30, 40 that improve QoL. Shamans get Ghost Wolf at 20 (+40% move speed), Druid‚Äôs get Cat Form at 20 and Travel Form at 30, etc. 
---
The game doesn‚Äôt truly change until you‚Äôre 60 and done leveling.
---
Well you do use a pick to mine it.
---
What
---
 Downvoted.
---
Sadly, I'm not. But all the luck to you on Krom! For the Horde!
---
senseless
---
what happened here...

Thank you, I really appreciate it! I‚Äôm also thinking about night elf rogue. Is that good?
---

---
Did you go to the village and ghostmaw rise?
---
If you‚Äôre char name is tombombadil, I saw ya in game yesterday!
---
oh you are someone who plays the ah then. i would do that but its risky for me.
---
that isn't pserver mentality mate :) They know the value of their server-wide reputation ;)
---
You are doing above average :)
---
right wing and left wing people can co-exist, the problem is the left is so triggered and thinks everything that doesnt directly align with their ideology is "racist". Begone snowflake
---
No there was a huge group exploit where people were getting unintended rates of XP
---
Thank you, this is one of my outlets and it's been a great way to challenge myself.
---
"Frozen wrath" and "shadow wrath" are easy markets with lots of buyers.
---
Just look for outliers in price and re-list.  Shoulders/bracers/hats turn quickly.
---
Also always worth scanning for "wrath" wands.  Shadow wrath wands in particular.  Warlocks and priests are super wand heavy.
---
Good luck.
---
What a scumbag. Horde Herod here, we‚Äôll keep an eye out
---
I'm level 31 with 4g... I feel like I've made some bad decisions...
---
Personally I imagine it coming from the mouth of a neon haired starbucks swilling hipster
---
Explain?
---
I role on a pvp server so I can kill horde and worry about horde killing me.
---
 Depends what effect it'll have on the market. Guilds of players with 10k gold each will drastically reshape a server's economy.
---
Nope.  Didn't layer once.  Maybe things are different now, but you could do a complete circle farming before respawns would be up.  The issue now is just that there's competition.
---
this holy fuck the vast majority of this sub is in hysterics over shit that doesn't affect anyone. "WAHH THIS RUINS MY CLASSIC EXPERIENCE" nobody is forcing you to abuse layering. enjoy the game at your own pace
---
Different instance servers.
---
You got me
---
I wish, and cheers to the fella who is! Haha. Nah im Eatyourface
---
Warlocks are very gear dependant, there's a very long period at the start of vanilla where they weren't very good in PvP. Might not be a thing with 1.12 talents but drain tanking people to death and shredding entire teams with dots came after you got AQ gear.
---
I only did that quest as horde.  We just fight over the boss drop that everyone ninjas.

Something like this happened to me recently, except I was in the Hillsbrad mine and it d/c'd me on fall through world, I logged back in at Southshore GY, as a horde member, this was most unsatisfactory
---
If you are leveling a warrior and you try to complete the quest, you will, even if you don't have any friends or a guild, simply because so many other people are trying to do it.
---
I did an "Chen's Empty Keg" quest 2 days ago, you need to bring lion's claws or something like that among the couple other things. So I went Northwest of Ratchet to farm lions. I killed all of the lions hiding in a grass, but still needed some more claws. So, I went to Savanna Matriarchs. And they are walking around... with their little lion kittens.
---
I killed them all in the name of Pandaria's greatest brewmaster. That furry son of a bitch actually has no remorse - in the end, I got only 5 pints of his renowned beer, but I bet he did a whole lion genocide to fulfill his rampant alcoholism.

No fluff! Loving just grinding mobs, working my profs, and questing here and there. 
---
I'm thoroughly enjoying the grind so far.
---
that is the impression i get :) leveling though i feel like i am probably very average right now lol.
---
I've run into a pink haired gnome mage named Mojache on my server, got a good chuckle out of it when I asked about Jimmy's whereabouts. A fair few variations of Pepitos running around as well. I love seeing all these old references!
---
This is the case in retail, but is there enough content in Vanilla to raid that much? Like, I was under the impression a guild would do MC + Ony in a single night.
---
You act like that wouldn't happen anyway. Which it would.
---
What‚Äôs the actual risk tho? Angry people on the internet?
---
How much did Blizzard pay ya for that lmao.  You could have just told me to edit out the word "retard", ya retard.

Horde on Krom checking in. If you need potions any time to fuck shit up (free of charge of course) let me know -Mirogg orc warlock
---
What if they just made all dungeons on Layer 1?
---
It's not a reaction to people getting to 60 fast, it's a reaction to bug abuse that has gone unanswered and will inevitably affect server economies for months to come.
---
  Why would I bust my ass farming mats or fishing when I could just farm end bosses all day and rake in gold by the thousands?
---
It's only easy if they have some kind of analytic even tracking that
---
Yep, noped in start.
---
reeeeee
---
Are you trying to raid?
---
yeah
---
A lot of folks will use a wolf or Wind Serpent for the extra ranged Spell Attack. 
---
In dungeons at 60, I'll be using one of two pets:
---
1. A plain old cat with Bite, Claw, Prowl, and Dash.
---
2. A bat with max level screech for some extra damage reduction.
---
In raids, I'll be using a Wind Serpent or Wolf.  Haven't decided yet.  It kind of depends on whether the guild puts you in a physical DPS group or with casters for mana regen.
---
In PvP, I'll use the Bat as well.
---
It's a level 40 weapon, so I presume it's useless for twinks?

Earth is not sending its best to Azeroth
---
well i have to kill her and resurrect which i havent even figured out how to do yet. none of this is going to be healthy.
---
I'm genuinely curious what advantage this will bring?
---
Just seems like a ton of work for not much gain, it needs to be a boss that's easily 4 manned, you need an army of dudes not involved to Grant you new layers, I dunno... Is it for gold? If you're alone it'll obviously be a boss way lower than you so it won't be for gear?
---
Huh, really? I started playing during wotlk on a Mac.
---
Why on earth is pvping on a pvp server a dick move? You had full health at the start, and it as a 1 on 1. Stop acting as if this is divine karmic intervention when it's literally just normal pvp
---
Pretty sure the level boost for hitting 60 was a meme.
---
So you agree that streamers are absolute garbage as well?

I have like 10 gold at level 33.....
---
How do you have so much!
---
The sad horde get a quest item confused with a bag.
---
Yeah you probably will get your mount a little later but as auction markets develop you will make more and you might still . I got my mount at 44 with a dead market and I just kept pushing to level. Gold will come.
---
It's an early quest item that looks like a bag. Bags are pretty valuable to find early on as they're expensive when you're a broke lowbie.

Except those patterns have tanked because everyone is farming them now. They sold for 250-400g on one of EU's most populated server. Now they're down to 100g or less.

sw herb trainer near mage tower and in park can train you
---
It's true that for pve content, they do need more gear than mages, but I would argue they are actually one of the least gear dependent classes - at least for SL spec which is perhaps the most powerful 1v1 spec in the game. Afflic needs gear more, and destro needs it the most.
---
Ironweave or just some loww rank PvP gear + SL spec,.a warlock will be mopping up players that are *much* better geared if both are equal skill. That spec is pretty meh for BGs though aside from holding AB points
---
How's the proc rate on the blue though for real? Worth trying to get for aoe tanking?
---
Might wanna give the economy a little time to fill up on gold before you try to sell it.
---
What are you the Reddit police? Asshole
---
yeah i think i am having fun at this point :)
---
Forgot I was in the part of the subreddit, lol. You caught me, Blizzard certainly doesn't ban exploiters.
---
It seems more and more that pally tanks are really strong 5-man dungeon tanks, much stronger than warrior, also at lategame.
---
If you want the true tanking experience and being viable for raid tanking however you need to go either Warrior or Druid.
---
The guy that's a fuckwit  who acts as a psuedo mod maybe? Report it if you don't think it belongs
---
the mods on this subreddit are horrendous lmaooo
---
Been there. She didn't have it.
---
I‚Äôm alliance on a pvp server, but damn we are some pussies with that pvp server %
---
Yeah I just read about it and apparently guilds nd streamers are exploiting layering in raids to farm raid bosses over and over. Sounds like a game breaking exploit to me...how sad.
---
He won't look into anything. Blizzard does nothing but wrong and layering is ruining the game etc etc
---
"Lfm dps brd"
---
- "54 pala inv"
---
"Sry we have a healer"
---
- "I'm dps"
---
"Haha good one"
---
Yeah, it just really pissed me off though... they made them amazing in all aspects of the game, great DPS, great tanking, easy to play (one button macro would get you great performance). There's *no* way they didn't know they would be horribly balanced but they ignored it for months to keep them as a selling point.
---
That practice has pissed me off more than anything else they ever did I think, at least while I was playing.
---
57 atm with 60g in cash and about 350 in consumes, cloth, etc. 
---
I was racing a mate to epic mount but he got 2 pristine hides in 5 runs and sold them for a combined 840g so I lost and can cash out my investments whenever.
---
lol are you serious? You guys have an opiod opidemic.
---
Never forgive. Never forget.
---
There are crafting patterns from end-game dungeon bosses
---
Not yet... But eventually yes
---
I have been tailoring so I give away all my bags everytime i upgrade and i give away any i find while questing.  It makes me happy!
---
Even if it‚Äôs too early to remove layering, I wish blizzard would just do it even temporarily until they fix this, because stop the exploit ofc, help us gauge how much layering is needed.
---
Ofc they were lying. Just simple tasks like clearing satyr camp in felwood for felcloth and hopping into new layer to farm it again gave huge benefits. Then you have people hopping to farm devilsaur leather or herbs.   
---
Any players knows that when you do circle route of a zone when herbing for intance you will always be faster than the respawn time.
---
"hey let's blacklist this guy because he didn't know how this poorly constructed escort quest works."

Lvl 39 here was having the same thought, this is pretty reassuring tho, feelsgood to be a newbie somewhat towards the front of the pack

This will never ever happen but it would be glorious if it did!

Try running to Badlands from STV mobs start running at you before they render. Also Western plague lands is conveniently located next to brill an undead starting zone.

A fellow shaman watched me die so when I came back to corpse and watched him be attacked by 3 mobs I just /smile and waited for him to die. I hate to be an ass to my own faction but you let me die friend :(
---
I did my fair share of giving out green cloth armor and wands in the Barrens. I could have had around 50s behind vendoring them, or give it out to newbies and make their game a bit easier. Yesterday my GM gave me 2 mail pieces (blue chest and Scarlet Belt) so I guess karma works.

I mean, maybe it‚Äôs just me but I read the quest reward before I complete it and I read the item when I receive it in a chat window, not sure how someone could confuse a quest item with a slotted bag.  Playing too fast I guess.

# BLADES OF LIGHT!
---
Lvl 60. I am sitting on 4k gold now.
---
No offense to you, but that senior mod is d0g sh!t, people should know about it and even if people abuse it thats the only way blizzard will reset servers so people lose advantage, if not many people do it only high end guilds, RIP servers
---
The end result is minimal.
---
Warlock also destroys a leveling mage.  Leveling mage isn't great in 1v1s at all.
---
I like how people say that but I‚Äôve never had someone that wasn‚Äôt skulled to me try to kill me alone. Only whenever its 3+ of them.

ok danisbest when i will get home later today i will look in game where you can train. but god damn if it will be in SW your buying me beer
---
I'm not sure what the actual cap is. 3000 is just an estimate. 
---
But other than that yes, that is my understanding of the situation Classic WoW has been in since launch. They have layers to allow more people to play on the few number of servers they estimated they would need long term.
---
What do you think the layers are for?
---
A dude in full raid pre bis with the strath mount gave me 200 gold yesterday and some epic boe patterns, felt fucking amazing
---
Iirc, someone fact check me, you actually have higher % to hit from behind. Warriors, paladins, and shamans also can not block attacks from behind, making back stab actually quite reliable
---
This makes it super easy to farm preraid bis gear and boe boss drop patterns. A guild could sit and endlessly layer an instance looking for the arcanite reaper or true faith vestment pattern for example
---
And you DONT see an issue with this?
---
Are you seriously implying that removing basically a how to guide would not reduce the amount of people knowing and potentially using the exploit. Nice try there guy. Its almost like not everyone that frequents Reddit also goes on twitch and vise versa. I literally did not know as many others also didn't know about this exploit until this post. Hmmm really gets the noggin joggin.
---
Just one.  I had just earned it and saw someone in chat asking for help getting their mount.  I remember that struggle, so I gave it up.  It was just one, but I know in vanilla every one counted.  I'll make it back.
---
Are you on Stalagg by chance?
---
yeah im going to have enough kids to make all the popular horde characters
---
No worries, hope it works out for you
---
Been enjoying your posts a lot!
---
Yeah I can count on one hand the number of times I've used eviscerate while leveling. You rarely get enough combo points for it to be useful and the only time it does decent damage is right after you get a new rank. Slice and dice is a lot more useful even while leveling imo.
---
How do you think the majority of people that abuse these things find out about it? It would make sense to remove posts that show people how to abuse the game so less people do it...
---
No Herod
---
Isn't that more...contractual obligation than artistic passion? Viacom don't give a shit, South Park makes money. They want that money.
---
It sounds dumb if this is how simply you think about it but yes a lot of your customers being unhappy about your product will absolutely lead to changes. The more upset people are and the more people that are upset will create changes faster. Try to flesh ideas out a bit more before you make yourself sound sillier than I'm sure you are
---
I'm a casual. It doesn't. It would affect the game for higher end players who were rushing to 60. Imagine playing a new Diablo season and you think you're ahead of the pack, then all of a sudden a new exploit is found that allows people to easily catch up with you. For people with that mentality, I could see it being damaging to the experience.
---
Feel free to explain why you need the 1% hit from the crossbow when you're already overcapped with pre-bis gear (even as a non human).
---
It's pretty passive - think of it like getting extra coppers for killing beasts. You can auction your early leathers for slightly over vendor price, but I think auction money isnt too significant until thick leathers.
---
looks hilarious on your side, kinda wish the visual bug happened on my side too.
---
Clearly you've never played on a pserver.
---
The equivalent of a sucker punch is a dick move, yes.
---
Me too except it just teleported me to the GY - never killed me.
---
That sounds like a bad idea. Luckily that isn't what happened in the OP so I'm not sure why your posting this quote.
---
Maybe not the first week if they aren‚Äôt familiar with the raid...but yes that is easily do able in 3-4 hours with time to chill and be silly.
---
Where "being a dick" means pvping. So butthurt
---
Pat is also a verb in the US
---
Anyone who says layering isn't an issue is actually dumb af lol. All those ppl who told us to shut up about, where y'all at?
---
Ahhh ok, so you are literally just being offended for other people. Go find actual issues and complain about them instead.
---
for wands you'll have to use /stopcasting instead of /stopattack
---
What are you using for ui? I like the character picture and health vs default. Also what combat ui is that?
---
Yeah but I didn't want to encourage them by saying that
---
its actually a joke stolen from mists of pandaria fishing quests
---
100% correct. People aren't just waiting somewhere in their hovel to be offended.  A lot of stupid shit is said, but if you're (not *you*) easily-offended, you need to grow up.  I love Barrens Chat.  Please never change, Barrens Chat.
---
1) I appreciate the transparency you're doing here and I understand you did not remove that post
---
2) Why don't you just allow the community to dictate posts like that via the voting system? Ignoring things against Reddit's TOS, why remove posts rather than allowing the /r/classicwow userbase to police themselves?
---
I see why he's so furious
---
Same here, level 27 and about 13g. I just realized after looking at a warlock leveling guide a few min ago that the mount was almost free for locks. It‚Äôs been so long I had completely forgotten!
---
Roll need on cloth healer gear, become a heal bot banana.  Later on get healer plate and roll a holy  / protection healer pally in pvp and feel like an undying god
---
I am! Who dis!?
---
Got it in Strat Live.
---
So this is what secondhand embarrassment feels like
---
ma man :)
---
I don't know anything about what's pre-bis for rogues, but hit is still useful as white hits aren't capped until much higher %.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be easy for bilzzard to figure out if people have used this exploit to farm ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of gold‚Äù? 
---
He also says he wants blizzard to ‚Äútake their time‚Äù...meanwhile there must be guilds farming MC with this trick round the clock.  
---
This is a crazy exploit...I can‚Äôt even believe layering works in instances...i don‚Äôt see a reason for that.
---
What? No, this is all a conspiracy by blizzard, who have bought out the mod team here clearly.
---
Oh hey you had me (purpslabbins) highlighted lol. Too bad I didn‚Äôt get to see this! But incendius horde ftw
---
I'd assume it already has on some servers.
---
After a late night game session, OP goes to sleep with white rectangles burned into his corneas

---
Hi, friend
---
Great! I've helped a couple of guildies get WW and while there there has been a couple of Ally Warriors in their low 30s trying to get it also to which I helped. After that I let the lowbies 1v1 lol.  
---
Also, a lot of Warrior respect at the island for our Berz stance I've noticed.
---
30 days for multiple free boosts. You‚Äôre just proving his point.
---
Plus the whole "there are no mobs" thing becomes a massive plus when you realize grouping up with the other questers and actually socializing in this mmo effectively solves the problem.
---
If mods enforced any semblance of rules. The subreddit wouldnt be filled with garbage posts.
---
Mariejayne, ayyyy.
---
Knowing Barrens chat as I do I wasn't expecting this to be as funny as it was
---
&gt; They just played more than you **AND** exploited game mechanics at the same time
---
FTFY
---
Oh ok thank you dude
---
He's right you know
---
Went magram, regretted it. Working on gelkis now.
---
You make a good point. Now I have to wonder, what other layering exploits like this are out there and haven‚Äôt been discovered/exposed yet? 
---
I was never really for layering, but was willing to give it a chance. But we really should not have gone down this path. Server merges later on (if necessary) would have been preferable to me over potential major exploits such as the one discovered by OP. Just a small exploit like this can absolutely devastate a server economy as we now see. And the fact that beta testing never went beyond lvl 45 makes me think there could be more exploits like this in the higher level zones/instances. 
---
It really is too bad that blizz severely underestimated the interest in classic, cause I have feeling layering will be here for many more months before they are able to get rid of it.
---
the joke is from MoP, blizzard themselves made the joke, doubt it gets renamed
---
Can't meow either. I want to meow at other cat druids that I see but instead I have to lick them

# SERVER MERGING
---
You can't do a whole lot in cat form in pvp. It's main use against equally geared opponents is just to stealth and get a stun off. If you stay in cat form any length of time against a physical dps like warrior/rogue you'll die very quickly.
---
[gg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tb0BCJK91c&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Best comment in the thread.
---
&gt; Now farming that pesky *everything* just became easy as fuck...
---
So yea, that quest was executed horribly. 
---
But a lot of people ive seen talk about it say "Why not just have the first quest be the escort, that way there wont be a problem" and while that is true, having the extra quest where you kind of read through some shit and make an oath and shit is very RP and very cool.
---
My solution would rather have been to make so that escort NPC's are not un-interactable. That would fix this and every other escort.
---
If you could pick up and deliver quests to them while they are in "escort-mode".
---
Whaaaa?! My favorite. I just sent you some pants! How was the slow cook dinner?
---
Bro you've got this.  Just watch youtube and prepare.  You want to play ret, so play it. Nobody cares its not "optimal". It looks really fun tbh.
---
Keep in mind that all those numbers provided by census sites are based on scans with a mod. They scan characters, not players...so the numbers are not accurate but merely show a trend.
---
Also for PvP: the battlegrounds are the most interesting part and they will be cross realm.
---
Also keep in mind that on servers where you are the underdog, leveling can be frustrating at times.
---
at this time they either need to completely wipe the servers, the economies are already fucked beyond repair.
---
Horde does that too, we just control the outside. Replace undercity with stormwind and you'll do well.
---
Yeesh man dont be classist, it's 2019
---
I remember when The Elite got busted doing this. Pretty sure Eminence was in on it too.
---
you're so cool
---
Why were the other ones removed if your being pedantic?
---
I did the exact same, I honesty thought at minimum they'd bring more raids like what we had in wotlk, all we got as a side raid was ToV which noone wanted to run, I quit at ToS because they showed they had no interest in survival as a spec and it was completely unviable unless you spammed NH for titanforged gear
---
Yeh this is just deliberate exploitation of a game system that isn‚Äôt working as intended. They have banned people for doing similar things in retail (like that recent thing to gain huge amounts of xp, I can‚Äôt remember what it was).
---
Undead Paladin, I would make it my main ASAP.
---
What is layering?
---
Someone got Frost Nova'd
---
STV is hell! Hell I tellz ya! I see something I get ganked, I chill and I get ganked. I gank back than get ganked again!
---
I like that the other priest got a good kick out of it too
---
Plenty of the people in full prebis streamed the whole thing. I‚Äôm sure some people exploited this, but the people acting like it‚Äôs impossible to be prebis right now are crazy.
---
Personal attacks...nice. 
---
Thanks for showing you are wrong.
---
Could you do this to farm hand of justice?
---
I tend to find Alliance players on the road, which I'd argue constitute as monsters.
---
WoW isn‚Äôt the first to do this. ArcheAge has done fresh start server a few times now. CoD rereleased CoD MW because people wanted it back. People know what they like and what they want. WoW is probably just the biggest game to do this now.
---
Ahem...

THANK you! haha im glad someone else said it

Well the guy replied to me about how it wasn't optimal, so yes of course I respond with how it is optimal. Also yes, you can say "well people are bad at the game so your points invalid" for a lot of things, has nothing to do with the fact it is empirically better.

Safe it for later

Can anyone explain "camp resetting" I've seen streamers somehow log off then appear at the entrance of a dungeon, but i can't seem to do that, i just log back in where i was.

I‚Äôd go make to my main BE pally, hopefully with the original racials.
---
Honest question. When is it ok to attack someone then? People kill a mob, loot it and repeat. Attack during combat and you're a dick. Attack during looting you're a dick?
---
I'm a warrior so I don't really gank people but what would be a better time to attack someone? Do I need to /point him and wait and hope he drinks up fully and then we somehow countdown from 3 and both go?
---
Zug zug
---
People abusing layering inside of dungeons to farm bosses is a much bigger issue.
---
You should /gquit. You‚Äôre clearly having fun. üòÇ

Pvp encounters need to be have another factors of one-sidedness
---
Oh stop your bitching. It's been nonstop like layering is the fucking boogey and is out to destroy the poor fragile integrity of classic wow. Literally unplayable. You HAVE authentic classic wow, but guess what? It's not fucking 2004 anymore and wow isn't some upstart MMO. You remember the day one queues tens of thousands of players long? People thought that was a disaster, now imagine if layering wasn't around how awful it would be. Probably have a lot more server crashes and then every bitching about how they spent two days in a queue and the server went down because nearly half the server was trying to stand in Northshire at the same time. You already have Blizzard coming out after every little incident trying to explain "no that's not how layering works". Is this an exploit with layering? Yeah probably, is it intended? No fucking way. So it's a bug. Vanilla wow was so damn riddled with them but you guys love them so damn much. And god forbid you do a two second google search and remember that Blizzard has already long ago told everyone that layering was always intended to be removed. So what good is it to screech at Blizzard to do something they are already in the process of doing? And you know what, who the fuck cares? Just don't exploit the game if it bothers you that much. Everyone else has been happily playing the game as normal. So yes bring it to Blizzard's attention there's a bug, but don't pretend like one easily avoidable exploit tarnishes the whole game as "unauthentic classic".

Orc warrior (Luckycg) here on Smolderweb! Can confirm I also had a group come help me secure the WW axe! 
---
Really enjoying this server, no signs of it dieing any time soon. Great players! 
---
(Also, purchasing your stacks of silk cloth for 38s! -Accepting CoD!!!)
---
Add an apple to the mix, I'm sure it will balance it out.
---
What's the difference between that and auctioneer
---
It‚Äôs kinda like a zone refresh
---
Only reason I want to get to 60 quick is headless horseman next month.
---
terrible.
---
Oh maybe the Reddit iPhone app is fucked up, it‚Äôs showing it as a completely standalone comment.
---
You've clearly never fought one that knew what they were doing.
---
Having to explicitly put a /s in posts annoys me. I thought I was enough hyperbolic, but it still wasn't enough.
---
Sounds like a surround sound issue on your rig, not an in game bug
---
Yeah you can bounce around zones, but its also a good idea to grind mobs for at least a full level every zone or so. Leaving Elwynn at level 9 is pretty odd, 10-12 would make more sense. I left Durotar on my Orc at level 12 and Tirisfal on my Undead at level 11. Both times I grinded and skinned about a levels worth of mobs so when I went to the Barrens or Silverpine, the first mobs were my level or below me.
---
Some mob locations are force spawned as you clear and some are on timers. I assume this is a force spawn area
---
They have to remove it because too many people are catching on to how to abuse it :(
---
I got bored of waiting almost 4 sec to hit something and respec fury \~lvl 48. It was great. Since I was leveling through dungeons, I had thrash blade and another great 1h. Great for tanking also, just make a macro to equip your shield when you start getting slapped around a bit too much. You only start to really feel the miss % when fighting mobs above your level. Stay in zones 2-3 levels below you and np.
---
Blizzard definitely has analytics in the WoW client. Set up a network filter and watch for telemetry-in.battle.net.

There was one on the AH today on Sulfuras alliance side for 150g.
---
This is the best in alterac before the match starts!
---
The sweet sweet 15 min debuff :D
---
&gt;I love PVP as much as the next guy, but every questing zone 30+ being 10 horde to 1 alliance isn't fun.
---
This is exactly the reason I rolled Alliance.
---
I was saying I don't know either way, but pointing out *why* hit is still valuable beyond cap. I'm a neutral in this fight and you got pissy. Chill out.
---
I wonder if Blizzard might ask youtube to not air those ads? Do you think youtube might help them?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12651/blackcrow
---
suspensions and bans aren't punishment enough
---
#EXPORT THEIR CHARACTERS TO RETAIL
---
the ultimate punishment
---
Why doesn't blizzard just fix their game? How thick are you? I'm beyond tired of people apologizing for them.
---
Death is TECHNICALLY a cure for poison!
---
so far, the 2, 100 roll, I saw, went to the last one who roll 100. As of here. MAYBE its a coincidence, but rolling last every dam time now.
---
Lol I mean I guess if you are so bad that you need to optimize your gear to complete low level dungeons that's on you... Like I said, it's a waste of money to buy that stuff because it is not NEEDED. If you want to you can buy the stuff and set yourself back, but sounds like a you problem.
---
&gt; Yes, depending how much reddit posts show up determine how their software development cycle goes.
---
Negative press can do a lot, can even make reddit admins appear somewhat decent.
---
That is very interesting thank you !
---
He thought his 3 level gap was enough to be lazy
---
if you think they'll do anything about this you're delusional.
---
34 w/12G
---
We are the keepers of the scarlet monastery!
---
maybe he meant they will burn in the fires of hell. in which case banning his name is discriminating against him for his religious beliefs. so much for being tolerant huh.
---
No law states boost are illegal.
---
Is that a wow content creator? Think he has a say in what ads air in his vids? Idk if youtube would refuse ad money just for Blizzard.
---
There is no level of incompetence I would be suprised by from blizzard.
---
There were so many solutions given tho. Like how to prevent layer hopping to gain advantage? Simply layer hop only if your party member is within say 40y radius. That would instantly kill people layer hopping by inviting people that are on the other side of the world.
---
But blizzard does. Pretty much every exploit in wow history has been met with a temporary ban and nothing reverted.
---
Level 19, one WHOLE gold.
---
Any item that is selling on the AH for 20s is prob under level 15 item and it just proves my point even more. It's a waste of money on an item you will replace when you could be saving.
---
Getting the baron mount in a day because you can kill him a dozen times per hour at least saves you 800 gold. Plus every kill is like 10 Gold worth of loot for 2 minutes of work.
---
Panda demon hunter, of course
---
Yeah, because something like this can only go through a reddit post. Are you implying people are too stupid that they can't say how to do this ingame?
---
I know tons of players in game that are already doing this, that are decked out in pre raid bis and tons of gold before this reddit post happened
---
They're deflecting because they're trying to maintain the peace.   
---
It's too late though. The gates are open.
---
Level 60 with 550g.
---
Please this. If this sub doesn't get any better I really hope a good theory crafting sub gets created instead
---
What is layering
---
So the system that they didn't implement into classic? The old raid lockout was something they didn't bring over to classic
---
Engineering rogue, Helmut that gives you a targeted knock down, blind, stuns, leaving combat to restealth and make all the plays.  Bleeds are op too... basically watch world of roguecraft.... shows you all the shenanigans!

What up!!! We're a bunch of cool guys looking for other cool guys who wanna whip out our rods and dip them in something wet. Nothing sexual. Dudes in good shape encouraged, if you're fat you should be able to find humor in the little things. Again, NOTHING SEXUAL

my bad guys didnt know it was that good for rogues

Lol no. This is Stormzy, he's a UK grime artist. I don't think he cares what ads are on his videos.

The Barrens Chat is always super helpful.
---
Way to educate.
---
Too bad Bloodsail is my Alliance server. Deviate Delight Horde wooooo
---
The most recent case on r/dota2 of people DDoSing other people in matches got tons of exposure and upvotes, in multiple threads. Then the threads where the exploiters got 6-year bans or something like that also got tons of replies and upvotes. So not really mass deletion in that case.
---
Even sports competitions only give out temporary bans for cheating. A ban being temporary doesn't mean you're unpunished
---
Same here man I can‚Äôt stand rude people
---
I'd add Garrote to this list. Also you don't need to buy Kick past level 1. Damage increase isn't worth the cost and still the same interrupt effect.
---
why not use a macro? like
---
/cast \[stance:1\] combatability
---
/cast \[stance:2\] defability
---
/cast \[stance:3\] zerkerability
---
no need to change abilitys with macro's like that :p
---
&gt; I would love to transfer to a server that has layering off
---
You think you do but you dont
---
Layering is not the issue, but how it is implemented. Like why game even swap layers for people when their party memebers are not even close to each other?
---
feral damage is actually competitive in phase 1 with powershifting
---
"BUT SOMEONE SM FARMED AND LEVEL FASTER THEN ME ITS BROKEN"
---
So..are you mad? 
---
"lol no i was just PRETENDING to be retarded and offended at how others play the game"
---
Druids are completely viable and in many cases better or equal to warrior. There are a few cases in raids where druids struggle ALOT but it is on specific bosses only.
---
Maybe if Blizz paid them to, which they wouldn't.
---
You get to play rock paper scissor mushroom too!
---
So what if it does. If you get banned just make a new account. Couldnt care less if some nerd bans me for negative opinion. If you dont post from fear of getting banned you have lost big time.
---
Clip?
---
You realize they cant just poof a fix into existence over night right? How thick are you?
---
Rude. I love the DND character drawings, and this one is awesome too.
---
man I just click every yellow dot in sight and throw up the questie map for 2 secs and run toward some markers.
---
Same here don't worry, I can't get online at all right now it says Servers are unavailable.
---
I think that blizzard has the power to end these websites like they killed private vanilla servers. If they really wanted to. :(
---
A dps class says to me they want to be useful in a group and in pvp primarily because of the damage they bring. That aint druid. Druid's are great but should be played by people that know what they're in for, not people that just want to turn into a cat and expect to kill everything.
---
Not believing in climate science is actually retarded though
---
I used to listen semi religiously a couple of years ago. Are they still rocking and rolling?
---
&gt; There is no way they aren't going to ban for this.
---
I'll make a friendly bet with you that nobody gets anything worse than a 14-day ban. No items/money reverted.
---
I would agree if 95% of the tanks I run with didn't have difficulty with LoSing or shield bashing. Just pointless to have mobs running around throwing heals / AoEs that harm the entire group over a bit of threat.
---
Any idea what is goin on?
---
They already removed a lot of layers for previously full realms(you can notice it when you try to swap layers and there are only couple) and queues are getting smaller at the same time so for sure tons of people are leaving Classic. I can see layering being gone in p2 easy. Honeymoon is slowely ending, both for casuals hitting a wall at lvl20 and 40 and hardcore games realising there is not much to do at max level.
---
no
---
You really want to get rid of layering? It takes me like 1 hour to do a kill 10x quest cause of all the people, if the remove layering it would be even worse
---
The end game is absolutely not solved, because some things are different than on pservers. 
---
I can only speak to warrior, here were some unsolved things from this week: 
---
1.	does HoJ drop from Angerforge? Or was it a recorded data bug
---
2.	Are emh worth it for humans vs nonhumans 
---
3.	Why are attacks being missed at hit cap
---
4.	Is overpower being dodged? Bug or paranoia?
---
5.	How to measure procrates from a combatlog with dual wield
---
6.	How much was demo about nerfed and is battle shout the new aoe threat meta
---
7.	What the fuck is up with the buff cap? Was it like that in vanilla or is it a bug?
---
And I‚Äôm only in there for a little bit a day, and I see much more meaningful discussion than on reddit. If you think the game is solved, then go let all the theorycrafters know that they‚Äôre working for nothing üòÇ
---
11agi is worth far more than 1% hit when you're already at 9%, which you will be in pre-bis gear. That's why the gun is better.
---
This would be commendable were it not the dirty Alliance.
---
oof
---
This right here is like 90% of the reason Vanilla/old world quests held so much appeal. Instead of each zone being a self-contained leveling experience, everything is connected to something else in some way. New expansions feel flat in story because they're focused on a handful of different things, and all have to (mostly) conclude their stories by the end of the zone/expansion. Classic quests are all about the worldbuilding and laying the foundation for everything else that follows.
---
Crazy idea, but not everyone's idea of fun is getting constantly sidetracked in world pvp while trying to level.
---
Lvl40 and no gold. I am a warlock though.-
---
servers went into maintenance, don't know for how long
---
Level 36 and 40 gold.
---
At 33 I had 90 silver so I feel like I am heading to the right direction o to get my mount at least! :D
---
We are SMOrc from Taiwan , we got 2 raid groups to visit Ironforge yesterday and surely failed(we got 4 last time)
---
Glad we got many  alliance try to fight back , not easy to get in like last time. This is why we come to US server
---
All the great pvp and town raid stuff. Just so fun!!
---
We will attack every weekend (not only Ironforge maybe some other  alliance point)
---
[Super relevant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0Ca_INfz0)
---
So if I my respec costs 5G now and I wait a week or month it won't go down to 1 again?
---
is this not against tos?
---
servers are restarting. got in game notice a few mins ago
---
Exactly. Also perma all the exploiters. Unfortunately the damage to the economy has already been done, which makes me really sad. To the point I'd even wish for a complete classic reset, as radical as that is...
---
Weekly server reset
---
Anytime
---
LMAO BRO JUST REROLL ON A PVE SERVER YOU FUCKING VAGINA I LITERALLY 5V1 HORDE AND SOLO QUEST ALL DAY U JUST SUCK LEARN TO PLAY AND PVP IDIOT LMAPO
---
Thank you! Will look into that
---
It‚Äôs not different. Perhaps it was done accidentally in their case, but it is the same bug.
---
I hope that's not a PvP server.
---
That's awesome!  anything that works..  Real life isn't that different.. think of it like quests. :)
---
Coulda said Deadmines and I‚Äôd still believe it was a real conversation
---
That's because there's a lot of issues that aren't given attention until the game is released and the activity of the playerbase shoots up several times over.
---
There is nothing that can be truly fixed. People are crafty and find different ways to abuse mechanics and all of a sudden there are new issues. From what we've seen, the majority of the original on-set issues that *were in the focus during beta* were in fact fixed, so they did work on it.
---
I performed this type of analytics as a junior engineer   It's literally trivial to plug all the server-transfering accounts into an excel spreadsheet.
---
You do have to authenticate when you play the game, remember.
---
Lol same experience, I was casually running up to a mod for this low drop and when suddenly a moonfire tagged it. I was kinda pissed.
---
Then an alliance priest came running up being so I did a /sit and watched him get demolished by the mob and priest.
---
Funny enough the priest did a /nod and went about his business right afterwards. As the Druid laid there I only said ‚Äúyou deserved it‚Äù before bouncing away in cat form.
---
Ahhh I love classic
---
Yeah I'd say that's one class that is favoured against them because locks have strong cc and better sustain
---
Shit like this is why we needed open beta. Jesus christ, can't wait to see what the next game ruining bug is gonna be.
---
Nah, exploit early, exploit often.
---
Noone will get banned for this, just as noone got banned for spamming 10man dungeons.
---
Hey I'm horde but I'll chill for a pint...
---
I had 90silver at lvl 33 :D 
---
40g at 36 just because I did a few SM runs the other night and after that I have just been grinding mobs (NOT QUESTING!) and I feel like this is a good way to earn XP at a decent pace and also get better money out of it.
---
(Warrior with WW axe if that matters)
---
Server selection question: I live on the west coast but my friends are playing on sulfuras (east coast server). Should I choose sulfuras or bigglesworth? I am sensitive to ping and the Ping different is 70ms vs 30ms when I pinged the 2
---
according to the information thingy on the left it says from 03:00 to 04:00 CEST.
---
But.... it shut down at 04:00 CEST. So im guessing 05:00
---
what the fuck are you talking about? Injecting a massive amount of gold into the economy doesn'1t affect anyone? Getting ganked by someone who is in full BiS by cheating doesn't affect anyone?  
---
What if you're a hardcore player who views PvE as competitive? This would completely ruin the game if that were you, eventhough you're not the one who did it.
---
Hit is not that important in PvP. If you're focusing on PvP then do Subtlety or Assassination.
---
This is also exactly what Shadow Unit Frames looks like
---
I legit laughed out loud.
---
you should add where you're from and what language you speak :)
---
Earthfury is more dead than John McCain, just don't do it.
---
Ye you aren't gimped early on enough you won't enjoy it for BG farming, but a few of my mates are warlocks right now specifically because they got wrecked by them in BGs constantly, having joined post AQ. They don't reach that stage for awhile, and the difference between some phases is night and day, whereas some classes just get progressive better rather than have a huge leap around AQ.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Ew twitch memes outside of twitch
---
back up
---
Yeah, I saw that too but... it says it's supposed to be on the 18th of September, not 16th. What's up with that? Also no updates about it on their Twitter yet...
---
Level 35 with 40g
---
I didnt realise pvping in a pvp zone was being a dick lol
---
I just do my own thing till I get attacked. Love an underdog fight and denying a gank. But for the Horde on my server it seems to be: lower level red= dead. I've yet to be attacked by someone close to my level qq
---
Yes, but it was disclosed prior to people joining, not right before the pull.
---
Who?
---
I'd love for there to be arenas in the game, as long as it doesn't give gear
---
Incoming mod deletion
---
i'm 26

this is account sharing, anyone that did this for you would be breaking TOS and risking their own accounts.

Ganking isnt "being a dick" unless your a pussy, always expect pvp on a pvp realm, and a priest killing a mage isnt somthing to brag about
---
No you didn't
---
whats the best way to abuse this before they fix
---
Pay $15 and get your own account.
---
You realize that they had a beta and ample time (2+ years) to get the game working? Do you realize that layering should have never been added in the first place?
---
Bro you think this is the first time instances were exploited? Every time ppl got banned forever lol. Look it up. Sorry about your account.
---
biggle has 47% alliance... honestly pretty good
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community#us-realms
---
Layers are different instances of the game world. Allows lots of people to be in the same place without overcrowding. By changing layers, by changing or leaving groups, you can enter a new layer where you didn't kill the boss...and kill it again then change layer etc...
---
Let me introduce you to [this bad boy](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2816/death-speaker-scepter) from RFK. You're gonna love this thing, especially if you already have an offhand item

Their ban waves were related to instance exploiting lol.

Yezzan just became KOS.
---
Yes, it's swords they can't use
---
Uhm.. what did he do? Did he just invite a person to his grp?
---
100g per hour where wtf. The max I've been able to farm as a mage is 50g per hour
---
I'm enjoying my rogue but I kinda regret not rolling a mage like I planned. On the other hand there are way too many mages and rogue is the least played class on my server, so hopefully I get a bunch of drops at 60 assuming it's not all stolen by warriors.
---
I‚Äôm a decent baiter, but my cousin Mose, he‚Äôs masterbaiter.
---
yeah i get that. but its still the same mentality and he was aware it wouldnt fly announcing it beforehand.
---
What KOS addon are you referring too? Sounds cool!
---
Horizontal progression is a hard sell. You want devs to spend 12months and millions of development dollars on content that offers zero incentive to the player that is focused on character power progression and has already finished Naxx.  
---
That's great you want WoW to be a questing/levelling/alt sim, but that's not what a lot of people like about WoW or want it to be.

It's a bug which players are currently exploiting and hence players will likely have their accounts actioned.

---
Warhammer and Dwarf Fortress references in the classic wow sub? What a time to be alive.

Maybe it had to do with the layering exploits in dungeons

Should have just bought a krol blade on the auction house like me; only took me 30 seconds. You're a warlock use a firestone.
---
Pet attacking doesn't interrupt cast times of pve casters, only player characters

It's crazy that after so many years Blizzard still didn't figure out a way to make realms have balanced H:A ratio.
---
Good to know, just repeating what I had heard
---

---
B-but... Blizzard knows more than you!
---
There is a guild on one of my servers (don't remember which), called &lt;I'm Going Thralls Deep&gt;.
---
Hilarious shit.
---
thats not how layering works, but then thats also not what a layering system should care. this is just a minor \`abuse\` but still wouldnt be that unfair. imagine you have an unlimited mine deposit in front of you right now, would you actually care and mine it 10 hours straight thinking that it will give you a huge edge? i dont think so. for the valuable mines, you would think you gonna get rich, but then there would be like another dozens of people doing the same thing which would cause that \`abused profit\` is not that profitable any more.
---
right now i cant even do quests at peak time. nps spawns are too slow, dungeons are almost the only way to get xp which is also not faster than quests. seriously its fucking annoying already with 5 people trying to tag the mobs just to do their quests in a same spot. i dont even wanna talk about \`kill the x nps\` quests. good luck waiting for 15 something minutes for the spawn and end up not doing it due to some dude tagging it outside of your party. And this all shit happening when there is layering system. i cant even imagine what would happen without it. people would legit quit
---
Its /pat lmao

---
&gt; prebis
---
this isn't what he said.
---
Early 2000s mountain goats for me, but the dandy warhols are in there as well for my nostalgia purposes.
---
&gt; Why the fuck aren't layers zone-specific?
---
Among other reasons (sharding which is zone specific not well received by players) layers are continent wide because of incompatibilities with certain NPC's that have patrol paths across zone borders, and escort quests that cross zone borders. The vanilla game wasn't designed with sharding in mind so they went with the somewhat simpler solution (and hopefully more palatable) of simply having entire duplicate copies of the continent running. That was the theory anyway...
---
check out Madseasonshow on youtube, he is a wow classic class guide that‚Äôs worth a watch and should help.
---
Dont brag about easy things.
---
I really hope it‚Äôs true.
---
Ok cya
---
What are you using to record? Always unsure of how people have clips while playing for hours
---
 Already ???
---
There are too many playing wow classic to not have layering. Not having it was fine 15 years ago because the sub base was so much smaller. If it bugs you to the point of not wanting to play that‚Äôs fine. But they need it at this point
---
Ah, you are on Kromcrush!
---
No. I'm not.
---
But there‚Äôs no actual proof of anyone in raid bis, so either he meant prebis or he‚Äôs just assuming people got raidbis and then getting mad about his own assumption
---
I‚Äôm pretty certain I got HoJ off Angerforge in vanilla. I could be mistaken of course but I always associated it with Angerforge and was surprised to see emperor listed as a source
---
Yeah I don't see any downsides
---
I bet you‚Äôre really fun at parties
---
Be sure to keep up posted on all the other stuff you're *not* doing.
---
A guy tried to do this with me yesterday.  I was set for bags so just thanked him and canceled the trade. Really nice though.  The sense of community in this game is magical.
---
I think he misunderstood the quest from Mankrik...

The horde are spending their time out of game getting pussy instead of going to board game cafes

As most have said, a Classic+ in the same vein as OSRS with voting would be ideal. 
---
I'd keep the level cap as it is, introduce a Mastery system possibly, a la GW2 (though I haven't read deep into it I admit). Keep the game "slow" as weird as it sounds. Introduce more player customization (BRING BACK COSMETIC GLYPHS I want my spells pretty. ) open up parts of the world that are closed off and revamp the areas that are stagnant (Hyjal, Gilneas, Azshara, etc.)
---
oh - that's my server!
---
no reason for layering to be beyond lvl 30.
---
take a look at Gehennas EU server. 1 guild controlls everything because they are abusing the layering, and they're extremely smart for doing it. They own the economy
---
Cannot stop giggling.
---
I'm 38 ffs. lol
---
Get new raids with spec specific gear.
---
Maybe introduce more specific subraces but not like retail. But id like to be able to play as a lordaeron refugee. No major change but maybe a little chainquest giving a bit more identity. I mean theres that crazy lady from lordaeron in sw just waiting to be a part of a quest. 
---
Demon hunters? No.
---
Death knights? Like this? No, maybe a ashbringer questchain.
---
Most points are good.
---
Sounds like someone bought the UtechSmart Venus. 4 of us 5 friends playing Classic have the same mouse. Super good quality especially for the price.
---
No one will get banned for this unfortunately :(
---
How do you find the AH? Like going prices for some fairly common goods. Cloth Stacks for instance?
---
LMMFAO!!!!!!!!!!! AHAHAHAH you almost killed an alliance player irl, I almost  choked.
---
I've had my Naga chroma for years now, and the 12 buttons on the side made it 100 times easier for pvp. I absolutely love it.
---
Also mining in retail gives exp
---
Dude, that's awesome. Nice job. I also raided Classic / BC and your macros rock.
---
those addons were making the groups for you, therefore removing any need for social interaction. that's what blizz didn't like.
---
Puggle shows you who you can contact, but does none of the contacting/grouping itself.
---
it's the difference between getting a premade frozen pizza, and getting all the fresh ingredient from the market and making your own pizza :-)
---
too bad delusional people are the vast majority of the playerbase
---
Leather working and skinning would be an easy and useful skill
---
What‚Äôs the deal here so I know when I get to it
---
Jerry, they were on my server in retail!
---
No, but it is very dickish.
---
My huntard did this yesterday too for like 15 minutes. It was great
---
I'm in blue there, each color is a different commenter.
---
For those considering Planet Fitness, they don't have squat racks.
---
haha
---
What does Kaz mean?
---
What were these exploits?
---
Thank you! I already had leather working but I‚Äôll definitely pick up skinning.
---
Stuff like this can permanently unbalance and give advantages to people
---
Mine is just &lt;Booty Bay&gt;
---
Dude its 15$
---
Razer*
---
Wat
---
Basically every time this sort of thing happens people get banned for a short time, not rolled back, and keep all the benefit they got from the exploit. Blizz really fucks up basically every time.
---
This is why I don‚Äôt join guild premades unless I know the guild. I‚Äôd advise everyone to do the same.
---
You could post this on /r/HerodClassic to spread word on the server
---
Still, your original answer doesn't dispute my argument. You simply stated that not everyone would care about it.
---
I love paladin. I'm never worried about dying in a 1v1 fight and usually end up healing in group fights, which means we usually win. Having a paladin is basically a trump card. Good dmg, and insane backup heals, bubbles, cures.
---
What does Kaz mean? I‚Äôm new too
---
"ah man, idk what happened! You saw me casting it on you. I guess I was just late!"
---
Fuck, really?
---
Docccc!!!!
---
I‚Äôm 34 almost 35 and still won‚Äôt step foot in STV. I may check it out tomorrow morning early when the population is lower but last time I went there when I was 32 all I saw way ?? Players running around face rolling.
---
just start your own group bro
---
no hero classes please. were all suppose to be "becoming heros" already...
---
I‚Äôve got a 3 weeker, sleeps like he would if I had him in the bassinet. Allows for some good chunks of wow time.
---
Way better than on Dalaran. For the past two days people have been arguing about Trump. On WoW. Bruh.
---
God I hate this quest
---
Shut up.
---
This is another issue. It's a bug, not layering being bad.
---
Hell yea dude! I do the same with my infant!
---
leveling a warrior as your first character is so painful. At least as a second char/alt you can feed them everything from your main lvl 60 so it's not too bad.
---
Yea ive reacted to this aswell, its really fucking annoying having the nova totem destroyed before it did damage.
---
on l-hope the totem didnt produce any threat on being placed. but on k-r-o-n-o-s even critters killed it before it could explode.
---
make sure to damage everything just a little before placing it, strange thing is that i havent had that problem with magma totem...
---
What's a good vendor add-on?
---
No way dude being a good dad is awesome now it‚Äôs 2019 claim that shit
---
Azshara was my favorite zone in the game and I still get sad about it. There was just something about it that really... I don't know. There wasn't hardly anything to do there, but it didn't need it. The zone felt overwhelmingly ominous, peaceful, eerie and beautiful all at once. It felt locked in time, you had felwood right beside it that was overrun with plague/corruption and it hadn't quite crossed the river into Azshara yet but... yeah, I can't ever explain the feelings that zone gives me. I'd go there to herb herbs I didn't need, fish, or just AFK. It's the only zone I ever just went to, for no reason whatsoever. 
---
I haven't been back since Cata..
---
Here's the hard truth. 
---
If they don't add content to the game, it will die.
---
Couldn't agree more. I barely had any free time to begin with but now I have none but I don't care, wow classic is like good for my soul or something.
---
You had to manually edit your game files so you could drop down between certain sections of the world, and skip large amounts of trash content.
---
The layering thing doesn't require you edit game files, and it's accomplished using valid ingame commands so it's not in the same league.
---
People are upset and want the people abusing layering banned though.
---
Was watcing a video when this ad popped up. It was advertising a levelling service from 1-60.
---
tbh blizzard could do it without layering no problem but that would cost money  and blizzard loves money.
---
That‚Äôs too bad I was going to grind leather as much as I could there for mount gold..
---
7d ban and rolled back to the very first time they started to exploit so they don't get the benefits, or perm ban. That's the only two ways this isn't horse shit going forward.  Sadly blizz always slaps on the wrist and leaves people with all the benefit they gained.
---
Yeah if it's 5 now. If you wait 30 days it should go down to 1.
---
The game was still new back then. 15 years later of course people are going to exploit the systems. I rolled a mage. Not knowing that aoe spell cleave comps would be so popular.
---
Why is he a dick? It's a pvp server.
---
Again not my talent build
---
They changed the collision map of the floor at the first boss to AQ40, which allowed them to fall through and skip straight to Twin Emps/C'thun.
---
Should start a cross-faction caster mafia that camps this pet 24/7. You could technically make it impossible to have the pet if it weren't for layering. (honestly one of the reasons I hate layering most is extra broken tooth's in the world).
---
Make me shut up
---
You are awesome. TY for the macros
---
Camping in pure toxicity and should never be tolerated.
---
\_Read post\_
---
... With derogations
---
what spell that he used to put you like this? I want to learn
---
Numbers
---
But there is a "-" in front of it
---
Terrifying stuff
---
Psy Scream has a shorter cooldown than WotF I am pretty sure. Might as well throw it out there.
---
Yea, fuckin whiny millennials...
---
Tell em to fuck off and go eat their avacado toast.
---
Bitchy little shits ruin everything.
---
oh yeah this is new
---
Is this on Grobbulus?
---
&gt; Why don't you just allow the community to dictate posts like that via the voting system? 
---
Because this sub is obviously indirectly directly linked to Blizzard and thus adheres to Blizzard's ToU so as to not lose that status.
---
This moderating policy is the same across every single gaming subreddit. Detailed exploit explanations are strictly banned.
---
&gt;2) Why don't you just allow the community to dictate posts like that via the voting system? Ignoring things against Reddit's TOS, why remove posts rather than allowing the /r/classicwow userbase to police themselves?
---
Because communities are and always have been incapable of policing themselves and turn into cesspools. This argument is as retarded today as it was the other hundred thousand times someone has made it.
---
Such a neat idea nwn
---
It is lol
---
I think its more of a problem of going down the same path we've already gone down before. Simply stacking new raids or levels on top of old ones renders old content obsolete and kill the 'world' aspect just like in retail. This is honestly one thing that has plagued retail for years. It'll all eventually lead to the similar problems retail is experiencing.
---
Personally, the idea of simply just having an end, a proper end, a "you beat the game" if you will is a far better way of handling it.
---
If ping matters that much, sure, choose a different realm.
---
But WoW isn't a game where ping matters that much, outside of hardcore PvP. Hell, as an Australian, I had a 200ms ping for years before Aus servers existed.
---
I'd just play with your friends imho.
---
we'll see in an hour if they get to keep it ;)
---
kinda retarded how the information panel on the left only gets seen when you cant connect right? since you get auto-logged into the realm list you never get the chance to read it. We were just starting BRD....
---
Also it says the wrong time which is kind of retarded... try logging in and see, it says restart from 0300 to 0400 CEST. But right now its 0417 CEST...
---
Well for some people it's easier to be offended than to actually improve so they choose to be offended. There are many dpsers out there which can't play their classes properly, maybe because they leveled up in spellcleaving-exp-farm runs. Thanks and I hope someone revaluated their gameplay after this.
---
Ice only ever ran into this type of shit playing alliance. Every horde I've grouped with has been execptionally nice tot he point of passing if it's a big upgrade. You should have known.
---
You aren't going to notice a difference between those ping levels. I'd take playing with friends at 70ms over starting from scratch with no one I know at 30ms any day.
---
Really depended on where the players were from. On US servers you have the pleasure of not having to play with people from certain groups that hate people from the United States that you get on private servers. If they fuck you over their group doesn't care, and US players were in the minority.
---
This for sure. Wish all new players got this advice.
---
I know it happens, but I still don't agree with the philosophy behind it. The point is that Valve listens to reddit, so it's not crazy to expect blizzard to do the same
---
LOL
---
This is actually hilarious. Lighten up guys.
---
Yeah, they would be limited but the amount of layers in the realm.
---
Poor kid. Has to have a bad influence growing up (alliance)
---
 I honestly haven't used the AH much so I can't comment on that. Whenever I have used it though I found what I needed for a good price.
---
WOW bank: Vanilla
---
Go lvl 60 with 1/10 ratio. Guess whos better in pvp with 60.the guy that only put one attack on you with 10 others or you after ingame days of solo pvp.
---
Either you got the guts and get used to be a batshit crazy alliance pvp player that just charges and doesnt give a fuck or you quit. Im happy for every other batshit crazy m8 but i wont blame you if youre not made for it. Just please dont complain, after the big horde switch we had back then you kinda knew what youre signing up for.
---
&gt; it's a slapdash and lazy solution by a company that doesn't give a damn anymore.
---
Then go play another game lmao. No one asked you to stick around.
---
And whose responsibility is it to prevent "deliberate exploitation of a game system that isn‚Äôt working as intended"? Is it the players' responsibility, or Blizzard's? This is Blizzard's fault and banning the players is the wrong move. It's not going to prevent people from taking advantage of exploits in the future and It wont fix the damage that this exploit has already done.
---
I played classic.
---
Mages AOE farmed back then, too.
---
And yet tons of people are arguing for less moderation here...
---
My god yes. It‚Äôs terrible
---
No. Layering is the expensive option. If they remove layering the world would be packed and queue times would be astronomical.
---
Warrior leveling spec..2h fury or 2h arms?
---
blizz history is riddled with perma and more likely in this case temp bans for people using exploits and bugs if its something this big.
---
It is if loot rules were stated ahead of time. I doubt that, though. A good way to get around that is to make this clear before you enter the dungeon: group loot, no reserves.
---
There is a lot of nuance with PvP on a pvp server. Ganking a lowbie that's leveling is a dick move, even on a PvP server. Corpse camping is also a dick move too. If someone ganked me I would corpse camp them, I would rather not have someone gank me though so I could just level in peace because corpse camping is honestly a waste of both peoples time.
---
All I know is my hotbar..
---
Nah anyone knowingly abusing exploits should be punished. It's not hard to avoid
---
Love it. Was in a dungeon other day using it on low health mobs just by switching in between and it helps level it up sooo fast
---
There‚Äôs so many damn horde there atm, they keep killing me, I guess not very good atm. Hopefully during a week day it will be better.
---
yea a \`perfect game\` without any initial mistakes would be great for sure but that doesnt happen. 
---
you talk like the only reason people are ahead because they abused something, which is not true.
---
those hardcore gamers or streamers would still be WAY ahead of you by knowing a lot of details in the game efficiency strats. its what they do and they play like 15h a day. if you have a full time job, GG you WILL be way behind already.
---
So dont blame you being left behind on these stuff. and no it really doesnt effect your gameplay. let \`analcrusher69\` and his buddies pwn you in bg when its released cuz he was way ahead all the time. its ok. someone was gonna kick your ass anyway. let it be 10 more or less people who is capable of doing that anyway.
---
I hate Alliance, but I wanted a NE Druid to RP with and the multipurpose abilities of druids decided for me. However, for Horde I‚Äôm leveling three alts in increments of 10.
---
Bigglesworth ally! What what! Represent!
---
People still buy razer?
---
Well's we know what you google now...
---
I mean, they seem like garbage people, but that guild name is awesome.
---
Stop playing then lmao. Can‚Äôt understand how some of you neckbeards can be so insufferable without a hint of irony.
---
What's worse, for a single cheater to keep his ill-gained goods, or to punish that cheater and discourage whistleblowers in the future?
---
I wouldn't be so sure, but they will be like 3 day bans.
---
"slippery slope" something like that...
---
Sorry, we remove posts that don't blur out the gold-selling websites names.
---
Yes
---
Layering is needed but layering in dungeons just seems like a pitiful oversight by blizz. Also for anyone saying the game is ruined from this I doubt the economy will be f'ed. these people that exploit this will get banned.
---
I am also a priest. Thanks for the tips! I may try the sos.
---
In extreme cases a permanent ban. Shorter bans for lower level stuff. I think, don't quote me on that!
---
Blizzdrone in his natural habitat, nice.
---
I...don‚Äôt think that‚Äôd work the way you want...
---
Thank you. I figured it would but just wanted to make sure!
---
at the very least you'll want the triprunner dungarees from a gnomeregan quest. the defias chest in particular can last you a pretty long time, though. the others just replace as you find good upgrades.
---
you can make a macro, but I don't think emotes translate across faction.  
---
/e meows at you.
---
people are also using it to farm items and ah stuff like herbs
---
Meanwhile it's on the classic forums front page
---
There is an Ally character on Bloodsail named Fisherman and his guild is Fishing Trainer. I saw him in Redridge awhile back but I think he‚Äôs in his 40s now. I truly hope you run into him!!
---
Bullshit. Blizzard catches exploits when the entire playerbase has already taken advantage of them, thus making rollbacks and bans impossible.
---
Really curious, what happens if you remove layering? Is that how wow before worked?
---
There is serious discussion on here sometimes
---
As someone with over a year played time with a mage, I am so confused by the current perception that mages are completely invincible. Yeah they do big numbers, but in PVP there are a myriad of ways to outplay a mage &amp; locks are particularly good at it. Although I will always have a soft spot for mages, if I roll a caster in classic it will be a lock.
---
&gt;How do you think the majority of people that abuse these things find out about it? 
---
Definitely not Reddit
---
I don't care if they ban them, just remove their gold earnings from the exploit
---
We're in modern times, more players per server is healthy, the only reason it was capped to 5k was because of older systems not being able to support it. I don't see how having 20k is a bad thing.
---
Get with the times, grandpa. Go play a private server.
---
This is WoW Classic in Blizzard's vision, not a copy of vanilla.
---
You have ded
---
You can see the lack of sleep in his eyes
---
It's more like Eastern Kingdoms Layer 1, Eastern Kingdoms Layer 2, Kalimdor Layer 1, Kalimdor Layer 2 because afaik a continent is a type of instance (world server) just without a lockout and you load into the other continent via a ship which acts like a dungeon portal. My guess is they applied layers to the world servers which in turn also means instances not thinking that people would somehow use them for dungeon-style instances.
---
You sound like project managers I've run into who think you can do 3 weeks of work in 3 days if you just reeaaaalllly want it to get done that fast.
---
I‚Äôd guess they do absolutely nothing.
---
That IS the way world PvP is meant to happen tho.  The fear of being in a fight at any time is what makes PvP servers fun.
---
It absolutely does. Any cheating that flies under the radar of the judges is fair game in any competition.
---
I think you're kind of missing the point here...
---
Berserker rage breaks sap, atleast you can go hide as a ghost and respawn somewhat safer.
---
I've been doing the grinding spot at  Feralas  since I saw your post and I must say, thank you! I've grinded around 3.5 level there in 1 day going from 46.5 to 50 AND I have found my first BoE epic there as welll!  
---
My experience per hour is a steady 40K XP/H (Not rested) as a combat rogue with "BiS" blue lvling weapons.
---
He should, Blizzard has been alerted on their forums and done nothing. Blowing it up as publicly as possible is the fastest way to get it fixed, people stupid enough to abuse it now will still get punished
---
They don't. Every exploit is abused to hell, then leaked to the wider community, the wider community abuses it to hell thus making it impossible to justify bans, which means the exploiters get off scott free.
---
I'm having some issues with quests... See this screenshot: http://i.xomf.com/vbbgs.jpg I'm level 10, the quest is available, but there's no exclamation point? This is with all Addons turned off. When I have Questie turned on, the exclamation point is on the mini map but still not in the world where it should be.
---
Bliztards at it again.
---
Lol that's not what systematic error is dude.  You're still arguing against my points and you don't understand what it even means. Or you're just trolling now
---
Pretty nice ELI5 right there.
---
Leveling as arms with Anger Management will get you better prepared to be prot at 60 than leveling as prot.
---
30 to 40 is just brutal
---
The facials are in favor of them but you still have the opportunity to outplay most people if you get good.  I‚Äôve outplayed undead with my warlock even though they have OP anti fear. What you can‚Äôt defeat is the numbers and that just feels soo bs especially when there are griefing mobs who camp quest hubs.
---
Thunderfury has been hilarious so far
---
They hand out 6 months to one year bans for hacking. I haven't heard of a hacking ban lasting more than a year since Cataclysm.
---
Lets just hope people like this will stop soon or won't make it far in classic
---
God I wish they would institute perma-bans for all the fucking arm-chair developers who couldn't possibly know anything about how wow classic was developed but pretend to any way.
---
Shouldn't be a problem I'm currently playing with 130+ ping and haven't notified major differences. 
---
With that said, the changes I have noticed are related to interrupting enemy castings (it gets tricky) and using the scan functionality from auctioneer (takes way longer than people with pings less than 50).
---
No comparison at all, there is nothing wrong with people trying to find people that don't want the same gear they do. There is no scam.
---
bro the economy is absolutely destroyed on every open world mats and gold is streaming in from aoe farming + layer abusing causing inflation at unnatural rates already. They should not wait until phase 2 to get rid of layering it needs to happen very soon, especially on the less populated realms
---
Eh,  i wouldnt say thats the case for Rav.
---
You have to think, every single drop out of Armory is good for a warrior.  Most spam it until they have all of the drops since its also good xp.
---
Been playing almost every night and haven‚Äôt noticed layering at all.
---
Why the fuck would that have anything to do with instances at all? I didn't give a shit about layering until just now. Total incompetence.
---
What‚Äôs the difference between layering and sharding?
---
It should run quite well with the classic settings and even beyond that. Just crank things up and go from there. Turn down shadows and water quality first.
---
I think it‚Äôs best to be safe and establish loot rules before you run a dungeon. I‚Äôve literally made macros for it when we take randoms after a healer needed on tank gear at the end of a BRD run. 
---
People don‚Äôt realise this ain‚Äôt BFA man, can‚Äôt just run that place again in 10 mins. People need to be told to roll for the stuff they are currently specked for to make them aware they can gtfo with their offspec rolls. 
---
‚ÄúI need that for healing‚Äù well tough shit coz you didn‚Äôt heal did you, the fucking HEALER did!
---
Those who are dishonest and don‚Äôt abide by the loot rules will be hung, drawn and quartered in every chat available.
---
Depends on how quickly Blizzard acts to fix the exploit. If the entire community is in on the exploit, they won't do anything to anyone.
---
Same on Smolderweb. Really annoying.
---
The post on the weekends by wowhead on server pop will give you a good indication.  
---
Queue times will only get worse with removal of layers in the future.
---
Bro you barely need any skills/abilities as a hunter. Just get a good pet with abilities, then use mark, aspect of the hawk, and auto attack. I wouldn't spend a dime on things like viper sting or mongoose. But do train your pet on stamina and armour.
---
330 at lvl 60
---
I used a Naga as my primary mouse from like 2007-ish onwards, replaced it thee times. I miss it dearly but it's currently an ocean away from me.
---
If anyone is gonna be banned it should be Blizzard for putting this shit into the game in the first place, even that Dumb fuck Alexensual knew better.
---
*sigh* This is the only game company I feel like I'm constantly at war with to not fuck the game up... maybe this is my reality check that the games is not for me anymore.
---
I‚Äôm 36 and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had an issue with layering, I‚Äôm in no way saying that it doesn‚Äôt affect WoW but I‚Äôve never seen it.
---
I would go for Arms. Tactical Mastery and Anger Management are great for stance dancing if you're tanking, Rend is a strong low-level attack and Deep Wounds has good scaling.
---
That‚Äôs not an opinion man. It‚Äôs a fucking fact, preach!
---
I thought it was the rend tick that broke his MC.
---
I accidentally ninjad a ring in MC. I had no idea FFA was on and didn‚Äôt think I would be able to take it, because I am a retard. Effectively blacklisted from PUGs through word of mouth and the two guilds I did join dropped me. I assume someone had let them know. Then I stopped playing. The end.
---
Spy Classic has it!
---
What's really disgusting about all of this is that this is the origins of personal loot in Retail. 
---
People pulling these shitty stunts often enough, resulted in the entire population having a worse experience.
---
They technically have the right to be assholes like this... and you have the right to post screenshots in every forum possible so that they get their just rewards.

---
This joke is too meta for reddit
---
Obv layering has a significant effect on the game, the question is whether the trade-offs are worth it.
---
The most obvious is PVP-  anyone looking for a fight or looking to avoid one can hop layers easily.  Zone defense is pretty worthless if you don't even know which layer is being attacked without extensive intel and cooperation.  On the other hand, griefers can just swap layers randomly to avoid fights and find newbies not yet wise to their presence.  I see this happening all the time leveling, and the joined chat seems to just make it more confusing.
---
You can't really exploit this in any significant dungeon. How would you swap layers in a 40 man raid?
---
So what if feral druids can farm their one dps weapon in the game, somewhat efficiently.
---
Nice, Congrats on the kill. Now to MC!
---
Wrong, try again
---
If you're play ally, pally/druid/mage would prolly be the most versatile.  Horde, Druid/shaman/mage..  Just my opinion.
---
And what was the point of the comment I had replied to?
---
yet sound and come off as a kid. hmm. Yeah sit down kid.
---
Ok... and ?
---
it's not 7%.  It may be intended to be, but it has been changed.  Been here all day.  I'm getting the same input from other players.  It is closer to 1 or 2 % I am guessing.
---
That's a 50 dkp minus because you didn't know what the fuck to do
---
love the choice of background music.  
---
Ocean theme for Wind Waker is amzing
---
This is pure evil.  What server are these hideous losers on so I can blacklist them?
---
It's because layering is tied to the continent server, and dungeons are tied to the same continent server.
---
I'm hoping they can get rid of layering soon, but its not incompetence. They knew this would happen but felt it was a worth while trade off, otherwise leveling zones would be unplayable.
---
Sorry but that rogue sucks. It's not a comment on skill,  it's just how balancing was back in vanilla.
---
There's an exploit to respawn bosses in instances.  OP used it to farm rare items and profit off it.  OP will likely be permabanned for it.
---
Because it died there.
---
this gives me the same feeling as when I saw a working map hack in Starcraft 1. 
---
The players that abused this are now at a massive advantage to players that didn't and in the case of gold gains can have lasting effects far into future expansions.
---
Damn that's harsh for just taking a stack. I did that with a ton of cloth for tailoring during wrath and got shit on relentlessly for weeks. Didn't get loot until it was all replaced.
---
/r/ExpectedThanos
---
The sad part is you're probably serious
---
What's my opinion then?
---
Basically think of a server as an onion, and each layer of the onion has people in it, the people are randomly put into a layer on login and can swap if they group with other people but otherwise can't interact
---

&gt;So if you have this three-hour-long gameplay session on the first night, that priest that you ran into in Northshire Abbey,when you were level three, it's quite likely you're going to run into them an hour later as you're trying to get candles back from Kobolds, and maybe a couple of hours later in Westfall if both of you haven't logged off.

&gt;Because you were all in the same world as each other, you're never going to experience walking across the zone boundary and seeing people around you vanish or seeing spawns move around. Indeed, the only way to switch layers is to accept a party invite from somebody else who's on different layer. And once you move, that's your new layer and you're going to stay there for the rest of your gameplay session.
---
&gt;It's the entirety of Azeroth. So it's not three Westfalls and two Elwynns, it's three Azeroths, four Azeroths.
---
Pservers didnt get a sub they relied on donations so they had to protect the integrity and reputation. People could also leave and go elsewhere if the community turned against them. Pserver admins were very ban-happy.
---
There's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm sure you'll get the usual shitbag responses but the reality is that everyone has to decide if they have enough fun to continue. If you're not having fun then it's stupid to keep playing because other people tell you it's fun. 
---
That said though, I've definitely noticed (not on my server thankfully) that some of the fears of the community becoming more and more toxic thanks to years of private server theory crafting and figuring out the "best" everything are coming true.
---
And that's sad because community was one of the major selling points for Classic but the community is a lot worse since everything has been "solved".
---
Dude, it worked! Thanks a lot for the help!
---
It's the best of both worlds really, I prefer tanking but know I'll rarely get in a raid for that purpose. So if you wanna roll pally you gotta sacrifice your want to tank when it comes to raiding. But like I said the judgement set has good enough stats to tank a dungeon and you won't have to respec or regear every time you want to do something
---
The trade off on the dps loss is the utility, tank dies maybe pally can pick up the boss and tank it and save the group, healer dies maybe pally can throw some heals and save it etc etc. Not to mention the buffs. People seem to over look this utility though and just look at raw damaged for a dps these days.
---
i dunno, the weakaura nerds in our guild set it up.

I got tigerstrike mantle for my hunter from a chest in Hillsbrad, they often full of crap but it is still money at least with a chance for greens or better. What they did sucks but chests can have good stuff.
---
I don't why pallied would hearth. It's a funny meme yju are better of dying and running back than hearthing
---
I blew that fucker sky high and didn't look back.
---
Why was FFA on anyway?
---
Alliance or Horde. Horde has some race abilities that are superior for PvP. Alliance is 'prettier'. Elves, dwarves Gnomes, Humans with beautiful cities. 
---
Horde cities are also incredible but with a different theme.
---
It comes down to what you like best. You level very quickly to level 5. Pick a character on each side of. Two different servers and LVL to 5. 
---
Pick the side you appeals to you. If you want to become really active in PvP and want that small edge: Horde
---
For classes: play what you like..all classic archetypes are there. Note that warrior is the toughest character to solo level.
---
Well warrior can take the tanking part, and in a leveling group of two warriors are beasts with a healer. So i think in terms of efficiency those two might be good. As a third, maybe a dps that doesn't compete with the other armor classes. Imo movement speed is also important. It's pretty frustrating having for example ghost wolf, but you can't use it because you level with a priest who has no speed up available.
---
Deviate Delight hype!!!
---
I‚Äôm on a PvP server and have been for 14 years. My code while leveling and even end game has always been to not start anything unless I‚Äôm provoked.  I never kill lower level players in their respective zones. I also will kill the provoking offender once and let them be on their way, but if they try and attack me again, I will camp them.  
---
Some exceptions:
---
If I happen upon some PvP I‚Äôll help out my faction brothers/sisters even if I‚Äôm not sure who started it. 
---
If I‚Äôm waiting for a spawn to complete a quest and killing the opposing player(s) would ensure they don‚Äôt tag it, I will kill them.
---
HEY PAUL!!!
---
Merging servers would come with its own set of problems that people would complain about. Layering isn't inherently a bad thing, they just screwed up the implementation.
---
True facts.
---
I love when I burn through the initial fear ward during death coil and just fear them again
---
Doo doo doo doo! Doo doo doo doo!
---
Pet has several meanings, from noun to verb.
---
If you hit 60 without making friends to group with you missed the point of classic and should just go back to the antisocial bfa world.
---
Cherish that. My son is going to be turning 1 y.o. soon and I miss having him sleep on me. It goes by so fast you wouldn‚Äôt believe.
---
Well TOS outlines deliberate exploits as bannable offenses. If you look at the logs and see certain players hopping layers a lot and killing the same bosses over and over that is deliberate abuse of an exploit. If a player layer-hops mid dungeon and gets one extra drop because of it then it would be unlikely they would be banned.
---
Obviously they need to address this. Bans and rollbacks are simply a deterrent to people from doing this now that the information is widespread while blizzard get on top of it .
---
True man but this still does not change the unfortunate fact that people are abusing it for in-game/irl monetary gain.
---
That‚Äôd be incredible, good luck :)
---
Definitely punish him and explain that he was punished for repeatedly abusing an exploit instead of reporting it and moving on. He abused an exploit and got so rich that he realized there was no point to the game anymore and got bored. Only then did he decide to blow the whistle. He had a chance at doing the right thing, but instead chose to cheat, over and over and over and over again. That is where my criticism comes from. We shouldn‚Äôt be happy with anyone who exploits the game to this extent before reporting it.
---
Look at all the other totem quests. They all involve summoning and killing elementals. Obviously shaman quest.
---
Yeah I'm honestly surprised this wasn't found in the beta. Shame
---
Would love to see them make a really sweet world PvP zone with all sorts of objectives and such. Mount Hyjal would be a good choice for it and players could fight over the summit or something.
---
Layering has been such a strain on an otherwise fantastic launch. And so many of its effects could have easily been fixed before launch. They just didn't test it well enough.
---
It's similar technology but a layer is an entire copy of Azeroth used to divide population so there is enough room in the world for everyone to play. Sharding is where players from separate servers but in the same place in the game are pulled together so there are more toons around to interact with. 
---
If a layer is capped at around 3000 players and there are six full layers on your server right now that means that if they were to turn off layering there would be 3000 players on your server with 15,000 people in the queue. They are planning on turning off layering ASAP. They say they can't start Phase 2 of Classic with layers because that's when the first world bosses come out the players would exploit the layers to kill extra just like they are cheesing these dungeons.
---
Nothing was on reserve until the jerk decided right at the last and only boss.
---
Yeah. This is why there's personal loot in retail now. Because of scumfucks like that guy.
---
I didn‚Äôt turn in the first one in order to not screw my group, thinking it would start it.  Did the escort and didn‚Äôt get the quest:(
---
Lol yup exactly this. I see underleveled DPS do this all the time. Can‚Äôt wait until theyre eventually oom and wipe I last boss. No thanks.
---
Reading all you pussies whining about PvP on a PvP server makes me rock solid.
---
Yeah...i mean if there really are people that made ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of gold‚Äù then delete those characters...but anyone else who did MC or other upper end raid more than they should, just delete their loot and maybe a gold penalty.
---
The problem is that by Vanilla 1.12, and by doing BWL/AQ/Naxx phases, we've already gone down that path.
---
By the time you hit level 60, there's very little incentive to ever go in 90% of zones again. You mostly just travel through them to get to an instance portal. You might trudge through them to level up a new profession ignoring 99% of the mobs and players if you really want to.  
---
By the time BWL and honor gear and bg gear is out, the 60 dungeons are basically pointless. Hell, by the time ZG and AQ20 is out *MC* is mostly pointless. You can run it for ToEP, Perdition's Blade and Bindings if you want, but 90% of drops in their are already obsolete by then just from solo honour farm and pug 20 mans and boe gear.   
---
So yeah, I like the idea of this huge world full of character building and exploration and quests and mysteries, and that was definitely the intent of Vanilla when it was being built, but they simply ran out of time - and it didn't get fleshed out enough. Then it released, and they finished some of the stuff they were working on like searing gorge/hinterlands, but after 2-3 months it became obvious people were primarily driven by levelling up, and huge amounts of people were levelling up, and were getting level 60, and were doing everything at 60 - and those people wanted more stuff to do. At that stage it makes no sense at all to spend significant resources on the people levelling, because those people already have tons of incentive to get to 60. You can make content for 50% of the people by making levelling content, or you can make content for 100% of the people by adding additional stuff to do after everything already in. So it's not hard at all to see why they did what they did.  
---
Putting a cap on it and saying "you beat the game" (with Naxx) is satisfying in a neat way I'll give you. But that way ends up with inevitable slow decline in playerbase, there's just no way it can compete with the hype of adding new, bigger, better content for everyone to work through. I don't think Blizzard is ok with that.
---
golden will go to 20g+ very soon
---
Thanks for the reply. Good information, and informative advice haven‚Äôt went this route before.
---
That must have felt so good on your part :D
---
Sad low life of a player, to even scam a guildmate. Heck, to even think about scamming at all.
---
layering ftw
---
I would suggest choosing one class of cloth, leather, and chain. So priest/warlock/mage, rogue/druid/hunter/shaman, and warrior/paladin.
---
Personally I would like to try a group of all shamans. I think it would be fun to have a shaman healer, tank, and DPS.
---

Can we have a fresh server after all this is fixed &amp; sub time refunded for all the bugs, server down time and queue times?
---
Players dude.. if it‚Äôs considered a bug or exploit then yes you can and should be banned. It‚Äôs in the TOS. Every player agrees to it to play the game. Especially if it‚Äôs a known abuse and you are intentionally exploiting.
---
They banned a guild for exploiting in a wotlk kill even though they didn't do it on purpose (albeit only 1 day bans i believe)
---
Reddit mods deleted it
---
Id even guess with established loot rules, not against TOS.
---
"I RP as a dirt bag ninja"

::picturing the physical arm twisting Blizzard used on the poor customers that decided, in the face of many warnings, to pile on to a popular server::
---
Just curios, what is your dpi? It looks like you have a solid 6 inches of room there with your mouse taking up 4 xD
---
Where in plaguelands? Hearthglen definitely doesn't have enough spawns for 100g/hour
---
And lower queue times. Everyone wins
---
My pleasure. Stay safe
---
&gt;We expect these free character moves 808 to remain open until 11:00 a.m. PDT (2:00 p.m. EDT) on Monday, September 16.
---
No lowbies, no ambushes when they are on 50% hp and fighting a mob.
---
Not necessarily. Could be struggles with posted raid times too. (speaking from experience)
---
I never felt anger at any moment of your pointless messages.
---
You are truly pathetic and I am done responding.
---
On the subject of macros, is there a way to make a macro to:
---
-pickpocket current target
---
-switch target
---
-attempt to pickpocket next target
---
-repeat this a few times
---
-go back to first one and use opener
---
This would be great for those dungeon pulls where you can pickpocket 3/4 targets
---
Supposedly &lt;Apes&gt; has used this to farm several Ironfoes and Felstrikers.
---
yeah, it's awesome.    
---
If someone is an ass to me, I just whisper them "rude".   
---
More often than not, the will apologize shortly after.    
---
It amazes me how many people only behave themselves when there are consequences for bad behaviour.
---
‚ÄúGuy wins duel‚Äù
---
Ohhhh I see now
---
Mage, Warrior, Priest would be a good combo. You will always have a healer and tank so just need to find dps for groups which will be easy. Also Mage can keep group supplied with food and portals to get around.
---
The queue times would be worth it, if they would die down a bit, but they aren't, still had a 3 hour queue time to get online tn, to only be able to play for maybe an hour.
---
yeah, maybe something more severe for anyone who does it in a raid? I don't know but I wouldn't imagine them throwing out perma bans or anything serious.
---
/e turns into "x makes strange gestures" to the enemy faction IIRC.
---
Just don‚Äôt take a dps that can use the item you want sheesh.
---
Awwww. Can they see default ones like /spit?
---
For greens usually around twice the vendor price.
---
 Horde has the kind of people who make these dumbshit posts though, so be aware. You will be on a faction with people that say retarded things like this guy.
---
Who brought the cool kid?
---
Ok. #onechange
---
Your experience really has nothing to do with heals v shadow.  Most guides don‚Äôt consider shadow viable until lvl 36 when you can actually get shadowform and a decent build.  The difference at these low levels is also negligible for damage, as the only real difference is a slightly longer sw:p, maybe the stun, and a shorter mb cd, which won‚Äôt do much at lvl 30.  You need to use your kit and work with the mage in pvp.  You have a 500dmg shield, keep it up at all times on you and him.  Dot enemies and when they are close and your shield is down, fear them off of you.  Leverage the mages poly and nova to cc enemies.  Just because you are a healer doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt apply dots and use mind blast.
---
Imagine people making up false assumption to fit their agenda.
---
Yeah I usually prefer to solo level. I like running dungeons with friends and farming mobs with friends. But when I‚Äôm grinding I just like to focus on me and only group when I need the help. That‚Äôs kinda why I prefer pve servers, it‚Äôs better suited to my play style. But end game I wanna play with my friends.
---
Battlegrounds will come. You don‚Äôt have to give up on your 38 rogue. If you want consistent world PvP, yes, a PvP server will make that better
---
Proof?
---
So why fix the exploit then? If it's the players' responsibility to prevent exploitation of a broken game system, then I suppose Blizzard is absolved of all responsibility to fix the exploit. Maybe we should just ask people nicely to not take advantage of exploits. I'm sure that will work. I can tell you banning people isn't going to stop shit.
---
I've been enjoying the cobbled together thing for several years now and somehow a bunch of fragmented amateur outlaw teams managed to cobble it together better than Blizzard. It's pathetic.
---
Ya not how it works but nice glitch
---
I mean there's a reason PvP is far more popular than PvE for Classic. If you love PvP yeah i dunno what you're doing.
---
Are they rly as op as ppl claim?
---
Na it's just creating a server economy that is larger than vanilla.
---
Stop posting this crap on the sub, please.
---
Class discords have a lot of discussion of this type
---
Nobody was overgeared in our group. We were running the dungeon to get gear lol
---
It‚Äôs rule of thumb in classic. If you wanna heal then spec healer and heal dungeons, period. 
---
Wanna spend 2-3 hours in a dungeon as a healer then have a dps need on your trinket? Would you be ok with that? :)
---
Blizz has banned/removed gear from players who knowingly abuse raid exploits for years.
---
Absolutely. Especially as a rogue. What you‚Äôre describing is permanently driving a race car in downtown Chicago traffic. It sounds like literal cancer, especially for the one class that truly flourishes in world PvP.
---
I'd need to see some proof of this first to believe it though. Everyone on classic seems to have it out for APES.
---
Source?
---
I used to just /wave and move on, never instigating, but then I got ganked by a ?? While doing the escort quest in Deso with a really long respawn timer. Now I attack every single player, regardless of level. I‚Äôll especially attack when they pull a mob or get in over their head
---
Is that the ever-so-popular decoy keyboard I have been hearing about?
---
How come people are surprised? Issues like this were brought up hundreds of times before release.
---
I know right?
---
I think it's just a spiritual successor to suf. Loved that addon back in MoP.
---
Pretty sure Ravager isn't supposed to proc off of itself. But the single intern they have programming this is a bit busy at the moment with all the layering exploits he created
---
If you get him to help around the house, you both get more time to play! (Assuming you live together)
---
It may not be bags, but I've been giving out potions like crazy from leveling alch.
---
Blizz just needs to do what they always do to people abusing raid exploits. Temp ban and removal of the gear and gold acquired. Then patch it so it can‚Äôt be done anymore.
---
I had a shammy recruit me as a warrior tank to his RFK run, then told me he was reserving Corpsemaker. I politely bowed out and he launched a /w tirade on me for wanting to roll for on OS piece. Some people just expect everything for themselves.
---
Love the picture
---
&gt; negligible effect on the game

Mate
---
It's not the origin, but it was adopted because of the origin (something about korean players in starcraft I think).
---
I use it for devilsaur leather all the time tbh
---
Mobs in instances hit harder and gave less xp on private servers
---
Who is bein a dick? Just normal PvP here.
---
It is run by incompetence and the lowest cost people they can find.
---
How? Some of that gold has already been traded to other people to buy auctions, craft items, provide enchantments, buy mounts etc. Do you ban someone that sold them an item or provided them a service? How would they have known the gold was illegitimate? And yet it is in the economy and not going away.
---
Other people managed to understand. I'm sorry you took it another way without reading the rest of the thread
---
DPI is 1200 :D
---
So you're saying screw the economy then if everyone does it its fine? I wouldnt consider it minor.
---
I‚Äôm 42 and have 20g
---
The race car analogy really is spot on. Well done.
---
There's this really weird sense of authority a party leader ends up getting. Just because you've got the little crown on your portrait because you started the group doesn't mean you're a raid leader that gets to set loot rules.
---
Mankirk beat his own wife. He fooled you all
---
Sorry should stick with crappy memes I guess
---
This happened to me when I was just starting out and it‚Äôs such a nice feeling.
---
&gt; You little people
---
Lol jfc you're a meme
---
Go back to retail
---
By that time, the servers will be ruined and not worth playing on.
---
Post it everywhere. Name and shame.
---
Tbh it does work, I completed like 2-3 quests a few days ago with a controller due to being too lazy to get out of bed.
---
Still a stupid idea though.
---
Lmao I thought it was gays willburn and was a legitimate name until I read the comments. Whoops.
---
Still, you can give new content that gives small upgrade, just a little bit. People will still want to work through it and it gives them a goal without rendering everything before it irrelevant like they do in retail where item levels start jumping up like crazy. 
---
The idea of upgrading the lower tier sets is an idea I like too. Make it so you have to raid the newest tier and gradually gather a bunch of stuff to upgrade a piece or something, then you will be making the decision which set bonuses you want and focus on upgrading them. 
---
As long as they balance it properly, they don't make old content irrelevant. Back in Vanilla and TBC you still had to work through from the first tier in border to gear up for the next. By the time you've spent a few months running the raid you are probably sick of it anyway, you don't need to keep people running raids perpetually. 
---
The key is no silly catch up mechanics that let people just bypass gearing up from previous tiers. 
---
As someone who started in TBC on a new server, hence everybody starting from level 1 instead of 60, raid groups were slower to get going. We literally never ran out of new content. Every time we killed a new boss there was a brand new boss we'd never fought to go after, for the whole expansion, well over a year of raiding. Compare that to retail WoW where you could join the expansion a year late, abuse the catch up mechanic, join a guild and clear every single raid on normal mode and see everything in one week, its completely night and day the difference there.
---
Its god teir for the AoE dungeon meta tho
---
I think we all want to see some heavy bans with no second chances here, but something tells me it'll be something dumb and soft.
---
On private servers dungeon mobs hit harder and gave less xp. Nobody did the "2h cleave no tank" or "all casters no tank" groups because you would simply die.
---
Beat me to it :(
---
I find it to be so.  Never had one much before, but I basically use it for all finance related stuff.  I mail everything that isnt my questing stuff (food, bandages, pots, etc.)  
---
My bank actually has most of my gold.
---
Commenting to see the macro.
---
Main points:
---
* Blizzard have developed a fix for the issue, and are in the process of deploying it worldwide.
---
* Realm Restarts at 3 a.m. PDT to apply fix
---
* Identifying those who knowingly abused this bug and taking 'appropriate punitive measures' (Likely bans and rollbacks)
---
I went to a industry talk with Blizzard devs who talked about large data collection, so really can't give a source other than it's what I remember hearing.
---
I think after talking to them personally, you really learn a lot more about what they're doing and not treat them as some incompetent idiots who sit around all day actively trying to ruin the game.
---
how can you use weak auras to track pally buffs on the raid? i only figured out how to track it on myself.
---
What addon  are you using  for your map? Mate
---
Man this means you could fucking EASILY do the 46 to 52 mara grind on a mage like it was fuckin nothing WHOOPS
---
I just turned in rend's head to Thrall and didn't get the Warchief's Blessing buff.
---
Is this disabled? bugged? working as intended?
---
Just buy the first rank rez
---
Well... I'm pretty sure it's because of WoW. The devs did get it from StarCraft Koreans, but I don't think that the actual general popularity of kek has anything to do with its original source. I believe it filtered out into the general population from WoW.
---
1 day ban is better known as a suspension. This thread is talking about actual account bans.
---
gb2retail
---
Well I didn't know that I was supposed to ask. I had gotten to Raider rank at that point and never really learned the rules about the tabs. No one knew that, and I was like 15 at the time so I was a little baby and afraid to say anything. 
---
Either way I took enough cloth to level 2 toons to max tailoring, so in hindsight I get it.
---
The MC broke while he was holding a movement key.  Fear has nothing to do with it, it just prevented him from actually controlling the warrior.
---
ArchAge isn't 15 year old game in the first place, and has much less cultural impact then WoW (and it had cash shop IIRC). CoD MWR was a good game on release, but was spoiled with MTXs and lootbox weapons (although it was not so bad as in BO3 and BO4, because the game mechanics are different). If the new MW will be a good game without heavy MTXs that is so impactful on the gameplay that you need to spend money to get best weapons, it could be another cause of making something fans would appreciate. But I doubt it a lot.
---
Meh, still better than crazy russian bootlegs.
---
Banhammer inc
---
Your opinion, but I don‚Äôt agree with people needing for offspec when people need items for mainspec. Fuck your offspec when I‚Äôve just spent 3 hours of my actual time in a dungeon.
---
ban this sick filth
---
Every time people get to exploit tradable a for a while, it affects the economy. The effects of this exploit will be seen in the long-term, for sure. Those that are behind the curve and didn‚Äôt participate in this will have to farm a lot more gold than what they originally expected.
---
Imagine you‚Äôre a. DPS that didn‚Äôt exploit this  competing for loot versus a DPS that exploited this and no has their pre-BoS + BoE epics. If your guild uses loot council, you‚Äôre SO fucked up...
---
I believe it‚Äôs called ‚ÄòLeatrix Maps‚Äô or something similar.
---
&gt;Guy in general last night in STV who said that there was alot of horde on tonight, just an observation, he didn't even criticize the game, 3 people replied straight away.
---
&gt;Go back to retail if you don't like it
---
Is this your first time playing an online game? Have you never experienced global chat channels before? If you don't enjoy listening to the bleating of a chorus of morons and aspiring stand-up comics I suggest learning where your mute channel options are.
---
Razor*, and yes obviously they do
---
The actual fuck? I would have given you a medal for clearing up guild bank space for flasks.
---
Do bags have a level requirment. I mean can a lvl 1 equip runecloth bags?
---
I'd have loved Tauren Warlock, personally. HP master race.
---
They have analytics tracking mob kills against players, player kills against mobs, pet kills against both of those, items destroyed, etc.
---
They track virtually every stat of every player and have for years. I am confident they're tracking this
---
And now we have upgrade-bind on items to prevent this
---
That's not the definition of systematic error...systematic error is relatively  consistent from test to test.
---
Scan to scan variation error like those is absolutely not systematic. You 100% don't understand.
---
Please don't argue about stuff you don't understand at all.
---
Done here.
---
Honestly didn't know it meant open world at the time haha. All my other mmos had designated areas for it.
---
Well statistically Skeram is about 65% horde 35% alliance so your personal experience really doesn't matter at all.
---
Is this Trailer Park Boys? That looks like Julian...
---
You also can't say anything even slightly negative about a pvp experience without a flock of monogloids telling you to roll a pve server instead. I'm not the one doing it, but my ignore list grows longer each day
---
Definitely new gen at 26.
---
Signed,
---
An other dusty, old fart.
---
*bleating of a chorus of morons and aspiring stand-up comics* 
---
Bahahahahahahahaha 
---
I laughed *way* too hard at this.
---
Someone who's bored
---
Nobody *important* gets banned; major streamers are advertisements for the game.
---
Did he expect anything different?
---
VW is not the best for solo. You ever heard of drain tanking?
---
I generally do not PvP. I play survival games on PvE servers for example however in this game I have always played PvP. Forget the BGs, the world PvP is amazing. There will be grand scale battles across the map including invading opposite faction cities and when things are quiet hang out at a popular path to a level 60 dungeon such as searing gorge to black rock and you will have a steady stream of opponents. 
---
As someone who is not that fussed on PvP, I would never play on a PvE server in this game. You are missing a lot of PvP goodness.
---
Yep. Anytime I‚Äôm doing a kill quest I inv everyone I see doing it.
---
Yes they are. Each layer has a fixed capacity. If they remove a layer then the server capacity goes down.
---
If it's left in the game it creates an economy that needs you to using layering exploits to keep up as well, if it goes away it creates an economy where some people who had a head start can now completely control the AH for their chosen items....
---
okay yeah, that's a bit excessive lol.
---
I mean, at the end of the day, this is on the players. This isn't something you stumble ass-backwards into. This is overt exploitation of an obvious loophole. If Blizzard has a spine, it should result in a cascade of outright bans.
---
I get that layering was an ugly, exploitable solution to a sticky problem, but it was probably the most expedient way forward to a somewhat playable "Classic" experience. If people want to break the toy they're given to play with, that's on them.
---
I've been playing an undead character on Faerlina, but the starting areas have been fairly empty. This may just be due to layering, but I still want to see a good spread of players to talk and play with through the game.
---
Why should they tell anyone what the plan is? They've already said it's not a huge problem but they're still working on a way to fix it. what more information do you need?
---
Barrens chat is great until idiots start arguing over Trump
---
If you're purely mix/maxing, then yeah, warriors are better than rogues hands down for raids assuming everyone is geared up to max.
---
But Idk, that seems a crappy way to pick your class. There are a lot of other factors that make rogues (or warriors) a better pick for each individual.
---
Nobody is going to exclude a rogue from a raid because there is a warrior available instead, it's more down to other factors 99% of the time.
---
&gt; Facebook is a massive ad company, no shit they track everyone
---
That much *should* be obvious, but most people are ignorant.
---
I think the main thing /u/Existential_Owl was saying to be wary of is the "dark profiles" or whatever they have on people who've never had a Facebook account in their lifes, or from people who deleted their profile and haven't signed in for years.
---
Didn‚Äôt they say layering will be gone in soon? Phase 2, I‚Äôm guessing?
---
Systematic errors are caused by imprecise calibrated equipment. All those factors are due to the limitations of your equipment and the way that equipment is calibrated. Therefore, they're all partially systematic in nature, but also random due to their variance. Either way, no matter what analysis techniques you apply they can't be corrected for. I think you're the one who's talking about something you don't understand here.

4 days late but I'm a new player. Played retail briefly and then swapped to Classic. In retail the initial 1-20 racial area was great. Simple but threaded story, lots to do, clear direction of what you're supposed to do. As soon as I finished that and went to Org for the first time I was totally lost. No idea where to go, no clue what to do next, areas became disjointed (I ran into Sylvanas in 3 different places and she was a different rank in each), and quests didn't feel like I was working towards anything, it was just a random person asking me to do him a favor. There were menus and recommended gameplay paths which were convenient but felt weird to use, like the game should have a natural flow instead of just popping up a menu recommending me to do some quest next. 
---
Classic everything was harder at first. No quest indicators, abilities are much more complex, just tagging a mob doesn't give you kill credit. But the world feels much more immersive and it flows together. Quests move you around the world and you pick up more quests from each town and city. Your role in the world is clear and dungeons occur naturally. It's a LOT hard for sure but honestly as a new player its been easier for me to get into. Retail stats and gear and whatever else were intimidating and I didn't understand them but it didn't matter because the game just kind of gave you what you wanted. Classic that doesn't happen but because you need to know what they do you just figure it out naturally from playing. Another thing is the groups, in Retail you can do everything yourself which is nice sometimes but also means you don't get anyone to figure the game out with or to guide you as you go.

&gt;"I only did that quest as horde"

:thonking:
---
Have some self respect, you can be bored without sounding like a kid who's waiting on his balls to drop.
---
It's a moot point, nip it in the bud if it is even beginning to become a problem and it ripples downstream and evaporates. The point is it's not a problem. We know this 1) because we play the game and 2) because Blizzard only makes money from people playing the game. They're not going to bury their head in the sand about something that could drive people away from the only thing that makes them money in what advertising has likely turned into a very expensive gamble. 
---
Despite your claims otherwise Blizzard has a *heavy* motivation to make sure people don't leave classic. And a balanced in game economy is a significant part of that.
---
How am I just now learning that /em works like /e and /me.
---
afaik blizz terminology has always been ban and permaban
---
I expect to see the tears flowing soon.
---
Iirc one is a mound of dirt and can be found near the tree  close to the path leading to the quest giver (on the left)
---
Well, thats silly but thanks for actually confirming it and not just calling me an idiot
---
Sulfuras. Dead-even, mid during off hours and 0-60 min queue at peak. Friendly people on both sides through my experience so far. Very active pvp.
---
How did you not notice him in the same guild lol
---
Layering means it's been pretty unlikely to actually run into the people I have on my KOS list.
---
But man those people are going to be surprised when they get an Aimed Shot up the ass out of nowhere a couple years from now.
---
And call it "the horde"
---
Remember kids, if you message the other faction on discord to kill people, its collusion and banworthy, but if you make it into a post on reddit instead, it's fucking fantastic
---
Yes of course that‚Äôs absolutely fine
---
From the data wowhead has faerlina is the most balanced. With a 52-48 split slightly favoring Alliance. Herod is almost as full as Faerlina but has a higher Horde representation. Questing is hard to come by on both servers. But dungeon groups and AH prices are more favorable.
---
Herod
---
Tampa Bay?
---
Oh for sure it was, I was a shithead. My raidlead at the time told me that I should stack haste as a fire mage and I just ran with that for 2 weeks, we had class together and he didnt let me live that down til cata. 
---
I've learned a lot through my stupidity. I'm like our raids idiot savant :D
---
My guild chat:
---
"Invite to layer please"
---
"Layer pls"
---
"Can someone layer ya boi"
---
"Invite to layer"
---
and so on
---
You can't "farm" a world drop. They're literally something like 0.001% drop chance off of any mob within a certain level range.
---
oh yes me too
---
The people in your general chat aren't being protective of classic. They're throwing out "go back to retail" because they know it's a meme and they know it's annoying. The same reason we get endless revisions of "Actually Deadmines is called VC" or "Girls Don't Play WoW" or "Did someone say Thunderfury" or any of a million other achingly hilarious thrashings of long dead horses.
---
Absolutely there are people who are ridiculously defensive about/protective towards Classic, but good luck to any of them getting their feelings expressed in the ceaseless tumult that are the global chat channels. You're just getting trolled, mate. After 20 years of playing online games, you should be well familiar with the sensation.
---
Questing is the fastest way to level (outside of mage AoEing), but I really would just alternate between questing/dungeons/grinding based on your mood.
---
The vast majority of people (even those who level pretty quick) need to have fun along the way and will risk burning themselves out if they grind any of those ways too much.
---
What addons are you using?
---
Right? They had it coming
---
 My guild xfer‚Äôd to EF. I like it so far. 6k Queue to get into Herod today and I am glad I never have to worry about Q or timing my day around remote logging in and such. 
---
A couple combined horde guilds are currently doing MC. AH is getting more lively. Day 1 xfers are noticing a huge difference in population already!
---
Are you leveling professions as well?
---
Are you optimizing instance runs with quests?
---
Are you mob grinding on top of questing?
---
When you log off, do you log off in an Inn every time?
---
Answer those and I'll think of other stuff.
---
B L A C K L I S T E D
---
server merging is bad
---
queues and overpopulated server is bad
---
layering is bad
---
layering could have been an ok solution if it was tested and heavily restricted to the overpopulated zone (requires defining shards rather than layering the whole server) - they took lazyman's approach, they didn't test it enough. the game is broken as a result.
---
i've been struggling a lot in pvp 1v1s as druid. not sure if i'm under geared, using the wrong spells/forms, or just missing the talent points i need to survive still.
---
i feel like i lose 1v1s to every class within about 3 levels either direction
---
Honestly at this point it seems like it's a you issue. 
---
On my adventures to 60 i've networked and connected with so many players, learned people by name, and have a filled friends list with notes.
---
Lol imagine playing alliance instead of horde in 2019
---
Wait a minute, that streamer contacted blizz and asked if it was okay to clear it again and they gave him the okay? They gave the whole raid the okay? That kind of scares me and makes me worried that they will do nothing about everyone abusing the fuck out of this.
---
Rattlegore is perfect high pop at peak times and no queue
---
The game is from 2004...
---
Can we not become heros.  Can we just be solid members of the alliance or horde who are rewarded in our adventures by what slim pickings we find for our 40man armies.
---
Being the hero, god, savior of Azeroth is one of the worst things that happened to the game.
---
What I want from Classic+ is to have defeated KT and then the world goes hah you think you're the shit but you're just plain shit here's a bunch of stuff way out of your reach that you have to work hard for and team up for and you'll maybe get rewarded for it.
---
Which streamers were doing it so we can see if their accounts go bye bye, which they should.
---
Well all the comments seem overly convincing. Time to get that PvP goodness
---
my response to people who defend red=dead:    
---
"You're not wrong, you're just an asshole"
---
Well then you're talking about something completely different because this post is about Dungeon exploiting and not layering abuse in general
---

You can just drown and take rez sick faster tbh

Blizzard have already ensured that will never happen anyway tbh

and more organized, I have been using it for the longest I can remember. One of the first addons I grabbed (when it was available) for classic.
---
I got a Logitech G600, has 12 buttons on the side and a 3rd button for my ring finger to act as a modifier key. Took me a while to set up but I love it.
---
 200
---
I don't follow.
---
I need this now.

If it has a screen it will run classic
---
You're slower than them because you're taking your time and enjoying the game, while they're missing out on huge chunks of the game because they rushed straight to 60.  Don't worry about them.  Relax and enjoy yourself.
---
Just do you, dude.
---
I‚Äôm a meme
---
I get people literally lining up for me at Goldshire when I do it.
---
Truthfully no idea, and I'm not claiming to be a programmer or all that knowledged about this stuff. I just think people VASTLY underestimate how much information Blizzard collects through their games.
---
I hope there are finally repercussions for people trying their hardest to cheat the game.
---
What are these people even doing in Classic?
---
And people were attacking me for Layering is going to ruin the economy post.. &gt;.&gt;
---
It's ridiculous how upset people get over gear that isn't end game. It must suck being an enchanter because there's no disenchant option.
---
Lol rattlegore like 10 mins ago? I was there!
---
It was such an obvious, indefensible exploit...and so completely antithetical to the whole "Spirit of Classic" that people kept bloviating about for years...that I have trouble dredging up much sympathy for anyone who loses an account over this. There's not a person who did this who didn't know they were exploiting, and the rules regarding exploits have been there clear as day since the beginning.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Last night in Tanaris I was questing with a friend killing pirates in Smugglers cove. 
---
There was a large group of horde just farming the middle campground and wrecking all the alliance that came near it. 
---
Slowly, all the alliance sat around on the outskirts of the area picking off what they could but it was slow going.  After realizing we were all in the same boat, we formed a small raid and drove them all out and turned the tables. 
---
This went on back and forth for about an hour, I added some great players to my friends list, and now have some horde players on my hit list going forward. 
---
For me this is what makes classic great.  It‚Äôs not later invites or begging for mages so you can spam a dungeon.  It‚Äôs interacting with other players and coming together to accomplish a goal that also falls firmly within the spirit of the game and storyline.
---
I win almost every 1v1 in WPVP as a paladin and have 1v2‚Äôed people many times. Paladins take a lot of damage, hit hard and can dish some crazy burst damage, can heal, bubble, lay on hands, etc.
---
Not really sure what you‚Äôre talking about. The whole ‚Äúpally sucks‚Äù thing is such a tired meme. It‚Äôs based off of ret pallies not being great at DPS in end game raids. Not World PVP or when leveling. A paladin can definitely top a damage meter in a 5 man dungeon before level 50.
---
Night elf warlock is crisp.
---
This is the market that layering will affect the most. Devilsaurs and other open world 'rares' are VASTLY inflated.
---
Not only that, but it's just so simple for people to 'switch layer' that almost everyone who is farming right now is using layering as another tool to increase their gold/hour, cant blame em.
---
They can't stop you from rolling on it.
---
Does anyone know what addon shroud is using to keep track of his totems?
---
ogre*
---
Juicy drama incoming
---
Hopefully they find a way to completely remove the economic impact from these exploits as well. 
---
Everyone who has exploited should get what's coming to them 100%.
---
It also explains why you might be trying to meet someone for a trade at the Stormwind Bank steps but cannot see them until you invite them to a group and then they‚Äôre standing in front of you.
---
I can hear the reees in the distance already. hoping their toons get deleted at the very least
---
Doing trash to cthun is OVERRATED!
---
No professions, I grind mobs when going from point A to point B. I guess I never really do instances because I play when servers are depopulated and I have no friends
---
Took me 23 days /played to lvl 60 back in the day. There‚Äôs no rush. But yeah, grinding mobs was needed iirc, as there just weren‚Äôt enough quests in certain zones.
---
I leveled in vanilla buddy, where elite quests meant you got guildies to come help or you abandoned it.  Being able to do elite quests during prime hours, even if it takes 10 minutes to find a group is a higher zone population than I'm used to.
---
Also, were you watching LFG or were you in trade chat?  Saying 4 messages in 10 minutes for LFG when trade chat is popping off is not very honest.
---
I definitely get a perverse satisfaction from ganking rogues when they are at low health and fighting a mob
---
Damn u got me good
---
Ditto. 2 days ago. Didn't win it though :(
---
Classic is Dead on Arrival sadly. Some guild has 100K gold with layering exploits. Can exploit raids too.
---
They're supposed to turn off layering soon, aren't they?
---
I mean, the instance abuse is because of the layering system. One can't exist without the other. At least that is how the glitch was described to me.
---
Spin to Win baby
---
Haven't seen the alliance side personally, but this was my main problem with the server. There's no point in sitting through the queue times if all that's waiting on the other end are niche groups of people.
---
Thanks guys!
---
The Blizz GMs have addressed this countless times since vanilla and it applies to all games. ‚Äúif it looks like an exploit and feels like an exploit, then it probably is an exploit‚Äù. They can't expect to get away with the ‚ÄúI'm stupid and didn't know‚Äù excuse. You need to consider this from the point of a reasonable person and there is also the damage caused by being too lenient. Perma ban is only way
---
"Small bags?" What, are we some kind of stingy curmudgeon? Wool's where it's at!
---
^(And it's "her)*^(oes)*^(". The apostrophe makes it possessive, not plural, and there's nothing to possess.)
---
Correct. Reddit has a larger userbase. That's a problem.
---
I've been on Herod since day one, and for the most part it's pretty solid. Fairly easy to get a group, generally friendly and good social interactions, lots of activity throughout the day, and a pretty healthy horde/alliance split. 
---
That said the queue today was 2+ hours, so your mileage may vary.
---
Depends on what I'm doing.   If I'm on my way to a dungeon or something I'm not gonna stop unless they fight me.  If I'm just trying to finish a quest quickly before I go to bed I wont initiate fights.      
---
But I do use Spy..  and anyone who does initiate is put on my kos list.      
---
I'm also a rogue so I get to choose my fights.  And when I pvp its dirty.
---
That's completely different though. That guy didn't con you into doing the instance with them only to change the loot rules at the end.
---
He told you straight up as soon as you joined, which is reasonable considering all the hate he'd get in lfg if he was announcing reservations at such a low level.
---
Hey! The Enclave, I fought with these guys a few days ago
---
I feel like card games are different and less ambiguous. Was it a glitch where the application simply wasn't following the rules of the game correctly?
---
I personally know people in my guild who were exploiting this so I will know if Blizzard are just telling people what they want to hear or actually ban these people, I expect them banned in two days.
---
Until the honor system is implemented there's no real incentive to world PvP, aside from just boredom. People are busy leveling.
---
Stop being so entitled, ahhh they should help me pvp! PvP more guys! Stop playing the game how you want!!!
---
I rolled a PvP server so if I feel like world pvping, I can. E.g. on my 60 account I go barrens and camp noobie with some friends. However, without bg or honour, if you're leveling there's basically no point in pvping, risking getting corpse camped, etcetera.
---
Lot's of Grobbulus posts recently. I might check it out.
---
There is not much incentive for PvP at the moment with no honor system.  Unless you‚Äôre fighting over mob tags in the same area I‚Äôm not going to go out of my way to start a PvP battle. I‚Äôm not trying to avoid PvP but there is no point in spending a lot of time doing it when there are no rewards at the current time. I think most people at this point are just focused on getting their class to max level.
---
I'm not talking about ganking lower levels. I can be level 40 and other level 40s will completely ignore me. Nobody fights eachother at all, even if they are an even match.
---
I had a jerk come up and skin a croc I had just killed right after I looted it. I am a Skinner. The asshole was just waiting to click it super fast after I looted so he could skin it first.
---
This is no longer defensibe blizzard.
---
Admit you FUCKED UP already and give us normal classic!
---
30 day ban for people farming what would normally take them literally over 3 months lol, seems like a win to me.
---
You never use SnD until you have rank 2. And even then you mostly just use it on elites or in dungeons.
---
&gt; "oh, that Id doesnt exist, let me make it for you".
---
Or get stuck in limbo like a guild mate that couldn't log in for a whole day because he was switching layers on a flight path at the same time he got invited while accepting a summon.  
---
And of course he fell to his death above Thunder Bluff when he finally got back in again.
---
You can /purr
---
Gratz! Loot?
---
No joke. 
---
A friend and I just ran ZF together (I‚Äôm a shadow priest that healed and he‚Äôs a Prot Pally).   Our group had a warlock and 2 rogues as our remaining party. 
---
I was worried the 3 DPS were going to freak out that we were taking things one pack at a time and used CC a couple of times. Plus with a pally tank there‚Äôs lots of drinking (and he‚Äôs still getting the hang of tanking).  It wasn‚Äôt a slow
---
run, but not the same speed I‚Äôve seen some players demand in instance in Classic.  After having done some SM runs, we have a little PTSD. 
---
To my surprise everyone in the group was so appreciative of a normal paced run, and seemed to love that we completed the instance without any deaths.  The rogues seemed happy just to have found a group.  It was refreshing knowing there were still players out there that actually enjoy the ‚ÄúVanilla‚Äù experience.
---
The one good thing that came out of Warlords of Draenor was removing this quest...

So you're not allowed to play on a PvP server if you're not going to 24/7 pvp. You'd be level 10 forever, never getting anything done if this were the case. Lol
---
Please be joking.
---
Yeah that's super fucked up
---
Pvp is for 60s not for a level 40 rogue ally against a level 24 horde just trying to quest in hillsbrad
---
Would you recommend any in particular?
---
You guys should kiss now
---
I play a rogue and a lot of the time I'll stop and gank if it suits me at the moment, but if it wont be a quick stop and stab, then I'll just keep moving.. I love pvp'ing but that doesnt mean I need to stop and fight every single opposing faction I find, I'd never get anything done and on top of that I'd have to look over my shoulder 24/7 for angry packs hunting me.  Sometimes it's just best to live and let live.
---
Unless you are in an unlimited rage scenario in which case you want something fast so you can spam heroic strike.
---
That is unlikely to happen on Classic though since bosses hit like wet noodle
---
Yeah I honestly haven't heard of this exploit yet either....
---
You people saying there‚Äôs no point in PvP because the honor system isn‚Äôt in place is just sad. 
---
Pvp is fun regardless. Fucking sad. SAD.
---
I have a distinct memory of the yeti cave in Feralas as a mage, and blinking forward only to fall through the ground like you did. The ghost-res repair bill is pretty harsh! Lol
---
Soys
---
Everyone has to fall through the world at least once. It's the classic experience.
---
In the current state of classic, are the Boot of Elements and Magister's Boots dropping from their original location (Uruk Doomhowl and Postmaster Malown) or their later spot (Omokk and Hearthsinger Forresten)?
---
In yep, started nope.
---
Lol, auto correct.  I'm letting it stay.
---
For the hoard.
---
This whole subreddit crying about another exploit that has once again been swiftly addressed by the classic devs.
---
Yeah back in the day before we even knew about the honor system we all just stood around waiting for pvp trinkets to exist.
---
Phase 2 isn't when pvp starts.  pvp starts day 1 and it was that way before.  Pvp in BGs with ur precious trinket is all well and good but that's a hilarious idea that you think PvP shouldn't exist until then.
---
Not really abusing it but apparently a streamer named esfand accidentally did the exploit and asked GMs if it was okay to run through MC again after already clearing it and they gave him the okay lol
---
Druid, Druid, Druid
---
What do you mean? He's running circles around the priest lol
---
The only way this makes sense is if they are 12

You‚Äôre new to the game so you don‚Äôt know how to google? Are you new to the internet? Lullll it‚Äôs ok man your just one of many people that should‚Äôve been blow jobs.

100%
---
When did I say people ganking low levels? I never said that. People ignore everyone even if they are an even match and are the same level.
---
Soo I don‚Äôt play rogue but maybe just check out prebis lists (or whatever tier) and tally up the crit stats
---
I was running from UC to the sepulchre and people were asking if something was happening over there. Can't wait to level to 60 to fight back.
---
how long is this axe bis for dungeon grinding
---
While leveling, I pretty much mind my own business unless provoked. Some people won‚Äôt like this, but I try to help people leveling, regardless of faction, because it is a grind that we all gotta do to get the phat lewts waiting for us. 
---
For instance, yesterday an ally warrior was at like 15%ish health and running from 2 mobs. I used to play warrior so I felt his pain and the runback from where we were sucked. So I proceeded to nova his mobs and sheep him (I‚Äôm Horde) so that he can heal. Once he was 100%, I freed him and we killed the mobs.
---
At 60, I will only start some shit with somebody who is out of contact and within 4 levels. I like the competitive aspect of PvP, so if it‚Äôs an unfair fight in my favor, I generally don‚Äôt seize the advantage. I like the adrenaline rush I get when I‚Äôm playing against another competent player or 2. 
---
Now I have been keeping a blacklist of people who have been griefing and I fully intend on helping these people to alt+f4. Gotta a good sized list so far, so hopefully these people make it to 60.
---
Funny thing is when phase 2 rolls out this Reddit will fill up with threads asking for warmode to be implemented in classic
---
That mage doesn't know how to to play.
---
I said that? Thanks for putting words in my mouth...
---
Wtf this is literally my life. 17 month old, all of it
---
Dude just Get the free trail, you CAN always upgrade that into A real account
---
if he didn't put how to do it nobody would believe it. blizzard blue posted that recent layering exploit claims are fake and that its not really a problem.
---
Trying to migrate character, but I don‚Äôt see the shop button by addon button on character select screen. Made sure I didn‚Äôt for some reason have parental controls etc. Anyone have a solution?
---
I believe for rogues it's 2 AP per agi but agi also gives crit and dodge etc or whatever.
---
Was also used in raids. Pretty fucked up. Hopefully repeat exploiters are severely punished.
---
You can also search for items around the same level and equipment slot
---
I hope the axe didn't even drop so he gets blacklisted for loot he didn't even get.
---
That's a shitty strawman. Nobody said you should ignore leveling, but if you never fight and walk by every enemy player you see, there is no reason for you to be playing on a PvP server.
---
Only if there's tongue
---
You said it yourself, it's a funny meme. You're thumbing your nose at the person about to kill you by going invulnerable and teleporting out of there.
---
They actually had huge community outcry over their difficulty prompting ghostcrawler to create a post about how hes trying to create a game where players would need to work together and cc / use brains to win but people just flamed him and Blizzard ended up nerfing Cata heroics. He quit shortly after IIRC.
---
Screeeenshow plls
---
I had a warrior need BoE blue mail shoulders in a catafter everyone else had rolled greed "for an alt" I was mad as hell cause I'm pretty sure it was BiS level 39 twink gear. I highly doubt it was even for an alt too... he sold that gear on the AH for a cool couple hundred G, I know it!

I'm pretty sure just /s and /y are layered? Correct me if I'm wrong.

Killing King Bangalash in STV the other day. Tried messaging general chat to see if anyone needed to kill him. Got nothing for like 10 minutes. Finally I see an alliance warrior roll up next to him (I‚Äôm horde) and we both look at each other. I /point at Bangalash and me and the warrior both /cheer at each other on. After a moment the warrior attacks him and I help him kill Bangalash. This kid ended up sitting next to me and waited the full 5 minutes for him to respawn and then helped me kill him. He thanked me and I saluted him and we both went on our ways. It was such a nice relief out of all the killing in STV to make a pact with the opposite faction and kill an elite mob that benifitted us both without being able to actually talk to one another.
---
Nope, it's 1 agi = 1 ap.
---
That's not the reason it's bugged. Resists you can see when it happens.
---
Why is everyone a human warrior? Dwarves have stone form and nelfs have extra dodge. Is 5% spirit really better?
---
What‚Äôd it say?
---
It‚Äôs only SM armoury, you can farm that pretty fast. Geez.
---
No. It wasn‚Äôt an upgrade for him and he still needed. So it‚Äôs clearly fair if you do the same.
---
Show us where the rogue hurt you
---
i'm already sitting on 6 void robe patterns, all my pre-bis finished and 4k gold. you can remove it now lol
---
How do your farts smell?
---
Like roses, right? Since you're so enlightened with such refined tastes that're so strictly superior to all those unwashed plebs who're doing things *wrong*
---
Are you using bartender? I like how it hides your bags/options bar until you mouseover it. Didn‚Äôt know it did that
---
That sucks. I won't gank low level people because that's just a dick move. They are just trying to level up. But in contested areas and alliance are questing same area they are fair game. What server are you on?
---
Man thats a great joke
---
Check out barrens.chat forum
---
When did I get offended?
---
 I'll just ignore the 30 epic patterns on the AH for 100g each then?
---
Or the people who've already brought and learned them?
---
1000x times less toxic than STV.
---
You just say "shuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnn" when you see them
---
How exactly do i put this into my macro?
---
Yeah now you just have to worry about shamans. Sorry bud.
---
lol there are some dumb people out there, you never know on reddit
---
Bingo. I can‚Äôt believe the layering fan boys are still running with the ‚Äúomg we need layering‚Äù narrative. The only benefit layering provided was to Blizzard (less work and $$$ for them).
---
But he didn‚Äôt use this?
---
On which layer tho
---
Couple years?  Layering should be gone by Phase 2 in a few months.
---
I did try and they don‚Äôt do correct those kind of mistakes. Multiple people told me that they wouldn‚Äôt correct it (I was trying to reason with the guild run who I was Pugging for), and they were correct :(.
---
This is where you get your crystal to build your first lighsaber right?
---
Why are people calling for bans? I didn't realize you could do this but layering is a feature is it not?
---
He didn't exploit this at all. What are you on about?
---
or just ban them and avoid some dumb hoops for karma farming
---
We tried to tell them... but the layering fan boys didn‚Äôt listen. We knew this would happen.
---
The lower level bags are not (6-slot, 8-slot, 10-slot... maybe 12-slot) except for quest-reward bags.
---
I think 16+ slot bags are BoE.
---
Fair point, I forgot when you zone to the other continent on a boat, you still see the same people on the boat.
---
On venation circle we had a priest named Banky ( or some variation ) he was universally hated.
---
fat loot
---
So what you mean to say is that you're literally making shit up and trying to cry that the sky is falling when you have absolutely **zero** evidence that this is even possible?
---
I‚Äôm 28 and know kek from playing Vanilla. I‚Äôm still new gen or old gen? What is the cut off? Can I be the T-1000?
---
Good.   
---
At best, roll their characters back 2 weeks. At worst, permaban the ones who were bragging about it on stream.   
---
Can't allow ill-gotten gains to ruin the economy and PVP experience.
---
How about we just listened to the logical people and demanded no layering. But nah... the layering fan boys needed to be able to level to 60 as fast as possible!
---
Cenarion** DYAC
---
Imagine getting banned for ezploiting layering.
---
This weekend I leveled my warrior from 34-41 by running only SM Armoury and Cath - never saw boots or chest. Feelsbadman.
---
Grats though! I got tabard on the last run thankfully.
---
YOUR MOM WAS 24 IN 2004
---
Someone else beat you to the post already.
---
Snowflake
---
almost every other hour? what server are you on?
---
i am surprised if chat goes 60 seconds without someone asking for a layer invite
---
Honestly curious, what makes APES ‚Äúgenerally not very nice people?‚Äù They are part of the reason classic exists. Just wondering if you had any reason other than anecdotal evidence for making that statement.
---
Whoah that macro sounds amazing. I'd love to see an example of it as well if you don't mind.
---
Can someone tell me what's the point of fishing in classic? Best food requires meat mostly. Where do you use fish other than cooking?
---
For those that were freaking out like spongebob's brain that one episode. It was a bug, unintended, and does not completely negate the need for layering. Also as expected fixed very quickly to when we found out about the bug and people will be banned. (Still a bad oversight by blizzard IMO)
---
From memory it was first run, but this blue post is more related to the "new" dungeon exploit that surface not long ago.
---
That raid reset was probably the first sign of this bug but it wasnt "abuse" as it was a one time thing.
---
Dungeon, people reset them non stop for easy loot.
---
Yep. And another thing that is screwed in current WoW is that you have 20 people and bosses are dropping 4-5 items each, on 4 different difficulties. Potentially each player can see 16-20 item drops from each boss for 20 people. Plus bonus rolls. 
---
In classic you had 2, per boss, per week. Shared across 40 people. Around 1/20th of the amount of loot for a raiding guild. 
---
So you keep your old gear much longer and everybodies gear remains different and somewhat unique instead of everybody wearing the exact same gear with slightly different ilvls a couple of weeks into the new patch. 
---
I don't personally think essentially a full reset is a bad thing either but I know a lot of people don't like feeling like all their progress was a waste. I think some system where you upgrade old gear is not the worst idea, however the problem can come if it becomes hard for people to find groups for that old content, so there is gear they want but can't get because nobody is running that content.
---
that's why you should've rolled horde. Allies are bunch of filthy scums with no honor
---
Really depends on how close the mobs are if you can't get to the second one before it wears off its a waste of time.
---
I'm the same way. The only social games i played were WoW &amp; Maplestory.
---
And there are plenty of people on this very subreddit that do it themselves - just look at how many people get defensive when you say that manipulating layering is abusing game mechanics.
---
We saw this coming from a mile away. They should‚Äôve never of done layering. The only benefit it provides is less work and money required for blizzard to stand up more servers.
---
Think he meant more like he probably wouldn't run into that specific player for a couple of years. Not unlikely if you're playing on a full server tbh.
---
[Nah, you're just smug, judgmental, and extremely insecure](https://i.imgur.com/Y7Usaw2.png)

What'samatter? [Does your back hurt?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMTkedIUX8U)
---
This exploit has been around for three weeks...some friends and I happened upon it a few day‚Äôs after launch. How is that for ‚Äúswiftly‚Äù?
---
200 for the pc I can always upgrade. I don‚Äôt really mind I just don‚Äôt want to build a 2000 pc just yet as WoW is the only game I‚Äôm really interested in.
---
3 day ban and they get to keep all their items and gold
---
Is rattlegore a high pop server?
---
I hope they just wipe the servers completeley and re-relaunch classic.
---
ouch to people who get caught
---
Win.  
---
But mostly, I lose.
---
Yikes...
---
Permanent ban.
---
buT omG wE nEEd LaYeRinG!
---
Whats up with the cringe night elf. U b fappn to that?
---
I turned off questie but the problem persisted. I think the other guy is right about me not doing the prequel quest since I‚Äôm a Gnome and just sorta jumped into Elwynn
---
I second Arms for leveling. I played through the first 25 levels as Fury, and Arms feels much smoother to me. When tanking dungeons, it's great to be able to switch stances while maintaining rage. Sweeping strike is also really good.
---
Oh thank god there are others. I thought I was just being weird.
---
Yeah, I always require something from the person.  Generally equal to what the materials cost me (or the materials themselves).  It's not sustainable otherwise unless you have a high level income.
---
Love the name, maybe I'll check it out.
---
I think you‚Äôre right actually since I came to Elwynn at 10
---
30-60 day bans and removal of gold and gear acquired seems appropriate, with lifetime bans for those exploiting MC/Ony.
---
@bensam123 @bensam Human Paladin
---
Abusing an exploit is definitely stupid. Yes blizzard is at fault for not fixing it. But the player is at fault for abusing it. 
---
If a bank makes an error you don‚Äôt get to keep the money.
---
I opened trade with a lowbie warrior to give him 20 free lions strength potions. He closed the window and whispered me ‚Äúpiss off‚Äù.
---
Well then
---
Why?
---
&gt; Holy pala is the only pala.
---
There are two kinds of Paladins in Classic: the ones that are good at healing and the ones that are bad at healing.
---
You need that stuff for DotA 2 so you can watch replays. AFAIK there's no such thing in WoW.
---
Well, did you contact Blizzard? They should be able to have a chatlog and if you got chat restricted for no reason, they will probably ban the players that falsely reported you.
---
Well yeah. Deadlifts and oly lifts are the ones that would set it off. I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôd set those down lightly.
---
Sure, here you go.  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMuxdAboxdVZVbt](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMuxdAboxdVZVbt)

We tried to tell them layering was a bad idea. They didn‚Äôt listen...

90 Day Bans

No ifs or buts

Too little too late.

Don‚Äôt delete their toons. Make them wait in a login queue forever.
---
I always /spit on Varimathras
---
You're just not efficient. You're definitely a slow leveler. 
---
Watch tutorials, aoe farming if the spots are open is insane. Lots of quests are terrible, they take long to do and the xp isn't worth it. Find which quests are worth it.
---
I'm a mage dog
---
Complaint registered.
---
Yeah, I can crowd kite like a mofo in a raid, levelling I just quest efficiently. Doing grind to that degree just seems soul destroying.
---
Why do you think trolls in barrens chat arn't actually serious? People on the left think its so hilarious when they here an alternative opinion, it's like you all think it's a big joke to not be left wing, if right wing people are such a small weirdo minority how is Trump president? Apparently trolls in barren chat can't be possibly serious and yet Trolls in barren chat hold the same views as your president of the united states. lol. Left wingers are so cushioned to any views outside of their own.
---
Watching alliance players be excited about fighting back a main city raid makes me want to gouge my eyes. Do they think they don‚Äôt look like total faggots?
---
eh i figured just wanted to give my 2 cents and an easy format for people to read
---
It's blizzard, theyre gonna ban for 3 days at most
---
yeah I was thinking he should shame delete his account now
---
This has been being abused by some of the top guilds for *weeks*. The race to 60/Rag was ruined by the raid exp bug. Now pre-BiS farms and thus control of resources in the world has been affected by this exploit. Do you understand now?
---
Oh boi. Very curious to see what Blizz does to punish them
---
probably found but not reported like a lot of exploits
---
Second this
---
Have you even been on reddit before? This is surprising to you?
---
it was not inteded that way, im pretty sure we are going to see a blue post tomorrow.
---
perma ban and removal of all there items and gold is more likely
---
Shadowbanned in a way. I love it. Let them have low prio in queue haha
---
Yup. We tried to tell them. But the layering fan boys wanted it. And Blizzard wanted it because it requires less money and work for them.
---
Fantastic explanation. I wish I could gild you man. Ty
---
Yeah you got all addons for free after buying the game aswell not having to pay a sub. 
---
Its just a joke brah and epstein was just a very good troll pulled of by everyone.
---
You seem a little judgey, maybe you should just let people enjoy something the way they want to enjoy it? Maybe...I don't know...get over yourself?
---
Bruh you got confidential information in your pic.
---
Why even live?
---
If you did this I personally want you to know that I find you to be worm filth.
---
The store button is there because that's how to free realm transfer.
---
Normally I'd agree since blizzard is insanely inconsistent with bug abuse.
---
However, anyone who thought respawning bosses was going to be viewed as "ok" had to be a whole new level of stupid. 
---
It was a risk,  simple as that. Blizz might drop a heavy hammer,  they might tickle,  might do nothing. That's what was likely going through the heads of the people abusing it.  Want the possible reward? you better be willing to accept the risks.
---
Lmao found an exploiter
---
yes, but trust me, it‚Äôs not a good experience, you will be just killing mobs and doing quests getting items that will be worthless to you and pretty killing everything in one or two hits
---
That‚Äôs because it wasn‚Äôt really a beta, it was promotional early access granted to popular streamers and influencers.
---
Haha sex number low hanging fruit humour epic bro üòéüòéüòé
---
How about Fuck That Guild and the shitty people in it.  Name them and we get blizz to take action
---
For those not aware, there are places in Booty bay and Winterspring in which you can freely attack others and have no retaliation from the guards. Makes trying to get these late game patterns near impossible because they'll just constantly kill the opposite faction while having 0 repercussions. You retaliating does nothing as the guards are going to kill you.
---
It involves having someone outside the instance but in a different layer invite you to a party while standing at the boss.
---
Literally just get layered while in a dungeon. Instant new dungeon with all bosses alive.
---
It just brings back memories doing this quest all that time ago this game is truly magical! Yeah the ravages is great I can‚Äôt wait to farm SM for it!
---
Why are you expecting people to tell you what someone else did? If they exploited, they'll be penalized per the blue post. Move on with your life. Just for the record though, it's entirely possible to have farmed a ton of gold already and have your epic mount. Since you bring up Asmon but don't care enough to know the facts, he's said multiple times he is using his gold to help gear his main raid team first and foremost and doesn't care about getting the epic mount right now.
---
Removing layering is really not an option right now. Even with layering I‚Äôm fighting for mobs with 3 or 4 full groups. It‚Äôs been really demotivating
---
Is the realm change still available?
---
It's absolutely reasonable to do so since there's normally someone in the group who warns then, such as in OPs case. I do every time that I go there, idiots still fail two times out of three.
---
U do not have to buy retail, are you sure he is on the the right game basically some people have multiple accounts
---
then name the guilds, we want names and if you can videos or whatever.
---
Sort of. During peak hours it is.
---
just takes time to process, it was on about 3 pages he had to click ok on to even create an account
---
Everyone talking about deleting their rooms, and I'm definitely not against it as someone in the mid 30 level range, but is there actual precedent for blizzard doing this? Thanks, new to the game.
---
Sunder armor.  Get every add with at least 1 but try to get like 3 or 4 on target you want most threat from.  If you miss an opportunity to use revenge you're doing it wrong.  Demoralizing shout helps.  Cleave is good for more than one target but make sure you are tanking away from CCed targets so you don't break em.  Shield block is important.  Save shield bash for a caster.  Its also a good alternate to hit a Target with when you have more than 1 add.
---
Groups I used to like to charge in.  Drop a thunderclap switch to defensive.  Drop a demoralizing shout while trying to get a sunder on a target.  Shield bash the caster, sunder then on the main target again.  Sunder the other two.  Dps should have caster dead by then.  So cleave when you can.  Don't miss revenge if possible.  Sunder armor all around.  Stack it up.  Cleave.  Demoralizing shout.  Shield bash.  Own.
---
Just because he's farming for one day doesn't mean he doesn't wanna do dungeons or a raid or something the next day.
---
Gy mage spam has completely ruined my rogue experience in classic. It's fucking impossible to find a group when everyone wants mages. I'm just tired of spamming in lfg chats for hours on end while killing raptors in highlands.
---
Maybe 1 lock to summon other party members for dungeons:)
---
Say you're an alliance and a horde, both level 30. One gets to stay in Ashenvale, the other has to trek to the Eastern Kingdoms, and then head to a level 50+ region where they will instantly aggro a bunch of mobs 30 levels higher than them. This quest gives what, 6k exp? (Legit dont remember, this post is a couple of days old at this point). Which faction gets this supposedly easy chunk of exp easier?
---
This kinda shit stresses me out lol. I don't know near enough about vanilla to know what items I should prioritize and I'm way behind right now at level 20.
---
"I swear i thought respawning bosses by switching layers was feature! It was in the manual somewhere i swear!"
---
I just don‚Äôt get why we need layering at all now.  It seems like the kinda thing where because they spent a ton of money on it they feel like they need to justify their investment and keep it around for a long time.  I would rather just sit and wait for my quest mobs rather than dealing with all this.
---
How about you also fix the blood of heroes not being able to be picked in WPL?  You're causing backlog and when it does get fixed its going to be near impossible to finish with all the warriors looking for the damn blood at once instead of spread out.
---
I hadn't heard about it until yesterday, and I've been playing for hours daily. It only blew up recently as far as i'm concerned.
---
I know, just making a joke.
---
So that's what an alliance looks like......   
---
Jesus Christ, they could be anyone. Mark from Target, or Alyssa at Starbucks. God, you just never know... Just so creepy.
---
Bring em on. Half the reason I play on a pvp server is for the feeling when someone tries to gank you at an opportunistic moment and I turn it around anyway. I've killed many an alliance who thought I was easy pickings. Turns out when no-one has pvp trinkets, you can't really stop me sheeping+evocating+bandaging, then crushing you for your foolishness.
---
Pots are only off limits in duels.. if someone attacks you in the wild while you‚Äôre oom you have every right to pop pots and kill that person. LEL.
---
And now they in charge
---
All getting ready to gank low level Horde together, one Horde at a time, the alliance way.
---
In my experience its blizzard server lag.  Funny how their servers cant handle a raid on Orgrimmar, but other servers managed it just fine even with 10k people on.
---
Going through this as we speak. Did you have to delete the Goblin Engineer Membership card too? When i dropped engineering it stayed in my bags.
---
yeah we know, it's just part of a PVP server. one of the most fun things you can do is fuck over someone who can't do shit about it
---
People can farm raids. You are only supposed to run it once a week. It's ruining, if not already ruined, the game's economy.
---
Oh boo hoo. You did it once, you can do it again. Id rather everyone be rolled back and have a legit authentic classic. Not something exploited to shit.
---

---
Why not both?  I don't think there's any plausible deniability here, the players knew they were exploiting something that was not intended and offers an unfair advantage.
---
what? when?  
---
I know about people permabanned in wow and other people banned for 90 days for example.  
---
I guessing it depends in this cases, if some people abused this in end game content probably 60 to 90 days or perma.
---
Your name is literally scum burger, and you're trying to spew valid verbiage. Because you are aware you lost the argument (the argument that your account is an actual shitpost account, so nothing from it can be taken seriously), you are escalating to completely irrelevant insults "hahaha ur mother shoudla swallow u bro!!111". 
---
No counterargument = I won.

And for this argument, likewise to every other aspect of your life: you lose.

Good luck friend.

That's mostly offline time. Just stating I don't believe is was like a delayed ban or w/e

Druids are pretty good at pvp, so you might want to look up some guides or some videos.

How is he using it? I can't tell from the video. Leaving his group and rejoining it?
---
Bloviate (Verb) - to talk at length, especially in an inflated or empty way. 
---
In case anyone else learned a new word today
---
This is a pretty perfect response, promptly acknowledged, promptly fixed, and promptly going after those who abused it to for gain. Honestly surprised it was handled this fast and they are taking action against those who abused it.
---
It's only a few hours every Sunday. Not sure if it's this phase
---
So the dungeon ID gives everyone the same layer to play a dungeon and when you leave the party and move back to your layer the dungeon ID should stick with you independent of the layering system.
---
What addon is this font etc
---
I hope they do. Then again Blizz didn't know about the dungeon layer abuse until someone came out and said they had been doing it since launch.
---
That's not what I would call "fun" but you do you.
---
This is (in my opinion) an exploit, the guards are CLEARLY supposed to attack anyone who starts attacking in these neutral towns. Getting around that is an exploit.

Not saying that is true, but right now 20-40 has multiple groups fighting for mobs. I tried to finish my lvl 30 warrior quest friday and there were around 30 other people fighting the trolls for quests.
---
You *can* trade in classic with just a starter edition and a subscription. 
---
Source: have traded dozens if not hundreds of times between my two starter editions, as well as a handful of times with other players.
---
Mages can kill healers. You have lots of damage and counterspell really limits the healers options.

Any suggestions on gold making? I‚Äôm leaving 38 mage and I‚Äôve been running SM since lvl 32ish. But only have about 45g. I‚Äôm 2 lvls away but don‚Äôt even half the amount. For my professions I have herbalism/skinning. Saved all my herbs (only at 170) and just sold all my light and medium leather. But saving my heavy leather to sell on the AH. But for a stack it only goes for about 50s.
---
Im not sure I understand. What was the bug that was exploited? It sounds like just resetting an instance over and over, but I expect there to be something more severe.
---
Why isn‚Äôt this higher up lol

---
I am thankful that my friends and family returned to WoW Classic with me. This toxic greed is demoralizing.
---
so does this prove the blue post from a few days ago about layering being over rated for economic manipulation was bullshit?
---
3 weeker here, this would never work üòÄ
---
Try the 6 one. It‚Äôs the only one I use, but truthfully I use about 4-5 of the buttons. Sometimes it also feels just too much. I guess muscle memory is king here.
---
Love the outcome of this entire Reddit post! üñ§
---
This stuff would be better suited to realm discords or realm subreddits, it just clogs up this sub with more garbage than there already is
---
Every server would have an eternal queue if they did that. For the game to be playable without layering they‚Äôd have to open 20+ more realms per sever most of which would be dead in a year‚Äôs time.
---
There‚Äôs nuance to this. Just removing layering tomorrow would cause more harm than good.
---
It works on bosses at well.
---
Yeah Blizzard should fire themselves for being so naughty
---
What if they already spent the gold? How do they rollback that
---
Orcish isn‚Äôt it? Think every horde race have both racial language and orcish
---
How are Pallies in PvP in classic? I think I've just instinctively been avoiding them because on retail it's almost not worth the time to kill one. There's the whole shield to deal with, then like sixteen healthbars of life. You could just kill the other members of their crew in the time it takes to deal with all the pally juice. 
---
I think I'm going to try attacking the next one I see, best way to find out how I do against one.
---
To show dominance! Next, they'll pee on them
---
Fuckin boomers
---
Why would you be banned for something Blizzard themselves implemented? lol 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even call this a bug or exploit.
---
The layers are there... you can use them. Everyone can do the same thing so it‚Äôs their fault for not taking advantage of something in the game.
---
When I try to trade him it says I can‚Äôt because he has the starter edition. You can tell me what happened to you but that doesn‚Äôt change the facts on my side.
---
you're just mad you got out wpvp'd
---
this IS wpvp, always has been, always will be. it's not going to be fixed or addressed. it's not a bug. people who roll on pvp servers always have shit liek this they can't stand and want things to change to suit THEM but the issue is that you aren't cut out for pvp servers
---
griefing is like 50% of it. fair fights are rare, sometimes you get camped, higher levels love to demolish lower levels, etc
---
For someone seeking help you, you sure know how not to do it
---
- Try to find an answer yourself first (macros can't interrogate the status of debuffs or effects on a target)
---
- Don't go off at people giving you alternate suggestions 
---
- Be nicer in general, the wording of your OP is not very inviting
---
The guy is feeding you misinformation. While layering was to help a bit with overpopulation in starter zones, the primary purpose of layering is so that when the hype dies down and a fraction of the playerbase stays (this is always true for hyped games nowadays, then layers will be removed and servers will have a healthy population.
---
Blizzard doesn't want to open server after server after server after server to help with the queue times and people waiting because then half of those servers would be dead and require merges, which people hate doing because they usually can't keep their name.
---
Layering is a neat technology because layers are the size of a full vanilla server (3000 players) which is why it's not easily noticeable you're even playing on a layer. When they decide to remove layering, the servers at a minimum would probably be around 3000-5000 players while the most populated ones like Faerlina would be like 9000 players. Keep in mind Blizzard said most (or all?) servers had low single digit layers (2-4, probably).
---
This guy **charges**.
---
Blizzard can track all that shit, they know already. IDK if they're going to take action, hope they do.
---
Just open a ticket and submit that clip
---
Truly there must be better ping servers. Filling up the queues with mostly people I can't communicate with
---
Good thing there's not much value to finishing a starting zone more or less quickly.
---
Go watch a stand up mr 100 years old. Reality from the pic sure hurts, but hey some people can laugh about that while the others have a bunch of spikea up their arses.
---
yeah!
---
I have a couple of ideas (most of them are just refurbishing of the good stuff in retail):
---
1) Heroic versions of old dungeons, like in Cata. To enter, you need to complete the attunement quest or questline. This way you can visit dungeons like DM and SM and get new gear, maybe even new mounts, recipes and reagents. For example, to make a Heroic Scarlet set you need to get a recipe from one dungeon and farm let's say Scarlet Armor Parts from trash and bosses.
---
2) Dynamic world events. Legion prepatch was so epic: the whole world united to stop the invasion. They could make something like that, actually, we had a Scourge invasion in Vanilla - they can add stuff above it and make a recurring event.
---
3) World quests: debatable, but if done right, it could be fun and rewarding
---
4) More world bosses. Let people fight for them. 
---
5) A PvP zone like Ashran. Blizzard have enough experience and feedback about it - just make it in spirit of Classic. I would love to get a title like in Draenor, where you needed to kill a lot of players of a certain race in PvP.
---
Same here. These people might be playing on the streamer/zoomer/edgelord servers
---
Black lung
---
It does not change facts, but it does raise the likelihood that you got one of them wrong. 
---
Maybe he's not subscribed on that account, maybe you're not subscribed and the error message is a goof, maybe you're both actually playing retail WoW and just haven't noticed. 
---
In classic, with a subscription, starter editions can trade.
---
Some of the posts literally had step by step instructions on how to perform the exploit. Of course they should be deleted.
---
Are you horde or alliance?
---
If alliance, agi is marginally more useful because of kings. So basically add 10% to whatever agi you get (6 agi = 6.6). 1 agi = 2 AP
---
1 agi = 1/49 of a crit percent or something, so keep that in mind as well. 
---
I‚Äôd take the AP as horde, tossup as alliance.
---
A geared fury warrior is an absolute powerhouse.
---
Well then I'd suggest you write a ticket
---
If everyone can do it then why aren‚Äôt others? Blizzard added this... and they‚Äôre just going along with the hand they were dealt. 
---
You see streamers do this ALL the time on BfA with layering so why would they get banned NOW?
---
You actually want that? I'd never log back in if they did that. I'm a few bars from 60, I enjoyed leveling but if they reset things right now I'd never come back, I play knowing my toon will last forever.
---
You must be Yipman.
---
If your not in a shitty corrupt council it‚Äôs the opposite, you WILL see loot, waay before the abuser. Because why would you give someone a 1% dps increase when it‚Äôs a 30% dps increase for someone else?
---
He did with princess dude
---
&gt;If you have 3 more or mobs, CL and fire nova become worth the mana cost for the aoe damage.
---
What is your end build going to be?
---
Because it doesn't matter if they try to do it. Blizz has the itemlogs and can see which account they offloaded to.
---
The do it on us servers as well
---
I would say warrior, mage and healer of choice. For horde I‚Äôd say shaman cause they‚Äôre amazing and they fit into the loot table so people aren‚Äôt fighting any gear. For alliance I‚Äôd say paladin as a healer but that might cause some loot problems. So priest or Druid might be the better alliance call
---
That is straight up terrible. Side note, what is the green XP bubble addon? Is it a weak aura?
---
Outside the USA its still unusual to use pet for pat.
---
I always wondered, do you guys pronounce pet as pat phoenetically?
---
On one hand, good. On the other, it seems weird to draw the line here. Knowingly abusing raid experience even when the raidinfo window says explicitly how it's supposed to function; unpunished. Effectively duping the amount of (rare) spawns and resources available by exploiting layers; unpunished. 
---
Mind you - before we escalate further - someone who has done both of these is already immeasurably ahead in terms of server economy, itemization and PVP balance, compared to someone who hasn't.
---
Respawning dungeon bosses, now that's too much. "Severe" punishment incoming. If I had to play Devil's Advocate, I would say that the negligent way Blizzard has handled the issues thusfar, would not necessarily lead someone to believe they're doing something wrong in this case.
---
Blizzard needs to be consistent in its approach. The raid xp abusers, layer hoppers et cetera all need to be punished - albeit to a lesser degree - to signal that further escalation of the exploits would be met with harsher punishment.
---
RandomÂÄã*
---
Agreed. I'm gonna bet that Blizz will fix the exploit but there will be no punishments. Calling it now: exploit early and often.
---
hes playing on that language
---
How are you zoomed out so much
---
How long has it been since he got the subscription? Same thing happened to me and it fixed itself in 24 hours. GM said it had something to do with payment verification or something
---
**/pet attack** used to work in vanilla as a macro.
---
Not classic!
---
Lucky for the regular joe blizzard just announced that those who used this exploit will face punitive measures. banhammer is out boys.
---
For sure mate
---
I‚Äôd assume they remain leader and someone would have to open a ticket
---
I'm excited
---
Depends on how you look at it. Most classes only become decent once you reach level 10 and unlock the first cool stuff. Druid bear form, shaman fire totem, hunter pet, etc.
---
And after leveling your fifth character through them because you are not quite sure what you want to play, you'll just want to get through it asap.
---
Also your name is MK7driver. Ooooh boy a carrrrr!some shit VW at that.  That‚Äôs literally what an 8 year old would make their name. Dad died early, I get it.
---
Druid. Druid. Lock... Druid. Druid.

---
Which major streamer did this and no one reported it?
---
Cars, girls, alcohol, and anime titties.
---
It's not about keeping them out, it's just restarting progress.
---
good idea, I'll try that.
---
Wasn‚Äôt it gutterspeak?
---
So sorry for ignorance but what benefit does swing timer have for pally? Obviously it‚Äôs good for hunters
---
Ban the player.
---
Layering in dungeons is not a feature. It's a bug. And since it's a bug, using it to your advantage is an exploit.
---
They've never actually implemented it well, to be fair.  It's always been pretty half assed.  
---
I want some fucking giant capturable fortress oriented gameplay where everyone fights over these strongholds and then has to invest gold into them(for a % return based on how long you defend them) and you get NPC base defenses/catapults/utility defenses/etc depending on how much gold is invested.
---
Yea I had a guildie help me so I had it for my 29 twink. Wep was beast in BG think I had it a good while after I decided to level as well.
---
arms, get ravager, keybind autoattack to all keys and facesmash keyboard
---
This really needs to be fixed.
---
Yeah but the eula defines cheats as ‚Äúmethods not expressly authorized by Blizzard, influencing and/or facilitating the gameplay, including exploits of any in-game bugs, and thereby granting you and/or any other user an advantage over other players not using such methods.‚Äù 
---
You know you are only meant to be able to kill the boss once per dungeon run, or once per week in a raid. If you exploit something that lets you do that more then you are knowingly cheating
---
Get ready to die
---
Damn this worries me about choosing to main a mage. It's my favorite class but I'm only level 20 and I haven't really experienced being ganked yet. I don't wanna restart as a new character seeing I'm already so far behind but I kinda regret choosing a pvp server.
---
Might be an outright ban - while if they bought something they probably wont punish the seller, but they can easily remove mounts or training.
---
Lol it was so ugly but good
---
Yea enjoy getting windfury crit
---
bored around 25... lol, oh boy you won't see level 60, my friend
---
You're talking about retail players (who want this type of gameplay, and have retail to have that type of gameplay) vs classic-minded players who want 60 oriented gameplay with extended end game content...
---
Must have been lowered then. Sad I got rid of 45ish of em for 7-9g when they're 20 now
---
Everybody should make their own "book of shame". Where you write down the people that have done shit like this on the server, already got one rouge kicked from the Deadmines party because earlier he ninjaed loot from the entire group.
---
Don't worry I had it as well. It take up to 72 hours to process his account. I was ok after about 12 hours. Just wait
---
I tried to transfer a blue I accidentally needed. Gm said they wouldn't because that's how classic worked.
---
Griefing is harassment which is against ToS. So no it's not part of world PvP.  You can argue all you want bout how this is wpvp but anything that is griefing is against ToS.
---
Don‚Äôt really know, I am an undead so I have gutterspeak and orcish. I just concluded that orcish is the default ‚Äùcommon‚Äù for hordes
---
Whats your /played to 60?
---
/pat
---
I heard Esfand did this. I‚Äôd be hard pressed to see asmongold exploit knowing the consequences.
---
Really? Because as a levelling Alliance I can't count on both hands how many times I was killed, and corpse camped, by a mounted player while I was leveling in Redridge mountains, a ~level 20 zone. It only got worse in Duskwood, and god forbid you need to run through Arathi Highlands to get to a dungeon/next questing area.
---
it can... blizzard didn't actually spend any time reviewing the code, they just jumbled and copy pasta code to make this "classic thing" work, they didn't actually give 3 fucks about the project. this can also be backed up by the fact that blizzard stated 2 weeks ago that "there's no one running around with stacks of gold and abusing layering we are monitoring everything closely" and now this? obviously they didn't monitor shit.
---
Well I wasn't referring to a specific person. Yes I know he's like the poster boy for WoW.
---
From what I've read it was Esfand and someone else that did it live on stream.
---
thats not 100% accurate.
---
there is a 'dispell' proof spec 
---
you dont take imp cone, or the 2% per point dmg talent (optionally you could get rid of imp blizz), but instead you put 5/5 in winters chill. now what does winters chill do you might asking. its a passive that applies a debuff from any frost spells. the debuff improves your crit chance.
---
"but that doesnt do shit vs dispells"
---
it stacks up to 5 times. so the old school (pre cata) strat, was youd get winters chill (tho by wrath you only needed the 1 point) and use r1 frost bolts to stack winters chill onto targets.
---
this made it literally impossible for pala too dispell themselves consistently. priests were the only ones that could actually deal with it, as they dispelled 2 debuffs at a time.  this was also why rank 1 frost bolt was nerfed to like 30% instead of the base 40% we have now. it was too strong
---
i dont know how the priest dispell works in classic. but the strat still technically works
---
the only reason to not take this, is you lose imp bliz/imp cone.
---
I hope!!

I have done it with just me and an alt in the group. 
---
/camp definitely did not port me anywhere.
---
All your character are in the same layer so no layering involved. Just /camp, reset with your alt and you will be at the same position but the instance is reset.
---
Horde logic right there....
---
I mean, if someone is being openly and blatently racist, I'd hope that anyone would call them out.
---
Oh yep all sounding very plausible, and now you‚Äôre supposedly snitching on your friends. I‚Äôd say your nose is growing
---
Based on the code of conduct, that does not appear to be true. How do you interpret these quotes from the CoC?
---
"Exploiting other players is an equally serious offense. Scamming, account sharing, win-trading, and anything else that may degrade the gaming experience for other players will receive harsh penalties."
---
In my opinion this falls under scamming, but if not  then it's covered under "anything else that may degrade the gaming experience for other players".
---
Also, see..
---
"Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect¬†and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions."
---
You may want to actually read the terms you agreed to before spreading false information.
---
Ele shaman.
---
"Clever use of game mechanics" not a single person should be banned or have their items taken in fact all of the blame should laid at the feet of the activision blizzard employees that proposed layering. I said this would happen a while ago and here we are 3 weeks in activision blizzard lagging behind as usual.
---
Ah okay
---
Tiers of punishment need to be implemented.  The problem I feel was that Blizzard didn‚Äôt set any ground rules.  They could have been a lot stricter when it came to intentional layer hopping, but instead didn‚Äôt devote pretty much any resources to encouraging players not to do this.
---
I really hope some high profile suspensions (90 days seems good) or permabans (unlikely) happen.
---
Jesus Christ dude stop spamming. We get you. You don‚Äôt need to say LaYuRiNg BaD 50 times.
---
Just started playing Classic, rolled an Undead Mage on Mankrik. I pray I run into one of these saints. Having only the standard backpack is painful.
---
I've never liked exploit bans in any games. It always felt stupid to me to ban people for doing something unintended within the rules of a system. In any other system you aren't punished for this. If the system doesn't stop you from doing something you are freely able to do it. You don't get imprisoned in real life retroactively if you found a legal loophole to get lower taxes when it gets corrected. Considering you can never know for sure if something is considered an exploit because it's impossible to define without absolute total knowledge over something. 
---
That compared to a ban for breaking ToS for cheating which is very easy to define. And often have very specific definitions that you can tell for an absolute fact whether or not something is cheating.
---
That explains alot
---
essentially what you need to do is keep pet taunt always on and shoot mobs before the tank pulls, you are the unspoken tank. No go....
---
My bet is nobody gets banned and they don't even mention this.
---
Umm...

It takes about 24 hours for your client to update and be upgraded.

IP bans don't work. They should do hardware bans.

I twice used a razer naga chroma - each lasted like 6 months each before the mouse wheel gave out, got a Logitech g600 (its basicly the same mouse but half the price). It lasted two in a half years before anything was wrong with it, I recently got another one with a 4 year warranty now.
---
I just usually make groups where I'm the only one who'd need that type of drop. It's tougher on agi or str classes (ESPECIALLY as DPS), though doable. On healer, it's so easy. If I get any say in it, I never group with any casters lol
---
In pvp war is always amazing, god tier, but only with 1-2 pocket healers. Still remember the old vanilla days in alterac with rank 14 warrior and his 2 pocket healers.... never dieing and killing everyone. 
---
Solo warriors are though as you have 0 self heals.

It is likely that we will see Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King at some point of time. They are considered good expansions by most people. Anything beyond that will likely never be re-released as expansions after WotLK are considered "modern WoW" which does not have same excitement in the community.

Hint: garbage, lowest-common-denominator garbage *at best*, vile, scummy shit (because unmoderated cesspools attract bad actors) at worst
---
Good fix, but what about the guilds that have been secretly farming this shit for the past 2-3 weeks non stop? Are these items being taken away and banks cleansed or are they reaping the rewards of exploiting and not saying anything?
---
This type of stuff is what is great about your guild. Now if you could work on having your members stopping some other stuff they do that people bitch about, that would be cool. (needing on all items in dungeon, 5v1 ganking, camping people, etc)
---
Yo bro. Is 9% hit still needed in a raid environment if im not Tranq shotting?
---
This seems worse than ninja looting. Ninja looting is typically just someone needing on shit they don‚Äôt need. This guy is changing the loot rules with no chance for anyone to even roll. And it was preplanned. This asshole is the worst.
---
If only some of us would have spoken up.. Oh wait...
---
wonder what the next exploit/downside will be? We already have several others being left in the game, like layer hopping to avoid pvp or to farm resources or reset mobs for grinding...
---
It‚Äôs about a 7 year old game. My point was that a release of old content isn‚Äôt a new concept. AA is like on their 4th fresh start this time with a new company and no cash shop.
---
You want to punish people who made mistakes in their code instead of people who who went out of their way to gain an advantage by abusing those mistakes?
---
You're one of those people who went and abused these bugs aren't you. Lol.
---
That's most definitely not the definition of a whistleblower. A whistleblower can take part in the activity they're blowing the whistle onm
---
Why would anyone run a dungeon with a 60, you get like no XP lol.
---
Yeah idk about that. I played a warrior to over 1 million HKs. 1v1 as a warrior was not so great in general. There were still classes that would almost always eat me. Frost mages in specific was a slow death waiting to happen.
---
I wonder how many people in this sub alone will "take a hiatus" from Classic/Retail in the next 72 hours.
---
Which costs resources to monitor and somebodies additional time to also make sure you're not banning any innocent accounts that may have been involved (eg is an item sold at 50% cost transferring 50% of the value to an alt account or just offloading it for cheap to get fast gold).  
---
Depending on how many accounts were involved this could be a huge cost of time that could be resolved by not shooting your load too early.
---
Addons don't forget
---
Lolwut? I can't imagine what you had to do to earn that.
---
They won't be banning people who did this once in error. It'll be the same as the AP glitch back in Legion. Accidentally do it, that's fine you didn't know. Knowingly abused it, gonna get clapped.
---
Yup which sucks because it‚Äôs not always an upgrade, just higher ilvl

I'd say you'll both get fuck all exp. Just a guess, though.

Throwing arround wrong words for what you describe isn't going to help changing it. 
---
Other then that im on redditmailone side there are so many places you can trick guards that it is a part of the game and it got never changed so it most likely won't get changed now. 
---
With that in mind and still chosing pvp server you accept to get fucked by unfair playing people.
---
I‚Äôm all for it, and then make NPCs of their characters and put them on pikes outside the major cities as a warning to everyone about exploiting.
---
Gotta lay off the power thirst.
---
Explains so much, I was wondering about all these full tier 1 and so much ony loot!!
---
oh yes you are right, but i think there is way worse if you are 60 farming end game dungeons, getting pre bis etc.  
---
But yes, the low level dungeons ban them, 90 days 60 days i dont care, just wipe out that trash.  
---
Layer them to BFA

Why can‚Äôt we just leave it how it is :(

Concerning the server Herod for Americans, does anyone else feel like the Horde population is getting out of hand? Im seeing way more horde than alliance and it's getting to be impossible to quest in some contested zones.  I love faction warfare but the server feels like its becoming heavily one sided in the hordes favor. Am I being too sensitive?
---
That's for horde, tho. OP is ally.
---
They must be tortollan.  Collecting many things meant collecting eight.
---
Zandalar Tribe :)
---
The effect is the same. Handing a punishment to him has a chilling effect on whistleblowing. That said, I believe the OP's intentions were to increase the pool of exploiters so vastly that Blizzard wouldn't hand out bans, so I agree he should be punished severely.
---
Elitist Jerks?  I don't remember if that started all the way back to classic or not.
---

How's unemployment?

For real if I'm going to have to go through the pain of tanking in classic I'm getting *all* the good shit. Sorry other warriors, I know you want to DPS, but them's the breaks.

So this is a common ‚Äúissue‚Äù, thanks for the answer. It has been a couple of days since he has subscribed so we will give it another try tonight.
---
Some people just pick on aesthetics or recreate whatever they originally chose. I changed to dwarf (former human priest) and have to admit I miss the spirit.
---
Got it
---
That is entirely diffrent. They had to kill Them to get to rag. This was unintended, this is complete exploitation and in my mind the most severe Thing You can do. Perma ban all offenders on all future accounts.
---
I've seen Tauren ambush a bus, shoot everyone aboard, transport a bunch of Heroin into Texas, then free El Chapo.
---
Does anyone have a link to where we can read about the phases? Do we know when BGs will be live?
---
Weren't a bunch of streamers doing this though? Gonna be interesting to see if they ban a bunch of high profile streamers or not. I hope so... they already have a ton of advantage over the average player, abusing exploits to get even more of one shouldn't be allowed.
---
The group could have refused to help him kill the boss. People should pay attention. And that's not me behind a dick but honestly. The devs already told everybody that ninja looting is not a reportable offense.
---
Whelp, guess I'm retarded... Lol
---
Meeeaannn
---
They've literally said they are going to ban people who abused a layering exploit which allowed for boss farming in instances without re-instancing lmfao
---
Thanks, we will test it tonight it‚Äôs been a couple of days now. If it doesn‚Äôt work I will make him to submit a ticket.
---
&gt; edit: i really like the idea of a jail in wow, a place in orgri or sw where you can see a list of people banned, so we can always remember them hahaha
---
This is a beautiful idea. You can emote at them... but they can't emote back?
---
Do you not pick up cold blood as a talent?
---
The newest mass exploit was a leveling exploit in BFA which made you level much much faster than you were supposed to. Preach (WoW Youtuber and streamer) got 30 day ban for leveling characters fast in a version of the game where leveling is very very easy and not a focuspoint of the game. To be fair some of that 30 day ban also came down to the fact that he had showed the exploit on stream. 
---
Now imagine you have exploited some of the most important content in Classic which is instanced dungeons and raids... If anyone used this to get a huge advantage in the game I think the Blizzard banhammer will be hard on them.
---
Did people do this exploit? 100% yes. Was it wide spread? No, and Blizzard will quite easily be able to detect accounts who did this and look at a proper punishment (I wouldn't be surprised if we saw 90-180 day bans).
---
They can just search for players who have an unusual amount of gold or boss kills over a small period of time and hit them.
---
Some hunters spend days looking to tame this cat.
---
There were also the bans for rated PvP win trading.
---
1) Release BC content but with a greater stat demand than the original. Something that current geared end game players could start but not finish
---
2) Incentives the creation and leveling of alts by having them provide advantages to a main alt to help clear new BC content
---
3) increased number of quest lines, leveling paths and exclusive leveling content between races and classes.
---
4) profit.
---
Everything you do now is constantly improving your main and new characters keep a healthy flow of players doing early content. Leveling new characters also rewards you with a potentially different leveling experience. Current content remains a required component in the flow of gearing and leveling so players don't feel cheated.
---
Why though?  This didnt exist in vanilla did it?
---
Straight up. That‚Äôs real talk.
---
Typical Barrens chat yup
---
Blizz really only perma banned early on for exploits, since wrath and up it was mostly temp bans. Either way it‚Äôs in the ToS that exploits are bannable. These people know what they are doing and know it‚Äôs wrong. Even if they got a 3 month temp ban they might as well make a new account.
---
We will test it tonight, hopefully it got sorted like how it did for the others.

Alliance Arugal here! lvl 60 now. Got Ganked twice in STV, and once in winterspring at lvl 59.5. Mostly leveled by questing but just stayed ahead of the bulk of players to avoid ganking. Got mates who leveled at a more leisurely pace and are having no end of problems being ganked now as well. We've had to go back and run bodyguard for them just so they can hand in quests. Fun times. If its any consolation it feels a lot more balanced at 60
---
Right. You'd rather have a mechanic in the game that ruins the integrity in the game, over sitting in a q. Insane
---
Been having a blast on Incendius. About 45 - 55 horde favored

Lots of people are level 20, and the gear you get until like lvl 45+ is irrelevant at max level

RNG is a fickle thing. I got both in 2 runs back in the pserver days on my rogue.

Druids are still great at endgame - good healers if specced and geared. You bring hots, battle Rez and innervate at least.

I mean there's not much to say here except "wrong". If that were the case, PvP flags would only enable at 60. World PvP is not about having balanced fights.

Anyone gone to swamp of sorrows?

I had it in my mind that it was a lvl 50 zone.

It's because people see a father with their child at the park or something and call it "babysitting" as if you are doing the mom a favor instead of raising your child. Its undermining a father's role in raising their kid.

Rules should be clear at the beginning and not change.
---
&gt; this IS wpvp
---
As much as I support wpvp even fighting unfair 5v1 or vs lower level people ganking them at dungeon entrances and so on, this IS NOT wpvp cause wpvp is about fighting each other.
---
This IS an exploit just like glitching under the floor and killing people from underground without giving them a chance to fight back and without having to deal with the guards.
---
If its a random ass vendor standing around in an area where no guards are supposed to be - I agree with you and griefing here is the bread and butter of vanilla.
---
But again, this is not griefing its exploiting.
---
wpvp is fun and exciting if you get ganked and you have to get out of that situation or maybe keep them infight until your guild backs you up, but standing afk in an INN at a neutral HUB and getting killed because someone is able to glitch out guards -&gt; I am sorry but if you consider this as "wpvp" or "fun" you probably just are a bad pvp player and only consider these exploits fun since its the only way for you to kill someone.
---
Only 5 at 30-35... I have one at 28. I don't rush. You're playing hard no matter how you look at it.
---
Apparently also raids as well.
---
Transferring the proceeds of a bug exploit will usually up the punishment significantly. Could go from a temp ban to an outright ban.
---
&gt;Rogues easily can take on 2 mobs.
---
If they have cooldowns, sure. WIthout and it becomes dangerous.
---
&gt;Warriors tend to mostly wear leather as well.
---
Some pieces maybe, and for sure at lvl 60. But I see mostly mail wearing warriors while they are lvling, that bonus armor is also very helpful in that regard.
---
&gt;Warriors are by far the worst in leveling.
---
I still think its rogue, I've lvled both and I found rogue to be much more obnoxious due to their squishiness, while suffering from basically the same issues as warriors. 
---
The most difficult part about playing both the classes is to get a good engagement, and if you are doing yellow-lvl quest as oppose to green-lvl ones (which is the most optimal) then stealth for rogues is quite useless.
---
And the mistake a lot of warriors is that they either face-pull, or just charge into mobs and chain pull etc, as oppose to buying a gun or a bow and pulling mobs to them so they can get clean 1v1 or 1v2 vs mobs.
---
And there is no chance for a rogue to kill multiple mobs without their CDs, and until like close to 40 that spell has a 5 min CD. And at that point the warriors get their WW axe which will carry them for quite a while as well.
---
A 3 day, a 5 day, a one week, a month long, etc.
---
It doesn't matter, it's still completely ruined economies permanently with the amount of gear, mats, gold, and leveling that has been done. The only way is to wipe out the characters and all gold / items generated by their personal player ID - but it'll never happen.
---
Big dick gear for aggressively medium dick DPS!
---
Dude, everyone hates us. A lot of alliance see horde and are like "no big deal, do your thing" but undead are kill on sight. It's a hard life being undead, man. We are like the grumpy war vet because everywhere we go we get attacked.
---
Ah there he is. Hello mr. ‚ÄúITS WPVP U CRY BABIES‚Äù, im soooooooo shocked to see you commenting here. It must be exhausting to devalue every legitimate concern with balance and exploits, backed by recorded evidence, with the same exact cookie cutter response. Where do you find the time?
---
That's offensive to work filth.
---
What‚Äôs the add on to show their level in chat. That would save my shift button so much.
---
Got Ret until lvl51, so you have access to Consecration and Holy Shield. The shield alone will make up a lot of your damage.
---
Don't bother going Prot before that, it'd make an already slow grind even slower.
---
What does that have to do with this exploit lmao?
---
Which is Slam. Heroic Strike is an Auto Attack which aren‚Äôt normalized. And I don‚Äôt have a source for Hemo I just remember rogues wanting the Kazzak Mace for Hemo spec.
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy to test yourself while leveling up. Frequently your Autos crit for more than your specials despite your specials having added damage.
---
That means raids can be exploited too!
---
made like 30+ linen bags and sat in goldshire handing them out to new players. was very wholesome to hear all the excited thank yous
---
That guild was permabanned for changing the game files, not abusing a bug in the game. I dont think they will be permabanned. What I care most about is removing the ill gotten gold and loot. However, I cant see how they will remove stuff already bought and used by other players.
---
You're a fool if you think the community manager's post on the forum supersedes the license agreement.
---
The former. Its kinda redundant because if you're doing a loop it'll respawn by the time you circle. Not nearly as game breaking as Being made out.
---
I honestly think that they come with the retail mentality, where rep doesn't mean anything, you have cross server play after all. But here... It is a different story. Good luck getting into a raid later if you got bad rep amongst players. I know of one person that had to recreate and rename his character and make a new rep for himself. Since the main char had such a bad rep of stealing and bad mouthing people.
---
Get an Auctioneer mod (I use AUX). Makes life sooo much easier when selling stuff.
---
At least someone gets it.
---
yes this.    
---
reckful was their money maker a long time ago.    they banned him.   he didnt come back iirc
---
"Don't arrest me officer! Its not my fault someone just left some money in this truck and I was able to take it!"

Witch hunts are against the sub's rules. I'm seeing far too many of these.
---
its a picture of a monitor you pedantic incorrect ass.
---
Human Warrior.
---
How the hell does stealth work? In wPVP it seems like enemy players can always see me after I go invisible. I'll be walking in stealth and just get charged by a warrior and killed. Rogue btw, not druid.
---
40 54 gold
---
thanks for the input!
---
It's an absolute must not.
---
I was staring at the item for like 5 minutes trying to figure it out...
---
Questie often shows quests that are part of a later chain or quests you can't get anymore (like Breadcrumb-quests from one zone to the next). It also shows quests that aren't in the game yet (Sunken Temple class quests, Argent Dawn etc.).
---
I find it hilarious that Classic is Blizzard's anti-"Do Not Resuscitate" development program for new junior devs and aging senior devs.  This oversight is just further proof that time has elapsed Blizzard and their franchises are best to lay to rest and remember the early 2000s.
---
Yeah, and immediately have triple or more the amount of people in a zone. This will surely not cause any problems at all.
---
It was a blast!
---
The addon is Prat. But the thing is, the level isn't shown until you shift click, and then after that it does show it. but it doesn't update as they level up. I think? But it does remember the class forever.
---
I'm not sure where you're getting your assumption from. The only way I can be competitive in DPS is if I get a ravager proc with more than one mob
---
Seas proc in weapon swings, the timer helps making sure you never Hit without a seal on and practically waste a hit.
---
I'm no modern but I'm pretty sure this falls under witch hunting which is against the sub's rules.
---
I was there and it was epic
---
Better safe than sorry.
---
If you get banned in the game you die in real life.
---
Oh ok, I guess I shouldn't worry about this kinda stuff. What's the average level now? I figure 20 isn't too bad but I have no reference for where the average player is.
---
Got this on bookmark already and agree - bloody awesome!
---
That's exactly what I was saying, though. Most of Ulda is tuned for lower 40s, then they throw you a boss that a lot of those groups can't kill.
---
That sucks man, there's people like that as well as much better folk. I just did first few runs of DM/VC ever for me. I have a paladin, and the first run a sweet shield dropped and I asked warrior if I could roll against him since I need it too. He didn't say anything and I ended up winning it... still kinda hoping he wasn't upset. 
---
It really helped me though, I've ended up being tank paladin in leveling group and the next dungeon run. Still hoping I didn't offend him though.
---
You (Alliance) say ≈† 1 3 1 p and Horde will read n o y o u

This shit is against the sub's rules.
---
Well beeing aware for 15 years is "works as intended" for me
---
Also loktar ogar
---
Jerks gotta asshole because fuck it why not.
---
Essentially people were clearing to a given boss in a dungeon (often the final boss), killing that boss and using a layering exploit to more or less instantly respawn the boss for another kill.  Aside from item farming, the gold from vendoring the blues alone would make the players abusing this rich.  
---
For example, soloing Princess in Maraudon was a popular and effective method for farming gold, which required 10-15 mins to pull off.  Using the exploit, once Princess was killed the first time, you could just keep respawning and killing her without the need to re-clear.
---
N
---
How much money did you make and are you full BiS preraid geared already? :)
---
The rules laid out in the TOS and/or EULA are that using any bugs to gain an advantage is considered an exploit and is punishable up to and including the permanent banning of your account.
---
And streamers or high-profile players are not immune. Reckful received a permaban on his whole account for account sharing for Arena boosting and at the time, he we probably one of the top WoW streamers.
---
I'm getting my popcorn ready.
---
Happy cakeday
---
I hope they don't even take the fact they stream into account
---
There's no win-win solution to prevent dead realms post hype. And did you see all the queue time complainers ? Without layers those queues would have been 40+ hours long.
---
I think layers are a good compromise, hopefully they remove them in a timely fashion.
---
Blizzard fucked up and layering is a disaster. Everyone knows that.
---
The player who blatantly exploited this should be banned, no questions asked.
---
I am definitely an asshole love to gankyou
---
Nice thanks for the tips - key binded raid marks is a good shout
---
Thanks will have a watch!
---
Your server will only ever be as full as one full layer though, unless I misunderstand the system. 
---
Removing layering shouldn't increase the maximum world population, it'll just mean longer queues.
---
Interesting, on my server they go for about vendor price, so it isn't worth risking the deposit fee haha
---
Because layering is a long-term solution to the inevitable hype dying down. If you open more and more servers, it will fill the demand of population well at that moment, but when a fraction of the playerbase stays (which happens to all hyped games after their launches nowadays), many of those servers will be dead in population. Blizzard are avoiding merging servers which forces people to not keep their name usually.
---
Layering can fill the demand of just as many people as adding more servers at the benefit of merging the layers together to keep a healthy population with zero merges of realms and all players get to keep their name. A Vanilla server was capped at 3,000 players, so if a realm has multiple layers it can be up to about 9,000/12,000 players on simultaneously.
---
Right now there are 39 US servers. Blizzard said that all realms have low single digit layers (which we can assume 2-4). If we average it at about 2.5 layers worth of players per server, and there is a 3,000 players per full layer, then that is a total population of 292,500 concurrent players, which I don't doubt at all. I mean Rocket League during peak times has 200k+ players.
---
Awesome man I'm loving it too!!! :)
---
the max is 50g right, but it decreases by 5g per month to a minimum of 10g
---
Join instance.
---
Kill boss.
---
Leave party. You'll get layered.
---
Reform party with you as leader.
---
Repeat.
---
There is layering in dungeons? O.o
---
Well that doesn't determine good leveling speed when questing. Leveling speed is determined by how many quests you can chain together without spending time running from one place to the other. It is also determined by what kind of mobs you are killing which in the case of Barrens most of the time are beasts which is considered the easiest type of mob to kill for most classes.
---
Lmao you do realize they are maybe getting 15 gold a run selling drops. As for patterns or rare materials you can only charge as much as people have. Charging 1000g for a pattern doesn't magically give people enough gold to buy it. As for giving them a opportunity to run specific markets people have been doing that forever. People sitting there buying up rare alchemy recipes so they are the only ones able to sell that pot. People camping rates that drop enchanting patterns even after they already have the recipe to once again control that particular  market. As for the "damage already done" you got to either have a severe chip on your shoulder against blizzard or are completely naive to believe these guys actually made 100,000+ gold using the exploit. Ask yourself this why did he go into such detail about how to do it and not press a single little button to screenshot and add proof of his gold? Finally as for just trading to alts you do realize this is 2019 blizzard fucking tracks shady Chinese gold through countless hands and bans people who real money trade. You really don't think they have the capability to say "wait this guy gave this other guy 1000g and the first guy got banned for the exploit banned." 
---
But whatever just don't play classic if you think its ruined. Im not gonna sit here arguing with some doomsayer.
---
That's why I left..? Genius comment right here.
---
"we want classic to feel the grind again and experience the community and world!"
---
Stays in one spot and abuses a bug for 10 hrs a day
---
Because changing HWID is so hard to do?
---
Piss off spamming this comment everywhere. Layer is a good thing, abusing is not.
---
All these AOE farming mages are absolute dog shit lol
---
72 @ 38
---
For a helm that he won't even be using for  that long. like, why bother ruining your rep for something from gnomer
---
They will issue 2 week bans and won't remove any items or gold. Screenshot this post.
---
The higher lvl they are over you, they further away they can spot you.  Theyll hear the stealth sound and just hit tab to target you.
---
anyone with a half a brain cell could see the ban incoming
---
Haha 50/50 gimme break
---
Yeah they are 20g a pop on Yojamba (Horde) and boots  5g. Being a warrior, I couldn‚Äôt afford them, only just got enough for mount last night (almost level 42) after selling about 40 stacks of silk and greens from SM. Can‚Äôt afford skills though- no plate Armor for me hahaha 
---
Wish we got free mounts, we have terrible farming ability solo.
---
The mind is willing but the flesh is weak and spongey.
---
For the Horde
---
You need to be wary of swing timers so you can maximize your swings proccing your seals. You don't want to use your judgment before the swing goes off or else it's just a normal weapon swing with no chance to proc a fat seal of command.
---
what server are you on
---
Until you kill 1000 birds and want to dieü§™
---
Same for gouge
---
As an alchemist rogue, I often open trade with random people and give away free health, mana or buff pots that are extra or unneeded.
---
#IT TIME BOSS FIGHT!
---
no, it decreases to a min of 10,
---
it will go up do 50 and decreases by 5g per month down to 10g
---
if it costs 10g or less it wount decrease
---
I mean it‚Äôs well known that shamans are absolute alphas compared to paladins.
---
Can't wait for those hefty 3 day bans to roll out
---
My guild had this issue too and we made a separate channel for it.
---
How much did you just extrapolate from that comment? You seem stupid and triggered :)
---
Doubt these guys would do this. They would absolutely know it would at least be rolled back if not issued some kind of ban.
---
I am not sure what you mean. I think classic talent trees should just stay as they are.
---
Reading is hard.
---
Print screen
---
The queues wouldn't have been 40+ hours long, people would have chosen different servers. Layering doesn't affect whether there's queues or not.
---
Layers were a terrible decision. Dead realms can be merged together if it turns out to actually be a problem.
---
Dumbest ‚Äúgo back to retail‚Äù comment I‚Äôve seen. How does not being able to configure an add on make someone a retail kid and ineligible to play classic?
---
They must be noobs. I have about 8 mages on my friends list and the ahrdest part of forming an AOE group is GOING to SM from STV.
---
&gt; People need to gear up their off-spec somehow.
---
Mainspec &gt; offspec has been the general rule since vanilla.
---
I absolutely destroy just about everyone near my level on my 38 Enhancement Shaman.
---
 All it takes is one WF, Fire Nova, Warstomp, Chain Lightning, Earth Shock, Another hit then a few Lightning shield procs. 
---
Purge away everything.
---
Cool. So they‚Äôre like the majority of top ‚Äúprogression‚Äù guilds that we‚Äôre in Vanilla. Got it.
---
So there is way to see incoming heals in their API. Just makes me wonder why VuhDo do not show incoming heals in Classic even it does so on retail.
---
THE EXPLOIT CALLED LAYERING?
---
Then why did they recently nerf Demo shout? and the group xp? and layering? The game is constantly changing.
---
There must be a fuck tonne of gold going into the game for them to take notice
---
Lol that's supposed to say mod! Freaking autocorrect.
---
I've helped so many warriors and other mages for their quests! I had to help an irl friend for the whole warrior quest so I understand that they go through! Another irl friend is leveling in hillsbrad now so I go there sometimes to gank the yeti cave and I always ask on the chat. I had an alliance player helping me on my wand quest in dustwallow too. We wiped once and he came back again and helped me and we communicated with commands. It felt so nice.
---
WoW is my hobby and my responsibility is to kill wolves in Azeroth.
---
What is up with this epidemic of people not knowing how to properly take a screenshot?
---
&gt;You‚Äôll struggle getting groups as Prot Paladin.
---
No. There's 1 tank for roughly every 50 healers and every 500 dps. They'll take a target-dummy if it's prot specced.
---
I don‚Äôt understand
---
There is no such thing as a good expansion.
---
I want to go goblin ingi for pvp but im torn to go gnome ingi instead just for the mind Control Helm...so much fun on boats
---
Here. The concept is not bad, it is the oversights, unreported bugs and abusers that suck.
---
Yes!
---
Write their names andvserver here, spread it so they'll be blacklisted.
---
This kills the brain.
---
It‚Äôs fine as is for now, but what about after all the phases are done? Either they have to take it to BC or release new content. Otherwise it‚Äôs dead 100% (see: old school RuneScape playerbase numbers before and after new content).
---
&gt;Can you link me something that confirms this as an easteregg ? Possibly by blizzard.
---
[Sure, here you go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense)
---
I mean come on my dude, it's literally saying "give usss your moneeyyyyy." It's a joke. Very, very, painfully obviously a joke. And if it is an actual attempt at subliminal messaging, it's such a fucking hilariously awful attempt that it's still be a joke, just not an intentional one lol. 
---
Like can you imagine Blizzard sitting down in a room being like 
---
&gt;"Hmm, how can we get them to give us more money?"
---
&gt;"How about if we just have a sound clip saying 'give usss youurrr moneeyyyyy' playing in the background when they're dead?"
---
&gt;"Genius! We'll be rich!"
---
Like that would honestly be funnier to me than it just being an easter-egg lol.
---
&gt;its about being a AD for blizzard like how much and how easy you can get in their games. 
---
First of all, you have literally no proof they're doing this except for "Well Asmongold said 'wouldn't it be crazy if X dropped' and then it did," which is not proof, at all, of anything. That's just extremely, extremely, *extremely* flimsy speculation.
---
Even if it wasn't lol, why would Blizzard even need to do that? How would that even accomplish what you're saying? Everyone knows exactly how easy it is to get items in WoW, there are tons of fan sites that have the exact drop percentages for every item in the game. Loot in WoW is not some black-box mystery, it's been 15 years, everybody knows how loot tables work.
---
In the absence of proof, I'm really not sure why your default assumption is that this is a Blizzard conspiracy, as opposed to the scenario that...the item just dropped...because it's a 4% drop rate and that's really not insanely rare or anything lol. Getting an item with a 4% drop rate after 2 clears is lucky, but not so incredibly unbelievably lucky that a fucking conspiracy seemed more likely lol.
---
*Plus you have absolutely no proof* lol.
---
When it comes to dream dust, liberals pretty much corner the market.
---
Well population is like 60/40 and undercity is quite confusing so it's expected
---
üòÅ
---
Is this cynicism for the sake of it? I get it's cool to shit on Blizzard, but they've never been shy with handing out bans to exploiters, often in defiance of a lot of the community.
---
Yeah that will happen alot if the mobs is above your level.
---
Would not compare him to Snowden tbh. That thread was started because OP felt *bored* of the exploit. Not because he felt that it was wrong.
---
I've been wondering how the hell there are multiple robe of archmage patterns for sale..
---
Get banned nerd
---
I've literally seen farming parties on pserver
---
100% chance you're just reading left wing news sources, so yes, you're right, its not 50/50 in your little bubble.
---
To quote the License agreement from your earlier comment 
---
&gt; Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision
---
Blizzard has clearly made the decision to not ban for ninja looting, as shown in the CM‚Äôs post. 
---
License agreements are almost never absolute on the side of the company providing the service, they would never lock themselves into something.
---
What does mine say? Dude, what does mine say? Sweet! What does mine say?
---
I don‚Äôt deny that, but the guy asked for evidence of the claim, not ‚Äúplausible-sounding ideas‚Äù.
---
Could be a Nymn song? Search him on YouTube.he made old WoWsongs that were popular
---
From my memory of vanilla, warriors require specific gear from across multiple raids and expensive crafting to reach their potential.  It happens when theyre doing enough white damage to never run out of rage with enough +hit and like +20% crit.
---
This. They should 100% be perm banned.
---
I don't think you should roll need on offspec things over someone needing it for their mainspec. Doesn't make the 'reserving' any better though.
---
I fell through about a week ago in the same exact spot!
---
But it happens with mobs below my level too. I rarely fight orange level mobs.
---
I hope if people trade this abused gold to someone else to avoid losing it the other person gets banned too for being an accomplice lool
---
I know. I‚Äôm just having so much fun and I‚Äôm really worried about where they‚Äôll take it.
---
What's a good duo leveling comp? After I get my main to 60 I'm multiboxing my 2 accounts. Was thinking hunter/mage but is there another one you see as being better?
---
Dude was a bad mage, that's fair. Cant call someone a dick for pvp on a pvp server. That's the point.
---
I was in both.
---
Does this sub like asmon? He gets shit on in the retail sub, I don't see people being mad about it.
---
Well considering wpvp is mostly (99%) unfair like 2v1 or high level vs low level ganking id say there is no reason to roll pvp server just to get into that shitshow unless you are one of those people having fun killing others in unfair scenarios.
---
Other then that when battlegrounds hit its were the real pvp starts.
---
I know, i wish i was in college level math so i could understand.
---
Damn I guess I was on the wrong layer. I haven't seen much wpvp on rattlegore yet.
---
What makes you think most of the people playing Classic are like you and going to do the same things as you? That's one of the most arrogant things I've ever read.
---
I‚Äôm on board with a lot of stuff. We need to focus on finding a way to add new content without invalidating old content. Not easy but doable. What we don‚Äôt need is another loot spiral with 10 progression addons forced down our throats
---
Dear diary, I now have friends and they laughed at the funny I made.
---
As a paladin main, I commend this
---
this probably sounded a lot funnier in your head
---
&gt; World of Wahhhhhhcraft
---
If he went out of bounds fatigue would have drowned him. That's a visit to the spirit healer LOL
---
You want arenas in a game where many specs have ways to literally one shot people? No thanks. The introduction of arenas led to **significant** changes in class design just to have a semblance of balance in a very niche instanced game mode that the majority of players did not participate in.
---
generally I agree that if there's any doubt of whether something is a glitch or just a weird quirk of how the game is made, you let it slide, but if they are killing the same raid boss over and over, knowing they should be locked out, there's really no way to argue they didn't know it was a glitch or that they weren't intentionally benefiting from it
---
Same here
---
Thats not how its ever worked. If some wants it as an upgrade they need, then equip it.  Needing to sell over a party members upgrade is as what OPs showing.
---
Then you should be warned that claiming you know someone IRL while on your main account where you occasionally share IRL stuff like your tattoos... That doesn't sound like a good way to protect your identity.
---
hey guys, what addon shows the spell he is casting above the head of the enemy ? thats fuckin usefull !!
---
That's why I tank. I put my group together and don't have to worry about this kind of bullshit.
---
The clue is. If you‚Äôre gonna be a smartass you also need to fly under the radar and not show it to anyone.
---
Later Skarmtank lol
---
Respect that progress.
---
Exactly, plus it doesn‚Äôt effect all those people farming Maraudon already for 40g an hour.
---
It‚Äôs super ironic, too, how so many people who were adamant about being on a PvP server for the authentic experience have spent 90% of their /played in instances, either leveling or farming gold.
---
Just bought it last week and I‚Äôll never go back. Having the 12 buttons, plus the alternate function that turns those 12 buttons into a completely separate 12 buttons is so, so fucking convenient. I‚Äôll never hit my number bar again.
---
Quite the edge 15 year old aren't you
---
for whatever reason you people who are left side of politics, can't seem to grasp the concept that as a left winger, you're probably reading 100% biased news sources, which explains why you're so surprised when you hear alternative opinions
---
Did it end up dropping? I need to know if you got actually screwed over or if you were just calling them out on their BS
---
It simply means the realm shuts down and boots up again, to apply changes/maintenance. It saves the information of all players before the shutdown so you won't be at risk of being set back progress.
---
yes, they will come in phase 2 or 3 iirc.
---
they were allways meant as catchup mechanics
---
Ahh there‚Äôs me!
---
I love playing rouge because I never get invited to groups since there‚Äôs always another rouge/dps * cries in stealth*
---
Do you have any idea how programming works? Bugs happen, cheating does just *happen*, its something you do. If people get banned they have no right to complain, as if they didn't know the risk.
---
Is there a solid way to make money through cooking or fishing? 
---
I burned myself out power leveling a Warlock and realised late in the game that I didn‚Äôt really enjoy the class. I switched to a Mage, and I‚Äôve gone the opposite direction‚ÄîI‚Äôm just barely level 22, and I‚Äôve slowed right down and focussed on my professions. As a result, I‚Äôm approaching 225 for both my primary professions (Tailoring / Skinning) and Cooking / Fishing. 
---
My question is whether there‚Äôs a reliable way to take advantage of my reasonably high secondary profession levels to make some gold for my mount?

If you want character power progression beyond that there‚Äôs allready a version of the game for that. Comes with loads of cool expansions that show how great 15 years of power progression work.
---
Which is funny because the fang set is for shamans and druids.
---
Sounds like something a server desperate for more players would say.
---
You ain't fooling me
---
Wait until honor kills are a thing.
---
But layering is confirmed to be getting removed though right? I thought the realm pop reduction last week and the free server transfers were in preparation for that.
---
these are from sulf and you‚Äôd just be here bitching up an absolute storm if you had to sit in a 15,000 person queue every night, let‚Äôs be real
---
tripple boxing ret pallies rn, and I typically kill people  7-9 levels above me relatively easily, or people my level almost immediately after my burst, it's fun af.

---
Skip bc and go to wotlk
---
Woah, this is fucking insane... How this goes beyond Blizzard's noses is what I wonder, it's just about time until everyone knows about this and exploits it.
---
Well hopefully if they do go the classic+ route they would take player feedback like Jagex has done with RS (70% or more yes votes for content to pass I believe). I think that would work out fine as long as they keep the core elements of classic intact (open world feeling, adventure). The problem with retail isn‚Äôt in the content they released I would say (although some of the new lore is sloppy at best..) but with the amount of streamlining that takes the open world feeling away.
---
I agree 100%, I lost a lot of motivation with all the layering exploitation.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It makes me sad people didn't know this
---
It used to teleport you to your HS location and put your HS on a new 60 min cooldown, but has been altered since. Also required to be suck between places to be used, iirc.
---
You‚Äôre just going down the line commenting the same things you sound uber neckbeard dude
---
the economy is already trashed from layering abuse, hate to say it but this game is already dead.
---
I think a lot of streamer and YouTuber will be banned soon.
---
Blizzard already stated that classic is staying classic, if they were to do any time locked it would be on specific servers.
---
In lowbie dungeons like RFK nobody is offspec for anything they can use.
---
We had 1600+ Horde today during peak hours. I'd like to push it to a high population server, but the population already exceed the estimated cap of servers back in Vanilla. So, it's really whatever. Just letting people know that the "dead server" thing is bull shit.
---
My toon on Heartseeker isn't even close to what it was on Kurinnaxx, so I could jump ship anytime back and already have more progress than I have on the new server. I'm not one of the people that transferred over.
---
Oof
---
It is well known by most it will take up to 72hrs to lose the lock for starter editions. The payment has to fully process and that is on the banks. It is likely to prevent spammers from subbing and trading gold for money then reversing payment.
---
Sub access is given immediately to prevent players not being able to play (since classic and lv 21+ on retail servers needs a sub)
---
&gt;causing inflation at unnatural rates
---
An over abundance of supply would cause deflation, not inflation.
---
Blizz already debunked the myth that people are collecting thousands of materials from this exploit. They didn't say it doesn't happen, but they did confirm that nothing on the claimed scale has happened, and that punishments were ready if it did.
---
Layer hopping was never in dispute. It was a known fact. But exploiting it to gain economy breaking amounts of materials is just a myth.
---
Asmon is basically balding Hitler according to /r/classicwow
---
And no, there's absolutely no proof Asmon exploited this.
---
Thats the main reason i always buff arcane intellect so things like this don't happen ...
---
Those guards were no joke lol
---
Thank you for your help!  
---
Sadly he didn't make the song I'm looking for. I appreciate your help a lot tho!
---
CharacterNotes
---
I‚Äôm honestly thinking of taking the server swap just to BS from a current guild. They got 430 members all in a rush to hit lvl 60 for limited content yet rarely help out the lower lvled members. Even go as far as to say it‚Äôs selfish to ask for help since it takes up their time.
---
How is this any different than any other intentional layer hop other than how impactful it is?
---
Guy I grouped with for UBRS last night said he had a macro saying that Dal'rend pieces were on reserve. Only problem is, that wasn't the case at all. That was not a part of the ad I saw in LFG to the best of my memory. Wanted to group with them again tonight but, after seeing that, fuck that guy.
---
Twitch banned Kungen for using inappropriate language, and while he is nowhere as big as Asmon, he still has quite a big name from back in the day, right...
---
Put some bids on a few items today and as soon as one went from medium to short I yelled out "And it was on SHORT!"
---
The biggest thing for me is flying mounts. I just want to actually see people on the ground man
---
This is why realm forums were so important back in the day, and still are. Post his name, and with screenshot and he should get blacklisted. Most serious raiding guilds won't pick up someone with this kind of history for any reason. If he continues this behavior he will gain a reputation on the server no doubt.
---
On a side note: This is why name changes and mass realm transfers ruined retail. Your server reputation used to be permanent. That was for the better. People took their online presence more seriously.
---
Wait how the fuck are mafias forming when layering exists? I‚Äôm genuinely curious.
---
I don't think my server is screwed cause of it. They should still be banned for being willing to cheat.
---
#NoChanges
---
All mobs have a chance to break CC. The chance is modified depending on level and mob resistance levels.
---
And like an actual permanent ban none of this 30 day shit.
---
Weird take. You just contradicted yourself. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the world of Warcraft‚Äù as if the world just stops. That‚Äôs the whole point. It‚Äôs an ongoing world. You‚Äôre thinking of something like ‚Äúthe story of Warcraft‚Äù where there could be a stopping point. But like you said. This is World of Warcraft, and the storylines will continue just as the world does.
---
While a lot of gold was farmed and pumped into the economy by a small amount of players from this it will be nothing compared to what would be in rotation in a month or two from normal play. The wealth of thousands of players far surpasses what this fraction of a percent will have earned. 
---
It will equalise and currently the economy is so out of whack anyway just due to everything being new. 
---
With blizzard taking measures where they can things will be fine. 
---
Everyone screaming it‚Äôs the end of days every time some new issue comes up is getting ridiculous.
---
Hope blizzard bans all these exploit abusers.
---
Perhaps Blizzard should take the 30 minutes to get together and sit down and examine what other ramifications this might have from a technical perspective. 
---
Honestly part of the reason this doesn‚Äôt sit well with me is that this gives powerlevelers the advantage. Exploit, then fix the issues without consequence before most people have the ability to take advantage. 
---
Their comments about examining layer exploited accounts are garbage too. There is a guy advertising in trade on my server with 300 stacks of devilsaur. You don‚Äôt get that high without layering exploits.
---
Pally can just dispel them all anyway... no bubble required.
---
The charm is gone.
---
The warm hearted nostalgia has faded.
---
WoW Classic is just a game again.
---
I have already noticed my runs becoming insanely toxic. This is the other side of the coin. A more community based game will breed as many asshats as it does decent people.
---
Now as everyone reaches 35+ the magic and joy of those first few days will subside. WoW Classic will fall victim to petty tryhards and impatient children.
---
WoW didn‚Äôt change. The players did.
---
I was Watts (dwarf paladin) on Dragonmaw alliance but I don't remember your name.  It's still cool to see this thread and read other player and guild names that I recognize from the good ol' days.  I played from launch right up until the end of wotlk when I had enough.
---
I played constantly but was pretty quiet.  Kept a handful of [screenshots](https://imgur.com/fLXOdkl) as souvenirs.  My favorite memory was when I got to do [zul'aman bear runs with some War Storm guys.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kJ3IM6WPcw)
---
I'm playing classic on Rattlegore now.  Anyway, thanks for the thread.  Dmaw forever!
---
Unless they changed it, mages will be 1, rogues will be 2, and fury will be 3 all the way to end game Naxx. Just look up Vanilla WoW progress charts. Warriors got a buff in Naxx that put them at the top.
---
Hmm. Very interesting stuff. I've gone full into the prot tree, and usually stay in defensive the whole time. Well, except on pulls. If i can charge pull safely, I will and drop a Tclap or mocking, and then swap to  defensive. But once things start, I seem to hold threat pretty well just using shield block, revenge, demo shout, sunder and taunt. Of course, have to pay attention to what mobs are being hit by my group. I started off by marking skulls, but decided just to let it be more controlled, to force me to be more attentive and reactive.
---
It feels like it's a waste to swap stances, but that's probably because I'm not talented to keep rage when I do. Thanks for the tips, gonna give it some serious thought.
---
As opposed to what? New people in the guild never getting gear?
---
the game would be literally unplayable without layering
---
Someone ran by right as the mobs on one of these escorts spawned and they all aggroed onto him as he ran away.  Chicken goes along without a care in the world as the mobs reset and ran past back to their gather location.  Love when happy circumstances like that happen.
---
Maybe your using a lower rank frost nova still?
---
when i look into the realm list i always see pop low on the new german realm
---
this is like one of those dystopian futures where the mysterious group pretends to be all super nice but then it turns out they're luring people in to eat them.
---
Yeah, because he's going to be sitting there documenting their every exploit just to try and satisfy your request.
---
Gotta be an ally. Gamers are the worst :)
---
Another dragon came after this was pretty easy to kill tho
---
Lmao you are getting really defensive over stupid shit online
---
Acting like Blizzard has the man-power to enforce any discipline is like acting like loot-trading and right click reporting aren't in the game.
---
&gt; I still think most of the time they dont hand out harsh enough punishments and its usually better to take advantage of the exploits as long as its not completely game breaking. The 10 man xp bug, demo shout bug, and layer hopping with no CDs are good examples from classic already.
---
The difference is whether they can determine intent. 
---
A player can't be expected to know the rates of 10-man exp vs. 5-man. You were getting less exp in a 10-man than a 5-man, so there's no way players should know that they're exploiting. 
---
Same with the demo shout bug. How is joe blow supposed to know how much threat demo shout produces? Everyone is just going to say 'wow, demo shout is great for threat' and move on. 
---
Blizzard has actually been pretty consistent with their stance on bug abuse. 
---
If you had to go out of your way to do something that you wouldn't do as a course of normal gameplay, you're probably going to a catch a ban for it.
---
So you have nothing allright i hoped for someone proving me false.
---
So far i got something and you got nothing.
---
Lol, they are aware. And they will be rolling out fixes and punish people who have exploited it.
---
Hopefully "appropriate punitive measures" actually means something. Sick of people getting slapped on the wrist when they know they crossed a line
---
Here comes the "but but, if it's in the game, it's okay" 
---
or this gem from the link
---
"you're punishing people for using bugs you didn't fix?"
---
Do people actually have a brain? It's not rocket science to understand when using a bug will cross the line of abuse that actually has consequences and affects major things, like the economy of the game.
---
So hopefully they get their shit taken away at the very least.
---
I can't tell if youre a shit poster or just stupid
---
Now please find the guilds that did this and ban them.
---
NTA for asking. If you‚Äôre busy enough this derails you and you feel you should be compensated then I see no harm.
---
And the first thing I thought about was not any gear, but the Baron mount, lol
---
Killing you in wPvP is not griefing... it is not against the rules...
---
You just went through my post history? How sad are you mate? And for the record I've never actually met him irl. Online irl friend, or whatever.
---
Both. End game and raiding usually isn‚Äôt a priority for RPers. Some may be focused on leveling, but there‚Äôs a reason we picked an RP realm vs a normal one. If the average player plays 4 hours a night, an RPer might spend some of those or a whole evening RPing instead of leveling.
---
Still using rank 1. I've been told it's pointless to buy higher ranks because the stun duration is the same and the dmg doesn't matter that much.
---
"broken economy" lol
---
I hope they do but I doubt they will.
---
None of that has anything to do with why people don't want to be left behind. They dont want to be left behind because, as you pointed out, WoW is an MMO. If everyone is doing level 60 content and you're level 20, you cant play with them and are relegated to playing a fairly tedious single player game instead.
---
This is not fun.
---
They just try turning it off and on again
---
I'm on Firemaw, we have at least 75k characters total on the server now, higher than level 5. I've run into one person again that I've set as KOS.
---
Let‚Äôs just say they probably aren‚Äôt in Geometry
---
I wouldnt know lol I don't keep up with asmon
---
Hello im WoW police i'll make sure the community knows who this is
---
It would be nigh on stupid NOT TO.
---
Why? because the typical blizz approach to exploits like these is a slap on the wrist AT WORST.
---
Every exploit that comes out, be it infinitely mineable mobs etc a huge number of people get away free, and a few get negligible bans. Maybe 3 days, a week.
---
It's almost always worth it to just take the hit with blizzard. And usually you don't take a hit at all.
---
I've been playing since launch (currently 44), and have joined a guild where I've become an officer. 
---
A friend group that i play with almost every week have decided to start playing again, however on a different server and different faction.
---
I'm torn between continuing on my main or start over with my friends, because that'll obviously be super fun. 
---
What are your guys thoughts?
---
As you can see in the pic he got kicked after calling out the party leader. So we do not know if it dropped.
---
oNlY pRiVaTe SeRvErS hAvE tHeSe BuGs
---
Yeah kinda? The etiquette is either you advertise yourself as a tank for pay or let them offer.
---
I don't think it really matters much, pretty nebulous since they are the ones that randomly whispered you.
---
How do you know this? Exploiting this bug is against their rules and are punishable.
---
Move all the exploiters to the same server.
---
You can still reset and do it again a few times in a row, -in the same layer-. This should only hinder you if you layerabused a dungeon, which it does not sound like you did. Afaik.
---
Always wondered if that's what it would be like to play Alliance.  Basically some neckbeard taking candy from kids.
---
No kidding. I feel like my group is always waiting for me as I drink for the thousandth time so I can spam frostbolt some more.
---
i died xd
---
Yup and they deserve to be that because they pour an incredible amount of time into the game. Some hate them out of jealousy I suppose. I deeply respect their achievements, just not their behaviour.
---
I mean in sure its too late now but you could have scrolled up and took a screenshot made a reddit post about it and give ppl the link proving you didnt ninja it. Now you gotta just explain what really happened and hope with time things die down. In the future it never hurts to ask if the group is cool if you roll on like off spec gear.
---
You opinion is that offensive names are a nonissue, and you're bitter at people who report them.
---
I know you're gonna deny, deny, deny, because you think it makes you sound clever to go "No, I never *actually* said that," and defending that position like it's an argument. Then proceed to never actually *state* your opinion because then you'd be caught out. 
---
It's nobody's fault but yours that nuance and self-confidence escapes you.
---
https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17624482493
---
Here are people talking about "safe spots" and how repeat offenders have been banned. But you're right, it's completely allowed.
---
People are already ninjaing and snaking stuff at high level. Trying to kill the ungoro devilsaurs is a hilarious mix of world pvp tied in with scumlords on your own faction just running up and standing next to the body waiting for you to loot it. I let a couple just rot on the ground rather than give someone else the opportunity to steal the skin if they didn‚Äôt put in any work on the mob.
---
Even if I had a shield, I wouldn't use it. I don't want to use a shield. I want to smash shit with my two axes. Because I am a Fury warrior.
---
Because it has a larger impact than switching a layer because you're getting ganked. This allows people to farm useful items in higher level dungeons 4 manning it. It also seemingly has an effect in raids as it happened to Esfand as he was picking people up, previously killed bosses respawned.
---
No doubt it will be fixed soon, but it is a comical mistake to slip through the cracks for a behemoth like blizz.
---
Eh, someone posted asmod stream where he was reading the forum post from a guy who was saying he did this. How to do it and that he already had over 10k gold. He didnt do it alone. People already complaining about higher pop servers having crazy economies. And chances are there have been people doing this for a couple of weeks now. So hopefully banning those people who have massive amounts of gold will bring stuff back in line a bit. Right now 10k gold is an insane amount.
---
Not op but that‚Äôs your own redefinition. 
---
His interpretation is that they are incapable of taking player feedback seriously.
---
Highly unique? What situations is it THAT much useful over a 1.2 AS pet that justifies its time investment? If you‚Äôre running by it sure, grab it, but it‚Äôs overrated and not worth the camp.
---
It's always a male undead
---
\&gt; other than how impactful it is?
---
I agree that changing loot options is a grey area but it's not like it didn't notify the entire group. I don't know if it'll still take effect to the fight in progress but a way to curb it would be to make it so any loot changes don't take affect on anything currently agro'd. But if you think about it how's it any different that need grabbing the item anyways if you were gonna do it.
---
Lol the servers are massive, they will never see each other, no one will ever face consequences for their actions.
---
Server KOS and blacklists are meaningless when servers are quadruple the size they were 15 years ago.
---
WoW Classic is on route to be the most toxic version of WoW ever created.
---
You really think that this reddit thread and this one guy claiming a KoS list will actually have any impact on these players?
---
They will never run into each other. No asshole will ever face a consequence. I‚Äôm legit scared of the toxicity that is going to come once a ton of people are max level.
---
Honestly I may call it quits before i even hit 50. Ive had such horrific people in my SM runs...SM!!! Like dear lord.
---
I keep hearing that. And probably should, as I'm currently not training myself to swap stances often (because I lose rage when I do).
---
Why not? You can control multiple layers fairly easy and devilsaur on my server is worth 19g each.
---
Too late.
---
This is so much easier to handle. Simply don‚Äôt invite another 2 hander class. I‚Äôve literally had zero issues as a tank warrior

---
Back in Cata they ruined the world first race for the final raid of the expansion by banning all the top guilds for exploiting an LFR glitch that allowed them to get fully geared in one week
---
I got a ring in 'ere last night
---
Alrighty you stick to that story, I'll stick to the data from 85 guilds that have been raiding in Classic for the last 3 weeks.
---
I think "thebigone" is trying to compensate for something else
---
It‚Äôs fine, we still have the people praying for the apocalypse. Apparently ‚Äúit‚Äôs already ruined the economy‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm quitting because other people cheated and ruined my game and it‚Äôs all blizzards fault not the players‚Äù ‚Äúalso layering‚Äù
---
No.
---
Yeah I had a holy pally today need bis ring from mara for his "dps spec". He also needed the 2h mace that dropped from princess, and the shield from goblin... all in one run... needless to say I didn't run anymore with him.
---
Because it was posted an hour ago while the original post six hours ago. It is also currently the 4th highest post as well.
---
Use brain lol
---
meh, i wouldn't expect anything less than this honestly, this is by far some of the lesser idiocracy i've seen while playing this game so far
---
even if i gave him a click i wouldnt have macros. fuck is the point of beggin for views for a shit video when the video is useless
---
Try farm an item like ironfoe without reserve. 
---
It‚Äôs fine to reserve an item But ofc not like those asahats did it. But make it clear in the LFM post so no one wastes their time..
---
Preach! I got a 7 month and a 2 year old and I‚Äôm making progress !
---
I keep coming across the same few ally that decided to gang bang a friend and I 2v5. 
---
We took 4 down with us, but they have remained KoS ever since. I've even chased a few down across zones to kill. 
---
I'm cool jumping someone 1v1 2v2 etc even at low hp or mana. That's fine but when you bring a 5 man party to kill 2 people minding their own business and then proceed to camp them. I draw the line there. Just fucking rude lol.
---
Remember the theory that Blizzard was DDoSing itself to reduce players in queue?
---
Thank god you're here to let me know how seriously I should take something in my life. Is it alright if I send you a list of my favorite bands and you can tell me which ones are okay to enjoy also?
---
You are going to get a ban now, read Blizzards statement on abusing this.
---
People warned of this, they got downvoted really bad by the vast majority here.  Smart players.
---
People are claiming they have thousands of gold due to this, I really hope they get that taken away cuz that ain‚Äôt fair. Also across some guilds, claim to have +100,000 gold
---
Ok, its early i cant read correctly, great.
---
And my axe!
---
More current now than ever.
---
Shoot, you prolly won‚Äôt replace it until like near 50 honestly. Looking forward to leveling my warrior and getting it at 30 as well
---
Those people are losers, in the game and in life.
---
Happened to us Ally on Skeram at Tarren Mill. The only times we got routed was because of guards.
---
Fun fact, you can kite TM Guards to SS and SS Guards don't do anything.

Not nice

Looking forward to your next blog update üëç
---
20-40 is a shithole to level. 3/4 full groups fighting for mobs constantly... I don‚Äôt want to be forced to run instances all day, so layering is absolutely needed for now.

Wow. That would be perfect.

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it seems to be a poll.

---
Damage gear is good gear for both PvE and PvP. In PvP, you need 4% hit as opposed to 9%, meaning you can sacrifice some pieces of gear to boost your stamina for longer survivability.
---
Armor doesn't matter - use crit-hit-agility-stamina gear. 
---
Entrapmen procs when the trap activates. Entrapment is a good talent for PvP for sure.
---
The servers aren‚Äôt expensive. They just want to avoid letting servers die. Sure you can merge and transfer, but first you‚Äôve got dead servers.
---
I just.... Jizzed in my pants.
---
So this is why mobs spawn when someone leaves my dungeon group after completing.
---
Thats just random people talking, it literally doesn't prove anything. Also the recent fixes to demo shout and whatnot has nothing to do with this. You are comparing apples and oranges.
---
imagine posting this on reddit
---
So could you have just finished the fight and Need on it anyway? Or will getting kicked before the roll finishes result in getting nothing? I can't remember.
---
The name is perfect for your picture.
---
Scum are like this, remember their names. If we all stick together against the ninjas we might survive.
---
Why would they ban someone for using mechanics they wrote into the game?
---
Rip classic
---
No, that's about right for the classic experience.
---
They thought they wanted it, but they didn't. 
---
MC being crushed in the first week in 1 pull with people at level 56 has been the highlight for me after being told for years classic was difficult. 
---
Blizzard have already had to ban addons for LFR.
---
lol.
---
Some jerk off was bragging about selling 17 Robe of the Archmage patterns to me when I was trying to buy from him for less than he wanted. Enjoy the ban homie.
---
Take your time. Explorer, level profession and talk to People. Spent an hour giving free bags to The good folks in Mulgore and chattin. NO rush for me. My friends are 60 and bored.

I've had naga, g600, and a scimitar.
---
Most comfortable is the scimitar to me. Least comfortable is the g600.
---
Just with the g600 the third mouse button just feels unnatural.
---
The scimitar is really nice, but no left/right on the middle scroll wheel and the has a adjustable keypad location if it doesn't suit your location you can move it.
---
Yes, living such a sad life I can spend two minutes in the bathroom in the morning both sating my curiosity and warning a person who might possibly not be aware of how much personal data they leave for public to see (which is quite common nowadays, with all the social media everywhere).

---
Armor type doesn‚Äôt matter for any dps class in the game. Meaning even warriors will wear leather. Hunters/Warriors/Rogues pre raid bis for pve is Devilsaur Set. You want to get at least +7% hit chance either through gear or talents like the one in Survival.
---
Entrapment is alright in PvP and yes it is based off every tick. Although for PvP I prefer the snare with Wing Clip or the HP talent in Survival.
---
There is a post for this

It's a serious problem but I don't think he should be showing the exploit live on stream, could end up biting him in the ass
---
Some of these exist already, but...
---
Gnome Priest or Gnome Paladin
---
Tauren Rogue
---
Dwarf Shaman
---
Orc Druid
---
Undead Paladin
---
Wrong. It will advance the economy by a few days at *worst*.
---
Let's say you have 10 guilds full clearing MC and abusing the layer glitch, all using 10 layers to do so (those numbers are extremely high - most servers have 2 or 3 guilds doing MC and some servers have 1 or 2 layers while others, like Stalagg, have like 6)
---
That's 100 MC clears worth of BoEs, gold, blues, etc.
---
In 6 months time we will have hundreds of guilds full clearing MC every week.
---
This will not impact the economy. It will give bleeding edge guilds a slight advantage when entering BWL, but even then not by much. As Blizzard has already stated [people will be getting punished](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295114/repeat-instance-exploit-to-be-fixed-and-blizzard-issuing-punishments) for this abuse. I expect, at the very least, item removal but probably also bans.
---
But let's assume they get to keep all their gear, are not banned, and are able to get an advantage on entering BWL for world/server first. Where does that leave you? 2-3 MC clears ahead of the next guild that didn't abuse it? 3-4 months in most guilds will be DEing purples.
---
The effect this has on the econom/raiding scene is completely negligent. Calm down.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2njb5/rooftop_camping_vanilla_response/
---
there is a blue post talking about it, it's bannable. 
---
My demo shout changes are talking about "works as intended" comment. If it worked as intended, why'd they change it? It was how it worked in vanilla, but now they're changing it for classic. The point is, no matter how it works NOW, it may not be how it's intended to work. Just because it CAN work, doesn't mean it's how it SHOULD work
---
Well, obviously they are now. Not everybody knew about the exploit. I've sniped items in the AH, because people misjudged their value. I wouldn't have known if somebody had duped these items or not.
---
Honestly this is 100% wrong and the root of the whole argument. 
---
I think of something like a huge class specific upgrade. 
---
Gold value doesn‚Äôt compare to personal equipment needs. 
---
The only reason your argument even has traction right now is because there are a bunch of players scrounging up gold for mounts.
---
If I remember correctly, those items are added later in one of the phases
---
The second mob was like a little babby compared to the Tree Weaver, which had an AOE stun that would stun/damage everything and everybody around it- at the same time healing itself every second.
---
Bdf
---
Noticed how they are only REACTING to huge problems with the game. They didnt put any reasonable things into place BEFORE launch. They are LITERALLY waiting for people to find how to fuck up the game the worst, let it go on untill it leaks to reddit/youtube videos.
---
THEN they take their head up from their asses and go, oh yeah, that might be a thing. And im sure they wont do ANYTHING to the people that abused this to hell and back. 
---
Blizzards own old saying, "clever use of game mechanics". Everyone that didnt abuse layering, get bent.
---
Yes. They are. SoJ drops, everyone should need. The 200g is worth way more than the few levels of utility anyone would get out of it.
---
This is my experience as well sadly.
---
Even before hitting the lockout, xp/hr was lower in a 10 man.  It would be even worse if we were pulling EVERY mob instead of just the most efficient pulls.
---
Blizz already denied the whole "thousands of Arcane Crystals through layering" story. They would take action against someone who did that. But the fact is that at most someone would get triple the amount of ACs they would normally get. This is assuming that they weren't taken in the other layers.
---
People who are abusing this heavily will be punished and probably stripped of what they got if they exploited to get super rare items (Ironfoe,...etc). And people just stumbling on it won't make any difference in the long term.
---
I was once thrown out of a group because I stole the mobs with pickpocketing during the dungeon. The reason was that "it's unfair for the other players who can't"...
---
What I'm trying to say is just put them on ignore and your world (of warcraft) is a little cleaner. It's not worth it if you're upset about such idiots for a long time.
---
I've always been able to do wpvp and bgs back in the day on a pve server..PvP servers just hit me wrong due to over zealous alliance or horde fucking with people while they try to level, taking the time to harass others for Hours..PvP is great..but getting to play and enjoy your time is better imo
---
For the uninitiated, cheating as described by the WoW EULA:
---
&gt; methods not expressly authorized by Blizzard, influencing and/or facilitating the gameplay, including exploits of any in-game bugs, and thereby granting you and/or any other user an advantage over other players not using such methods.
---
Wtf in with that btw?  I have known a few horse people in my life and they're all nuts
---
Dude. That was me today. I was so relieved when it was finally over. Worst part about it was all the mod 50s people doing In Dreams and spawning that damn boss.
---
I forgot about the rivendare thing damn. Can't remember if I got it in my current main legit or if I did it on my old perma banned account (different exploit) haha
---
'Soon'. They promised to turn it off before phase 2. Phase one could last 3 or 4 months.
---
Like how Athene got the clear from a GM in wrath? That has never worked and probably never will.
---
!remindme 1 week
---
/r/rareinsults
---
Its just weird to me that the experience seemed better on private servers. Sure there was wait times for mobs but every one was just so pumped to play.
---
My shaman just lost a Need roll on [Horns of Eranikus](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10833/horns-of-eranikus) to a hunter last night.
---
I am pretty sure that unless the content will be able to be monetised heavily, you will not get new stuff for Vanilla. Why would Blizzard spend workforce and millions of dollars to develop fresh content for game where the only financial gain is monthly sub, which is also shared with current game?
---
Once majority gets bored, the logical move is to move on TBC for them, will cost next to nothing. I'd love to be proven wrong, but I am willing to bet it is not happening.
---
Ended up with 99g 34s and had a 10g discount which left me with 9g. Sold some stuff, trained, and traded for 2 runecloth bags which I now have 4 silver and a handful of copper.
---
That's not the same at all. Ironfoe is and always should be a reserve item unless no one goes into the group expecting it to drop. If you're a warrior or rogue and you're making a BRD group you always reserve it, it's simply a false equivalence
---
If the talent works only every other shapeshift, I'd do a bug report on it.
---
How did it get to orgrimmar?
---
Cheating as described by the WoW EULA:
---
I reject your hypothesis
---
It's the second layer down lol
---
I come from Everquest and I have never seen so many greedy assholes when it comes to grouping. Not saying everyone is like that though.
---
Spineless cowards. What‚Äôs that sweet xp/level counter add on?
---
\*without more servers
---
Literally the only concern with having "dead servers" down the road is having to merge/transfer. WHICH ALREADY IS BEING DONE
---
This private server garbage has to be ignored or even banned.
---
This is why you tell everyone in lfg and trade. So that they all block them or add them to their blacklist. After a while they'll be forced to move to another server if they even can. There's a very small amount of level 60s around now it's not a good idea to burn bridges like this.
---
Yo I got you
---
Some people in the crowd were of a high level but had an alternate set of roleplay armor.
---
&gt; Also reminder: private servers could hold 6k people at a time on a $200 a month server. 
---
Yes, but can the in game resources handle 10-12 000 people? that is the key here, not what the server can hold. Let's say that a super-computer can hold 200 000 players in one layer. What do you expect would happen in that world? 
---
I dislike layering as much as the next guy, but people need to understand it's not the technology, it's the in-game resources that prevents them from removing it. So, when you see "free migration" from this server, click yes! You will then play an active role in creating a healthy number on each server, which will speed up the 1 layer pr server process.
---
Frenzy brings BT attack speed to .77 , but brings a 2.0 attack speed pet down to 1.54. With the 2.0 attack speed pet hitting twice as hard , also benefiting twice as much from frenzy, BT is awful for PvE. He‚Äôs just for PvP.
---
All I want is tbc to drop sooner or later. Don‚Äòt get me wrong I love vanilla and spend a good amount of time in there. But the when I had the most fun playing was on my dreanei shamy. I just loved juwelier so much and the tbc style fit my taste the best. Blue space goats fighting in purple battleships against evel wizards. That was the thing I loved the most. Hope they bring it back on different (!!) servers so the classic ones wont get demolished
---
You're missing the point there. It's a play on Classic vs Retail in that with retail, a heavy majority of progression takes place in instanced dungeons, raids, and phased zones that break the cohesive nature of world when compared to classic.
---
Frozen Dawn Represent!
---
Why would you do that? Because you went Aldor bitch
---
what server and character names? easy to blacklist them now
---
Yeah you have to force yourself, muscle memory can be a bitch. But you get so used to it after just a couple of days, I can't even imagine going back to just a keyboard.
---
If it still works, stop doing it. You will likely face the same punishment others are going to be getting. 
---
Just because a exploit is abused in a different way doesn‚Äôt make it a different exploit.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve farmed mobs to make a quest guy spawn for twenty or so minutes while some guy afk‚Äôd in a safe spot near me and tagged the quest mob as soon as it spawned so I had to do it again. He didn‚Äôt even party invite so that we could both do it lol.
---
I‚Äôve remembered his name and guild so that I can watch them die whenever the opportunity presents.
---
Bruh üòÇ
---
Thats a good trade off tho. Once i bought mine i trained alot of skills still got 17g
---
your idea of tolerance seems very intolerant to me
---
geeze, devilsaur is down to 5g on mine lol
---
Or go with gnome engineering for the net. That's how I finish them off. Nifty Stopwatch is also pretty nice.
---
Random people joined together in order to down a hard to solo boss, and instead of fairly distributing the loot it dropped, a person swooped in, changed the looting system to "master looter" and assigned the loot to himself, for then to say the item was reserved to him, even though no such arrangement was agreed upon at the beginning of the run.  
---
So the guy who posted this spent probably a good ¬Ω-2 hours with the group thinking he had equal chances at getting the loot as everyone else, when infact the group leader simply stole the item, without him having a chance to do anything about it.
---
BUT THAT'S NOT THE REAL CLASSIC!!!!!!!1111one1111
---
They are just lucky. After 20th run i just lost faith and moved on.
---
The damage is normalized, so they're doing the exact same dps.
---
The beta testers, "you", were really awful indeed.
---
Is there a functioning kos addon? Tried vanas, but it throws a bunch of errors due to not having a classic compatible version.
---
This is an bug that clearly was not intended and the level of advantage gained from abusing this exploit is enormous. This bug is only exploitable if you have an awareness and understanding of how layering works, and if you understand that you would know why layering is in the game in the first place. No one who abuses this mechanic is ignorant that this is an exploit.
---
Blizzard have a pretty well documented history of banning people for abusing exploits like this.
---
I'm not a priest. Priests aren't the only healers and they can't even use axes so I'm not sure where you're getting that from. I'm a paladin, but I could just as easily have been a shaman (the two healing classes who use 2h axes).
---
Not sure how I'm the jerk for rolling on a dps upgrade when there were no dps twohanded users in the group, but ok.
---
Also think the servers are to big now for the word to go around like it used to
---
It's not the tech that cant handle it, it's the fact that having 900 people doing the same quest at the same time would be awful, but splitting it to 200 is only kinda bad.  Some quests, even with layering and dynamic respawn, have been awful to complete due to crowding.  Having 3-4x more people waiting for that one named respawn would be bad.  Dead server in 2 months would be bad.  This is the compromise.
---
Oh God the quality is getting worse
---
Grab the add on called allyroute from the twitch desktop browser. Its based off a speed run to 60 with just questing for alliance players. It will tell you where to go and what quests to ignore so your not wasting your time whilst still exploring a lot of different areas.
---
Also if you get the add on questie from the same twitch desktop platform it will mark quest locations/mobs you need to kill on the map so you arent running around looking for something as some things can be hard to find
---
Looks like you're going to get every class for an answer. My choice would be arms warrior, two charges, slow, and execution. Incredibly fun in world PvP and battleground.
---
Yeah.  Only seppos pet a dog.
---
Will be better than vendoring the cloth if you use FA or tailoring.
---
I've definitely seen poly end short many times, but I don't think i've seen nova end short - or at least it's very rare. (lvl 40 mage using rank 1).
---
The whole team was lvl 31 we got to the final boss before we were all kill by the mobs after you open the door
---
What does this mean? I already chose Elf Rogue.
---
No that‚Äôs on you...
---
This, but unironically.
---
Yeah very few people can actually farm it on mine so they are driving up prices, no mafia just big groups farming together.
---
I looked up food recipes and all the ones I saw were added in patch 2.01. Maybe I didn't find a good source of information
---
Beasters isn‚Äôt one of them right? That‚Äôs definitely not me so not even sure why I‚Äôm asking
---
What are reasons I always kill hunter pets?
---
My server is like 55:45 in favor of Horde but sometimes I see only horde, only alliance or mixed. Pretty chill folks that mostly want to quest tho, I am lvl 40. Of course if in crowded area, quest wise and one side have more ppl then they might scare away other faction. Haven't seen any corpse camping. Stonespine.
---
Yezzan &amp; Thebigone - with which guild on which server? 
---
Name and shame these shitstains
---
I played Vanilla when I was 12. Sweden
---
Literally all I did was ask for proof.  I'm sure you could have done that without being an asshole and making incorrect assumptions about me. The fact is Blizzard has a history of ignoring a lot of exploits or fixing them and not banning anyone. Hence the term exploit early, exploit often.
---
Yeah, Blizzard does tend to ban players for creativity
---
I got your back too.
---
&gt;Whatever believe what you believe in. Your just making shit up now
---
You're so...so close...so close to putting it together lol. Making shit up...kind of like...how you made shit up about Blizzard rigging loot for streamers? With no evidence? It's almost like that was the point I was trying to illustrate...
---
&gt;https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Easter_eggs
---
Haha yep, if it isn't on this fan-maintained wiki page, that's definitive proof that it isn't a joke!
---
It's like reasoning with a small child.
---
Same here. Must be some hole in the mesh or something that the charge paths through.
---
Its is best for solo in PVP servers, just have to spec to demonology abit
---
Please tell me that the Duskwood one has Stitches murdering someone.
---
blizzard wont do anything
---
they always say they will so people think its been fixed but they rarely do anything :D
---
Ohhhh brother I can‚Äôt wait to see them.
---
I can‚Äôt find any high profile streamers that used the bug in such a way as to get punished.
---
Esfan left and came back a different day and half the raid had respawned, so they messaged a GM and the GM told them they were fine. Probably so legitimate players weren‚Äôt punished since they couldn‚Äôt then kill Rag that week.
---
Skate recreated the bug to see if it worked in Gnomer, but I didn‚Äôt see him speed farming crowd pummelers.
---
Which means you were 10 when kek became a thing because of WoW.
---
yes, 3 is classic graphics
---
oh yes I will without a doubt be going engineering as soon as I can afford my mount. but alas, skinning will stay for the extra gold until then. But youre right it will feel a lot better when i got both of those and I can chase ppl down :)
---
Yup, and it is STILL a dick move. You are absolutely correct in that this person agreed to play on a PvP server. And yes the game is indeed called World of Warcraft. That person was completely within their rights to do that. They are still a dick for going after someone with almost no mana and just finished combat. It is smart to do? Oh yeah, certainly. Are they still a dick for doing that? Oh yeah, certainly.
---
Unless I‚Äôm misreading this subreddit‚Äôs rule list, I‚Äôm really glad that r/classicwow has more lax policies around naming and shaming other players. This post would have been immediately removed from r/wow because the OP didn‚Äôt censor every character name.
---
One of my most unpopular opinions is that naming and shaming should be a thing. Both Blizzard and any WoW fan communities that enforce rules against calling out other players actually protect and defend toxic behaviour like ninja looting and bullying.
---
Why? Because the most important aspect of WoW was its community. If there is no outlet to call out others for ninja looting or griefing others with evidence, then they will continue to get away with their actions. This is part of why the current version of WoW has no sense of community: The other part being that cross-realm everything and matchmaking queues remove any kind of consequence to being a dick. It‚Äôs why retail WoW has descended into probably the second most toxic video game I‚Äôve ever played, It‚Äôs definitely up there with some MOBAs.
---
I say this as somebody who was effectively bullied off of Turalyon-EU by a few really toxic guilds (Shameless, Ten Pu, The Talamasca to name a few) who were just horrible towards me. They threw offensive insults at me openly in public chat, falsely invited me to dungeon groups to use me for a summon then kicking me, telling other guilds to blacklist me on false pretences, IP blocking me on sight from guild forums meaning I couldn‚Äôt apply anywhere, etc. It got so bad that I simply stopped playing my main in late Wrath and rerolled on a different server. Heck, I actually got one of these players a 24 hour suspension after he told me to  ‚Äòdo the realm a favour‚Äô and kill myself.
---
Woah, this makes me think just how cool it would be if Blizzard does similar shorts like the ones they did with Warbringers but with some of the most memorable quests in Classic.
---
lmao this sub :D
---
sshhh don't tell them
---
And it's still not dropping!
---
Woo grob Alliance ü§òüèΩ
---
Transfer their characters to Retail
---
Unlucky. I‚Äôve had my naga chroma form about 3 years? Maybe 4, nothings failed on me yet.
---
&gt; What you just described is Exactly what i and a lot of people are interested in.
---
That's not classic WoW though. And it's not a *lot* of players. 
---
In Classic WoW, new content meant new stuff to grind. 
---
Like sure, you'll go and run a new dungeon once to experience it. You'll go through the new raid once because it's something new. 
---
But then? About 99% of players are done. 
---
There's nothing left for them to grind for, the game is over, they won. They'll either restart the game on a new character or they'll quit. 
---
Classic+ could include new tiers and new catchup tiers, ways to upgrade older tier sets, etc. 
---
Like basically another Dire Maul, another ZF, a tier between AQ40 and Naxx that has some really cool items for Naxx raiders to want, a new legendary weapon, new profession stuff to make professions a bit more relevant beyond Tier 2, etc.
---
But no gear/character power incentive with new content would mean that the new content would be dead in two weeks.
---
Dear diary,
---
So with surefooted, still need 1% more hit, then stack devilsaur for crit, ty for reply
---
The clip shows him displaying the bug, doesn‚Äôt mean he abused it. And even if he killed it that time a crowd pummeler isn‚Äôt worth a serious punishment
---
I‚Äôm all done with Dun Morogh, I just hate grinding is all. I need to get to 18 and then I‚Äôll grind out 2-3 levels in the Deadmines while trying to get items there. Thank you for your answer!
---
Ah, I thought it was done just before looting.
---
Random add-ons on top each other.
---
Just had a Warlock ninja a really good sword from me and a warrior that needed, in the same dungeon our tank left because hunter pet pulled aggro and we wiped, they started a flame battle, think I cycled through like seven party members. Didn't even manage to kill Herod lmao.
---
I'm so sad. I've seen it drop twice in pugs but a mage and huntard won them. I was so close one time. Oh well, just gotta do ubrs.
---
Install the game and pay or a sub.
---
Auctioneer does it, and brings in some other good pricing info too. (Just ignore anything it has to say about enchant values)
---
Well, while not 100% useless you're right. Its always handy to copy paste from the description than pause alt tab and rewrite them (assuming you have one monitor). But op is a view-whore, someone asks him for addon list and he replies that it will be in the next video, cause everyone wants to wait god knows how long for an upload and subscribe for only that reason.
---
Ayyyy I‚Äôm in there somewhere!!!
---
/e pets %t.
---
Guy needs all the help he can get if he's gonna feral druid tank LOL
---
Raids are even easier. ‚ÄúOh you have 20 Rag kills three weeks in. Interesting.‚Äù
---
WHO THE FUCK CARES?
---
Are the murlocs in Swamp of Sorrws bugged? Around 84/90, it's impossible to aoe farm them. They reset VERY early, after like 5 seconds, no matter how close they are to their original aggro spot. The ones lower at like 84/92 are completely fine.
---
which is another reason why nothing will happen
---
honestly it seems like 99% of the people in this sub dont know how blizzard operates
---
But it‚Äôs not just 1 group. It‚Äôs 3/4 groups if not more in the range 20-40. Add named mobs + escort npc‚Äôs...
---
This happens at the...archeological digsite(?) in darkshore too. I did that damn escort 4 times because people in my party kept accidentally accepting it before I turned in the pre quest
---
I don't think the issue here is reserving, but rather people reserving without letting other players know in advance.
---
You said it
---
That is such a pointless question lol
---
&gt;Okay so getting your BiS trinket feels nice. Wouldn't it feel better if you are always guaranteed a better one from Mythic compared to Heroic version, as a reward for doing harder content?
---
You do! I dont calculate in the insane luck you need to get a super high titan forge proc that this would not be the case.
---
Hc drops 430. Mythic drops 445. Comparing hc to mythic a +5 proc wouldnt be an upgrade. A +10 proc wouldnt be one. A +15 proc would be equal. A +20 proc would be SLIGHTLY better but they are so incredible rare that i just dont care.  
---
And btw you can also get procs in mythic content. A +5 proc in mythic is better than a +15 proc in HC.  And since i dont run HC for month anymore, i will get my procs on the mythic gear that i wear. So yes, my itemlevel will be higher than the one of an hc raider. You must be insanely lucky for it not to he the case. You must get +20 procs on pretty much evey single itemslot for it to be better than a mythic raider. And thats not gonna happen.
---
&gt;You really dont think it would be more fun without WF and TF?
---
I dont care 
---
Wouldnt it be more fun for you if raiding in classic would be rewarding in the first place?
---
This is why you play with frens peepoHappy
---
Just to play devil‚Äôs advocate here.
---
Aren‚Äôt you supposed to blur the names to prevent witchunting? Maybe that‚Äôs not a rule in this subreddit, but most other gaming communities have that.
---
I wholeheartedly agree though, If you‚Äôre a fucking prick. Be prepared to have the world see it.
---
What's KoS?
---
I'm on Bloodfang :)
---
It's been 12 years since BC came out and to this day, when I see the letters "DST" I get flashbacks of Gruul's Lair pugs forming in trade chat with DST on reserve.
---
I agree, but we have to live with what we got.
---
I think thats what the sinister strike macro is for. But on the backstab macro i think you would want to equip your previous weapon because you prolly wont have enough energy for ss.
---
Blacklisting ninja-looters and toxic asshole? I'm all for it tbh. I could care less about streamers.
---
dafuq are you talking about? a healer using a 2 handed axe?
---
you actually believe blizzard will ban streamers for it? hahahahhaa
---
hahahahaha
---
How long do you think this has been abused? Why didn't the players beta testing the game actually beta test the game?
---
Loot the dogs!!
---
As a skinner I can relate.
---
lol why yall acting like hoes?
---
That's literally not how layering works or what it's meant to combat but go off I guess
---
?
---
I am on pve server with real life mates because then we can progress and play uninterrupted with our limited time as a group and they don‚Äôt pvp much anyway. 
---
Most of my wow time I play alone and then it‚Äôs pvp server hands down. Not that I have ever pvp‚Äôed open world as my honor code forbids any non honor pvp but I want it open:)
---
this exact thing happened to me as well hahaha. same part of the boat and everything except i think they tried to leap off the boat in order to target me.
---
I don't think that's accurate.
---
Source: The guild full of 11 year olds I played with in vanilla.
---
Are you 10 mentally still? Or retarded?  I guess you are, you just wasted everyone time, i would have left
---
That doesn't make sense.
---
That's like saying shops charge you money when they ask if you want to buy, but if you ask them first everything is free.
---
Most impressive
---
It's not banning creativity, it's banning hugely abusive exploits that trivialised the game and give players massive unfair advantages. It's all in the TOS. Why play wow classic to just roll through by abusing game breaking bugs?
---
are you new?
---
APES killed my puppy!
---
That's nice and all but "I'm greedy so I press greed", isn't much of an argument. I presented the explanation of why my idea works better.
---
*Most people don‚Äôt listen to the lyrics, but they should!*
---
Maybe
---
Death IRL and a curse on their families.
---
It's just elvui
---
The rogue who used bombs on arthas right? I think he proved that it was a part of his normal rotation and that it wasn't intentional abuse.
---
Uncheck "Show quest objectives on map" checkbox in questie settings
---
IDK what it's like for other casters but as a Mage my mana pool is more than double what the highest level drink gives me. I spend most or all of my mana pool every big pull. So sorry non mana users but I need a full minute to drink up because the water is shitty.
---
Without game hacking or some shit I am of the opinion of a game developer leaves a way to do things in the game they shouldnt get mad at players for using it but fix their damn game so they cant.
---
Like those calling for the heads of people "exploiting layering". Its a feature of the game and Blizz need to fix it to limit what can be done with it.
---
Level in fury if you plan on tanking quite a bit.
---
&gt;And even when advertised before, I don't get what gives people the right to do this. Why would the party leader have any more right to a piece of gear than someone else?
---
Seems like he is questioning the whole concept of using your leverage to your advantage.
---
People seem to think that if it worked for OSRS it will work for WoW, not realizing that the games progression systems were fundamentally different from the start.
---
Ban them all.
---
Kissing our sisters
---
&gt;What you just described is Exactly what i and a lot of people are interested in. 
---
Yes, but enough people to sustain development for a decade? Not likely.
---
&gt;I can see many ways how that can be achieved.
---
Such as? Because there's a reason games don't do it. Nobody has come up with ways that actually work.
---
RFK is no different
---
Apparently if you are the one to start it he has a chance to bug out
---
Everyone else got to turn it into him except me
---
Not worth running that dungeon for an hour again just to wait for that slow MFer
---
https://progameguides.com/wow/wow-classic-phases-guide/
---
Lucrative twink items are world drops and would only be harder to get by resetting bosses
---
Why so furious?
---
some old stuff would be nice. Like that Tethyr quest chain that got added to Teramore in BC times.
---
Those groups are actually great because it's a lot easier for everyone than just not bringing certain classes. Instead of saying "LFM Need DPS no Rogues" its just reserving a specific item, so if a rogue wants to run the dungeon for whatever other reason they can still get in the group.
---
That‚Äôs a really constructive argument you have there, and not at all elitist. Maybe you should reconsider what kind of community you‚Äôre trying to foster here in classic?
---
You say this but then hunters freely want to roll on BIS weapons for warriors and rogues.
---
Tfw your addon autopicks up
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call it a bug. It‚Äôs more like a bug. It‚Äôs not on you if you just sit tight and wait for respawn, it‚Äôs on Blizzard to not enable such function/respawn to take place. The blame would be on the people if any actual steps would need to be taken
---
That's toxic AF. Sorry you had to deal with those a-holes. Seems about how mad I get when I'm in Hillsbrad getting ganked by alliance while leveling.
---
Server name?
---
Yes.
---
&gt;i got 4 black lotus in 30 minutes yesterday, that should never be possible.

Why not? For some reason somewhere deep in my mind I think I remember that people managed to do that very rarely in vanilla.
---
You are an angry, uninformed person.
---
Say I have 2 characters, different realms. Am I able to mail stuff from one another or no?
---
&gt; \-Out DPSing every other class in dungeons 99% of the time. 
---
Every Hunter in my dungeon groups were behind most of the classes in terms of dps.
---
I love ableist people, always the brightest.
---
Then Blizzard stopped allowing players to name and shame others, and such behaviour went unpunished.
---
Thats disgusting cant belive people doing this. Sorry man  i feel u l.
---
Lmao, "Guild run shitnut". Gotta get some WoW friends
---
Surprisingly accurate
---
I completely agree with that. Hate about retail all you want, the progression was done because people asked for it and I'm certain most have been reasonable. It's easy to think that the way things are now is inifinitely better, but at some point things will get boring again. To be perfectly honest, I'm already getting tired of leveling in the 30's range because it's always the same. I don't think people will stick for years when there's none or only minimal progression available.
---
Hunter here, I don't know if the palas buffing wisdom on me actually troll, but who cares :)
---
They scale very Well over the whole game.
---
Yeah those scrubs so go back to Retail if they are not satisfied.
---
You should stop paying to play their game if you believe them that incompetent.
---
Yuuup, I don't think there's any way the powers that be at actiblizz would fund new content creation for classic without having some way to monetize the fraction of classic players that would actually use it.
---
For once AAA game dev greed actually benefits me though, because this makes me feel very optimistic that we're getting BC servers next after classic phases are all done. I'm very excited for that!
---
60
---
That is not even a rare drop. The game just screwed with you hahaha
---
Yeah, one thing about Classic is you're expected to visit multiple zones in every level range beyond the 1-10 zones. So, most Alliance characters level though their teens in Westfall, Loch Modan, and Redridge (I think the quests there start at 15).
---
Night Elf players will also usually do as much of Darkshore as possible before heading to the Eastern Kingdoms but if you're not a Night Elf, it's not worth the walk.
---
Well the party organizer can have the "right" because they're organizing the group and setting the terms before the run starts. That was OPs point is that anyone can say they're reserving a piece, so long as it's made clear BEFORE the dungeon starts. If you don't like the terms, just don't run with them and put them on ignore. If you agree with the terms because maybe you don't need the specific piece (or already have it) then it might turn out to be a good group to run with especially if the organizer has been farming the dungeon a lot, and is likely very efficient at it.
---
Tank priviledge. Deal with it.
---
Btw enjoy paying gold for entry into dungeons in about two weeks when the pack starts getting level 50+ 
---
5g + greens reserved + orbs reserved + etc reserved.
---
You dumb for real. A 'gamebreaking', at least economy breaking, exploit is put to light. It's posted in a reddit regarding the actual game. People browse this reddit because they care about the game. 
---
Brace yourself, downvotes arw comming.
---
You need to mana drain the shit out of them, make that your priority and keep them dry.
---
Nothings gonna happen.
---
Shouldn't have used prot, I meant tank. 
---
A tank has the leverage, doesn't matter if he's fury or arms or prot, because most warriors refuse to tank. Always fun to see an "LFM tank" and the one searching is a warrior.
---
Or just don't exploit it?
---
If the other server is a cool place to be I night go there
---
Hardly even any layers atm anyway
---
No sir.
---
Should be a 6month ban tbh, that will discourage anyone from doing any exploit this serious.
---
Was doing it and some autist tagged one of them and I had to restart.
---
You clearly have no idea how this can affect 100% of the players but OK :)
---
Damn, thanks!
---
What was the justification for banning the second group? It could be argued that faction change bypassing the lockout was a bug, so that could fall under the "exploits of any in-game bugs" clause. But trading personal loot was intentional.
---
silver well deserved
---
Dis is lit fam
---
But thats a big combination of alot addons or?
---
Yeah I was seeing a lot of this this evening, I still have no idea what it is
---
All I can read is playing on PvP server enables you to being a dick and is appreciated.
---
at 60, when you start getting gear. But its also about personal preformance.
---
I have no idea then haha
---
Full health and 400 mana :)

A person releasing video of the big was probably not the same person exploiting it who will be banned. The people exploiting were farming epic recipes killing bosses 10x a hour that are usually at the end of a dungeon that takes an hour and a half to clear.
---
why so furious bro?
---
Welcome to Azeroth:)
---
The future? The game is already complete. If you want new content blizzard is releasing exp every other year.
---
My man! I started in BC and would absolutely love to go back, especially since I didn't raid at all except for one kara pug a few days before Wrath came out.
---
Would you prefer/expect fresh servers where everyone has to roll new characters and level to 60 first (with reduced needed xp that patch 2.0 changed) before heading to outland? Or more of a "character copy" option where you can have an identical version of your character put on the TBC server when it releases?
---
Definitely some upsides and downsides to both, I think
---
How do you figure lol that‚Äôs a bit of a reach
---
god, you kids.
---
Yeah... about that...
---
Its Miks scrolling battle text :)
---
I got a feeling that Blizzard thought Classic just gonna be a hype that died out quickly. The typical "oh, give it two weeks and most of them are back to LFG and pet-battles". If that was their approach it makes sense that they had few servers and many layers.   
---
Now, since it seems like the exact opposite is happening with more and more retail players joining Classic en masse, they find themself in this predicament where they have to figure out how to work their way down to one layer pr. server. I mean free migration after two weeks? 100 new servers since launch or something? 
---
I also don't understand why you think I cover Blizzard ass with my comment?
---
Imagine joining the world channel voluntarily, then complaining about the shitposting going on in there. Newsflash: global channels are cancer.
---
Join the group, need on that shit
---
Oh okay, thank you so much!
---
It is still a dick-move however. He waited until at the boss before changing to ML and then saying axe is reserved even though they never said this before the run started. Just because you are party leader doesn't make it excusable to act like this.
---
Lets say if it happens at least three times. I can imagine someone doing it accidentially and then just thinking "ha, cool, lets kill it again". I know I would if I had instant respawn without trying to do it on purpose.
---
Miks scrolling battle text and Shadowed unit frames :)
---
whats the problem? we are doing this cause often there are too much/zero players on certain boss for quest,when we need kill him/find party for help.
---
The ravager is actually pretty mediocre outside of its proc imo. But there are different specific classes that apply for Armory pugs more often than say Cathedral pugs, so its not as easy as "just bring casters."
---
Google leatherworking guide, wowhead should have one that‚Äôs great!
---
Upvoted because this is it. Happens all the time to me.
---
I hate yall
---
maybe in a guild run if you explicitly say that when recruiting for people but dont expect a rogue or warrior to waste time on your sorry ass
---
Nope, I fought him, and I won. It's a joke :)
---
It makes perfect sense, if you care about the item don‚Äôt join, if you don‚Äôt join if you want.
---
1/3 of my guild's chat is "Inv layer"
---
I r vry smert
---
The one and only!
---
I remember there being a blizzpost years ago saying that if they do a long-term ban instead of a perma-ban, it has a better effect because psychologically it isn't as "final", so the cheater ends up not playing anymore as opposed to just remaking a new character and doing it all over again. 
---
It has something to do with closure, and the finality of a perma-ban, I'd assume.
---
I think those are quite different people, aren't they? Or they are hypocrites. I would have to lie if I'd say that I believe that a huge portion of classic fanboys aren't hypocrites.
---
I‚Äôll tell you right now, you can read for hours on the internet, scroll through hundreds of opinionated comments on Reddit, and watch all the informative YouTube videos that you want. However nothing will quite prepare you for the frustrations to come, as a warrior beginning to make his destiny by way of either quest or dungeon.
---
That being said, what i have learned is listen to all of the advice, and take what you need and leave what you don‚Äôt. What really ends up happening is a spec, and leveling systems that accommodates your play style. If you want to exclusively level in dungeons, prot might work out just fine for you. Early on prot isn‚Äôt really considered efficient or useful in terms of soloing or running dungeons, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt spec it and be succseafull. 
---
I found that around level 48-50 is when the idea of going a protection spec became appealing. It seemed like a turning point to me, where the damage mitigation, and overall utility, and hardiness could actually pay off and be efficient in a group setting. I also found that later in the game, you can depend on grouping with others for content, where as in the early levels you will need the ability from time to solo. For example: class quests, gathering dungeon quests and completing their prerequisites, material farming/profession progression, not to mention world pvp situations. 
---
IMO, I‚Äôve found that protection talents become a lot more useful later on in the game, but part of it is just figuring out how you like to play, or if you even like warrior at all.  The beauty of the class is that all specs are viable, you just have to figure out what suits your play style the best.
---
Classic.
---
You know that box on the bottom left of your screen, that's for chatting to other people. :p use it, discuss with your group their intention, if someone has the same idea, they wanna equip it, then you can both roll need. It's polite to equip it straight away, so they can inspect you've done it, and jobs done.

Blizzard doesn't lack the skill or ability to fix this exploit. Nor it lacks the skill or ability to take player feedback seriously since they are rolling a fix with the server restart.

Check out Yee Haw Game Ranch and you can find more amazing insults.  But this is definitely a good one.

Really? If that's the case I hate exploiters as much as I hate blizzard for not testing layering abuses like that

Did the same last night, Did a call out to some level 50 war and he said jup I remember the pain. So helped me.   
---
Remember to pass on the help when someone asked you for help :)
---
To be fair, the AQ40 "exploit" was absolutely insane. I have no idea if they seriously thought this wouldn't cause problems.
---
Scumbags..... Nice ui, what addons do you have?
---
Hawt
---
There's not much finesse to it. Keep grounding on CD and Tremor up as much as possible, interrupt Mind Flays with Earth Shock, run out of Mind Flay range when you're silenced yourself, purge shields on arrival.
---
ohh i hated this. We were 5 people waiting at some point (respawn was more than 10 minutes..) and made a group, when suddenly a random appears and starts the quest as soon as it respawns.  We were piiiissed.
---
Advertising exploits and it's ok to abuse them. Quite terrible advertising actually.

Its part of the game and with nice mates it's still fun to do the dungeons over and over again.

We were also one of unluckiest raids for druids since Stormrage helmet never dropped for a way too long time. I already had 4 or 5 T2 items before I for the helmet.

The damn game played me like a damn flute back then.  
---
Ah hell, who am I kidding? It‚Äôs playing me like a flute. Again.
---
You guys just stab yourselves and then drink it
---
Then the healer freaks the fuck out and starts madly healing you
---
 In what world am I the one in the wrong?
---
I can't wait for phase 3 when PVP gets put into the game. Wish it was earlier man.
---
Do love me some world PVP at the moment tho
---
If you're dps, whirlwind and mortal strike are your best friends but those don't come until 36 and 40, so before that you really just kinda gotta deal with rend and HS, unless you and your healer are cool with two tanks
---
I'm rolling around with almost entirely blues at level 27 on my mage
---
My mana pool is like 2.3K and the level 15 conjure water restores like 700 mana
---
It is ***bullshit***
---
Would you have made enough gold in game to pay off your loans though. Then it might have been worth it
---
They could change the loot settings, not much you can do then.
---
It sure is :)
---
I actually love it, as someone who tries to optimize the hell out of everything and rush games this game can be rushed but it kills all the benefits if you mess something up. 
---
You do a dungeon and do some mission impossible shit to skip 2 trash packs saving 1 minute but then you get greedy and accidentally pull an extra pack, boom dead and 7 minute run back. Some mechanics are just so incredibly sadistic there's just no way to avoid it unless you planned around it. 5 second interrupt on healer, poly on tank, knockback, patrol from nowhere. You went too fast and got to greedy so suffer the consequences. It's not that real reinforcement learning going on, everytime you try to rush it just takes longer, dps too early and pull aggro and you get one shot. 
---
Another that's really amazing is that your character always feels like it's shit... But you can see the next milestone and once you get that spell then everything will be better. It's so excruciatingly difficult to quest right now, but you just bear it out because that spell will solve all your problems and you hype that up in your mind. 
---
Well, you finally get that spell and guess what? You're still shit.
---
all the streamers who abused the lveling pots in bfa got bans and rollbacks.  
---
regular people got way less sever punishment in this case
---
When did they ever not ban "important" streamers if they actually exploited shit?
---
The amount of similar comments I got back in Vanilla when I tried to get it.  
---
I even had people go ‚Äúoh that, I just disenchanted it as nobody wanted it‚Äù.
---

---
I forgot SND other-wise it would be up there. So long as you have improved slice and dice
---
Cheap shot &gt; Slice and dice with 2 combo points and improved SND should keep it up until the mobs dead
---
oof that's unlucky. Reminds me I wanted the fist weapon from kel' thuzad, it refused to drop, 26 runs in a row. It wasn't rare, it just refused to drop and evidenced by a friend of mine whose guild found one every third run and had to disenchant it &gt;_&lt;.
---
I think he played it too cool and then the feedback spell ate his ass up
---
Worst case for me in classic was getting del rends on my rogue. I had to do ubrs literally 15+ times to get the drop, it got to the point where I started making the group myself and making sure I only invites hunters that already had the OH.
---
He even rolls, lose and still loot the head for himself
---
What race are you?  I‚Äôm dwarf for stoneform vanishes
---
Change servers. I haven't seen a queue since day one.
---
Layering is ment to prevent dead servers. Do you not understand the point of it? These servers with 70k total players would be stuck in 10 hour ques without layers.
---
Faerlina be like. Rattlegore represent!
---
These messages are sometimes hours apart, just ignore them.
---
*It's only been 17 days since launch*
---
They'll get a serious stern warning
---
&gt;The second would be to limit server sizes to a smaller population. 
---
Yeah, and then people would whine because of 20 hour queues instead of 6 because they believe a server with only a one hour queue would be dead in two months.
---
I loved my little mace though. It was brilliant. Still one of the best mace models out there, too.
---
Str and agi both give you 1 AP per point if you\`re rogue or a cat form druid. But agi also gives crit and dodge, that's why it\`s way better for rogues.
---
I'm glad that those that instanced and abused it will be punished but where is the punishment for those that exploited the raid glitch? Most of the 60s if not all got there so quickly because of it and it's annoying that they get a free one up for exploiting.
---
It takes a little bit to take the start restrictions off. How long ago did you two start paying?
---
Because they knew people wanted a true vanilla experience with classic, so putting in microtransactions would get an angry mob to burn their HQ down. But classic+ wouldnt be a true vanilla experience, so all bets are off. Character boosts and mount store wouldnt go against the spirit of it because its not wow from 15 years ago anymore.
---
I mentioned something similar on another post here.
---
Taking seasons from Diablo 3 would be kinda cool. New sets with new set bonuses every season. Add different boss spawns to current/new dungeons. Maybe give NPC's some new spells that players would have to master. Stuff like that.
---
You heal anyway with whatever gear you have. Run maraudon/sunken temple at 60 even if you need to and can't heal BRM dungeons. Then go to BRD and progress upwards thru scholo, brs, strat.
---
Back when I played the loot was always on FFA during raids.  Our 2 raid leaders were the MT and main healer. They were already moving onto pull new mobs with each kill and weren‚Äôt dealing with distributing loot.  
---
Back in vanilla A LOT of guilds operated the same way.  We never had any issues.  Like others have said, without having anything cross realm people had to be careful or they‚Äôd be forced to served transfer even for a slight mistake.
---
And get your account banned for using an exploit.
---
Put the weapon before the shield in ur first macro
---
it is what it is.

I got ganked by a human pally while killing mob and half health.  I was at 25% health when I killed that pally
---
does the corporal  actual=ly mean anything or is it just some quest title everyone can get
---
Sorry, English is not my native language :) the outcome was death, as 80 People crashed onto us after we ganked them several times before they managed to group up. We should have faced them inside the stone in hindsight. Was a really fun experience tho.
---
Must not be a mage

I had the rare shadow damage increase BOP pants drop from GY yesterday only to get them stolen by a mage who didn‚Äôt read the item and just saw ‚Äúdamage‚Äù he won the pants :(
---
LF2M SM AOE MAGES ONLY
---
Yup, this is the way to do it. Since it's BoE one could try to make an argument if it's an actual upgrade, and then trade it afterwards if the winner is cool with it.
---
That‚Äôs pretty much the most vanilla wow shit ever
---
&gt;People are upset and want the people abusing layering banned though.
---
Well, people abused an very obvious bug/oversight and this should of course be punished.

You can also find it next to the dinosaur you need to kill for final quest.

What? Rogues are very fast at killing mobs. They can disengage easily, they can take 2-3 mobs with evasion, they can skip mobs if its desired to reach a point, They have sprint and a lot of cc to deal with dangerous situations. Moreover they use energy instead of rage which is a pain to fill.
---
Sorry but I think you know nothing about rogues.

Is this specific to hunters? I have been stuck in combat so much lately and it‚Äôs annoying. In dungeons and not.

---
Why would you make a video on something that works much better as text?
---
That makes sense. I played on a PR that at some point fucked something up and had a whole 24+ hour rollback.  That means everything you did for the last 24+ hours is lost, all the xp, aurions, loots etc etc. I was leveling my alt rogue during that, I never wanted to play it again because of that. These guys will feel like they lost so much time when they come back to their green geared chat etc.
---
They should get a rollback on their char to the second they first exploited that shit + a long ban so they come back once everyone has had time to do what they exploited to farm. Some will come back and play the game, some will just un sub and go do some other shit.
---
Jeez, what a shit show.
---
Maybe they are way higher lvl than the dungeon is designed for, thus you get a very fast run, while they are just going for this one thing and nothing else. But even if not: it's them who are gathering this party, they are doing a bit of work to organize it. Basically, willpointing described it the best: free market. Just don't make it a shady market like those guys from the post.

Night Elf, remade a character from vanilla.
---
This is why now you will see many horde noobs in pvp.
---
A lot of them rolled horde thinking they will be the dominant pvp faction. Many of them rolled it thinking that because most pvp streamers rolled horde, so therefore the masses roll horde.
---
Now the real WPVP players can shine on alliance to kill the horde noobs.
---
I don‚Äôt see what this has to do with it. But yeah I mean if your answer about that is ‚Äúwho cares?‚Äù there‚Äôs no point discussing it. I still firmly believe that these groups should be boycotted, nobody deserves priority on something in a PUG group.
---
*horde killing.
---
Thanks for this.
---
Layering being removed will not change the total population, its all about fixing overcrowding. As people spread out throughout the world the layers are reducing for the same number of people.
---
God I love chat sometimes
---
That‚Äôs never been the rule in wow communities. The entire point is to start a witch hunt.
---
You are in a favourable position for most of those fights. would be my biggest suggestion on your next one. 
---
Looks like you're having some fun though!
---
Made me want to listen to some DMX
---
Was released 3 weeks ago and people are already "hmm future content blizz pls??" even tho we still have a lot of phases. People are really insecure about playing a game.
---
People are dumb. Hunters do great dps while leveling, especially marks hunters.
---
This would be a great way to solve the issue.
---
Imagine all the stranded Bank Alts back on the original realm :D
---
&gt; fewer people can be online in total
---
Not how it works.
---
So Frost bolt is still worth it dps wise even when getting hit
---
I did kill black gorillas in STV. Seems like there is no quest for those. I am on PvP server and happily farmed couple of levels without much competition or alliance players disturbing.
---
Unless it's BOE not everyone is going to want the item, why would a mage or rogue care if a warrior wants to reserve some plate armor? Why would a warrior who already got that item care?
---
should have just used dynamic spawns instead of layering.
---
On a pvp server I recommend druid, druid and druid. One goes bear form and tanks, another cat form and DPSes, third one also goes cat form but has a set of healing gear for dungeons.
---
"Layer them to bfa" now that's punishment.
---
"You may come back to classic but only once you've suffered 3 months of MM+47 PUSH NEED 2 SEND ILVL ACHIEVEMENT LINK TO YOUR MYSPACE PAGE AND YOUR DEAD DAD'S POCKET WATCH"
---
ah yes. "Incompetence" says the man who very likely hasn't run a complex networking system that hosts millions of players.
---
Look, I don't like layering either, but it was bound to have problems the team couldn't foresee.
---
10. Get banned for exploiting.
---
Path of exile works.
---
!Remindme 2 days
---
And do you do this without warning your group prior, ie I'll be rolling on healing gear ? If that's  the case you are a dick pure and simple.
---
Yup. Hence the emergency hotfix/restart and banning everyone who exploited.
---
Your mindset here indicates that you are bad with money. Why would you equip a lucky krol blade drop, losing about 250g that you could have made from selling it when you think of buying it for the same 250g as a waste of money. Thats not prioritizing. If you would truly prioritize epic mount over krol blade for example the rational move would be to sell the krol, get you epic mount a bit earlier and then save up for another krol after you get the epic mount. Why does the krol blade suddenly become worth more than 250g for you the moment you see it drop?
---
Same thing for the devilsaur leather. If you prioritize epic mount over devilsaur set then why do you farm leather to put it in your bank while you slowly chip away at the epic mount cost? You could just sell the leather, get your epic mount earlier and the focus on getting the devilsaur set afterwards.
---
You are not really prioritizing, you are following a romanticized self-sufficiency mindset which is not a bad thing, I think it can be really fun in an rpg setting. But it is kind of unfair when you are in a group with people who have a more dry rational approach because then you suddenly going from a krol blade not being worth 250g to 'I need it to equip, I have priority' modewhen the roll window pops up actually seems super selfish on your part from their point of view. Don't be afraid of trading and using the auction house.
---
It is nice to be able to walk through NPCs and not pull them lol

It is absolutely on you to abuse unintended behaviour, the EULA says as much: Bug abuse is using game systems in ways not intended by Blizzard. If you found an NPC with an infinite quest turnin and abused it for free levels, that is also very clearly a bug and very clearly abuse. It doesn't suddenly become more okay because it is easier to abuse, it is not like it is more legal to steal something because it is easy.
---
All warriors have killed me on site while I did that quest. Every single one
---
I was personally refering to when org was raided on Firemaw (probably the shittiest raid ive seen aswell lol) orgrimmar was laggy then.  Otherwise its fine for me.  
---
Id guess its your PC/Connection
---
Where is he encouraging harassment? Just informing others of players actions.
---
He never once said, "everyone whisper him and tell him he's bad" or "find out where he lives irl and lets swat him".
---
Until he directly encourages others to harass this fellow, then it isn't against rule number 3 just to post his name.
---
Honestly robe go the archmage has a 10% drop rate on trash mobs and people in my guild keep seeing it drop, once it dropped twice in the same run. You should be worried if you see half the rogues in a guild with felstriker though haha
---
If a boe has value then everyone needs it and as such they should roll need.
---
Ret Paladins aren't the best at DPS but they bring a lot of utility.  You're able to off-heal which can save a group in some situations where things get hard for the main healer, and things like Sanctity Aura and improved Might can help improve not only your own DPS but others in the group who benefit from it.
---
Asking the real questions. I can show you more of said plastic octopus if you‚Äôd like since that‚Äôs my hand in the picture.
---
Of course they do. If they stream the layer abuse that is so much worse.
---
Besides the terrible mage I also hate that insanely disruptive scrolling combat text.
---
Where do hunters fit?
---
&gt; I have been watching some of their streams all day in the past few weeks 
---
i feel genuinely sorry for you
---
Amen to that!
---
Yea
---
But I was a rogue in this case
---
Happens all over. I got corpse camped by 3 ally today in Arathi. All of them at least 7 levels on me. They killed me around 7 times and corpse camped 3 other players who they probably had 10 levels on. So yeah. Big league players right there
---
And no one's saying you shouldn't, nor that it's unacceptable. It is in fact entirely in your right so go ahead.
---
But it's still a dick move, and that can't really be argued with.
---
I don't like these posts either but they are clearly related to classic. This isn't. Illidan is not even in this game.
---
Nice! Cheers OP!
---
Shall try it tonight and see if the colourblind mode will help me out with the colours.  Unless there's an option to change them
---
Dalaran falls twice?
---
I'm almost 50, still in deadmines gear because I pass for warriors/rogues feelsbadmate.
---
Found one of the people in that image. XD
---
I know for sure that the add on is Masque I just need the skin or plug in he is using
---
And that is also a VERY broad example. Like I already said, there‚Äôs even no need to take any steps other than what, wait?
---
I truly am home.
---
I can show you my logs when I played on Kronos.
---
Lol.
---
Bruz, read up where I said I don‚Äôt deny it making sense. I agree, if they can, people will cheat.
---
Wintergrasp was amazing
---
I did a scholo earlier, 4 guildies and a rando.  We EXPLICITLY told the rando that the flask recipe and warlock tailoring recipe were on reserve if they dropped before we even started.  The guy happened to be an alchemist and wasn't happy, but begrudgingly came along.  I even reminded him again before switching to mater loot prior to Ras (it's not that we don't trust you...).
---
The last SL warlock who tried this died during Cheap Shot ^^ He was not geared though... a good SL lock is scary af
---
People were quick to answer this one! 
---
Definitely write a ticket if it hasn‚Äôt changed soon.
---
Also NA but Earthfury is called "low pop" and it's one you can transfer off of "high pop" Herod. Check out the stats for each:
---
http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Herod
---
http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Earthfury
---
The stats change as people running the addon log in and out but right now the new realm seems like a solid option. About 7500 each for Horde and Alliance. Herod doesn't look good at all. 43,000 Horde and 26,000 Alliance. I expect more people will be leaving Herod as they throttle the layers and queue times go back up. Especially ally.
---
Yeah I binded the first six side buttons on the mouse to home, end, delete, pg down etc and I keep 1 to 5 for stuff I use less often like potions. I see alot of people use mouse scroll for certain actions but I can't imagine not being able to zoom in and out with the mouse wheel. G600 is the way to go.
---
I have a mouse with 2 sides buttons. I mapped them to ctrl and maj so basically multiply the number of spell I have easy keyboard access to by 3.
---
Assuming we're thinking of the same guy, what he was suggesting was having people of the opposite faction blacklisted for corpse camping him or stream sniping. Something that 
---
a) never would have happened in vanilla because streaming wasn't really a thing back then and you didn't have huge personalities playing that could have a big influence on the opposite faction. Only people you could realistically blacklist was people of your own faction b/c the other faction doesn't give a shit about you or know you at all
---
b) is definitely not as bad as ninja'ing loot. If you're playing on a PvP server that accepts the possibility of being corpse camped. Play on a PvE server if you're that concerned about it, everyone else has to deal with it. Hell there are people who play the game solely for the open world PvP and all of its less than ideal features, its a fundamentally different issue than ninjaing loot.
---
Regarding streaming specifically, if you stream you're literally advertising your location out to the world at all times, it comes with the territory. If he's that worried about it and *has* to play on a PvP server (though he apparently doesn't want to open world PvP) put his stream on a delay, it'll at least make it harder. From what I've heard though this hasn't been a problem so far, if anything streamers usually move around with a large entourage or at least a few people so its basically impossible to gank them.
---
I am pretty sure it is not how this works. The data from all "computers" is probably written to a single database so it is most probably a software bug while processing the data that caused it.
---
I'd stay on the island a bit longer, till 14 or 15. If you are out of quests, explore, there are likely some quests you missed. I'm always 15 or higher before I leave. 
---
And Darkshore would be your next easiest location. A short boat or flight away. You'll get a quest that says to go there.
---
Ignore others telling you to go to westfall or Barrens. Itd take you hours to figure out how to get to those places as a new players. Explore naturally as quests ask you to go places. Just my 2 cents.
---
&gt; Was a really fun experience tho.
---
This is all that matters. 
---
Seriously that is what vanilla was all about.
---
Oh I know, they're both shit posts.
---
Yes, I had the same issue, but turns out the spawns are a bit random.
---
Just run around the pit and you should find it.
---
What an absolute pathetic shithead...
---
Ive seen people say X is reserved, but it was in the chat before the dungeon. Even seen some say if X drops and you all pass, i pay you all some gold
---
It's fine to reserve. It results in only people joining who don't want that piece of gear. It's simpler than having to consult that holy pala or hunter if he's going to be an idiot and need on ironfoe. Just state the reserve and it's fine. I've joined and started a few groups doing it. If you want a specific item yourself ask if you can reserve it. 
---
Childish would be not doing it and that lack of planning leading to drama.
---
Only rule is to reserve BEFOREHAND. And don't assume that freaking holy pala won't roll on ironfoe just because you're fury and can actually make use of it.
---
Which bubbles can you purge exactly? I think I've tried and sometimes it doesn't work
---
Someone just messaged me ingame and said "You're a fucking scumbag!". That's the spirit!
---
Red means dead, one time. If you're on my kos list, I'll happily gank you for 15 mins, actively trying to make you want to quit. All rogues are on my kos list whether entry or not, they will deserve it later.
---
Or repost the one about missing a roll! I love that thread.
---
Its not really relevant in regards to world pvp. The only scenario i can think of would be people flagging themselves to invade a city. It might be harder to get a group to defend your quest giving npcs. 
---
Other than that, it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
---
Thank you kindly :)
---
Mage must've been horrible. I eat pallys for breakfast as a mage.
---
Yeah my group will have blackjack and hookers.
---
I think it's different if they discuss a drop before the instance.  Anyone can call something then, and anyone can back out no hard feelings if they don't agree.
---
RIGHT THE WRONG
---
You should avoid some alleys in SW, nothing but punk gnomes skulking around trying to mug you.
---
Would atleast state it before u start. Say ur just tanking the dungeon, but will be needing on fury items!
---
I mean I‚Äôm alliance lol
---
100 hours is only fours days. That's not really bad for 38. It ain't great, but I wouldn't classify you as pathologically slow.
---
Not if there's a mage or even a warlock in the group.
---
as far as i know the dungeons (not each instance, but their physical location) is indeed somewhere in the azeroth worldspace.
---
This means that since it exists on a layer with an instance ID, and not in some separate dimension, changing layers respawns the same dungeon instance on a new layer.
---
It makes a bit of sense to me as to how it's happening, and hopefully can get fixed soon.  I'm sure the effect this is having on the economy isn't low especially where specific items that can be farmed this way are concerned.
---
Yeah when I want to gank someone I usually will walk up to them, threaten then, give them 30 seconds to eat and drink, re-establish their buffs.  If they need extra time I will let them call in guild members to buff them up too.
---
Sometimes they might even be a level below me so I will follow them round for an hour or so until they level up so it will be an even fight.
---
Sometimes I might even have to help them complete some quests too so they can get more gear to make it even more fair.
---
Then of course we both need to clear a 50 yard zone around us.  I'd hate to be fighting the opposing faction and they get attacked by a raptor or something like that.
---
So the average gank for me takes around 3 days but it is worth it since I would hate to be a dick and kill someone on a pvp server when they might not be 100% ready for it.
---
Ones on my server sell it for 30+, you could easily do more currently
---
ban him
---
Yeah and the UI has plenty of room for extra additions.. almost as if it was designed that way on purpose. Lol.
---
Simple guys, ignore them, and do us a solid and let the rest of us know too. Problem solved :). 
---
You only care about yourself? Be only with yourself. Simple.
---
Is this the same image from the Pogba one lol
---
*The warrior looks down at his 3 charms and mutters to himself* ‚Äúfuckin level 39 elemental bastards.... godamn level 30 quest...... dont even like STV.....‚Äù *he throws a knife at the next elemental, -MISS- praying he only pulls one* ‚Äúfucking 2 hours and only 3 out of 27 damn charms to show for it‚Äù *he stares blankly at the elemental, wondering how It could parry him while casting. Then a sounds breaks his tunnel vision* ‚Äúwhat on azeroth is tha-‚Äú X GON GIVE IT TO YA
---
You realise the whole point of classic in the first place was so the chubby 40 year old nerds could play the game they were addicted to 14 years ago? Its wasent made so retailers could get a better wow.
---
Almost as funny as when I heard it 15 years ago
---
Zoomers please leave to your preferred stream of choice
---
Pro tip: make your own group and look for a tank, when you dont find one after 5min say ur gonna tank instead and look for another DD
---
Now you can roll on fury items
---
i just went into his channel and wrote !addon and got the following message :  
---
 9:04üì∑üì∑üì∑**StreamElements**: @Toolt, Mike is using these addons in wow classic: Details! Damage Meter, SamyTotemTimers, WeaponSwingTimer, Onebag3, AtlasLoot, Questie, Dominos, Recount and Lorti UI
---
Gnome prot pally
---
Short answer: No
---
Long answer: Noooo
---
Google vanilla friend finder and good luck!  I found some old contacts this way.
---
They werent resetting it, just layering.
---
The Great Fras Siabi says hi.  Literally everyone runs in to click the box as soon as possible and wipes the group.
---
We don‚Äôt know how many days a dev needs to fix this in first place. Layer doesn‚Äôt look like a simple system. Is also weekend so their dec will only attack the real issue on monday. The best they can do at the moment is to try to do a quick win like disabled the feature.
---
Fits well with your name too
---
This has nothing to do with logging out to get back to the start of a (resetted) instance right?
---
This is simply not efficient for leveling. Easy? Hell ya. And most people don‚Äôt care to continuously grind and be able to kill multiple mobs without stopping. But if you do care, you absolutely need first aid to save your mana. The less time you spend drinking to recover mana, the more time you have killing mobs.
---
It's funny because it's taking me an eternity to level now (35) but I can't find a single SM group at all
---
Fade? :&gt;
---
What exactly happened there?
---
Hunter had a huge amount of bugs I remember at least 80 on that spreadsheet.
---
Given that they have been quite good in Fixing them. I'm sure it won't be too Long until they fix the rest if it didn't use to be that way in Classic anyway that is..
---
I love these posts. Community reputation is massively important
---
Bryce you a busta.
---
Shh don't tell anyone
---
Why do you need to redo your bindings?
---
Thanks for your pointless reply
---
&gt;Do you you guys think a player like that who never actually experienced vanilla would be able to enjoy Classic WoW?
---
Yes. I only started when TBC was just released, and I played until Cata or something. Classic is not too different from the WotLK experience IMHO.
---
If anybody still is here, it was an enchant formula that without my knowledge was worth a crap ton of gold. 
---
I am personally a enchanter and wanted it badly for myself and my friends. 
---
Me and a hunter rolled, I got 28 And thought I got to low then someone else needed and got 27, I was really Happy until he got really upset and demade reroll? I Said just simpelt no and he rated sworn etc so I decide to leave the group because I didn‚Äôt wanna play with him, the rest of the group was fine but I could not deal with him.
---
Bout 2-3 mins later he got him and some of his friends to spam World chat that I was ninjalooting, that moment I saw chat blowing over 20 people ignoring me and worst of all my guild and 2 other high tier guilds hate me. 
---
This is no problem today tho because Ive found a new guild that are so kind and we‚Äôre talking down MC this thursdsy. 
---
I am a mage lvl 60 currently and still Im not gonna say my name or realm
---
I don't know if it's all that bad. To me I picked up classic and was just surprised at how much FUN I was having.
---
I'm REALLY looking forward to the rolling out of the phases and re-experiencing all this content, and I guess I'm just very hyped at it's popularity. So much so that I want it to last forever, and I don't think it will once the last phase rolls in a few years from now and people are realizing that this is it. I like to let my imagination run wild and think about what could happen if the popularity of classic is still there in 2 years time, and I like to imagine what could have been if blizzard had gone a different route.
---
Right now, however, we're playing classic and of course it will stay true to that. But it doesn't hurt to daydream once in a while.
---
Sure Asmongold... you can't fool us!
---
Tomte would've wiped all of you alone had he been in range for my Power Infusion. :(
---
You phone using heathen!
---
Iron forge ask guard for weapon trainer
---
4 Stam 4 str leather belt? Aaahhh!!
---
obviously, but if 2 people are equally good, the one with better racials will generally win :)
---
nothing weird about it, and if you do it too much you're locked out. So no
---
Ok I guess you cant read, UNLESS THEY CHANGED IT. In vanilla mages were 1, rogues were 2, warriors were 3. Then the Naxx patch happened and warriors were 1. This is classic and not true vanilla, so again if they changed it.
---
Can take 72 hours to work on a resub. It‚Äôs a security thing. My friends was working within 24 hours.
---
shit nut ?
---
Here's what I've wondered about: 
---
a.) Feign doesn't always leave combat so FD+trap unreliable. 
---
b.) Pet runs behind mob without attacking it. 
---
c.) Pet stands on corpse. Staring. 
---
 
---
d.) ~5-10% of the time auto-shot takes an extra beat to fire.
---
Nothing new there that guild recruit blurb has been used on retail for years.
---
Retailers in classic, love it
---
Wouldn't surprise me, he always takes the easiest way despite making promises.
---
I come across some people and think, "oh they look nice", and I go along my merry way.
---
I come across others and think, "this person needs to die right now".
---
Ruined oppurtunity!
---
Yes, this is what I did on my priest. Take up tailoring for bags/mooncloth/BiS chest. All the leftovers go right to first aid. With this meta of dungeon grinding, it‚Äôs very easy to get more than enough cloth to lvl either professions and have some mats left over.
---
&gt;Is there a solid way to make money through cooking or fishing?
---
Yes. Fish for oily blackmouths, deviate fish or firefin snappers. They're used in alchemy recipes that are often in demand (swift swim potions &amp; Waterbreathing potions, potion of giant growth, fire oil).
---
Overall I'd say from 30-40. (I have levelled dozens over the years)
---
You have strong poisons, access to 2 x blue weapons from SM and RFD quests.
---
Combat swords go Es you riposte and blade flurry.
---
You have cheap shot, kidney and imp gouge (people love 3% dodge but I can't play without imo gouge it's just too fucking op! gouge restealth, gouge bandage etc)
---
Blind at 34. Then you become an absolute assassin with so many tricks up your sleeve.
---
When I was looking for clever names for a mage one day I looked through maybe 5 or 6 threads on blizzard's forums and reddit and without fail every single thread had multiple people suggesting "frostitute" as a name. People really think that ones funny, huh
---
You have to compare Blizzard to a few fans running their own pserver. The pserver folks dont have millions in salaries to give out to a host of bug fixers who can run their algorithms (I really have no idea about programming) and find the offenders, revert items etc.
---
The pserver admins need to rule with the fear of death... perma ban, else everbody would exploit the fuck out of glitchy aspects of the game.
---
The christmas herbing you are talking of wouldve been the nail in the coffin for the project, because people were herbing Black Lotus every 5 seconds for hours. 
---
Economy would've been ruined.
---
You realize that those chubby 40 year old nerds wanted the game to expand and only quit because the game took a bad direction right? Retail is to far gone. Classic is a chance to fix past mistakes. Or it‚Äôs a place for lonely people caught in a midlife crisis to feed an addiction to literally the same thing over and over for the rest of their lives. During vanilla every single player as I‚Äôm board with an expansion. Hell I‚Äôd even say during BC too. It wasn‚Äôt until lich king that a significant portion of players started having issues with changes.
---
did you actually just write that unironically and got upvoted for it? holy shit
---
This is how I got 30p fishing way to go bro!
---
So you think we'll go into phase 2 with server caps at 12k+?
---
Yup
---
Oke thx
---
I don‚Äôt understand why this is any different from abusing layers to avoid ganks or repeat the best aoe pulls (like jokerd did).  Somehow it‚Äôs worse if it‚Äôs inside an instance?
---
All of these involve exploiting the layer system to accomplish things faster in the game.  
---
Anyone abusing layers should be banned, and layers should be removed.
---
could you please tell me where should I farm gold as a mage? Im 60 aoe spec, but I just don't know where to farm..
---
I like to organize my spells on my bars by there type (all my fire totems in a row then earth, water, etc etc.) when I add a spell in the middle I have to shift all my keybinds down one slot.
---
They say that a ret pally's strongest attack is throwing his wheelchair on the opponent
---
I had 3 Razer naga's (1 hex) and they all broke down within 1 year or so. I hear it's very common. I bought a logitech g600 this time.
---
They don‚Äôt have multiple ironfoes or felstrikers, one of each I think and both farmed normally, felstriker on stream even
---
Does WoW even need advertising? Pretty sure everyone knows about it by now
---
Not really, its just rolled back. Same thing happened in AA. They did Fresh start servers which were just rolled back, just like here, then progressed like normal.
---
Everybody gangsta till the boomkin gang shows up
---
Remember the names and let no one run with these idiots.
---
well said
---
Shaman/rogue seems to be fine, with very fast single target killing speeds.
---
Mage/Paladin would be fun too, I guess, with consecration into AoE farming.
---
Warlock/SPriest is very synergetic as well.
---
all it takes is one crazy dude
---
So the gear from naxx is just that insane for warriors?
---
No warrior is leveling as prot, pretty much. It's really, really bad.
---
But if you are a warrior you will get random whispers to tank dungeons if you are in the level range (it's weird) or when you whisper someone for a dungeon group they will ask you to tank. Thinking that they should be able to preclude someone from rolling on an item that is realistically mainspec because they agreed to do something as offspec is silly.
---
Necessery remainder. Developers are humans too. Certain issues need time to fix or find solution to. It wont speed up because you yell at them or even if you throw manpower at it
---
The issue might take weeks to fix
---
They don‚Äôt have multiple ironfoes or felstrikers, one of each I think and both farmed normally, felstriker on stream even. They haven‚Äôt abused dungeon layering.
---
lvl 8 paladin in durotar?!
---
The sub rotates between what you're talking about and a screenshot from a dad getting a 6 slot bag drop, pretty tiresome imo
---
Shit, that was actually me if you look closely it says to[bluebob]. I accidentally do it all the time and I catch myself and hate myself even more.
---
Tool the hunter bag? [Sounds like Bryce](https://youtu.be/fFO0CkSiZfI).
---
I am doing that because I have no friends and I keep getting ganked 24/7.
---
What was the raid glitch?
---
But then again there's nothing assholeish about dropping out "before the instance" if you disagree with the terms being discussed "before the instance
---
If someone likes the item enough to equil it as an upgrade they should have already bought it anyways.
---
"Chain CC" makes a lot more sense now.
---
Someone needs to make a prat plugin that grabs your censusplus data
---
Why do people keep speaking about relaunch which is just not happening at all
---
Equip needs a slot number, cant remember the command but its something like equipslot or something... look it up in various guides.
---
Had the same problem.
---
oh wow. they just killed the boss, and layered inside the dungeon and got a new boss? thats so obviously a bug they exploited. thanks for the info man.
---
Not even since battlegrounds are crossrealm
---
I bet if you added together all of the time saved over all those automatically accepted and turned in quests over several months it would not equal the time lost from someone messing up this one single escort quest in RFD
---
Never join a group with "locked" or "reserved" items/drops. They were cancer on private servers and they'll continue to be in classic.
---
Be nobody's fool.
---
Loved that ‚ÄúFor the Alliance‚Äù at the end
---
If you see "item x is reserved" and you need it, don't join. Eventually they'll find 4 other people who can't use it or don't need it, and then everyone in the group will be able to roll on any items they need. It's not a big deal and nothing to cry over provided it's mentioned in advance.
---
I'm ally on gehennas and it's ridiculous.
---
Beautiful
---
Catering to the pseudo-niche community that is being neglected.
---
yeah, thanks
---
That must be Firemaw-EU, right?
---
Lol i'm the hunter,just trolling people hard because it's a good weapon for hunter (and i know goonium who agreed we'd both roll)
---
You sound...fun
---
Pm me the details plz.
---
Don't forget the 2 others! Names on screenshot
---
So it has been changed and not true vanilla experience.
---
You can simply /ignore them
---
Why is this witchhunting? The party leader (PL) exorcised his right to be Loot Master, albiet at the end of the run... OP is not claiming PL did something illegal. OP is just exorcising his right to alert other people on the server that grouping with PL comes with a degree of risk. Thats what server forums were used for back in the day. OP in no way asked for anyone to attack OP. Just that the incident occurered and can occur to others. 
---
Reputation will once again mean something unless you want to pay real money every time your name gets out there.
---
yes i was at 150g when i bought it therw are people with epic mounts already
---
What about the W?
---
I remember you'd have to really live your feign death in vanilla. Like full animation and lie down for a second or 2 before you left combat. Only in TBC combat was dropped instantly
---
Is it bugged even when waiting a bit?
---
If he didn't tell you in the beginning you can get him banned for it, it's ninja loot then
---
Holy heck I had completely forgotten about this. Yeah nobody gave a shit.
---
Whats the Name of the addon for the additional Character stats?
---
Same with Eye of Kilrogg. Need to wait a moment or it'll break the spell and move own character instead.
---
You'll most likely have mana issues early on. You also likely lack both Feral Charge and Nature's Swiftness which are staples of druid PvP. You need all three of Mana, Charge and NS to really succeed as a druid.
---
Worse thing layerin is that retailers especially in my experience is avoiding world pvp with layering instead of grouping up and halting lvling to clean up a zone. Wpvp is mostly about controling azone for farming or questing its ur duty.  
---
So if the mentality is to escape. the ones who dont iwll have to face even more enemys.  
---
This is messed up, its not even that much hordes i meet atm no need for layering lol.  
---
Vanilla u cant expect to lvl 1-60 alone witout having to rely on others.  
---
Do ur fucking duty. Please destroy and shame ppl with this mentality.
---
Run
---
Yes exactly
---
I remember some people in my guild werent happy with an expansion.. The first private servers popped up after BC release. 
---
I also gotta remind you that you are posting on the subreddit for a 15 year old version of a video game, stop trying to sound superior to other people. Its cringy as fuck.
---
Yh I skipped that 1.. Tigeress fang was bad enough
---
He does look sad :(
---
Plenty of time for those without irl commitments. I think some people don‚Äôt realize how much time that allows a person and makes this type of things very achievable. Albeit overkill since you‚Äôll just run out of things to do well before phase 2
---
2 plus 2 equals 4, minus 1 dats 3.. quick maffs.
---
I think you're incredibly naive lol
---
I believe in the quest chain Thrall has some dialogue that although it is affecting alliance by taking her out it would be a step forward in horde-alliance retlations.  Thrall just trying to be pre-emptively peaceful by slaying dragons.
---
10g
---
I believe it‚Äôs just called Extended Character Stats
---
POM Pyro his ass
---
/spit /slap
---
Thanks.
---
MC can be resisted at anytime during the control, Tauren probably resisted that at the very beginning
---
lvl 10
---
This is me in 3 years.
---
US servers?
---
First time I see someone fall through the map. Cool to see they added measures to not get stuck in an endless fall. Also cool that your body spawns at the graveyard because otherwise you'd probably have to take ress sickness otherwise.
---
Is there a decent subreddit for hunters? I tried looking found one thats retail and one for about every other class. Just not hunters.
---
not entirely... if the hunters are also 60 and the dude isn't hiding in stormwind or weird not 60ish zones... you know. farming rep or mats.
---
Well, that's obvious. [What do you do with a Wii-Remote?](https://i.imgur.com/rRfVFzz.jpg)
---
ok, so its true. but that makes me super curious to why you hid your character name? seems incredibly uneeded.
---
I was responding to OP of this line of comments, not towards the OP of the entire post, this is how reddit works. You can have sub discussions within a meta  discussion.
---
Just noticed the one in the fireplace
---
as long as it doesn‚Äôt go anywhere in the direction that cata +++ went to what we have on retail now.
---
People put too much weight into this. Get over it. If you were gifted the gold you‚Äôd take it too so just let the guy play his game and maybe play the game too instead of crying over a grown man playing video games.
---
Thanks for sharing your experience.  
---
The character who buy it from me told me to contact him for every CD, I think he is trying to be ready asap to make a Legendary, as he is level 60, warrior and GM of his guild.
---
Because the vast vast majority of the player base has real life commitments and is still far away from level 60. It would suck to hit 60 after phase 2 release. This phase isn‚Äôt about the end game content or the pvp this phase is about the leveling. Many people don‚Äôt realize that
---
Yeah I'll probably, for sure, going that route! Thanks man!
---
75% of my game time is in the barrens
---
You are doing everything right
---
I started to enjoy Rogue more when I got Riposte, then even more when you get Blade Flurry
---
I think you overestimate the resources and ability of Blizzard to do detailed investigations like this and outright prove it. They don't have hundreds of employees trained or available to do this.
---
I cant give you any tips, but i can recommend you watch world of paladincraft.
---
There's some benefit to the metric fuckton of idiots rolling mage because LUL spellcleave leveling. And that's that my chance to kill one on open PvP as a warrior is like 50% instead of 5% now. So many terrible players rolling fotm, it's hilarious. 
---
And for some reason they always pick the fights they can't win. Just Saturday I was questing with a shaman buddy of mine in Searing Gorge, I think 47 and 48. A 60 gnome mage came by and thought it was fun to dunk me while I was at a quarter HP fighting two mobs. Corpse camped that fucker all the way from the cauldron to Thorium Point. Like holy shit, don't attack questing players more than 10 levels below you, asshole. Or if you do, at least win lol.
---
What are they talking about exactly? I know a lot of people farmed instances. Was that an exploit? Meaning doing, for example, SM GY 5 times in a row. I did that but if I remember correctly you could always do an instance multiple times?
---
Nintendo wack 11.  Its not as catchy.
---
STV
---
I think it would be more interesting to see tbc unfold with no chars at lvl 60 at the beginning. Because I leveled my shamy at the start of tbc I lost a lot of time against all the other guys who sticked to their mains. Would be nice to see a fresh new start of tbc
---
None of the above.  Rather TBC+, not even WOTLK. 
---
TBC was a beautifully done expansion which did not compromise the core game.  It added two well thought out races to each faction, allowed for paladin / shamans on both factions, introduced outland which was a super impressive zone and while it introduced flying mounts, flying was only available in the outlands.  And like others I believe flying should stay there as world pvp in the core world would die otherwise.
---
To see new content added to TBC without raising the level cap beyond 70 would be the purest form of real WoW that I could think of.
---
Haha that is awesome :D
---
***Quicktime***
---
imho all always should roll need to avoid missunderstandings
---
im high enough level for that? someone said they tried stv at lvl 32 but it was to hard
---
Sounds like a guild for me
---
I healed all dungeons in shadow specc, even ubrs and brd.
---
Which nameplate add-on are they using?
---
Un dungeon it's usually a mob that flew and is like km behing you hugging a wall a 1%.
---
Because you don't get locked out from bosses, you get locked into an ID without the bosses in them. So if you respawn the bosses you can kill them.
---
haha do u honestly believe that? They surely dont have the data about each loot and time. Also I doubt that the most noticeable people like streamers who used this bug will even be 'punished'.
---
Build quality was always shit and their customer service was never as good as Logitech. The Razer hype train has just slowed down.
---
Boss =/= Elite. A boss requires an entire raid. BFA forgot about that since every player is basically a boss.
---
Make a wow 2, not 100 expansions god damn it.
---
its blizzard they have the resources but do they give a fuck is the question
---
You shouldn't need a slot number with classic. 
---
Sometimes if you update the macro with new weapon you have to equip it first. Sounds dumb.. but took me awhile.
---
Just talk with the group. Communication is key.
---
Pretty much invite another Person.
---
You log out with the character you are inside the dungeon with.
---
The other peson (outside the dungeon) resets it while you are offline
---
You Login again and are at the beginning of the reset dungeon
---
Why though ? Where is it written that its forbidden ? It's just clever usr of sharding mechanics haha
---
Layering must be banned.
---
Pretty much the same, except there‚Äôs one specific Horde guild on Whitemane that I will KOS no matter what.
---
You can do this as any class. What he said has nothing to do with "tank privilege".
---
True... true. But one person having 10 of them to sell is shady.
---
The big exploits only come out after the big guilds have already been using it for weeks and finished using it. The torch room exploit was a secret for about 1.5 weeks well after all the top Guilds got to 60 and then it starts to leak out.
---
Fair point. AFAIK there was talk about rolling the perpretrators back to the previous backup as punishment with a one week suspension. I mean they obviously could detect who had done it, somehow.
---
The fear worked though, particularly for me who never played vanilla before then I had no idea what was a bug and what was a quirky vanilla thing. I refused to grab the UBRS FR buff because I heard of people being banned for it during vanilla.
---
Shot answer: no
---
But here i≈ü what you can do for saying the pain:
---
Download bartender4
---
Now /bartender4 allows you to lock-unlock and move your bars around. Reorganize all your bars and stack them to gather. 
---
Probably a 3 or 4 row of 10 buttons or so.
---
 Once you are done, close the bartender4 window and type /kb now bartender allows you to move your mouse over a button and press a button. From now on that button is bind to the key. Close the gui and enjoy.
---
Keybinding will never stick to a spell but with this addon you can map entire bar in a few seconds. Instead of waiting minutes with blizzar keybinding menus.
---
The damage has be done, we dont know in what extent and its impact to each server.  Reseting raid bosses means that its possible that many endgame mats and recipes were injected to the economy etc, what a shit show.
---
There was no where near the playerbase playing in vanilla.
---
Jokes on us, he was only pretending to be retarded.
---
Cheers.
---
Stop crying

---
Maybe you are thinking of Tank Spot.
---
I have no idea if they are still around
---
I always took need as someone who literally needs to use the item.
---
If what your saying is the case cant someone need on every expensive blue/purple item just because it vendors for alot .
---
In this case i still think you roll greed because your greeding for the expensive  BoE but thats just IMO.
---
I know I can't have herbalism and mining radar up at the same time. Would it be possible to have a macro which switches between the two? Basically I would like to have one keypress, if herb radar is active, turn it off, and switch to mining. On the next press it would switch back to herbs, and so on.
---
If they REALLY want a certain piece of gear and are not willing to roll against others for it, they have to start and lead the group.
---
That way they can simply fill the group with people not needing that gear. Works with most of gear, except for maybe casters having to share some BiS with healers as you always need a healer.
---
You a dps warrior and need that good shit leather gear? Start a group with only mages and priests etc.
---
Yeah, on my server it was half an hour queue just to to get a chance to accept the quest to go get the apples. At least they are some benches nearby, so i could sit down and have a conversation.
---
Well, the 2 1/2 hour sunken temple run already 2 hours in is still ruined. I care more for completed dungeons runs than stuff people can buy from the auction house.
---
That's why a good 30% of runs I join have hiccups in various degrees while my advertised runs where I lay out the party rules as the group lead and tank have a 99% completion rate. 
---
Ninjas are everywhere, can't take the risk every single run possibly being cut short wasting an hour of my time every 5th run.   
---
In lowbie dungeon with crap loot it's okay-ish. I don't care, but in high level dungeons recipes, patterns, items worth thousands of gold each drop frequently. 
---
I'm not passing on that for the sake of the run to be completed.
---
I could not disagree harder with the progression picture. Make it so end game isn't just nothing but dungeons and raids. Otherwise you risk pushing a higher and higher percentage of players out of the game world and into instanced content. Some players do not like feeling like they can only do dungeons and raids to progress. Add more epic chain quests and outdoor content.
---
I'd love to see Hyjal be something of an elite outdoor zone. Or maybe non-elites close to the main path. Think something like Jintha'Alor but on a nearly zone-wide scale, littered with 5,10,20, and 40 man outdoor bosses (with appropriate respawn times).
---
I've wondered this myself. Having done several LBRS runs, there's always mage who wants to farm the pattern for archmage robe, but the idea is clearly that they alone get to need on it, and no one has opposed it. Similarly no one said anything when I needed greater fire res potion as alchemist, which seems to go for 100g in AH.
---
Where does it end? Can I need flask recipes too with the excuse of being alchemist? Obviously I'll learn them if I do, but seems unfair to "steal" 500g from the party.
---
You mean the quest that literally rewards you with a 10-slot bag?
---
Would Venriki really do this? I have a completly neutral opinion about him but he doesnt seem like the guy to be doing this, especially it could impact his income.
---
Some ppl ask money and you can /follow him, while he transfer you into another zone.
---
Find what you can sell :)
---
I would also try placing /equip before changing stances.
---
Same people, most people wanted an expansion. And some people didn‚Äôt like the one we got, so private servers became a thing. Farther down the line of expansions you get the more unhappy people are. And I‚Äôm not trying to sound superior to anyone lol I‚Äôm stating that a group of people‚Äôs wish to not give up the past, a group of people who seem to be insanely toxic and rude to anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with them, and let‚Äôs face it a group of people who‚Äôs major demographic is likely a those who have an unhealthy obsession with the game, shouldn‚Äôt jurisdict the future of it for everyone. At the very least, like osrs, a way to vote in game should be put into place, and the first subject to vote on should be weather or not classic+ should be something that‚Äôs worked toward.
---
In retail I was force name changed twice on my warrior (turd). I just typed in turd again and it let me log right back in. Is that not the case with classic?
---
When people who don‚Äôt really understand WoW and hear it mentioned they have an image enter their head. An image of a pale skinned, frail, sun deprived, whiny voiced, almost certain virgin, who no one would ever want to be friends with in real life.

Hello guildm8

Wow, just wow.
---
Go to stv, or grind out hundreds of mobs. IC you pick option 2 find ones that drop stuff you can vendor for a lot of cash. The elementals in arathi have good drops iirc
---
You‚Äôre Alliance or Horde?
---
well the dude at the counter looks like he's got all the time in the world....
---
"Anyone who disagrees with me is uninformed". 
---
You see. Maybe, just maybe, attempting to coordinate a guild to a server which pigeon held you to a launch server (which was always going to be fucked) was a bad idea. Maybe, if you're SUCH a well reasoned researcher of servers and guild coordinator, you could've told your guild you will officially pick a server 4 to 5 days after launch to guarantee this issue of yours would not be a problem. 
---
You are bad at this.
---
Maybe if you would admit that to yourself you could save us the "full pop server victimhood" that pervades this subreddit.

A mage is designed to kite stuff. Your mobility, combined with the ability to slow things, is your greatest defence.

Hey, aren't you the guy from the warlizard gaming forum?

Yo, playing wow for the first time in 12 years. Currently a level 19 warrior, I followed the Fury talent tree as per this popular guide [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxX1WQILnM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxX1WQILnM). Just found out sit crits don't proc blood craze or enrage. This makes me think Arms is much better, should I respec?
---
If any one has a tree to follow that would be great
---
/r/iamveryrandom
---
1k needles
---
Are you using some software like AHK or isBoxer? Or just macros?
---
In any case what you're doing is really impressive!
---
At first I thought that was my problem, but now that I have equipped the sword and it's soulbound the macro is still not working. 
---
Do you think this might be a bug?
---
Aww, little druid is learning how to do rogue staff in the cat form.
---
Damage is not irreparable but for you to assume that if no bans/gold roll backs are taken that there will not be some very rich players, extremely MORE rich than everyone else. Is just outright ignorant.
---
Some patterns/BoEs are selling for a few hundred gold on my realm now, guilds are pooling money to buy them for regular raiders (Mine included). If people find a way to quickly farm these items and sell a ton at once they will be a lot richer than everyone else.
---
Secrets of an engineer;)
---
It is a bad stat you fucking shitter.
---
There are very few cases where you would take agi over hit, ap, or crit and you would NEVER take it over weapon skill.
---
Just shut the fuck up because you are clueless.
---
Says less likely, doesn‚Äôt say you won‚Äôt.
---
Literally
---
&gt; Rogue - rogues just like to be assholes for shits and giggles. No idea why would someone want to date a rogue. Plus you know how rogues like to do it - DEFINITELY LOSE. 
---
According to real life this seem to be the winner.
---
Some boe go for 400-1000 gold or more 
---
That‚Äôs not just some cash that‚Äôs a LOT 
---
Like if it‚Äôs a guild group it should go to the guy who needs it but in a random group ? Everyone should just roll need at that point 
---
That only goes for these obscene amount of gold items 
---
Like 100hold isn‚Äôt enough that should go to who actually uses it
---
yeah, its a struggle. if the item is something boss specific, like flask or tailoring recipe, stating it prior to run is the key. but some random world drop could cause big mess
---
Classic Bryce. Hunter bags is all he ever talks about!
---
That‚Äôs just what he named it, fitting since it‚Äôs a pile of bones. Guessing he tamed something which didn‚Äôt lose its appearance.
---
Calamitys grasp. Been there farming that
---
It‚Äôs very possible. They can rollback your character to a specific point in time, or if they really wanted to, can look at inventory gold and auction house logs to remove specifically the amounts of items and gold from the exploit runs. It‚Äôs not if they can, it‚Äôs if they will bother going to all that trouble.
---
Most importantly it vendors for a gold,
---
jesus you really are this stupid... 15 gold a run? A RUN?? Did you even read the original post? It's not a RUN, it's a LAYER RESET. Even if it were only 15 gold, that's still a lot, and you have to factor in the timeframe this has been going on... As for the pattern, obviously they're not getting 1000g per pattern, but whatever gold they get for it, even if it's a low amount, it's still going into their pockets. And DUH obviously there are players controlling certain markets, but guess fucking what??? They earned that shit by playing fairly, by playing the game, not exploiting it, so they deserve to be doing so. Camping shit for hours is a commitment also. And since those people aren't sitting on a MASSIVE gold pile capital by default, it's way more difficult to actually control markets, since you have limited resources, so you don't actually have an iron grip on the given market, as opposed to exploiters who have way more capital, and can literally do whatever they want with it. You finally getting the picture?   
---
And there can be multiple reasons why OP opted not to provide a screenshot, like for example TRYING NOT TO GET BANNED... The info he gave on the exploit was absolutely true, why wouldn't the rest of it be??  
---
As for blizzard tracking gold and banning fucking DUH. But there's still a lot of things that can happen. A chinese farmer obviously is going to trade the gold to either their alts or customers. But an exploiter? Again, what if he walks up to lil timmy in Stormwind and opens a trade, and lil timmy accepts all that gold because WOAH DUDE THANKS. Will Blizzard ban that random lil timmy eventhough he's technically innocent? Are they gonna track ALL of these cases down one by one and review them? You REALLY think they have the manpower to do that?? What if the exploiter goes around and trades just 500g to each person he sees in Orgrimmar? Is Blizzard gonna ban every single one of those people that accepted? Ofcourse not. Do they have the means to track down and remove that 500g from each and every one of those people, IF they still haven't even spent it? You guessed it (although I'm doubtful), NO! That gold is already in the world, in the bloodflow, in the economy. The damage is done and irreversible.
---
He's part of a 13 quest questchain that gives you Linkens master sword, the final quest is called "It's dangerous to go alone".
---
The quests take you between ungoro, Tanaris, Feralas, Felwood and Winterspring
---
agree sir
---
He can have her
---
except he is a druid and this very boss drops pre-raid bis weapon for ferals, which only has 3 charges so druids need multiple copies of it.
---
You migrate to hell
---
Because I've done about 200 BRD runs and if Johnny Thundercock the level 57 shaman snags Ironfoe when it finally drops I may just lose it.
---
I advertise it as a splendid opportunity to get your HoJ as I do many many lava runs and you're welcome to join in, but that hammer if it drops is mine.
---
Bombs were commonly used so he didn‚Äôt even really have to prove it.

uhhhh no
---
Is this the hulk holgan guild?
---
Overpower him.
---
Lol, lol.
---
That's cute but the discussion to be had on what to do after the phases run out is an important one to be had. To add new content in a horizontal progression, to release other older expansions such as BC, or to keep it frozen in time as a novelty act(which inevitably dwindles over time until the niche market remains), or some other solution.
---
It's something people at Blizzard are surely thinking and discussing. You may as well pretend you have influence in the outcome and do so as well.
---
What ruined it for me about becoming the Hero is that I just don't deserve it. I skim through most quest texts, and level for the sake of leveling. And that feels fine as just another soldier/adventurer. You know, that greedy adventurer who's in it for the gold.
---
But in retail, everyone praise you, want you for War Chief and shit, the ONE hero (with 4 alts who are also the ONE) and I don't even remember what I did tbh.
---
Lol, haha, lol.
---
No worries dude. I've done that before.
---
Depends, Satyr Bow is fair game for both and hunters should keep their paws well off Striker's Mark.
---
Keep in mind I'm not saying that is the only way to handle end game content. Just the way I wouldn't mind seeing new raids and dungeons added, the idea being rather than simply pushing the tiers every new dungeon, they fill in gaps and provide other avenues for acquiring tier 0, 1, and 2 level gear.
---
A Jintha'Alor inspired Hyjal with world bosses would be so dope.
---
I am on PVP server Firemaw, spend lvl 30 to 32 on the Shimmering flats, never even saw pvp combat, it was one big Kumbaya MEETING. DISGUSTING.
---
Gnomes working together with undead, dwarves being best buddies with orcs..

On the same server arathi and hillsbrad were constant war zones..  
---
Thefumes from the dried salt must have drugged everybody....  Or maybe it's the sun, I don't know.

Seems a bit wrong to cancel a subscription like that, he may no work for them still but unless he signed a contract stating that the subscription was dependent on him working there l, how would they justify it?
---
Also assuming you have a decent group and clear speed is fast bloodrage will be on cooldown which slows that initial combo down so during the last pack pull u can switch back to battle stance and pool some rage ready for the next pack so you don‚Äôt need bloodrage to have enough rage for sweeping strikes.
---
Naga rogue.
---
Technically its still a grind.
---
This list is generalisation, I can tell you these classes can do MUCH more than most people think, if you put in the effort.
---

---
Hell yeah brother
---
I came here to post this! I think I just hit like 24 and I am so hyped for Un'goro and Feralas and so many of these questing zones. It's been so long!
---
I'm just happy with how it is. Yes, there are some differences, but hey, 1.12 is what I wanted.
---
MC and Ony would be doable no matter what, and i didn't went for speed clearing those, so it's nearly no difference for me at all.
---
The game is RUINED now! The economy is DESTROYED! Classic is a failed experiment and it has FAILED! Shut the servers down, Blizzard! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!! WE SAID NO CHANGES!!!!! KILL THE BETRAYERS!!
---
Or, you know, let Blizzard handle it and move on.
---
hehe just did that q yesterday!
---
But man ... after that he needs a sword and that's a real deal, there is zero of them on AH :(
---
Didn't the guild that got banned literally alter game files to skip to C'Thun?
---
Its actually even "better" than what earlier described. With this exploit, you would just "do the exploit" and the boss would respawn right infront of you, you didnt even have to walk out or move.
---
Am I the only one that‚Äôs noticed Rumplforskin in trade chat?
---
Can be a wait, Aszhara was pretty desolate in vanilla.
---
You can't babysit your own kid. That is called parenting
---
yeah its not like any guild who used an exploit to farm specific bosses ever had anything bad happen to them
---
Just been reading all this hate for like two hours guess I‚Äôm quick to jump on people lol. Blizzard has the worst fans of any community I can think of.
---
You're much nicer than me.  If I see horde I will literally MC as far from the coast as I can.  I'm an utter asshole
---
There is a guild on my server called Dead Naga Storage. Almost choked on my water when I saw it.
---
At first 30 level I pressed greed for all boe blues (butcher etc) but the rogues who rolled Need never equipped them. From now on I just say all need whenever a boe drops. 
---
Last night, on our way to maraudon, an epic leather glove for rogue dropped. Told entire group to need, they did, as a warrior i won it. (70g on ah). Rogue was unhappy but that is what happens when they never equip it at all.
---
Right, but killing one boss for one drop that you can solo anyway isn't as bad as farming a boss like Baron that drops Pre-raid bis, a mount, and can't be soloed.
---
Well the hunter quivers do give % range attack speed which strangely works on wands too
---
Stalagg 100% has character migration enabled, had like 20 guildies transfer while I was trying to make my shop button appear. I just don‚Äôt understand why the shop button is not appearing.
---
Well seeing how that rare spawn isn‚Äôt found in DWM, nice story.
---
That doesn't happen. Generally talking about reserving stuff is superlame to me too. People assume some basic unspoken rules, but those rules feel different to me than what they were 15 years ago. IIRC everything expensive was greeded on back then.
---
&gt;attacking while having advantage is a dick move
---
Yikes

Fuck this guy

I love how people keep giving excuses that bug exploiting ( in this case Layer hopping), is fine and they can do it because its blizzard fault.   meanwhile you have this section in EULA.

---
Like it‚Äôs working for bosses? Or people are just exploiting it to farm the trash.
---
You are generalising PVP and WF is not part of a shaman's core toolkit at all. In fact, WF is rarely used.
---
Say that to the Warrior that rolled need on the Deep Fathom Ring. I guess it has 3 Stamina on it smh
---
its a fucking boe, its gold for everyone. having a driver's license is no necessity for participating in a lottery for a porsche.

You only needed two layers because when your party left layer one for layer 2 it reset layer one because no one was there.  Then when you finish layer 2 you relayer and end up in layer 1, which is now a fresh layer.  Rinse, wash, repeat.  Think about all the BIS you can get.  Go to any boss in UBRS and do it until every person in every class in your ten man group has what they need. He‚Äôll go twenty man.  You can kill a boss in what ... 3 min.  It‚Äôs the time to get there that slows you down.   In half an hour you should have every drop the boss has at least once. Another 30 min at least twice ... and so on.   You could have an entire guild at BIS in days.   That effects everything from PVP to end game.
---
you missing link rofl
---
Except in the instance of those using Honorbuddy like bots in the last 2 years blizzard has never perma banned anyone in a situation like this unless they were already on their last strike. 
---
So either get all your salt out now or be ready to let it out next week after the punishment is doled out in 14-30 day bans.
---
I'm sorry, but headless horseman was released in TBC.
---
This is what you get when you implement a new thing without proper QA.
---
Do people in this sub actually believe Blizzard will ban streamers? :D
---
Yo is that a nose ring?
---
Classic WoW is my first WoW experience, can someone explain what the party did so I can avoid the same fate?
---
When MC breaks and you jump / walk with the controlled character, you'll start jumping / walking with your character. In later Expansion you need to repress the walk/jump after MC breaks. 
---
I must admit I killed myself like this once or twice before Molten Core, walking alliance scum into the lava. Karma.
---
Yeah cry that you have free not so effective water.
---
Yeah arms is way better for leveling. Haven‚Äôt watched the video but maybe the fury talents were for endgame dps
---
If you're sure you won't get bored by phase 3, which is also a factor.
---
I can't watch because work. Can someone explain what's going on?
---
Can someone please explain to me what layering is and why it seems to be a big issue in Classic?
---
Yea reveals his age/ humor.
---
No it isn't, so whatever they are reporting you for it's just hogging time from real reports. Great idea, jackasses.
---
How does changing loot type work mid-instance? Are they able to change it as the boss is about to die, or right after it's dead but before looting it?
---
Kalimdor is waaayyy more peaceful imo
---
Lol you waited 9 days to reply? It took you that long to find a link to some video?
---
Can somebody explain to a really old player what this means please ?
---
You're a fucking womble
---
Yet Asmongold does this and everyone thinks its hilarious?
---
Abuse early, abuse often.
---
Blizzard employs a 3-strike rule. First ban is for 7 days which is worth it for some players. Full tier AND a week vacation? Yes, please.
---
Imagine crying over SM gear
---
As a warrior, I never invited hunters to sm armory, because of that. It is the only safe way.
---
You sure?
---
My understanding is the following
---
1) Each realm is it's own container
---
2) Each container has several servers (layers)
---
3) These servers are independant of each other, other than that they are interconnected and character can migrate between layers
---
I've tried to [visualize](https://imgur.com/a/m8PlYoC) it with  paint but if incorrect - Would you mind giving your explanation? 
---
I might need another cup of coffee before i can explain it better haha.
---
Of course it will. But how is it different from, say, a boss addon telling you to move when the boss is about to hit you? That also gives you an advantage in the game over players who don't have this addon...
---
Blizzard don't ban individual addons. They have no mechanism for doing it. All they do is change how their own API works so that those addons no longer have the ability to do what they do.
---
In other words, Blizz won't ban a specific addon, because:
---
1. They can't. Addons are something that's entirely under player control.
---
2. Tomorrow someone might make a similar addon that offers the same functionality, and they would have to do it all over again.
---
I want this addon gone as well (and not because I play a stealth class). I hope they find a way to disable it without breaking important parts of the game.
---
I don't understand this. Not that it's a reason for the guy to go crazy, but how do you accidentally need an item?
---
On benediction there's like 2 layers
---
Sorry, new to this sub what did these guys do wrong?
---
I disagree, ninja looting is quite different. In terms of loot, you are going with a group of people who you either know, or are willing to group up for because of some form of trust. When you get ganked, despite your level or current hp/mana, you don‚Äôt have that same trust factor with literally an enemy faction. The enemy faction has absolutely no obligation to not kill you just because you think you are entitled to not be killed.
---
Hi,
---
Been weeks and can't decide my rogue's race.. Friends are alliance, so I went dwarf for originality and good racial, but... I hesitate with gnome which are "stealthier" and more annoying for others but average/bad racial for rogue.  
---
Any insight? **I really deep struggle, Dwarf, gnome, ... or ... UD for nostalgia ?**
---
Knowing I'll do a mage quite soon after or in parrall√®le (so UD or Gnome)  
---
thanks in advance, question asked billions times by ppl, but still can't damn decide, this make no sense..
---
It's exactly how you should do them.
---
People from the matchmaking era of gaming. What matters to then is their satisfaction and everyone else is basically a faceless NPC they will never see again. Bloody disgraceful!
---
This made my day!
---
when enemy is at 80% health? naaaah
---
It is
---
No one needs to be buffed. People just need put in more effort to make things work.
---
Even on the most populated servers there are only single digit layers. Its not that unreasonable
---
Pretty sure might is only melee attack power.
---
If you‚Äôre using frost nova  at the end of a spellcast like Frostbolt, the damage of the spell will hit the target after frost nova and may break it.
---
IMO no C+, just do seasons like in D3
---
Any insights on which leatherworking gear is attractive for selling on the AH on all level ranges? For example, I have been able to market Barbaric Bracers and Dark Leather Shoulders quite well - due to a lack of competition from items from Drops/Quests in the level range. I'm wondering what other items I should focus on to make gold. Thanks!
---
3rd one
---
Your statement reminds me just how different the mindset of the player base used to be. I remember the fierce debate between players back in the day over wether creative use of game mechanics were violating the spirit of the game, people would argue for days over wether the ‚Äústand on the hill‚Äù‚Äôstrat for Archimonde invalidated your kill or not.
---
Now? Well, let‚Äôs just day on retail a very common statement is ‚Äúexploit early, exploit often‚Äù lol
---
Blizz permad professional boy farms. But only temped botters with singular instances.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5c7zkf/bot_banning_and_why_6_month_bans_work/
---
Sometimes Blizz permas to set an example like account sharing, but I haven't heard of any regular players getting permed.
---
It was in the nova too but within melee range
---
STV was avoidworthy on unbalanced privates, too.
---
IF YOU DONT READ EVERY QUEST YOURE LITERALLY KILLING CLASSIC
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
I've been at work the last few days and haven't touched WoW. What's been going on with the instance abuse?
---
Fuck! I always miss out on shit like this ... I mean boo this is bad!
---
Rip /u/iamwussupwussup . You will be missed.
---
Where you lived? Are you a mormon or something?
---
Thrall is such a good leader.
---
I think they also banned several people during DS when righteous fury was bugged and made paladins do 100x the damage of any other class.    Groups used it to easily clear content and were banned.
---
????????
---
Have you even raided with a guild before lmfao
---
Not really, most world pvp happens while out levelling or farming mats - those things exist regardless of arena.
---
Typical Horde
---
Look at those loosers downvoting me.
---
I don't get why people are obsessing about non endgame loot in the first place.
---
Your server is a big part of it. Odds are you and the cat you replied to have quite different pops on your respective realms.
---
&gt; Edit: It's worth noting that this is because Enh shammy was intended to be the shaman tank tree. Shaman has tanking abilities and talents sprinkled into enhance and their basic kit, but it never quite hit the point where it became viable. Mostly because they just don't get the raw armor value and have no taunts even if their single target threat generation can be pretty crazy (care when earth shocking as a shammy in dungeons for this reason). But since this was apparently aimed at being a pve tank, none of the benefits are really pvp viable as defenses either. It's easy to see where they intended to go with shammy in those senses, but it never quite came together enough for it to be competitive with other specs.
---
Shaman can tank raids, it just require effort. Here is a Shaman Tank guide https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150
---
Hunter pet management sounds horrible
---
what's the problem with that ?
---
Check the page classic wowhead and then maybe delete this rant ;-)
---
Because the game is 15 years old, it is not new and will not progress and have expansions after. 
---
People who played back then are far more likely to not have time to play it now (such as myself, I'm still playing just barely have the time with a newborn etc)
---
People will have came back for the nostalgia and realised it's not how they remembered, especially considering temporary layers, using late game stats, no BGs for the first phase, and AoE farming dungeons being a thing - and once most people are 60 those that haven't kept up with private servers will realise that you need engineering/FAP/tidal charm/chicken trinket etc
---
People who didn't play it but are coming from retail or later expansions will have a huge brick wall in front of them because they will be used to a very different game.
---
I'm not saying everyone will quit, not at all, but it's evident people are already starting to - from the people who just can't handle the style of the game (a group of my friend's friend's have gone back to retail for example), to people who are seeing this modern gameplay (AoE farming dungeons etc) in an old game, and thinking.. That's not how we should be playing.
---
Again it's worth mentioning Classic's player base was front loaded, as in, everyone (read: the vast majority) will have joined from either when servers opened or within that first week or so rather than more and more over time increasing rapidly. The only thing that can happen now, as everyone including blizzard have predicted, is a steep drop until population plateaus with people who are dedicated to playing.
---
 The Reckoning sit! Shifu didn't teach you that. He didn't, i figured it out. Skadoosh
---
We don't talk about kidztwo. Not since the accident.
---
Haha what a shithead
---
Shaman Tanking or shaman dps?
---
Well yeah, seeing as most assholes tend towards popular classes that someone told them were 'overpowered' to compensate for their lack of confidence.
---
&gt;Exploits happen, it'll get taken care of.
---
No, it won't people already have 100k gold. Not all of them will get banned because Blizz is too incompetent to read their own data.
---
Masterloot change is bannable
---
I dunno I sure have seen a lot of flask recipes for sale feels like they came from this
---
This is intentional a guild that starts with M and auto buying anything under 15g in order to extort the realm into paying 400g for a set of the Armor. Very scummy people
---
PUBG feels even more unplayable than when it was released.
---
Who is Kidztwo?
---
LAst night I was camping a named elite quest mob Rok ALim, or somthing like that.   When he finally spawned my partner disconnected , and although I could solo him as a druid , it was close. About the same time a Rare Centaur with hyena guards  ran through our fighting spot and I tagged the rare right before a couple of other player's noses.  Instead of letting me die and tagging the rare themselves, they healed me and pulled the guards off me.   The centaur dropped quite nice  green lvl 28 cloth shoulders of the Eagle, so I gave them to one of them, who was a cloth wearer. 
---
It's a great game indeed!
---
Rogue + mage teams could easily counter that
---
I believe this is best summed up as:
---
L2P
---
My guild transferred day 3 of original transfers opening (From Skeram). It was pretty concerning at first, given how absolutely dead the server was (We‚Äôre talking less than 50 people above level 30 during peak). 
---
It is dramatically improved since the other 3 servers were offered transfers here. It‚Äôs still much smaller, but you now see constant spam for all level brackets of content, outside of endgame. Alliance side though, there‚Äôs 3 builds that are fairly well stocked in the 50+ department.
---
Spellpower is the way to go. Intellect only increases you mana pool and chance to get a critical strike. The mana pool thing doesn't matter because of Life Tap granting effectively infinite mana, and crit isn't an effective stat for the DoT spells that are your best friend. Also, crits are uncontrollable; itemizing for crit means you could crit on your last hit on a mob and overkill it, wasting some of the stat's value in a sense.
---
+spellpower and +shadow damage, on the other hand, benefit every tick of damage you do. It makes your spells significantly more efficient. Life tap does shadow damage to you and thus restores more mana, and a fully channeled drain life in +spellpower gear can give you 40-50% of your health bar or more.
---
When theres two full parties waiting for a quest mob to respawn, I‚Äôm quite happy that I can choose to hop layers and get it done quick. Other than that I‚Äôve barely noticed layers exist tbh.
---
Not in BGs they can‚Äôt. Besides AB and sometimes AV.
---
Can someone ELI5 please
---
The economies will be fine relax lol deleting people‚Äôs retail accounts is overkill. Keep in mind these people are paying money to play this game and have for a long time. Exploiting an easily exploitable bug a week into release is not worth having years and years of time and money taken away from you
---
&gt; You say this, but you havent actually said WHY it is a bad thing that people have the gear they need.
---
A lot of people feel like they're finished when they get all their gear. To get them back in the game, Bliz releases a new update with noticeably stronger gear every couple of months. So rather than it being a momentous occasion for your BiS to drop, loot just gets you a few steps ahead on the treadmill before it resets with the next update.
---
The major appeal of Classic is that it is a slow-progression RPG where investment over time is (usually) more valuable than mechanical skill. Whereas for an action game like Retail, investment is less valued compared to the satisfaction of executing mechanics and therefore a much faster 'gearing cycle' is necessary so that players wont feel like their mechanical skill is being held back by gear.
---
I'm not saying that one of those systems is objectively better than the other, but the core philosophy of each is very different.
---
Somehow I don't believe you.
---
Yo, yeah.
---
you may aswell just quit now then.
---
It ain't happening
---
Nope. Usually it‚Äôs a good idea to keep it in the same spot for memory purposes. Once you get it right it‚Äôs not too bad.
---
There is no double standard here. I agree with the streamer on all but one point. That point being that I don't consider stream sniping toxic but rather the logical conclusion of streaming your position on a PvP server. It's not even like this is everquest or tibia where dying is more than a minor inconvenience.
---
This is where my pom pyro mage would come in handy
---
Xy8
---
It's just the daily reddit bs, don't sweat it. Also, it's "losers".    
---
You can be loose, after you loses your virginity the other way.
---
No just proof that layers are going to be exploited. Should layers be removed, prob not because que times suck and it's a necessary evil. I just don't understand why ppl can't admit that it's a problem.
---
Not advertising this at the beginning on the dungeon is ninja looting, plain and simple.
---
Then we're safe :D thanks for the info :)
---
Found the exploiter
---
Well there's a record of everything that happens ingame, so it is technically possible. We'll see if they can be bothered to go that far though
---
This is why I'm a misanthrope.
---
Did they drop from the people vultures?
---
To be honest, I was running on a piss poor laptop. Probably turned up all settings for this screenshot and had like 2 fps before dumping them again.
---
Your part of the problem then by allowing them to continue their shit selfish behavior.
---
Lots of jabs at the changes tbc brought to the game
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295114/repeat-instance-exploit-to-be-fixed-and-blizzard-issuing-punishments
---
Please do give us an update on how long the ban is.
---
Hm, he's going down fast, he's going to need a big slow heal...  Oops, didn't make it in time.
---
Jesus Christ you're dumb, it sounds like you've never even hit Max level
---
You prove your good by farming consumables etc for the guild and getting pre raid bis pieces
---
Dkp is for lazy casual plebs that don't want to actually play the game
---
You on Horde? I know there's a Toronto Kromkrush guild on Horde side
---
Don't they say in their Classic policy that GM will intervene if clear loot rules are violated?
---
We pay a sub for vanilla (I've not played retail since mid tbc) and back then paid a sub too (about ¬£8 a month).
---
I am probably not a reliable person having quit mid tbc but my friends who play retail just tell me the community here is nicer, more friendly and they prefer it; with most of them having started wow in tbc or wotlk. I like to think that people play games for the people and there's enough to do, especially cause some days I'll go help someone out or grind a recipe someone wants Etc
---
I swear they are using some of that nostalrius private server code shit, so many bullshit stuff happening, like mobs getting stuck in a terrain or just walk thru everything
---
Shaman tank or shaman dps?
---
"punitive measures" doesn't mean anything. If this is another slap on the wrists 1 week ban then I'll lose all faith.
---
I don't blame him.  I explained this quest twice to my group and they still messed it up.
---
Cant you report this to GM and get a strike aginst his account?
---
Watched on mobile so I didn't catch those details, what did he do to be cocky?
---
Wouldn't layering a raid give a different raid ID?
---
The mouse wheel of my 2014 model of razor naga (not chroma) messed up after ~1 year of purchase. I managed to fix it using a YouTube tutorial, but now it's messed up again. Can't decide wether to buy Logitech or scimitar, or maybe roccat nyth/tyon..
---
Care more about your own behaviour and not of what others do or do not do and you will have a better life:)
---
The damage is done. Many guilds and players abused it to the high heavens for about a week already.  
---
I have no faith that Blizzard will be able to correctly identify *all* of the abusers *and* undo the damage done by it. Be it farming tons of pre-BIS equip or the absolute havoc it has caused on the economy.   
---
I fully expect them to release some kind of generic "not much has happened and we banned some people who abused it" statement and then that'll be it. Maybe others will believe it, but I don't.
---
Well don‚Äôt you think the best way to make people start exploiting a bug is to point out the bug exists? I‚Äôm sure they were doing everything they could do to keep it from getting discovered or spread. Now that its possibility is well known they have to speak on it more publicly
---
Congratulations. I just got mine as well, a bit disappointed with its appearance though.
---
I look forward to every one of your posts!
---
Yh, this sub is pretty bad for actual discussion, but that's Reddit for you.
---
It's probably because this sub is full of very casual players. Which inherently isn't really an issue, I mean it's just a game. But the sub is insufferable half the time, with posts about things that take 5 minutes to google.
---
"Exploit early and often" is the phrase I always see.
---
I havent watched him much at all but he does not give off that kind of exploit-vibe. But having 1K gold + epic mount AND baron while the reason being gambling seems suspicious indeed. Baron itself is not suspicious, but lots of gold and now hearing this layering resetting bosses..
---
Yes that's it! Thx! Sad to see that they are no longer creating content
---
The concurrent pop is closer to 13k +/- 2k for full servers based on /who-ing. Definitely not 50k.
---
They've also already reduced 5he number of layers
---
Can someone explain layering to me? I don't know how it works and how it's currently exploited.
---
Sooo RIP Skarm?
---
I enable in-game music and listen to that.
---
I'm also leveling sub. When do you use cheap shot over ambush?
---
Their accounts reset to ‚Äòempty‚Äô and any gold/items they sent removed
---
That's such a massive drag on leveling speed that nobody is doing that. It's a lot less boolean than that in action.
---
&gt;You deserve any punishment you receive for knowingly exploiting.
---
If it's in the game, it's in the game. People shouldn't have to walk on eggshells and follow a secondary set of rules for something that can easily be fixed. You can't blame people for operating within the scope of possibility.
---
Can someone help me figure out a mouse over macro list for healing? Having trouble with some spells so if there‚Äôs maybe a lost or a basic macro template for mouse over healing spells? If so, is it possible to have a macro that allows you to heal your mouse over target or if you‚Äôre mouse isn‚Äôt over anyone it heals the player selected with the same macro button? Or do you have to have two separate buttons for that? Thanks
---
I mean, OSRS did add a ton of content for the end game and added power creep multiple times.  ToB and Zulrah are the easiest two off the top of my head.
---
The ones you said are the biggest
---
I'm only level 31. Perhaps I'm wrong, I'm no expert, I assumed it was for shatter.
---
If, somehow, every quest could have one of these images, I would love it to be an add-on that gives quests these images as splash screens for key bits of quest text
---
I play alliance, so not really.
---
This is so humanity. Find an exploit and abuse it. Look at history.
---
They need to compensate don‚Äôt they?
---
There is nothing in the rules that prevents node swiping. Yes, it's a dick move, but don't act like it's comparable to Need ninjas.
---
In an ideal world, everybody would greed unless it was to equip or use. However, we're not in the ideal world and people will always look to gain an upper hand - minimise the chance of ninjaing by always needing on every valuable including rare/epic BOEs and expensive patterns such as pre-bis robes and flasks.
---
If you are so inclined, you can then give those Edgemasters you needed on to the Warrior or that flask recipe to the Alchemist while limiting the possibility of a ninja.
---
Is it a term, played the game for 15 years and have been fairly involved in a very grey area of the game, I haven't seen that term used once..... 
---
Keeping in mind that, believe it or not, Blizz have actually improved their logging I wouldn't be surprised if boss event exploitation will result in a hefty ban wave. I mean they go as far to log individual node (fish, ore, herbs, chest) interaction. To rely on an exploit that ties you to an instance is pretty dumb if you have any knowledge of what Blizz go after.
---
I've steered clear of this exploit, there are plenty of less risky methods in Classic, with several having a much more consistent return!
---
That was because it let people level extremely fast which means they wont buy boosts.  The other exploit that came in that patch was far more damaging to the economy but nothing was done to the exploiters.  People were able to repeatedly get flasks from what was supposed to be a one time thing for alchemy.  This greatly damaged server economies.
---
gross comparison
---
But is anyone for Princess?
---
Unless you really want to min/max, just play the race that looks cool to you because if you don't like your character later on, especially during the leveling phase, you'll probably just quit.
---
LOOOOOOL just leave already mate.
---
There's 0 chance that blizzard hands out permanent bans for this, strong bans and reverts definitely, permanent no.
---
Also there is zero evidence I've seen of people sitting on hundreds of thousands of gold. What evidence do you have to suggest this apart from meaningless speculation about layer abuse, I'm which blizzard has already stated nothing of the sort as they are carefully tracking the economy?
---
Wow this fight truly looked like a fight from 2004-2006. Jesus christ. Also I keep seeing mages that spam AoE. Dungeons they spam blizzard/flamestrike against 2 mobs. There's zero chance that's more mana efficient and DPS. But this shit in PvP as well... Too used to instant cast spells I guess they can't shake it.
---
Blizz gave people abusing exploits to max their Azerite power a 3 day ban and didn't even take their Azerite power away lol.   
---
I expect nothing. Blizz will be unable to repair the damage this has caused, both economically and gear wise.
---
The economy is fucked if Blizz don't do a good job of getting rid of items gained through the exploit.
---
This really hurts Classic.
---
You misunderstood what I said, I was talking about the Demoralizing Shout threat that weren't at Vanilla values.
---
Yup. And sometimes it doesn't go off at ALL. It goes on cd, no animation, no effect, while standing perfectly still and doing nothing that might break it. 
---
It's really hard to rely on :/
---
failed attempt at being sarcastic.
---
if its meaningless you don't put ML on.
---
A few other people put time into their comments to disagree with me with solid points. But your comment is just bull shit. I didn't participate in the exploit, I'm just trying to argue a point.
---
Best place (fast respawns, not popular area) to farm leather? I am level 34
---
don't pug if you can't take to loos a roll. 
---
We did some 5 men urbs yesterday , so if you don't need the low level don't invite him.. and if you need him? he deserves the loot
---
I don't know. That's not what I am responding to, I am clearing a misconception about what layering is supposed to do.
---
And if I'm being honest, I don't care about layers. I play on a lowpop server with barely any layers, so
---
agree. Esfand did it on stream.
---
Chill man, that attitude of yours will make you burned out sooner then later. Im 43 Warlock and dont give a damn. On vacation at this moment and i dont miss WoW at all. Im typing this while laying at the swimming pool in Cyprus. Next week ill just continue the grind. We all got enough time to get 60 and get raid gear. Enjoy the game man. Ignore the fact that you want to get 60 asap. It is not a sprint.
---
There have been explanations posted on here but the mods have been removing them as they're explaining how to do an exploit.
---
Why will it become valuable in phase 3?
---
I had a quite long conversation with some people the other day in regards to that. Some hunter told me they are more entitled to mage weapons as they can use the weapon to hit things unlike mage lol. So yeh appearantly weapons like ravager are too good for hunter to pass up as they have to melee sometimes too ;) xD
---
I'd suggest you go Arm. Leveling a warrior is difficult enough, you'll have plenty of time to play Fury once at max level if that's what you prefer.
---
I would say point out the bug exists and say - if you exploit this - you‚Äôre banned.  But since actiblizzard is trying to save costs, they probably have 1 person responsible for looking at thousands of accounts and thousands of bugs... too much for 1 person to handle.
---
You're bluffing!
---
5-10g will be what it averages on most servers. It obviously depends on what people are selling it for, but the Cooldown is high demand and lots of mages will take alchemy
---
What does your current macro look like?
---
Not if there isn‚Äôt another way to cheat lol. Once the bugs are fixed if there‚Äôs rollbacks let them come back after a temp ban. Streamers or high profile people who spread the word should get a perma ban. But to perma ban hundreds of people for using an extremely easy exploit in week one seems a tad hasty.
---
I don't even have an opinion on it. It's just not clear what the standard is now. As said, me needing on 100g alchemy recipe (from the very same mobs) wasn't scoffed at, although I might have asked before needing. But there's a limit when expensive boe items are just too expensive to have people needing on them. Had Warden staff dropped in a party while leveling, I don't know if I, as a feral tank, had the right to request solo needing it, even if the item's only user is feral tank. After all I, like the mage, could always buy it off AH. But I'm fine accepting either rule set.
---
Reserve? What does all that mean?
---
They have the right to, if people know beforehand they can just not join that group and join another group instead. Say someone has done 100 runs of a dungeon at 60 to get an item they really need but they've lost the roll every single time it drops, of course they want to reserve it to finally guarantee they get the item they've been trying to get.
---
and OSRS added more powerful items multiple times.  They have had issues with power creep to the point where multiple facets/strats of the game are completely obsolete compared to the newer stuff.
---
Reset their accounts
---
They have money yes. But not necessarily the people trained/available to do proper investigations of this nature. Especially where the gold has been moved around different characters and/or used to buy things. Once the gold is moved around or put in to the economy, it's gone.
---
I do think reserve is fine if it's established beforehand, but I thought it was funny last night seeing someone advertising a BRD group with like half the good loot from the dungeon reserved.
---
nope
---
I got my mount at 41. You have made it to level 40 with no mount a couple of extra levels won‚Äôt hurt.
---
And shockadins can be both ranged dps, melee dps and healers in pvp at the same time while having the armor of a warrior and massive survivability
---
Well it's cute that you think Blizz will   
---
1) actually catch everyone who abused it   
---
2) be able to actually undo the damage it caused, both economical and in how much this was exploited to farm pre-bis gear with ease  
---
3) hand out more than a ban for a week if even (azerite exploits only got a 3day ban AND were not even removed, people got to keep their maxed azerite power)
---
walk out with whole team - use the reset instance button is normal.  
---
Any other way is an exploit
---
When im soloing stuff. Cheapshot gets me 3 combo points 75% of the time, and I can usually get a backstab in before the stun wears off. I have a macro to switch to my 1h sword when I sinister strike so im not losing to much damage by not ambushing. It seems way faster to cheapshot-backstab-sinister strike-4 to 5 point evis. Im only level 26 though
---
I'd assume no, as people don't have gizzards lol.
---
Jesus stop using a facecam please, you look worse then the troll you play.
---
Warrior use plate and rogue leather .....and you agi mail....what do you pass on?
---
I love vanilla so much that I've been playing it for a decade. :)
---
Yep, when I did RFD the first time recently in Classic we literally had  to do it FOUR TIMES in a row because people are such zoomers nowadays they just click without thinking nor being aware of their party members' situation. Even after I kept spamming that they should only turn it in and wait for me (party leader) to initiate the escort itself...
---
People are just dumb \o/
---
Just reroll account to the point where their character was level 59.
---
Not really, there are quite a few guilds that claim to be one type of guild that morphed into another while still advertising themselves as the former, additionally there seems to be quite a few Russian and Chinese wow players on the US server probably due to either censorship and the overwhelming amount of cheaters that are just ignored.
---
Reserving gear in a levelling instance, are people really struggling that much?!?
---
Anyone ever pulls that shit, I'm pressing "Need" if I need it.
---
What form should I be in then with a feral spec? Just bear the whole time? Whats the point of getting a stun off if your not going to kite to their backside and use shred in cat form for the crit boost?
---
&gt;namepl
---
I would like to know the answer to this too.
---
You could respawn bosses over and over with layering.
---
Sigh.
---
Name and shame them. It's allowed. Shame them every day. Remind the server of them. Let them regret this moment for the entirety of their time on this server.
---
Its really frustrating to see all these people exploiting content that we love.. mostly unfair and pathetic. I really hope they dont punnish light.
---
We‚Äôre all only jealous we don‚Äôt have ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of gold‚Äù like dem cheats.
---
if you need the item, because its an upgrade press need.  
---
Any other cases press greed, or communicate with your party about it
---
You're going to get 1shot by a 60 in t2 or r14 just as fast as someone in t4+ or t5+. That's just how classic pvp is - can you break it off in someone's ass faster than they can break it off in yours.
---
definitely slander his name and less people will party with him
---
You‚Äôre going to see a drop off then a sudden spike at phase 2 then a drop off then a sudden spike at phase 3 then blizzard is going to have to figure out what to do to get more spikes in the subscriber numbers to make their earning look better.
---
I agree with you there.  Whether they are justified or not, we‚Äôd have to review on a case by case basis, and would probably even disagree.
---
First of all I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you man actually sucks :( 
---
Secondly what is your UI setup bro? Its so clean.
---
Classic is about the journey not the destination.
---
If they have derived joy from exploits and bugs to top tier in a month... Well ... Whatever.  
---
Took me 2 years last time and fighting side by side with people who became real world friends was what I enjoyed about the experience.
---
at least your server lines up. my server is full of a bunch of chumps that just cut the line and i have to wait even longer.
---
He's not saying someone should care, he's saying a 30 days ban is not shit.
---
IMO they deserve the full 6 months ban for something so serious.
---
Tested and recommended
---
Nope the data is from census plus addon which /who every level currently online then keeps doing that every hour or so and combines it.
---
What lol? You‚Äôre making it a lot more difficult than it is. People know what they‚Äôre getting into if you told everyone beforehand, best thing is to do it in the ‚Äùgroup ad‚Äù so there wont be any misunderstandings. When you get to the boss that drops the piece you can either trust that the group follows the rule you‚Äôve placed beforehand or you simply put on master loot for the boss in question(which shouldn‚Äôt be a problem at all as people in the group should be aware the potential drop is reserved). 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to join a group as such, simply dont, join another one or make your one. People do things differently &amp; it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue as long as the group leader is clear about his intentions before making the group.
---
That's a great thumbnail.  I always struggle to make decent ones
---
Am I the only one who never liked zones like ungoro? Yeah this cave is beautiful and I have font memories but kalimdor has way too many beasts for my taste. I always prefered zones with more humanoids over beast zones for some reason
---
fucking bryce dude i swear
---
Is it a bannable offence if you used layer hopping to just escape from being ganked at lower levels

Ooohhh yeeeeahh
---
r/beetlejuicing in wow? I'll take it.
---
Better than just resetting your modem
---
Yes in the real world not everything is black and white. Unfortunately for you, we aren't talking about the real world. We are talking about a virtual world. Blizzard is the omnipotent force in this virtual world. They can literally prevent people from having the freedom to commit wrong acts. Given that they have this power, they are responsible for allowing this to happen in their game.  Use logic when making comments.
---
32-34 I did some Shimmering Flats and Desolace quests, RFK, and Gnomer.
---
Yes, please; even though I know you want views I can‚Äôt watch videos where I am and this looks awesome - does Reddit karma count as much as YouTube views?
---
People then claim there are more alliance than horde. If anything there are more alts in alliance not more players
---
Warrior, Rogue and Druid/Priest/Shaman.
---
Priest might be better for gear diversity for loots in dungeons.
---
Do trolls have horns 2?
---
It was probably a hunter weapon though
---
Honestly I don't think this is reroll worthy. At max level people who will do world pvp like in Hillsbrad will be doing it willingly and in groups so the "running away" part will be a non issue, you'll have plenty of targets.
---
Previously, they said it would be shut down as soon as it's full.
---
I joined Dragonmaw after Vanilla, but yay go DM!
---
I think the Tauren features change your cat form look, if there is a feature to have no horns on your Tauren your cat form may not have horns?
---
it dropped in a dungeon while you were in a group... I don't see why different rules should apply for BoE compared to a regular drop from boss. Need if you will actually use and equip it, greed if you plan to sell it.
---
It must be us Druids...  And we don't have those nasty Plaguelands full of undead.  (we have felwood, but it's not that bad)
---
You just accidentally click he wring button. Sometimes when your focusing on killing or whatever it's possible to do. I've accidentally needed on crappy greens and such and had to apologise. If someone else needed the item I'd always trade it to them if I can, or failing that give them the going rate in gold as an apology.
---
Fair enough I guess I was a little close minded in that statement. I don‚Äôt think it needs horizontal progrsssion but Azeroth really is a world of its own to me and most of its players ya know. I‚Äôm not saying there has to be horizontal progression. But I‚Äôd like to see the world evolve. Add new raids and lore, or world group quest type things that come out as special events. Just something to keep the world thriving and believable.
---
Thank you!  I spent probably longer than I should have on it haha, its tough to make good ones that stand out.
---
Yep, Blizzard should have the data available to punish the exploiters. Using a query against this database, it won't really take them long to find the accounts participating in this.
---
exactly as it should be, would be no problems if everyone stuck to this basic principle.
---
That‚Äôs what makes vanilla wow amazing
---
because whatever team they use for retail on this junk clearly could not wrap their heads around the 1.13 version of the game
---
its just a small team of indie developers
---
Trolls cant be druids in vanilla sadly
---
I also want to know what UI this is. Have you had any luck finding it. Elvui is too much for me.
---
I love learning new words.
---
I always used (and saw people use) the term Boss for dungeon bosses and Raid Boss for those in raids.
---
Yeah I think people here expect you to /duel opposing faction. Which I'm pretty sure is possible.
---
I agree. ‚ÄúRuined‚Äù was probably the wrong word to use but I couldn‚Äôt think of anything more suitable to describe it
---
If you mention before the run starts that you're going to need every BoE, that's one thing. Then people in the group can make an informed decision bon weather or not they want to go along with that or replace you. If you just wait till the first BoE drops and need something you can't equip, you're being a scumbag and screwing over anyone in your group who is playing the system as intended. I've seen too many people on here say "go ahead and roll greed, it just gives me better odds" on here when expressing your exact view point. If I see that kind of shit in a group I'm in, good luck never getting healed again.
---
imo this could just be bannable (even permanently because they will always be assholes) - this isn't even far from possibility
---
Short-Story-Time:
---
I was leveling on retail in a TBC Dungeon - one of the more "difficult" ones. Some people didn't understand certain mechanics so I explained them. After they failed them for the 5th time in a row I was like "dude, just read what I told you" - no response the whole way through, so I stopped saying anything. Not wasting my breath.
---
Last boss has 5% hp - I get kicked. I was furious. Obviously ending the Dungeon rewards most of the EP and I wasted like 5 times the amount of time to their stupidity.
---
Support responded and said they could deal with this, if they had access to more information. They know the voting system can be abused with this stuff but they can't ever do anything against it if they don't actually see all the logs. End of the story: Support asked me to report my feedback cause that's directly for the Dev Team.
---
I think they mentioned they only see who joined and that I got kicked, but they couldn't see the details of how the dungeon went, what has been written etc so they couldn't check a) if I was behaving poorly enough so a kick is justified or b) when they exactly kicked me (progression wise).
---
Sooo.. if Blizzard wants to up their game on this, it's possible and would result in abuse like this to be punishable.
---
Not only rogues but other classes as well, fury warriors for sure and feral druids.
---
That sounds like the sort of thing that would be perfectly legitimate in a traditional tabletop TCG. Infinite loops and long recursions aren't exactly common in MTG but they exist and the rules easily handle them. It sounds like the problem is that the Hearthstone client wants to actually wants to insist on literally carrying out the animations, etc., for each instance of the repeated action? That's interesting.
---
That was about abusing open world layering for mat gathering, this is completely different way to abuse it. Why instances had layers work like this I don't know, it's very possible they had to make it that way, or that it is very difficult to just plain make them not part of the layering system. Layering isn't perfect, and it sucks it had a problem this significant, but like I said in another comment, I can't stand the people that make such uneducated comments like they wait for popular people to abuse it before fixing when 95% of the people that hate on bugs, layering, or anything that goes wrong have absolutely no clue how anything about how videogames works other than "people type code and it makes the game i play". Yeah blizzard messes up sometimes with bug that shouldn't have slipped into the game, but a lot of times they couldn't have known and sometimes it harder to fix them than the people that complain so much think it is.
---
What mods are used here? Also does anyone know of a working crit meter? I used to use crit line but cant get it to work.
---
Honestly I could still not care less...
---
Most People that did this are sooo tryhard I am not ever gonna reach them anyway.
---
All they got is pre raid BIS and Mats for later. I can make Gold later too and buy most things. I'm not at a disadvantage.
---
The pre raid BiS will be gone in a year or so and everyone is on an even playingfield again.
---
Besides them not having to farm because they have loads of mats stacked up already.
---
And?
---
I was going to farm anyway. It doesn't matter to me if I am farming alone or if others farm too. This just makes it easier for me to farm if anything.
---
Maybe I'll Change my mind at some Point because I missed something but so far I really don't care.
---
I was not going to rush to 60 I was going to take my time and I am. 
---
Just reached 40 yesterday and I'm loving it. All the 60's that have farmed everything already are going to be bored until Phase 2 I'm sure.
---
If they make it this far because they might be banned who knows :D
---
Dude i LOVE your damage text that comes up on the sides. *Pleaaaaase* tell me the name of that addon.
---
*insert "know your place, trash !" meme*
---
Desolace?
---
This is authentic classic, what are you talking about? Is it authentic vanilla? No, of course not. This isn't vanilla.
---
Nitpicky, sure, but people should stop thinking this game is *the* vanilla because, again, it isn't.
---
Tauren apprieciate the land more they get the better land!
---
The "reserved" stuff is bullshit even if explicitly stated at the start. Nothing is reserved. Everyone is putting their time and effort in to completing that dungeon to try and get the loot. People should just refuse to join these groups and crush this mentality.
---
The exception to this could be guild runs where the main tank needs a particular item over an off tank, for example. But in that situation it's for the overall good of a guild. 
---
Other than that, f*ck this.
---
Blizzard have logs of literally every interaction in the game performed by the player.
---
That's how you know I'm a big dumb dumb, but for rp factions don't really matter as long as your server has a balanced population
---
How do you layer hop
---
You can easily have 6000g by now without resorting to exploits.
---
Best part is because of this post, that guy is going to be put on half the servers blacklist.
---
Welcome to classic Yezzan. You are fked now
---
Whoah is this still a thing now in Classic Wow?
---
Nothing short will suffice?
---
So will you quit if they don‚Äôt delete accounts across games?
---
Of course it's a cause for concern. That doesn't mean anything about it being used to farm tens of thousands of gold. Sorry, it just doesn't.
---
I keep sending them bug reports and tickets. They started to instantly close my tickets. x        D
---
I like that!  I'm always pickpocketting so this will save a bit of time.
---
quick economics question: I read that deviate fish goes for about 1-2g per stack. at my server right now a stack goes for like 80s. I am lvl 25 right now, should I wait till I am closer to 40 to sell them with the hope that then there will be more people with gold to spend or will the supply go up and the price will stay the same or even lower ?
---
It is actually really fun and an interesting part of playing Hunter. You develop a bond with your pet by taking care of it. I even feel bad letting my pet die due to having to spend more resources to make it happy so I often try to suicide to save my pet sometimes if running away isn't an option.
---
thats abit too harsh ain't it? just delete them it, no need to get THIS mad.
---
A 6 month ban is normally for botting
---
Someone says they need the item before the run starts, so nobody else is allowed to roll on it.
---
Haha, of course dude. It's this one https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mik-scrolling-battle-text
---
Right? :p I hope they really suffer from a bad Reputation when they are 60...
---
Where did he state he never reported it? He just said he didn't \*use\* it. Learn to read, lowlife scum.
---
Cool response
---
First of all, sorry for the format. Im on mobile.
---
Secondly. This is all anecdotal but this is how my personal experience was 1-60 with afew points as to perhaps WHY it was this way. 
---
I hit 60 the end of the 2nd week.  I Didnt do a single dungeon as a raid group. 
---
I didnt do a single spellcleave from 1-55 
---
I duo leveled my shaman with a warrior friend.  Only doing RFC and WC once each for quests. 
---
Then SM arm about 10 times with a melee cleave group of myself and 4 warriors (no axe for my friend /sad) 
---
Then ZF maybe 3 times. Once for  the quest, other two untill my warrior got shoulders. 
---
After that it was back to duo questing to lvl 50. 
---
Id say we netted maybe 5 levels in total from dung exp (quests included - and thats a generous 5 i feel like) 
---
After that the launch week was over and i had to get back to work so my friend kept leveling solo as warrior.  He hit 60 on the first tuesday after launch - so one week in. 
---
I specced resto at 50 and primarily did BRD with abit of late tanaris and Searing gorge.  Then from 56-58 i did LBRS. Then went to EPL and started the chain quests there for X items - dinged 60 sunday morning of week 2. 
---
NOW. Here is to the point:  yes, i had a week of work - not everyone has access to that so i had more time to sink in.  Playing 30hrs at a time then sleeping for 5.  
---
Point is, people put an awful lot of weight into the dung grinding. Sure it was the absolute fastest way - but me nor my friend were very far behind.   We were both ahead (if i remember) of method (lol) and thet were doing the raid group shit. 
---
That being Said - we had a god tier comp for leveling, (warr+sham) and also we had planned our route and checked stuff out basically since the announcment.  
---
AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO ALLIANCE UNTILL 2 DAYS BEFORE LAUNCH.   So the route plan was pretty useless besides agreeing to only do early dungs for quests once - and get ravager for the warr (which we Didnt even get) 
---
To the route point, we turned to the website classicwow.live. They had a SUPERB guide i can recomend.  I had it on my second monitor the entire time. 
---
Another factor is the armor value and the damage most mobs did was far less than pservers we were used to so that helped speed us up. 
---
Yet another point that i know people will bring up: layering. 
---
Nope, we Didnt even need to layer. Once we got ahead of the launch zerg, there was no competition. 
---
Most people (read: mages) started grinding 5mans, the only people we saw in the world were either solo hunters or priest+warrior combos. And all were typically 3 levels under us. Everyone else was either just behind because solo playing or doing dungeons.  OR we were lucky and our layer was just less populated.
---
We had expected to hit Level 20 in 9h which Didnt work since the launch lag and zones were fucked.  But we did hit 30 before going to bed. Upon which my friend Said we should get up at 05:30 to avoid que times (firemaw-EU) and that worked well. 
---
Once again. I realize not everyone could take time of, or had planned ‚Äùso well‚Äù or played so much.  
---
But you dont need to have exploited to Level well ahead of the curve. 
---
You need to have Done it to be as fast as apes was.  But they would have been first even if that ‚Äùtactic‚Äù Didnt work. 
---
Hopefully everyone is atleast enjoying their time - however you spend it - i know i am.
---
Haha. Morons forgetting server reputation is a thing again. I hope they get fu led over and noone invites them. That's trashy af.
---
You are just so catastrophically wrong.
---
It‚Äôs my favourite! Thanks for additional ones! I completely forgot about mouseovers so I‚Äôll definitely be making one for Gouge and Blind
---
If I've learned anything from this subreddit, it's that people will need it anyways because gold. Doesn't matter if it's a strict upgrade for someone in the party, some people will need everything if it's a BoE because they are greedy and entitled.
---
Dabu
---
&gt;It's entitled and childish.
---
not really. you thinking that kind of is though.
---
I don't think you understand what directly means. When someone layers and farms 1000 or and undercuts significantly, which makes my ore not sell, that is an INDIRECT impact.
---
ah, shatter. Still the safe distance is better then having the extra crit chance. and if you have shatter you probably have frostbite, which can proc from frosbolt itself. So it's better to cast some low lvl fast frostbolts to proc it, and go for a high rank crit once he's frozen, all from a safe distance.
---
Is the earths gravitational pull stronger in the future?!?
---
Some people have families and responsibilities *irl* :-)
---
I agree, but as cloth-wearing classes it's more fit for us to grind humanoids for tailoring comps. Not to mention food, potions, recipes, scrolls, and all the other sweet drops humanoids have on their tables.
---
I will probably level on Kalimdor with my alt for skinning and LW tho.
---
It's not like we have the option to buy any better
---
It's the principle. If they steal items at lower level then they will certainly steal more valuable items. Plus, who wants to play with someone who is willing to exploit their good will.
---
Yes it is 55 silver this is how I got my mount
---

---
I dont think he is a role player and it sounds like he wants to be efficient not take a long trek to do some fishing lol

Should have been a headpiece in game resembling a gag ball. It would be perfect for this pic.

---
So lazy you can't type a few lines of text into the game, but you can spend the time to post a negative comment on reddit.  Lol  
---
P.S:  The macros are in the description of the video.  ;)
---
Yoo saaame! I zoom in and /wave so my son sees it and he waves back üòÅ  he also loves to smash my keyboard lol.
---
Yeah no except this is an MMO, and therefore my joy in this game is directly linked to the actions of others.
---
There are a million games out there to choose from, including THIS VERY GAME (BfA) where modern gaming is what it is. Must EVERY game turn into a speedrun grindfest where iLVL and BiS are all that matters? Or can we, maybe, have ONE game where it isn't?
---
Maybe Classic was the absolute best possible option we had for THAT game.
---
But, if everyone and their mother is doing this, you can tell me I must just ignore it all you want, but that doesn't magically make me or my experience unaffected by it.
---
Yo are we talking about Bryce?
---
Told my gf we're naming our son Arthas so I can absolutely nerd out before he succeeds me.
---
Will you only make rogue content, or can we expect a similar guide for other classes?
---
I am just getting started on macros... Nice work!
---
I remember seeing some threads and comments about useful rogue macros, but can't find them anymore.
---
Does someone have a link to those or can post some useful macros?

Is there a sub with a more numbers/competitive focus on classic wow?
---
he whines because he's a whiny baby who can't stand people playing a videogame differently than him. reddit is full of them.
---
Soda farmed one pattern with layerhopping
---
Never played WoW untill Classic. I just think that layering is needed to have a better experience overall. I agree that the misusing is a issue. But if everybody was all on the same layer. It would ruin my experience and i probably would already have quit by now.
---
Bubbles tend to burst. With all the lootbox and MTX regulations coming (and I believe it's inevitable) publishers will need to find other ways to make money. We can only hope they'll get back to making good games.
---
I refuse to group with hunters period. They are the most selfish players overall by far.
---
Awww, you're making me blush.
---
Well if you don‚Äôt need that particular loot who cares and that‚Äôs usually the idea to find people for that group who don‚Äôt need that one item.  As far as I know at least.
---
Or people who need stuff on every coloured item. I'm lvl 24 and a pretty blue item comes up. This one guy in the group = \*NEED\*
---
"Why do you need a shield? You're a warlock."
---
"It has spirit on it."

I'm not even joking his legit answer and he probably needed half the items of the WC dungeon

Yeah, i just meant that when people are at that NPC, even if they try to do it correctly, the addon might still start the escort to soon.
---
With the twitch client you have to select wow classic. It's at the tip right when you select the world of warcraft and have the mods tab.
---
You took it in the wrong direction lol.
---
And look man, I‚Äôm top 500 in overwatch. I‚Äôve played that game basically since I stopped playing MMOs. 
---
Blizzard continually fucks it up so bad. They can‚Äôt add one thing without shaking the grounds on which they made the game upon. The recently added hero is cancer and now so many heroes are irrelevant. 
---
There was a composition of teams a while ago that was present for a year. They added one, and unreasonable, character to the game.... and then the meta was stale for a whole fucking year.
---
Imagine have 28 heroes to choose from, yet if you don‚Äôt run a specific 6, you automatically will lose regardless of skill. 
---
So yeah , blizzard fucks things up constantly and repeatedly. WoW, Overwatch , Hearthstone, you name it. They are great games at their core, yet they always do something that results in people quitting, bug abusing, or complaining until a bandaid fix comes in.
---
Layers don't/won't affect queue time
---
Yeah!  I love bartender, you can change it to fade out until you mouse over it, can do your bars like that as well.

I mean its completly doable with legit play, but i would assume this would require a few years of private server fresh restarts and some luck. But i dont think Ven has played any or much private server.
---
Sooo, you really are saying that you only want to be 3000 people per server? Hahahahahhaahabha
---
Came here to say exactly this.
---
&gt; It's the players resposibility also because you agree to not do it when you make an account. 
---
This is true, and also a good point.
---
&gt; You can't expect Blizzard to find everything by themselves. 
---
While you can't expect Blizzard to catch everything, you can at least expect them to catch the big things. Like  the really big game breaking glitches. Or you can at least expect that they not add game breaking glitches to the re-release of a 15 year old game.
---
Sorry forgot to say, they're in the description for the video on Youtube!
---
Fury is the PVE class.  
---
With gear your are a beast, and will top Damage meters.  
---
PVP is shit.  
---
Arms is the PVP class, and with an Healer on your side, you while wreck some shit up.  
---
Again, you will be a monster on the battlefield
---
If its so annoying that people politely ask if you would like to tank... If it really triggers you... I don't think you should be playing a tank or even wow.
---
What a shit mentality! 'omagee someone spoke to me and asked me a question how offensive' stick your head in a fryer!
---
Fight back..this was a counterattack. I tried to level for 2 hours from 39-40 and every zone was 8 of you guys running around as doom squads.
---
Most of the people will back to retail or the game itself after a while. Many of us are here just to try for a bit. Is not a brand new game without any competition like it was in 2004.
---
There is an option for the group leader to change the looting mechanics. There's really no need for this to ever be changed for the average player though.
---
There is this group of people that for some reason believe Blizzard have god like powers and understands everything about their game, and any criticism is wrong just because "blizz knows more".
---
I've had discussions with people about layering stuff that is literally happening to me and i can prove at any time and people will respond with "no blizzard said that's not how it worked".
---
It's like you have these lvl 60's exploiting stuff constantly and then a lvl 27 hunter jumps in like "no that's not how it works guys, because Blizzard told me so". Jesus.
---
Well, thats just bug on top of another bug then. You shouldnt be able to reset instances while inside them and you CERTAINLY shouldnt get a new boss with loot inside a raid, because you are saved to a raid ID.
---
But blizzard didnt want to test the raids in beta, "we got this, inhouse", they said.
---
I've had multiples similar encounter recently uppon reaching level 60, i remember a shaman named "Taure" on server Sulfuron to need gears he couldn t even wear for his guild master because his friends comes before group. Thats what he said as to why he did that.
---
Could you imagine instead of ~80 people in the barrens you have like ~2800 people in the barrens?
---
They changed the loot rules just before killing a boss so that they could steal an item.
---
(If they said at the start of the run they were reserving a specific item that would be fine).
---
TIL. Always assumed green quests gave less xp for some reason. That's huge.
---
Please do!
---
Look up on spellpower coefficient for every warlock spell. For example a 3.5 sec shadow bolt has a 86% spellpower coeffecient. ( 100 spellpower = +86 damage ). However, you're probably using the reduced cooldown talent so the coeffecient goes down.
---
You'll need a healthy mix of intellect/spell power as you need intellect. I know people say :" JUST TAP LOL" but your healers will 1. hate you 2. ignore you after a while
---
Private servers had no subscription. But playing them came with a cost. You could wake up and your character was deleted or the server would be gone entirely. It happened on 2 different servers I played for different reasons. 
---
I am so fucking glad I don‚Äôt have to worry about that anymore. Blizzard servers are hands down way better than any private server I ever played, and I played a good amount. Scripting, reliability, and support is top notch. Only waited like 2 min for a ticket response for a bug in ZF once. Pservers very rarely had support like that. 
---
Anyway, no I don‚Äôt think the hype will die out any time soon. At least I really hope not.
---
A quick summary:
---
* Servers take a lot more players now than in 2004 (technology now allow for this). In other to prevent over saturation of starting areas / grinding areas, they implemented the layer system.
---
*  When you login, the system makes a decision on what layer you'll end up, based on the amount of players on each layer.
---
* That layer should have a similar amount of players than other layers in the same server.
---
* When you get invited to a party, there's a chance that you'll switch layers (if party leader is not in the same layer as you). When this happens you'll seamlessly change layer - you'll notice that all players around you will disappear and new ones will appear, same with mobs, etc.
---
* There are a couple of restrictions to prevent this being exploited for PVP reasons (like you attacking a player then asking a friend to invite you so that you disappear and that player can't kill you anymore).
---
TL;DR: You may be killing boars in Goldshire next to your friend that just logged in and you may not see him. Once you invite him to your party, you'll both be on the same layer (he will switch layer) and you will both see each other.
---
All the twitch add ins that have the version set to 1.13 or something like that are for classic. (Sorry not at home to get the exact number for the version)
---
As I was brand new to WoW I really like having questie.
---
This is an exploit and you might get banned or suspended..
---
Dont abuse bugs like this. It might be fun in the moment.. but a month (or longer) ban makes it quite a waste of time
---
Can you explain why? I only called it "Heroic" because of it's kinda what we already have. Same dungeon but adjusted to 58-60. Maybe even a bit more.
---
Nah he's probably a warrior.
---
Did basically the same in every run of RFD i did. Sometimes you need to explain people basic shit.
---
Had to pay 30s to rogue yesterday to stop opening graves in ZF that nearly wiped us (changing mob from 2 to 6). Literally "im gonna pay you 20 bucks to fuck off".
---
It's a warrior life.
---
Not gunna lie. I have one but its on there so i can track my threat and see my rotation improvements
---
That‚Äôs fair! I like to hotkey other abilities with the modifiers...
---
I usually find I‚Äôm keeping an empty space for pickpocketing specifically cause I like finding stuff!
---
Meanwhile boars and wolves parry me all the time. Bastards.
---
Oh that's right its still 2004.
---
This is why I'm levelling as a tank in Arms spec; if I want something specific that's going to boost my solo ability (i.e. weapons like Corpsemaker / Thermaplugg's Left Arm / Ravager), I just build a group based around other classes that can't use it, something like a Druid / Priest healer and any DPS that isn't Paladin or Warrior.
---
A misguided Hunter might need, shit happens, but at least building the group a certain way means I'm taking advantage of being a tank and removing some of the loot competition, but without actively stepping on toes.
---
^((If for some reason I join a group with another Paladin or Warrior rolling for mail / plate DPS items, I stay away and stick to tanking items... I wouldn't even consider master looter outside a raid setting, that's what it's there for imo.))
---
Can't relate, I'm lvl 60 going back to STV to slap some GF ass.
---
Oo that looks like a Whitemane queue
---
print screen button.....
---
Nah, dont delete it. Lets make sure all the exploiting basterds know whats comming.  (If anything at all :) ).
---
to be honest, exploits are generally handled by blizzard heavy handed and usually receive perma bans.
---
Are there any left after killing most of them for those gibbets then?
---
Same. Touch wood, people seem to realise that reputation matters in Classic.
---
I believe he means the bug where raids gave more exp than parties.
---
Really? I missed that, due to work i got very low spare time and use it to lvl and im skipping blue posts and news may i ask for the link? Thank you very much btw!
---
You say that like them underestimating Classic to this extreme an extent isn‚Äôt entirely unreasonable and incompetent. It is.  It‚Äôs not some slight whoopsie by an otherwise good company either.
---
Ok. Here's why an abundance of supply is never an issue.
---
If you have 10,000 Arcane Crystals, you have three options to get rid of them: 1) sell them slowly to maintain the market price, 2) sell them all at once and tank the price to the ground, or 3) make gear using them and sell it.
---
A combination of options 1 &amp; 3 is the most likely since most people would want a good return on their goods. They would be selling ACs slowly enough to not affect the market price (and damage their own stock), and maybe making some items that require ACs and selling them (if they have the right profession and recipes).
---
This scenario by default would not affect the market negatively. These people with 10,000 ACs will have to sell slowly, negating any effect they might have on the market price.
---
If someone were stupid enough to dump the ENTIRE supply on AH at once, they wouldn't be able to sell many before the price starts going down quickly. People will get them when they're cheap and either use them or repost them when the prices goes back to normal after the burst of supply ends.
---
In the long-term, this exploit won't make much of a difference. And Blizz has explicitly said that no one was having the claimed thousands of ACs due to layering (and that they would take action if that ever happened).
---
The economy won't be affected in the long-term and the leveling / gearing gap will be bridged naturally. And this won't happen in P2 since they're removing layering.
---
That's why I repeat that this is a non-issue.
---
It‚Äôs tearing me apart (lisa). I always played in the eastern kingdoms, so in classic, i play a night elf and really want to stay only in kalimdor‚Ä¶ but i‚Äôm a priest with tailoring‚Ä¶ ‚òπ
---
That looks less like a cheater and more like a multi-boxer.
---
We love to stay hydrated.
---
RGB cringe
---
&gt;  get a feeling that Blizzard thought Classic just was gonna be a hype that died out quickly.  
---
It was like what, 3 weeks since launch? People didnt had to resubscribe for next month lol, also they confirmed that they are constantly reducing number of layers right now as player number is reducing, which is what they planned in the first place.
---
That's when you drop group.
---
Back in Legion there was an exploit to farm basilisks for felslate ore. My group abused it for over 2 days. I made over 2 mil gold and some even more.
---
We all got banned for 7 days. Worth right? Theres more. After 2 days we were unbanned and received a month free gametime because they banned people who didn't abuse the exploit
---
This day ive learned that you should always abuse bugs as soon as possible and as much as possible
---
Right now I see plenty of people helping warriors out with the quest in Arathi and STV. You don't even need a dedicated group, just ask for help and you'll get it. Worked out for me.
---
Hell a mage straight up gave me 8 thundering and 8 water charms since he as farming mats already, leaving me with only fire charms.
---
Yeah i have noticed that happening too. When people of one faction get killed most of them switch layer so the other layer will be dominated by that faction so the opposite faction there also switch to a layer where they dominate.
---
just a multi-boxer
---
Start shimmering flats in thousand needles then Stv, Decolace, badlands, arathi highlands, theramore Isle, alterac mountens
---
Hey this is just personal preference, but I'm a druid and got a warrior friend. Whenever we are playing together we NEVER join groups. We LFM in chat. If a group of dps wanna run with us they'll have to disband and ask to join. As tank healer combo you guys have the upper hand. 
---
Btw, those guys were assholes. If you were already on the way, that means they made you lose your time. I don't feel that it's wrong to reserve items (I would never join the group if I wanted to roll on it), but it should absolutely be called out during invitation.
---
not good faith
---
garbage, just ignore them and move on
---
This behaviour should result in suspension..
---
And just like Nonagon Infinity, this grind is also infinite (because they never drop)
---
Also I watched a couple videos on YouTube for addon suggestions that were great, specifically I liked  hirumaredx‚Äôs video for Addons for leveling.
---
Unfortunately the vanilla cats all look the same
---
I can hear them too, it's frightening
---
I do
---
Character name change?
---
ban their asses, real good
---
Yeah. I was expecting it to happen at some point, but I figured Sunken Temple was still ahead of the curve enough to avoid it for now. Guess not.
---
Dwarf priests are the best for fear ward and this guy is a hipster
---
How did a sixty mage lose to two people 12 and 13 levels below him?
---
5 accounts channeling the same spell at the exact same millisecond?
---
We can't talk about it...
---
Heard of a thing called queues?
---
Expect blizzard has stated that they want the community to communicate what they think and what they want to see.
---
Having these discussions is not harmful in anyway, nothing happens overnight.
---
The group leader changed the loot mode to Loot Master just before the final boss. With this mode, the group leader can give the loot to whoever he/she wants, mostly themselves.
---
I think starting them at level 1 would be a good punishment blizz still keeps a sub if they continue to play. win win.
---
What's your name on DD? I play Alliance on DD and nothing in any other servers, so I'm curious to know if we've helped each other, or if you're on my kill on sight list, or neither
---
Nothing shared here will contribute to whether a lot of people go there or not....
---
Someine ingame told me flour didnt exist back then in vanilla. So you failed being a smart ass ;)
---
Hey, they can rez!
---
Once every 30 minutes
---
Rank 1 is 1 magic effect, rank 2 is 2 magic effects.  At least so far.
---
My guild has cleared MC/Ony already. I'm not really invested in farming top gear by doing those raids all over again weekly. I'd have to assume majority of the player base will reduce playtime drastically once they've done all of the content there is few times. But it'll take few months for most people to reach this point, then phase 2 already begins. New phase always brings players back, but if there's not enough content, then a lot of people will fall off, and many of them won't return.
---
Anyhow the fall off already started. A week into release my server had 10k queues. Now I don't know if even exceeds 1k anymore. In a week or two there probably won't be queues anymore at prime time except on few select servers. Big question is how many people will go to BFA if/when they lose interest in Classic. Will WoW still have relatively close number of subs 6 months from now in total, or is the fall-off 30%? 50%?
---
If I had to guess how the hype train dies few months ago, I'd have assumed initial hype to be less, and it to die faster. But I forgot how long the leveling takes, so I guess there was no way massive amount of people would quit before they made it to 60. As people have way different "end" goals for their classic, can't really expect massive drop off at once, but just the player count slowly dripping down.
---
Let them have their 15 year old, server specific, cringe worthy "world first".
---
This will be fixed. Dungeons shouldn‚Äôt be working like this. Outdoor layering is fine.
---
I have 0 addons, does that make me a n00b?
---
Spell dmg and frost dmg do the same thing for frost spells.
---
Because an item giving only frost dmg is limited in that regard, the "worth" of the frost dmg in an item stat budget is less than spell dmg. Therefore you typically find that an item with only + to one school of magic has a higher amount of +dmg, or higher values of other stats, compared to items of the same level with + to spell dmg.
---
Note that this is a general rule, and not necessarily correct, given the chaos that was itemization in vanilla.
---
Generally higher + dmg is better, and it is one of your best stats for general use. But as explained by others, aoe dmg has poor + dmg scaling, compared to single target spells with a longer cast time.
---
Did you really just make a 3v1 pvp montage with X Gon Give It To Ya?
---
Grow some balls instead of rolling around with your buddies griefing people who have no chance outnumbered.
---
Disney has been doing it with rereleases of all their animated films on a timeline for years.
---
Tanks also have the highest repair costs and requires the most effort to play, and that's coming from a healer.
---
Ya it actually ties into the addon folder within wow classic, which makes sense. 
---
I do wish twitch would have two options, instead of the one WoW option with subfolders. In time.
---
Need rolling to sell on AH .. smh
---
Quest til 22. You need 3/3 Blizz.
---
\&gt; You could wake up and your character was deleted or the server would be gone entirely. It happened on 2 different servers I played for different reasons. 
---
What servers? I still had my nost char until LH shut down.
---
Yeah, but you aren't actually "respawning" them, you are switching into a layer that still has them, aren't you? Which means technically you should probably end up with two IDs or the second one overwrites the first.
---
Tho, regardless of that, it is still a shitty bug.
---
Just find a good place with easy to kill mobs..  What you'll find is the best earning places will be camped by huntards :(
---
Done!  In the video desc as well as a comment here.
---
Have had nothing but issues with Razer and will not continue to support them. If you want a MMO mouse, G600 or Scimitar are the way to go.
---
Play where you you'll have fun, you can always go back and farm cloth in efficient locations later if you need
---
Speaking of which - look out for your mail ;)
---
Hehe your damn right itll take you 4 trips from the graveyard before you hand in 1 quest.
---
/luck is one I miss a lot
---
My wife died yesterday after feigning death
---
I said "Oh it must have critted"
---
she didn't get it
---
Ewww you have a real life
---
&gt; not popular area
---
You want to go to a popular area, because many people will kill beasts and there are chances that they are not skinners, so you just come and swoop in on the free carcass.
---
Duskwood was my gold grind. The Worgen drop money, items, and can be skinned. All 3 of those got me my mount at 40 on the dot. I was honored so I only had to spend 90. Still had 4gold in change.
---
No worries my man, if you viewed the vid here I still get youtube views.  The macros are now in text form as a post.
---
Would leave this guild in an instant
---
True, but mashing all those layers together would make the game completely unplayable.
---
I mind control him and throw him in the water
---
Well, she will gank him, I‚Äôll just grad popcorn and watch
---
Yet I still want to die
---
Shit
---
I went in to Org last night on Firemaw and even with layering there was like 2x the amount of players I'd expect to see on a full vanilla server in org. And there's still a lot of people out leveling on that layer..
---
&gt;  will result in a hefty ban wave
---
We can only hope.
---
Im gonna go with the innocent until proven guilty here and no stirr too much shit but i do think its suspicious with the constant giggling and sarcasm from Ziqo.
---
And if the money would have come from "gambling" and rolling against themselves and other people. Firstly, what kind of "normal" player would roll for 500G double or nothing? I would assume noone or 1 person.
---
Secondly, if they were to roll against eachother, one person would have the gold, and the other person would not have any gold, both cant have lots of gold.
---
They‚Äôre down to 50s a stack on my server. Everyone is farming for that first mount so it‚Äôs a buyers market for sure. I don‚Äôt know how long this mount gold rush will last for, but everyone is recommending holding on to what you want to sell until after the economy calms down
---
Lol I‚Äôm playin alliance rn but this still made me smile :)
---
This has beenexactly the same for me. It's so weird having social anxiety in gaming but I have closed games before, if I was in an uncomfortable situation. I try to avoid most of the communication, especially voice chat but as you said in classic there are some parts or quests you simply can't do alone. So far every party has been really nice and chill though
---
Can't nieve I'm saying this, but it is called "the shimmering flats"  da da tsst.
---
1v1s only last like 1-45 secs... pop it at the start or 5 secs in and you are immune for the entirety of the encounter. Win. Laugh at them. And carry on
---
The funny part is the "That's not how layering works" comment. Been seeing that exact comment being used since the beta by people turning a blind eye to how much layering fucks shit up.
---
;)
---
Bout time
---
"people disapearing"
---
As if people aren't disappearing when they switch layer on purpose. 
---
Go to any valuable rare spawn location, you will see people appear and disappear out of nowhere every 5 minutes.
---
Last friday, me and my guild were following a lvl 60 horde to kill him, we almost catch up to him thank to the carot on a stick and guess what ? He disappear just in front of our eyes when  we were about to catch him after a 5min pursuit.
---
Do you speak Swedish with russian accent?
---
We had our guild &lt;GM&gt; be renamed, unsurprisingly. Lol
---
Night Elve Mowhawk !
---
Nice screenshot!
---
Well, it kinda sounds like Arthur. With such names you don't want to go full nerd so you won't ruin your child's life by giving him a name that would sound stupid around IRL people. Sylvanas is on the verge of that, Alleria is better in my mind (it sounds like Valeria, and there are Russian names Alla and Lera so you already have a shortened version that don't sound stupid), on the other hand Turallion or Tyrion would be not great (especially when Tyrion is a GoT character). Varian and Anduin are great IRL names too I believe.
---
Roll need - talks about epic mount... 
---
If you plan to sell, it‚Äôs greed...
---
I'm a 40 warrior and I just farmed SM Graveyard with a 40 mage. We shared all the gold/loot and made about 40-60g in 6-8h. We cleared the whole dungeon, looted all the chests and vendored everything. Reset, rinse, repeat. 
---
After trying some farming spots out in the world, this was clearly the best as it didn't have any contesters.
---
God Damnit Bryce
---
Yikes, did your wifes boyfriend take your Switch away again? If you get this upset over a strangers opinion on a videogame you need to consider therapy.
---
Counter-point - played both sides, regretted almost every minute I was Alliance. Didn't feel like 'home' to me at all. I suppose thats because until Cata I was pure Horde. 
---
Home is where the Horde is, ja feel?
---
We've only played one session, yet. So this is probably it.
---
How long is "a little bit"?
---
Wow you seem REALLY eager to defend someone who you even think is being attacked.
---
You know being a goblin in mommy's basement doesn't actually make you cool right?
---
Oh my
---
yeah, its shitty, but for a while till like lvl 50? (well lower tbh), I can outdps a mage with it.
---
esp in uld, mages act very surprised when a warrior outdps them on the massive mob pulls (esp when I am only 42 and they are 45+)
---
granted, if the healer is bad, I am going to die, no ifs ands or buts, no tank can hold  threat and unlike mages I can't kite.
---
lol i dont even know there is exploits, cheats, hacks or whatever..
---
What is the layering exploit you talking about?
---
please i hope they will get perma banned.. that would be soo great
---
Yes, I would rather have seen a larger number of smaller servers with NO layering. Authentic Vanilla experience with no changes, like they promised.
---
Razer Naga is a piece of junk and i've owned 6 of them, including 2 of the new Trinity's. They break after light use. Go with G600 or Scimitar, Razer is shit!
---
Ah, so this is why he's so furious.
---
Epic
---
Swords. Daggers. Polearms. Axes. BOWS
---
Why sadly? Priests are super efficient with Spirit Tap.  Basically zero down time if you manage your mana correctly. 
---
I farmed Swamp of Sorrows jaguars and Badlands elementals / beasts from 38-40 on my priest so I could afford my mount right at 40. A lot of those spots are now heavily contested though. I was quite ahead of the curve when I did my farming which helped.
---
We he basilics in the south of shimmering flats in thousand needles. It‚Äôs close to gadgetzan so it‚Äôs super easy to vendor and bank things and go back for more. Great experience too. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend farming as a caster though, they do a mana burn.
---
So they don't have long enough legs to ride a horse properly so the frosted is bigger to make their legs sticking straight out not look as weird.
---
!remindme 3 years
---
Cool I don't know who that is and I don't really care.
---
So fuck off you dicksucker
---
It scales with ego
---
&gt;hey added it as a lazy solution because they didn't want to merge servers 
---
oh ye, i guess waiting 40minutes to kill centaur leaders in barrens with 40ppl around is exactly why layering shouldn't be a thing ... i want 120ppl there! and 3 hours waiting for one quest! 
---
Brilliant solution dude, you are such a problem solver, why blizzard doesn't just hire you right away
---
&gt; That is entirely diffrent. They had to kill Them to get to rag.
---
Bullshit, they had to chose between exploiting a bug for extra loot or not doing it... they chose to do it.
---
Vanilla/Classic wow just has more social aspects to it than the current wow. Current wow seems so out of place and it's hard to socialize and meet new people, but classic wow, you have to communicate for things. It brings everyone together more and of course people will avoid the selfish players in a game that requires more socializing and has that aspect (socializing) more naturally so. I love classic haha
---
Likely due to artificial inflation. People are scumbags.
---
yes, there would be huge crowding issues.
---
think of making a horde rogue. as you can't have an alliance and rogue in same server... (firemaw)
---
looks like I just found a server to roll :)
---
Honest work was not that effective during the history of humanity. That's why I'm broken too with 20g at lvl 32 üòÄ
---
&gt; You are just so catastrophically wrong. 
---
Certainly possible. Wouldn't be the first time. I'm still going to defend my argument, even if I'm going to get down voted to hell for it.
---
I mean Hillsbrad is a zone whose entire in universe premise for the Horde is to slaughter alliance NPCs, no wonder its violent!
---
And hunters.
---
And on this day a legend was born. A warlock with the power to wield the bag of hunters.
---
"i don't want to wait so let's ruin the game with a system that allow me to not wait"
---
Go back to retail.
---
I use it to jack off to my non-existent overheals
---
Just finished ungoro, was my favorite zone as a kid, reliving it was phenomenal :)
---
It more or less will, fortunately. Since the server communities are much more tightly packed now, sooner or later, people will recognize these people and they will be socially isolated because no one will group with them.
---
its not cheat, Blizzard is incompetent

I don't know anything about the deathcharger as that is either very lucky or fishy, but Ziqo, who Ven farms with, was showing their dual-mage strat to farm patterns in an instance - said they drop about once an hour or so and sell for ~300g, so not unthinkable levels of gold if that's what they've been doing, though could be exploits off stream as well
---
One of my favoriete machinimas. This came out in BC and this was exactly how my guild treated eachother. It was glorious. I miss those friends :&lt;
---
I don't understand why are people crying so much about layering. There is a higher demand for everything in the game due to having so many players, be that materials, ores, herbs, quest mobs, etc. One single layer per realm would be literally unplayable and people would quit. And this will help later on to have a nice amount of players on a single realm, with only one layer, once things settle down. 
---
On the other hand, layering has a cooldown, plus most realm only has 2-3 layers. If you saying people can exploit this so far that they sitting on hundreds of thousands of gold, lets say a guy has 300.000 gold, and his realm has 3 layers, then what? He would have 100k gold with one layer...(?), which is already a lot. It is more about people not giving a damn about economy, and over the years some people (call them irl goblins) gained so much experience in goldmaking that making gold in classic launch never been easier. Prices are volatile as fuck, materials literally doubled, tripled in price overnights, it is just crazy how easy is to farm gold if you have some experience. 
---
Just enjoy the game dude, you would be freaked if you knew about retail economy and it's goblins sitting on hundreds of million golds. :')
---
Spread there names and what they've done in trade and LFG chat so they don't get invited to groups. That's how it used to work in the old days, your reputation actually mattered
---
It's fair tho, only people from private servers will remember paladin leveling dmg, and is not as it is in classic, people from retail only remembers paladin at lv60 from 15 years ago, only thing i remember was the seals sucking, and then my memory is PTSD from Wotlk when paladins got omega buffed and killed everything in sight.
---
Also I forgot to mention there‚Äôs a war party of 30 high level Horde players behind that tree...
---
wait wtf happened?
---
Did the MC get resisted or something?
---
It's situational, if you have it attempt to swap back after Ambush, but you're out of range to do that ambush or something then you'll swap to normal weapons and have to swap back for Ambush, whenever you swap weapons you have minor delay in being able to do anything else, so it's best to keep it separate, which is why I use the Sinister Strike macro to change.  
---
Autoattack dps will be the same either way, so the only point of having a big damage sword/mace in your mainhand is Sinsiter Strike.
---
Nothing pisses me off more than a gnome rogue.
---
sounds to me like your another kid that thinks hes awesome cause he used bugs and exploits and 20 hours a day in a video game and tries to belittle everyone who doesnt, wish they would ban this behaivior, ruins classic. games dead in 3 months if this attitude continues.
---
TheBigOne, guess we all know what his name is in reference of now.
---
If you plug a potatoe into a monitor it would still run wow classic.
---
get fucked you fucking morons. trying to ruin the game for everyone else.
---
Yes it was, especially with the lack of language specific ones.
---
You‚Äôre crazy if you think blizzard can‚Äôt track specific loot and time lol.
---
Sounds super fishy.. No reaction at all. And that people have 1k to gamble after 2 weeks? No way.
---
in classic all cat forms looked the same, no matter the look of the character itself
---
Windtantrum
---
&gt;wow will be dead by the time naxx releases"  
---
This saying was true because naxx was released just a few months before BC.  Our guild stopped raiding naxx entirely because nothing mattered with BC around the corner.
---
Indeed. At least you have the choice to avoid them. The assholes knew they'd be less likely to get their group together and hoped that people would be too investing in finishing the dungeon to complain...  
---
Blacklist them 100%
---
it is also just fucking insane you want the SM ravager axe or the corpsemaker as a fucking warrior tanking you spend the 5 secounds it takes to get spammed inv by rogues,warlock and mages you can easly get a full group without hunters, shamans/paladins and other warriors
---
Yesterday I traded a randoml lvl 26 nightelf rogue some nice crafted leather gear (she was wearing horrible gear) and 4 silk bags. The response: k, ty.
---
Yes, but - make sure your dps's let you generate threat on all the mobs before they engage them, and try use skull mark to focus fire one mob at a time when possible.
---
Did he even do this exploit?
---
I saw him reading the reddit thread but wasn't really paying attention nor do i watch him regularly.
---
"All it takes is literally using 6 or 7 abilities and some auto attacks"
---
It's great even for grinding mobs if you pull that extra one on accident or as a druid if you're tanking. In PvP though it can really create those LOL moments. Just the other day I had 3 people on me and it procced on all 3 of them allowing me to get away, it was hilarious. Or with hunter pets, if you put them to sleep it prevents the hunter from stunning you. It's really awesome for sure, I love it. I'm sad to see it go after level 50, but at the same time around that level you now have access to the engineering helmets which are a pretty solid alternative.
---
Yall remember that time Bryce nabbed that hunter bag???
---
It's not layering that I have an issue with. It's dungeon and raid layering and exploiting. Those are radically different things.
---
Still faster than waiting.
---
So abusing instances with layers is a problem but everyone else spamming /world and abusing layers in order to farm mobs/gathering materials/whatever isn't cheating?
---
You can clearly hear on the vod that they had No play in the reset, they Even waited on confirmation from blizz before they went on to clearing. They had every right to a rag kill and shouldnt be at fault for that. Streamer hater much.
---
As a warr, i sometimes make my own groups without other warriors.
---
I accidentally linked an amazon page in LFG a few days ago. I was horrified and then relieved beyond measure that it was amazon and not .... something else that i have perused earlier that day.
---
Please clear your clipboards people!
---
I was given a 1000g by my friend who powerfarms on his mage since the time he reached 60 after 4 days played. The day after I was contacted by a GM who questioned me about the origin of the gold on my account. So yeah, they do have the means to track trades. You are making the problem to be much bigger than it in reality is. The majority of things on the action house hower barely above the vendor price. Almost no one is making absurd amounts of gold and those who do while abusing bugs get punished. The same thing happened in vanilla too. Stop exaggerating.
---
How is it a bug though. It's working as intended. Why have layering even enabled in an instance. Or for that matter even have it enabled past two weeks of launch.
---
Exactly. That's what they should have done. Instead they were selfish and filled the group as fast as possible rather than just not taking another 2 hand user. Would it really have killed them just to wait a little bit longer for another DPS rather than needing to pull that shit?
---
Id agree with you the OPs comment just reminded me of it, I dont think he has baron mount so while i do think the whole situation is weird, its not proof.
---
scroll wheel for sinister strike/hemo/backstab is pretty nice
---
those are not the "secret karazhan crypts" those is just the karazhan prequest arrea which was always ingame and got buffed to 70 in the pretbc patch.
---
Try and visit the vendor where you hearthstone. The prices will shock you :)
---
That would be past tense patting where I'm from. (New Zealand)
---
&gt; In regards to Esfand and McConnell that was different. No one had any idea what was going on and Blizzard was contacted immediately before anything was looted, a Blizzard rep gave the go ahead and said it was fine. 
---
&gt; Apparently they talked with a GM.
---
he made contradictory statements and he did not show any message from a GM.
---
twitch.tv/videos/479284719?t=04h46m03s
---
"I don't know, I say regardless we go for it." 
---
GM's do not authorize taking advantage of bugs or giving loot from bosses because of bugs etc.
---
Quick clarification because I mixed i up. I was talking about Satisfactory and not Factorio.
---
Bryce stop
---
Ehhhh. that may be a bit far.
---
I don't think the entire economy is fucked because of the first month of the game. I think it might be a bit sideways for a bit but it will settle
---
Outlands for the rich !
---
That has a name, its called a boost. It is probably coming to classic at some point, realistically speaking, and will cost money.
---
Most people's connotation of a "hero class" is just a new, fancy, OP class like Season 5 DKs.
---
i got my corpsemaker with a warrior in group who i said i wanted the corpsemaker i didn't put it on master looter and he was honest we then did an other 2 runs to try and get him an axe aswell no luck.
---
Haaaaa, Ninja, the most played class on Vanila
---
Damn I didnt realize how behind I really was. People really rushed and got to 60 fast as hell. I expected some but not this many
---
This is the kind of witch hunt I‚Äôm down for
---
Shame, shame, shame,...
---
I had to fight for tags in groups of 5 for 3 hours to do the Dangerous quest in Hillsbrad. How about we *don‚Äôt* triple the amount of people doing the same thing
---
Yea I know that place, 5 mages everytime aoe leveling there so its no go spot :/ and maraudon boss farming or mobs?
---
What server did this happen on?
---
Fuck! I wish I was as upset as everyone else. I wish I could get mad over nothing, for no reason. It's fucking classic. They give you an inch, you grasp for a mile.
---
Why you keep saying this? They‚Äôre gonna take your loot away bro lul
---
Wow that‚Äôs a dick move. I typically reserve an item when I run a group but I allow each group member to reserve an item too and this is made clear in the LFM and at the start of the dungeon.
---
Quite the opposite; I was hyping Vanilla for its server community and multiplayer aspect. Layering kills them both, even without the exploitting. 30k population servers just cannot have the same server community as did the 3k servers in vanilla (that were 'full'). 
---
Still waiting for vanilla servers. That excludes layering completely.
---
Pull the individual folders out of the one main folder?
---
I mean... I‚Äôd take gold, but I also never claimed that I was gonna make the game as hard as possible by not doing so to a massive fanbase.
---
Lmao Bryce never changes
---
I did this trick a ton and didn't get shit from GM's. I assumed it was an intended secret. And this was BC so it wasn't current content or anything
---
With queues that high they may have to alter plans. This was not intended
---
Is this a British server?
---
Classic Bryce, I swear...
---
Lol if they remove layering now no one will get anything done. They should rollback layer abusers and give them a temp ban.
---
You don't get lockpicking levels for opening boxes for other people. In trade at least. Haven't tested it in dept, just opened like 10 orange level boxes for random people via "will not be traded" and got no levels.
---
It's possible that I'm level capped. But I'm pretty sure I checked that
---
Can you explain what is this mount and how to get it?
---
I guess it is, depending on how many hours they stream. They still have to put in alot of hours of farming to make that gold, and if they're not doing any farming on stream, i guess they're not streaming very much and farming off-stream.
---
Cute!
---
My daughter is 5 and she LOVES sitting on my lap watching me play.
---
She bumps my hand off the keyboard and demands that she do the running....I use her for that loooooong runs. 
---
She enjoys the pets and monsters, wants me to fight every ugly looking one!
---
I do not DARE kill a mouse or bunny!
---
This is spammed on my server every day
---
There should be plenty, bg's will still be a thing
---
I for one hope they make Classic+ (far down the line that is) but i do not hope they make it like you want it to be  
---
1. Offcourse there should be more raids and offcourse that should be the goal for any "expansion" to classic imo Raiding have allways been one of the key feature if not THE key feature of wow.
---
2. Questing is actually fine as it is but i agree they could add a few more quest chains i do not think they should add another zones lightly but maybe make quests start at npc in major hubs where you then setting out to complete major tasks all over the world
---
3. Class specific quest lines i do not agree with at all. Maybe a few more class quests and they could even be quest chains but a class quest line through the entire levelling process would be really bad.  
---
one of the things that makes classic better than retail imo is that it is more of an sandbox class quest chains would put it right back at theme park status
---
4. I agree here they shouldnt push ilvl an ivalidating old raids and i like the idead about upgrading your set through content and i honestly think it should be done with tier 0 - tier 3+ and it could maybe be done by quest chains or by some drops you combine. It should ofcourse not be possible to get tier 3 gear if you are not raiding tier 3
---
5. I 100% agree with the proffesions should use old trade goods aswell... an example could be Alchemy where you could have a potion use both Peacebloom and Mountain silversage. anyways imo Crafting should be made totally new from scratch i have never liked the system blizz have and in a world with so much potiential i feels off and boring
---
6. Hero classes... this is a big onesome hate them and some love them.... i do both  
---
i hate how blizzard introduced them with the Death knight in Wotlk but i think i would love a system where you progress you character in other directions.  
---
An example of a class system could be:
---
Priest &lt;
---
God damnit, I play horde on rattlegore, but I'm at work
---
Rattlesnake
---
Search 'Icosiol' on YouTube, he has a fishing/cooling guide for horde and another for alliance.
---
Just ban them temporary for 1 month, they will be behind everyone by that time, and remove loot
---
Tbh, layering itself made me lose the most of the motivation. Classic feels almost like a singleplayer game with 30k servers compared to vanilla's 3k servers.
---
Hard to say. All the math runs through the server. Just a question of if they keep a record and for how long, really.
---
This can still be normal behaviour, as a person may just be cornering the market, aggressively buying up any other people's pattern to monopolize an expensive, impossible to farm item. It's a common tactic.
---
I don't know about this specific person, but on most servers items like righteous orb, devilsaur crafts etc are all listed by the same few people.
---
Blizzard‚Äôs End User License Agreement 2 defines cheats as ‚Äúmethods not expressly authorized by Blizzard, influencing and/or facilitating the gameplay, including exploits of any in-game bugs, and thereby granting you and/or any other user an advantage over other players not using such methods.‚Äù
---
They're actually dealing with this : https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295114/repeat-instance-exploit-to-be-fixed-and-blizzard-issuing-punishments
---
Please, check your facts before telling everybody that it isn't illegal and that reporters are stupid.
---
Sword skill, extra reputation and the best model in the game
---
Lol they‚Äôre making the group, their rules (as long as it‚Äôs stated beforehand). The other 2hand user can do the same, make their own group. It‚Äôs not an issue
---
Being a smartass? I was trying to be helpful, you ungrateful jackass.
---
Except layering though
---
Yep, 9,50g
---
Where I am too.
---
PvP making it sooo hard to finish the quests there!
---
I think you should be in a party doing these quests!
---
That‚Äôs a weird way to look at it
---
I say PermaBan!! This in unacceptable, and whoever does this, is exploiting the game.
---
It's a spell, he just summoned it underneath him haha
---
Press F to have Bryce bless you with Hunter Bags for many years to come.
---
Blizzard has already stated, that what you are crying about isn't possible. They won't go into details about it, but needless to say, there are not enough "layers" to even get close to the massive exploitation you think is happening.
---
I find it strange that this so called master pvp race is to chicken shit to walk in front of IF to get gnome, nope they need a teleporter. Meanwhile Alliance gets slaughtered in Barens and near UD.
---
Epic real bad tho. Like factually evil.
---
Now that I think about that a bit more... it would be quite interesting play classic in such a way:
---
...to be put in a group that forced you to play your class however possible to make it to the end of an instance.
---
It would certainly beat today's "optimal or nothing" mindset.
---
You're right, they weren't.  Not trying to cover it up or "wash myself clean" wtf lol.
---
You wanted someone to do it for you, so you didn't have to type it out yourself, because you're lazy, and that's fine but you were a dick about it.  I went ahead and posted all the macros anyway cause plenty of people asked nicely, and you still come back with an attitude lol.
---
Who pissed in your cheerio's, my man?
---
What do they mean? Just need it and that's it.
---
Ring 'Barov Peasant Caller' and shout in /Y Shame!  
---
Should make a separate post breaking down the finances of server capacity
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Because I have insight on how this stuff works.
---
The problem if there's no evidence.
---
What ui are you using, or is it an addon?
---
20s? Thats like 5 mins of grinding
---
What add-on is that status TEXT? NEWB here I love
---
You can't compare the two, the code base is entirely different so also bugs are entirely different.
---
Also private servers had more than a decade to observe people exploiting and fix that, while Classic is less than 3 weeks old.
---
Blizzard is being quick about it and that's what matters, Classic is still a million times better than pservers that can disappear any moment without notice and where you can be scammed without any ability to do something about it.
---
The official line is it can take up to 72 hours I believe.
---
It's like they forget no cross realm means they have a server reputation. You fuck people over, ninja, or grief people and you'll be known for it. Eventually, nobody will want you in their groups and you'll be an outcast. Looks like its already happening to them :)
---
Transfer to EU-Earthshaker, medium population is a much better classic experience.
---
Oh man I had a blast in Naxx. I have never had a gaming experience that even came close to the first time we killed 4H. It was truly an experience. 
---
And there was 7 months between 1.11 and BC release, which is on the longer side of the usual 4-6 months between content updates.
---
Yeah dude, any more lies to tell?
---
You sell soulbound items to vendors and then buy something with the gold which means putting it into circulation. Now times that by everyone who's been abusing the system since launch and you have severe inflation. How is that fixable?
---
Some people doesn't want pvp some skills that can be learned at 20-30-40-50 etc. For example I don't want mounts in BG. Definitely I'll grind a 39 twink rogue.
---
I just hear of people abusing layers and stuff but I havent actually noticed anything on the game.
---
Nop.  
---
No achievements.
---
Eh, people were this shitty 15 years ago as well.
---
so classic is roughly 4 million, possibly more
---
how much is retail?
---
ok cya
---
But I need it to sell it to a vendor! /s
---
Was that before or after the runs I did with you? (Seesik) congrats man!
---
Yup, my bad!
---
So basically you feel the need to donated using an unfair advantage. Yeah okay, thank you.
---
Banning and rolling back is just to keep the image they take actions. When in reality that doesn't fix or do anything about the situation. Ppl that figure it out are well aware of consequence and this gold and all that you got from it was far long transferred and secured. Economy is fucked they had so much time since release that ther is nothing that will fix the situation. With the amount of profit those that abused it made it will take year to fix the economy. And even worse it all happened at point where it was still developing. Tbh I lost all my motivation to play.
---
But it reads like they would just heal them so they don't get "a reputation as a bad healer by letting anyone, even a asshole, die."
---
you don‚Äôt become a man by getting laid either.
---
Is there  a list of methods expressly authorized by Blizzard?
---
They can track every copper and item that was purchased with it and purge it all from the server.
---
you didnt read my OP bro
---
 Leveling doesn't nuke the economy.
---
That sounds fantastic.
---
&gt; It doesn‚Äôt inject gold into the economy people still need the gold to buy the items, roll back their characters and ban them for 30 days
---
If they have a ton of gold from lets say selling flask recipes or other epic recipes, they have sold and bought numerous items after that. You cannot just "take away" the items others bought with legit gold. Or take the gold away from guys that sold them something else. It has already changed the economy by affecting itemprices, for everyone.
---
Dropping prices on certain items and rising them for others. How do you determinate what portion of that certain players gold was "legit" and what was because of the cheating ? Do you just blanket rollback them to hitting L60. Or just take away all their gold and items ? What about guild banks, same thing.
---
This isnt as easy as you make it out to be.
---
Lvl 56 about 120gold
---
I had a weird thing happen with my /startattack macros on a druid if I right clicked the target instead of left clicking target (macro didn't work). If putting /startattck at beginning doesbt work, I would take out /startattack and see if that is the issue.
---
"Guild run shit nut"
---
Fucking dry up.
---
Believe it or not but esfand and tips are pretty good friends with some of the inner beings of blizzard. Which vane with a respons to go ahead and kill the bosses. And if the shotcallers in the ebd disagreed they would just remove the extra loot. Advised Them to not use the loot but they could loot it to their bags
---
Idk bro if you think blizzard isn‚Äôt capable of tracking loot on a game where loot is everything then I think you‚Äôre just gay.
---
I'm not saying he didn't know what he was doing. The ninjas clearly intend to ninja. What I'm wondering is whether they're newer players who don't understand the ramifications of ninja'ing on a closed server. If you ninja in retail, you just disappear and never see those people again. If you ninja in vanilla/classic, you get a reputation that will make it harder or impossible to get groups, something that wouldn't even occur to newer players because they've never had to deal with a community where you interact with the same people repeatedly and reputation matters.
---
Lots of people do stuff like this.  Advertising groups with reserved items is obnoxious enough, doing it without letting the pugs even more so...
---
You can take them out of retail but you can‚Äôt take the retail out of them
---
yeppppppp. it sucks that theres no armory cause on some private server the cheating was detected that way.
---
with armory we could easily tell who abused the layer to gear up and report them to blizzard. i doubt blizz is gonna be as effective as the wow nerds reporting
---
You need a new guild.
---
Having no mounts in battlegrounds is an unfair advantage? Ok ty. I'll mail blizz to disable battlegrounds below 40.
---
There is a never ending supply if these pixels though. Didnt get what you wanted this time? Go again. If you think about this as "wasting time" go do something else. Drama over loot is something I will never understand. 
---
Not once in my years playing WoW have I bothered being angry at trolls stealing loot. Its my time, so I wont let anyone ruin it.
---
Thank god that's the mentality on my server. Would hate to be a tailor mage/priest/lock with these fools on my realm to see them need on the pattern need for epic mount.
---
Except it was layering that they were abusing.  The original post of the whistleblower who took part in abusing it specifically mentioned it using layers.  You had to be invited into a different layer to abuse this tactic it wasn‚Äôt just infinitely spawning bosses by dropping and reforming.
---
Yep, but the whirlwind axe is the most important of all.. Have you gotten that one yet?
---
As I said, I'm pretty sure they meant that they WOULDN'T join the group in the first place, so then they wouldn't be healing the assholes, so they they wouldn't get a bad healer rep.
---
All it required was a viral video and any number of deleted reddit threads.
---
Honestly kinda bugs me a bit.  I know how hard monitoring is, not the monitoring itself but looking for the right kinds of shit that represents abuse.  But really...
---
From my experience all communists online are american, people whose family lived under communism very rarely support it.
---
wow nice!
---
So your idea of a solution is creating more servers than necessary only to tell the player base "just transfer to a different realm lmaoooooo". The impact this would have on server economie is much bigger than layering.
---
That's understandable if you're on an RP server.
---
Wouldnt say so. I had exactly 101g when I dinged 40 yesterday. Just never touch the AH, go skinning and vendor all items. Dont buy the skills u dont need.
---
All people that does this would be over 90g by level 40. ;-)
---
Haha!! These retail players have no idea the power of non cross server group..  he‚Äôs gonna have a very hard time getting into any kind of group after this.
---
So you know for next time, it is customary for the chest winner to link any green or higher loot to ask if anyone needs it before taking it. Think of it as you won a greed roll, and make sure any needs can still go first.
---
I guess if you have set the ground  rules out at the start that is OK too
---
There is a Way to Farm the Pattern with only 2 mages without killing anything Else but the trash that Can drop it.
---
Only thing you need is feathers and invis potions
---
We had a guy who said "all rolling greed?" When piccolo dropped in strat .. we all greed and he needs.  What a TWAT.
---
I've found people at 60 to be the most toxic. All they care about is optimizing everything and getting their bis instead of having fun with friends.
---
I really wonder if all this spirit of classic nonsense is spoken only by people who didn't even play vanilla or were not playing attention. Buying gold and accounts was common, so was trading accounts. Tons of scummy stuff. Tons of min maxing, tons of abusing exploits existed. Just cause you and your friends didn't do it or know about it doesn't mean it was there. You want the true spirit of classic? Then that means dozens of bots corpses in Org spelling out Chinese gold selling websites.
---
And that children is why we cannot have nice things
---
I‚Äôve seen one guy, a mage, in my guild ask in guild chat to get an invite to a different layer because someone was taking his AOE farm mobs. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever seen. 
---
Maybe my server is full of idiots but if you‚Äôre asking to layer hop, you‚Äôre exploding and you should get punished.
---
If your boyfriend plays WoW you already lost.
---
Yes would be amazing to fuck over legitimate players. They do this in Warframe. A fair player sells an item for currency, said currency is gained illegally, they remove currency, fair player has currency removed. 
---
It even happens that the fair player goes into the minus and has to pay for the buyable currency to be able to log back in.
---
Yes you can, you completely roll back their character to before their first exploit dungeon, do you understand what a roll back means? Everything is gone legit or not they are reset to before the first exploit and banned.
---
Unlikely they modified drop rates, there are just way more people levelling compared to what it was actually like in vanilla.
---
*How do I queue for dungeons?* never fails to kickstart a conversation.
---
3-8g a run is not correct. I would say 2-4g a run. ;-)
---
I can blame customers allright, because they willingly misuse feature that was implemented just to offset server load, and not so they can escape pvp and/or farm mobs/herbs/ores faster.
---
There is no in-game command or button to change layer, people knowingly exploit this feature by asking for invites to other layers in global chats. There is massive difference between being automatically layered after grouping for some activity and doing it just for the sake of changing layer.
---
TL;DR: stop rationalizing players shitty behavior.
---
Yes. That would made my day and I guess a plenty of people's days who were here for vanilla and not this abomination. I've already made it to 60 but I'm more than glad to start it all over just to get rid of the layering.
---
I just wish for Blizzard vanilla servers. That excludes the layering. Tbh, this is not what I signed up for.
---
And orcs get the smallest. This bug/feature has always existed.
---
Blizzard doesn't know how to code.
---
How is that even possible? What if they used the gold for profession training or spells? Are blizzard just going to take it all away?
---
Rolling %100? %1.
---
Tbh. I don‚Äôt even view it as abuse. I you‚Äôre in the 30-45 level range it was absolutely fucking necessary in order to be able to finish your quests. If blizzard hadn‚Äôt made such a complete mess of the launch, only a few bellends on twitch would have bothered with layering.
---
Apart from layering, which is a necessary evil and much better than the alternative, it looks like some people on your server forgot how PvP realms work. It's all fun and games until a rogue, 20 levels higher than you, is enough of an asshole to spend an entire sunday camping you.
---
Hi, /u/Dovahroll
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d4y84e/too_soon/). 
---
I can‚Äôt remember.
---
Eh, I think you've missed the point. The gaming industry has catered TO this behaviour with getting rid of dedicated servers, where you couldn't run around and screaming about fucking people's mums rather, than work against it. 
---
If you did this 15 years ago you'd be part of the assholes of the realm and you'd suffer consequences. Same as on any dedicated server.
---
Ofc it requires manual intervention but not as much as you seem to think.
---
Just skip over the first three
---
Well, yes. [This is an Onyxia kill from seven years ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIs3xXBu3g)
---
Heartseeker faction balance is a lot more even and you won't have to worry about the nightmare of queues especially when layering is full removed. Make the switch now and don't worry about it. The population has increased drastically. Remember that the OG Vanilla servers only held 5K. Heartseeker is already 3x that.
---
There are dozens of us!  I‚Äôll be joining as soon as I can!
---
It's not that the boss respawned, it's that you've moved to a layer where the boss never died. Layering should not be active in instances, that's the biggest problem.
---
&gt; You can't compare the two, the code base is entirely different so also bugs are entirely different.
---
I didnt compare the codes, i compared RESULTS. And tbh, if blizzard had half a brain between them, they would have A) put a CD to layer change B) test layer changes in instances AND FUCKING RAIDS.
---
And done this before the launch. Its not like people didnt warn and talk about layer abuse. Almost every problem they have had so far, have been linked to layer changes. Apart from the XP bug within raid instances.
---
It was the reason for me to quit.
---
Almost every game that is newish is complete trash..has to many bugs or is f2p and incredibly toxic, or millions of micro transactions.
---

I always wonder : how do you get this kind of record ? Do you record all the time or there is some kind of software that allows you to record the last 2min or something like that ?
---
Oh damn. Forgetting the last ctrl c you did can be harsh I see.
---
&gt; Believe it or not but esfand and tips are pretty good friends with some of the inner beings of blizzard.

He made contradictory statements and clearly wasn't reading a response from a GM.
---
You accused me of Streamer hating... well I accuse you of trying to suck them off.
---
i was watching him stream a raid literally a day or two ago where they hopped instances to farm drops.
---
You should have tactical mastery and always be dancin lol
---
Having the talent to maintain 25 rage and stance swapping is really nice for building additional rage with charge, and using rend. Without that talent I wouldn't bother.
---
Basically it records in the background, but only saves last x minutes when you press a button. So for example something awesome happened, you press a button and boom you have 5 minutes of video from before you pressed it.
---
I havnt gotten very high level yet on classic(I was going back and forth between classic and retail, then my laptop charger broke:c) but usually when I see someone leaving a line of dead beasts I'll try to buff or heal them and then start skinning since I was playing a drood
---
Yeah I know, but I wont be using the mount all that much anyway. My ghostwolf is a lot more usefull in a lot of situations.
---
How is it a whitchunt when its a clear proved violation of all moral codes and game rules? You are supposed to make these cretins known, without Xrealm there are clear consequences.
---
I feel like this mage has been watching those streamers who play mage so much that he actually believes he can execute the things they do and come out on top.
---
What dropped?
---
I was genuinely wondering if he had a goblin land mine set up/something. 
---
Guess I'm just a dumb ass person, or maybe you're just being a prick.
---
Okay 1 year ban.
---
Always make my own group, easiest way to go so you are in control, ensures fair play
---
Balancing around PVP is one of the things that led to the mess that is retail in the first place. Normalizing stats or capping damage when attacking other players would be one avenue to control things, but it should be completely secondary to PVE balance.
---
People think they're gangster until they get Ret bopped.
---
And on the other hand: ‚ÄûPaladins simply really often forget to die‚Äú

Paladins could tank majority of content.

And they actually better at AoE aggro than Warriors.

This comment is way too accurate
---
If you find out which button your thumb is naturally resting at (for me it‚Äôs 7) that can be useful. Also the two buttons below the wheel, or 10/12 as the bottom left/right on the side panel. The rest I feel are either difficult to reach or easy to missclick.
---
Yep. I‚Äôm not your fucking ‚Äúboi‚Äù
---
The game is less than 3 weeks old and the best instances are not released yet, the gold they put into the economy is nothing compared to what it will be in a few months when everyone is at max level farming.
---
This "problem" will solve itself in time.
---
I always wait to see what people do before I choose what to roll. If I see a guy Need roll a couple times for dumb shit, I Need roll to specifically try to block him.
---
Back in the day, rolling need meant you were going to equip it right there in the cave, and it would mean an upgrade for the whole group...so in that world, at least.

Why is this dumpster fire on the front page next to asman fan hype, while so many bug reports and get deleted?

I dont get this? If you're a skinner and you dont want them to ninja it then fair enough, otherwise its just a  node, its worth nothing to you ,you cant use it.If you really dont want it wasted group up with a guildie skinner to follow you around and skin them as you go , or else drop a proffesion and take up skinning.
---
If you look closely at the chat, he did that right before engaging the boss. No one was aware of the reserved loot.

Hamstring is better. You get rage back if it fails.

I was there Gandalf, I was there, 3000 years ago (15).
---
a)Feign death can be resisted.
---
b)Pet always had shit ai and yes, sometimes, they would chase after a mob and run by it, never attacking them, until you reset their behavior (command them to attack again). A bug that was there isn't present this time around, at least, I haven't encountered it yet. But sometimes, back in the day, you could send your pet, and he would get aggro, but the pet would know it was tanking, so it would try to get behind, and both pet and mob would be running into the distance chasing their tail, spining back and forth. It happened pretty often. And although I've seen the spinning part, of trying to get behind the target although they are tanking, they never ran forever. Again, you can reset their behavior by commanding to attack again.
---
c)Pet standing on corpse was pretty common too.
---
d)I've noticed this too. But to be fair, this is the first time around I use an addon to track autoshot timer for "vanilla" (I started using one in TBC). So I can't tell if it's Classic which has a bug, or the addon is bad at predicting timings, it sure did screw me over several times so far. 1 thing to note though. The addon I use is terrible at handling attack speed changes in the middle of your autoshot. If you gain Quick Shots or Pop Rapid Fire, the bar never updates to give the proper values. So I wouldn't be surprised that the addon just sucks and makes us move before we should.
---
That's with consecration? So I should start in holy?
---
Ha, haven‚Äôt made it there yet but it‚Äôs either that or a throwback to when I accidentally got one shot by Ysondre or whatever dragon spawns in the Twilight Grove. ‚ÄúThe zone is my level so I should be fine.‚Äù I said...
---
That's a bold claim with no evidence. I think it's called conjecture.
---
if it has a relevant amount of gold value roll need.  if you roll greed I thank you for the increased chance of winning.  everyone rolling need is the only logical and fair way to handle boes of value.  it doesn't matter if x person can use it y person can sell it and buy boes that they can use.  ya'll are illogical and omegastupid if you disagree.  
---
nobody cares how you did it 15 years ago you were stupid then and you're stupid now.
---
You're a Rogue, so of course you don't want mounts. Also I bet it must be super challenging to fight against lower level players while you have BiS for level 39, right ?
---
Umadbro?

I love how they say 30c pet gold when most sites are selling for $2 or more. the website obviously needs to make a cut but for a business with 0 overhead it‚Äôs just hilarious. Go peddle this shit to kids in China.

For leveling, use whatever. Mobs dont live long enough to justify any of the weapon specializations.

For endgame, swords spec 100%. It is just too good to give up and BiS weapons for rogues are swords.

Is there any information if dev team were to launch new servers without layering? I just want to get rid of the layering completely and am ready to start it from the level 1 all again just to get rid of that abomination.
---
If not, how could we get dev team to launch them? I guess there's atleast some of us who want to play Vanilla and not this theme park.
---
I once saw a priest. True story.
---
No harm, no foul! I'd really day that it's the big generational devide when it comes to online gaming. 
---
When your conduct in the game reflected on your online person and standing vs. how whether you do online goes because you have no reputation to think of. 
---
Hope you're enjoying Classic and that you've met some nice "old school" people :)
---
true , although theoretically if they play fair , the other correct ratings should balance it out.
---
30cent per gold? your telling me that guild that exploited could have made 30k instead of outting themselves. dang
---
I just started i need to pay for website and i am selling for .85 cents
---
Yes, it was an effect of layering because layers were active in dungeons, but "their not being enough layers" isn't the case in dungeons. The bosses instantly respawned and you would swap layers as soon as you dropped the group. You can't do this in open world because their is both a delay and competition over mobs. Dungeons aren't the same.
---
Just tap bro ;)
---
The golden era of ninja looting was classic wow, what are you even talking about
---
My main issue, playing as a druid, really is how I should behave when loot that is an upgrade for a role, I'm currently not playing as, drops.
---
I have different stat-prios depending on whether I tank, dps, heal or want to PvP.
---
If I greed on a piece for a role I'm not currently doing and the others also greed, it's basically wasted and I could have needed. If I need on it and someone else needs it too, it can and has caused drama.
---
So it seems best to always wait for the others to roll and then ask.

---
Why would anyone join anything? The group could be better.

You're right, these new memes are harmful for normal groups. But not everyone is about efficiency. I'm a tank approaching 30 now, plan to do some chill SM farm in a normal setup.

I know the reference, but I don't see how it's at all relevant or how it fits here.

Yeah I mean it was just one of those situations.  Everyone else was needing greens they didn‚Äôt need throughout the run which resulted in me getting the short end of the stick while I was the highest level almost carrying the squad + making multiple portals to get people where they needed to be. The ring was an upgrade so whatevs idk why I‚Äôm even looking for justification on reddit lol I just felt kinda bad

just like you told us, comunicate
---
Well nobody says you arent allowed to use your cc on the casters. Just dont 1v1 mobs out of taunt range. All that does is divide the healers attention and the tanks attention and chances are we will take longer clearing a group because the focus target doesnt die as quickly. Also try telling your tanks to use LOS. It makes everything so much easier. Sadly, many range classes start casting at the mob casters as soon as they see them...immediately pulling aggro and preventing the tanks attempts. A lot of knowledge has deteriorated over the years. Its too easy to taunt and pull aggro on retail so people just forgot about all of that.

Missing the point, you're supposed to say that stuff when recruiting not right before the boss.

And banning anyone that exploited it I hope.
---
This is damn near the definition of greed, but according to you its illogical to greed and you must roll need. Definitely a way to lose groups and even have people avoid your guild. It's already happening on a few servers.

Wait, this was Uldaman, right? How the fuck did you do Uldaman if you were the highest level in the group at level 40?

I gave up on that task. I dont want to injure my health :_S

Anyone remember a comic on here once where it showed how every class survived a fall, like mage with slow fall, and then the gag was the shaman just reincarnating? I've been looking for it but I don't know what to search for

That's what a lot of the complaints about layering have been about. Blizzard did say they were eventually planning to remove layering when there was a drop-off in players (whether that is in phase 2 or later I do not know).
---
Because classic servers can hold a lot more than vanilla could, without layering the launch would be 10 people camping every spawn at the same time.
---
On the other hand, there's a lot of spam about people wanting invites to layers to change the world they are on for various reasons. A hunter messaged me asking for a party invite to change their layer so they wouldn't need to compete with another hunter in the area for Broken Tooth...
---
That's without even getting into this whole exploit using dungeon layering, which seems like a massive oversight.
---
what would you call me?
---
Nah dude real horde just 1vX this alliance scum all day. üòé
---
I‚Äôm not getting resisted, my spells are getting evaded for no reason. The enemies are the same level as me
---
need should be the default and the only way to get it there is to roll need.
---
For a community consisting almost exclusively by straight guys there's an awful lot of public masturbation going on.
---
there‚Äôs a horde guild on grobbulus (rp pvp) called White Claw Clan. I honestly kind of love seeing them run around because it‚Äôs perfectly RP reasonable and at the same time not at all.
---
The real Geddy Lee would never approve of such behavior. Also, the real Geddy Lee would be a night elf druid, not a dwarf paladin.

Couple guildies did a pug MC the other day and one of them had two T1 pieces drop.

Needless to say I am bit jealous of them having been able to play that much for the past weeks.

FFA looting doesn't change how fast you complete quests, even if 1 person is looting everything. Once that person finishes, even if they continue looting everything the quest item will still be there for you.

They want to sell for more proffit and get epic mount asap.

Hi Frozen Boy o/
---
It's not much better past 45, at least on my server. I ended up doing BRD for most of 50-57 because I was so tired of hunting around for spawns.
---
If you only got an hour to play, you really shouldnt be upset about not getting loot. 
---
And comparing this to being robbed on the street... really? 
---
Its a game. Its pixels. You can go again and again and again. 
---
The only thing I can see the OP being upset about, is the fact that he got removed from the group. That sucks.
---
Why don't you go fuck goat!
---
Tailoring isn't really a gold making profession. In the early days of a server you can make some bags and it might make you some gold, but later on in the game there are so few things that are needed from tailors. Enchanting can be a really good money maker. If you happen to get some of the rarer enchants you can make decent gold while standing around in Orgrimmar.
---
I would definitely drop tailoring if I were you. If you want to make some money pick up a gathering profession like herbalism or mining (or both, if you want two new professions).
---
Esfand cleared MC up to Rag, then the next day they went back, we think possibly on a different layer, and when they went in the bosses were respawned, or werent killed yet on that layer. 
---
He was hesitant o kill or loot them until a GM was in chat and said hes cleared to go for it
---
The beginning, yes. It starts with mobs 37-40, but midway mobs are 45 and the last boss is 47.
---
Uldaman is meant to be ran 2 or 3 times.    
---
The last part is quite hard if you only have ~40-42s.
---
There's no point buying new ranks of kick and gouge, it's just minor dmg upgrades.

Why is the Alliance a bunch of ungrouping pussies?

---
Item reserving is supposed to be done in a specific scenario. Say a player in MC/Onyxia gear who has no business farming something like Stratholme agrees to go. There's one piece that he wants from the dungeon and having him there is a huge favor to the group's potential for success and overall strength.
---
In that case, I understand him wanting to reserve a piece. It's all he wants from the place. He's going to be a big asset and it makes sense that since his odds of gaining from the run are so low, he would want at least something to convince him to go.
---
But at this point when everybody is going in basically in the same gear, reserving is stupid.
---
Reputation in Vanilla means something.  It's not like retail where you will never see the players you partied with ever again.  Act like a shitbag on a Vanilla server and your reputation will begin to preceed you.  Sorry your friends brother is a steaming pile of shit.
---
He was taking the items i needed, e.g. a skeleton finger so i had to try again in the next mob, he did the same thing again so eventually i left and farmed skeletons alone.
---
???????????
---
Actually having loot rules that aren‚Äôt stated beforehand is actually actionable by a blizzard GM
---
&gt; or north of the Eastern Plaguelands. 
---
A venture into the ghostlands would be nice IMHO. Especially if we branch away from TBC timeline and make Blood elves at odds with the horde, either as a third faction or as part of the alliance (unlikely, given the bad blood between NE and BE). 
---
&gt; **Fleshing out classes and races with class and race specific quest lines from 1-60 with race specific rewards** 
---
All classes have equal amounts of class quest lines (3). Some are just earlier in the levelling process because some skills are locked behind them. Warriors are good examples, as they have all their class-specific quests past them at level 35 or so.
---
&gt; **New Raids should be tiered on par with the previous raids, not push past it** 
---
I think this is a bad idea. Because it'll create a situation where it's very easy to get a group for one raid that's popular and no reason to go to the less popular one. I see this at lower levels already happening: even on horde side it's hard to get a group for SFK, while WC runs are frequent even in low pop hours.

I think /facepalm doesn't work anymore, or is it me ?
---
Just a reminder that there's now a site for sharing macros created by a Redditor - macrohub.io
---
If you live in the Russian far east you get better ping on US Pacific than on any EU server
---
They should remove it. Because if what you tell me is how it works it means that it would ve poaai le for a faction to siege for example orgrimmar and yet people wouls be able to just join a layer where orgrimmar is not at war and nothing happen.

Make sure to post when they complain lol

it's not "greed" it's fair.  boes have universal value pretending it has more value to the person who can equip it is illogical.

Dude, they were just bad, that's all (and that's okay, no shaming).
---
Never understood the whole "x item is reserved", w&lt;e all had to run the inst x times to get it, i'm a clothie and doesn't matter to me that there is 3 more cloth in the group
---
like the stacking exp flasks on retail a couple months back that got preach banned, abusing bugs is not ok
---
Couldn't they track the number of boss kills from a single person over a period of time?
---
If a group killed the same boss 40 times in 10 minutes I think it would be fairly easy to tell they were purposely exploiting.
---
Why not? Seems like a pretty high priority thing to automate to combat gold sellers.

I thought that, but a coworker of mine from India had no idea what it was, and he's a fairly big gamer. Surprised the hell out of me

Man I wish we had servers like this for wotlk, just the Best expansion hands down. If you dont count the Lfg finder. Interesting talent tree and huge zones, really well made theme and class balance/ skills/ gear was much much better than classic ever was or will be.
---
simple equip does not work for weapons equipable in either hand.
---
use "/equipslot 16 Nameofyour1HWeapon" instead
---
for conditionals you want to put the coniditional before the slot number.
---
i got something along those lines:
---
/equipslot [equipped:shields] 16 2HWeapon; 16 1HWeapon
---
/equip Shield
---
/cast [equipped:shields] Defensive Stance; [equipped:twohanded] Combat Stance 
---
I typed this from memory, can't log in right now. It might contain some syntax errors. It should switch your weapon to 1H/Shield and switch you to Def-Stance and if you already have a shield equipped equip your 2h and switch you to combat stance.

You do understand what MMO stands for in MMORPG? Layering it's not there for you to be "it's to crowded for my liking, im gonna layer hop".
---
They‚Äôre definitely not weak!  They have a lot of utilities/abilities.
---
Watched a 40 tank spec pally defeat a 51 Orc rouge in STV.
---
Yep, did it yesterday and ... well didnt do it, only one guy got it in our group.
---
You saying it like personal loot is a bad thing.
---
I, for one, think personal loot is superior to the roll system.
---
poe has seen huge power creep in the last year alone even not taking into account the difference between release and up to 3.0
---
I agree, however..
---
Their solution to population was layering instead of a healthy amount of servers. I followed their direction and re-rolled to one of the newly launched servers. That server is now overpopulated. 
---
Occasionally (maybe 1 time during a play session) I ask for layer change when I am in a zone with more people farming than actual mob spawn spots. I know this qualifies as abuse to many of you guys, but I have already been waiting in queue for 30 minutes to get in.
---
They failed to properly estimage and manage population, and layer changes can be a coping mechanism.
---
I'm not talking about what other people are selling. How would more players mean that I personally receive 4 BoE rare drops in a week and a half?
---
So I'm a Herod warrior on horde. I usually roll with a shaman and priest. 
---
These names are now known in my group. My shaman friend is a complete crazy person. He lives to bring misery to opposing faction members.
---
&gt; as Blizz has told us repeatedly.  
---
Is this like when Blizz told us repeatedly that classic servers would never happen?
---
Insert Goofy scream.
---
Classic has tenfold more people per server. In function, each 'layer' is the size of a vanilla server.
---
Oh boy some ones gonna be in for a surprise come raiding. Half the fights my guild used a fury off tank it gets REAL common in aq40 and beyond
---
no punishment is unfair to cheaters and abusers of "game mechanics"
---

Fuck those guys.

I'm more surprised that people keep playing those games while shitting on them at the same time. If you hate the game so much, why are you still there? There are countless other games that you can play now.

---
yes, reddit is a hugbox where anyone who goes against the circlejerk gets their posts hidden by the hivemind. what a fantastic website.
---
If you're gonna live your life caring this much about vague generation labels as a definition of what a person is like then you'll have a bad time
---
&gt;Oh man I had a blast in Naxx. I have never had a gaming experience that even came close to the first time we killed 4H. It was truly worth the effort. Sapph and KT were pushovers compared to those 4 :P
---
4H is just about the most complicated fight in classic, IMHO. Everyone needs to be on top of their game for that fight.
---
Sapph is just easy after that, and KT is just a fight which deviates less from the regular raid boss.
---
For solo, just swap to berserker to get whirlwind out then switch back to arms while it's on cooldown.
---
A macro for it is pretty handy, lots of macros for warriors since stances are instant and not on gcd.
---
#showtooltip Whirlwind
---
/equip Name of Twohander
---
/cast Berserker Stance
---
/cast Whirlwind
---
So you can even quickly smack some dudes from sword and shield defensive stance with this.  Then either click back on arms stance, or make a macro to reequip one handed and shield and go defensive stance again.
---
You can stream Private or Unlisted (requires the link to be seen). In example, I stream Unlisted as sometimes I want to send the link to a friend.

I just deleted mine, it didnt seem to cause any issues when i did.

I think the word extra might be redundant in this sentence.
---
5% mana is less than a lightning bolt.
---
Serves them right for settling next to an unexploded nuke, no?
---
You can still type /pvp to enable yourself for PvP combat even on a PvE server - the only difference is that you can't attack others without them also being PvP flagged (because they typed /pvp or attacked you first) which for a lot of people isn't much of a problem. I did loads of world PvP back in the day on a PvE server.
---
Furthermore, for many people world PvP basically ends with getting level 60. The only world PvP you'll be doing after that will outside dungeon entrances and for farm spots, which can be more annoying than anything.
---
Eventually they'll add battlegrounds which function identically on PvE and PvP servers, and is where most of the PvP happens really.
---
So all in all unless you really like the idea of attacking people you see in the world, it's not really that bad that you'd give up that much progress tbh.
---
Sorry you had to deal with that. If I had a group I‚Äôd take you through all the dungeons you wanted :)
---
Roll back every single server.
---
Everyone starts At level 1.
---
This and only this will save classic
---
Yep, that option is available, but only on the default window with the general tab. If you drag a tab off to make a separate window, you'll find that option is not available on the new chat window you've created :(

---
ps.: would you mind to share your weakaura for the Poisons?
---
If you are "not ok" with 39 rogues in a bg, you should see 19 mage twinks annihilate 1v6 warsong gulch. Twinks are acceptable. Nobody except bots play battlegrounds for leveling. Dungeons had an ilvl barrier, battlegrounds not. Also blizz added NPCs to lock your XP so you can't ding. Want to pvp in mid levels? Aim a level 19-29-39-49-59 and grind gear for that, like you are grinding for raids.

Hi, been playing Classic ans enjoying it so far - but I hesitate to go for 60 with my shaman, as I'm not sure how well I'll be able to hold my own, regarding farming, PvP and dungeoneering/raiding. I want to play enhancement and only be the designated healer when desperately needed - but if possible go enhancement only. Some insight on that would be highly appreciated!
---
I absolutely agree with you, especially on the second part of your post.
---
I'm so tired of the "Stop talking about the future", "Stop trying to rush XXX", etc threads. This is obnoxious. I have every right to participate or not participate is any kind of discussion and I don't care what you think about how I'm playing the game!
---
I'm playing fast, I'm making AoE rush sometimes, sometimes I gank people and I don't give a single flying fuck about what you think of it. I'm enjoying myself with my guild mates and that's all that matters. I don't make reddit posts claiming my way is better than anyone else, I'm just doing me so fuck off.
---
I've had trouble with this as well. Seems most guides state that 2h Fury build is the way to go, at least until you can get Mortal Strike (arms). Two 1h Fury is also a possibility but I see many people claim that the chance to miss is quite high so that dps output suffers. Then again: if you enjoy dual wield fury then go for it.
---
You can tank most dungeons without points in prot. Obviously your survivability improves but at the cost of dps.
---
Oof but not untrue
---
Yo! Have you been able to find a solution?
---
It's been 15 years. People know damn well when they are abusing something not intended at this point.
---
I ran straight into a mob to test that out and I still got evaded
---
I recommend watching at least the beginning part of warrior deep dive with monkeynews on youtube. He goes arms and his way really helped me get through leveling on a crowded pvp server much better than i ever did before
---
WCIII Reforged can't come quickly enough.

Gold ramps up alot when leveling.
---
#nochangez crowed bitched a fit and got the 100% reasonable feature taken out of dungeons and restricted to raids
---
They changed looting options so the guy doesn‚Äôt even have an option to roll on anything and only gets loot when they hand it to him
---
Lest we forget.
---
You can always try and farm whelping pets. They are in your level range so you will still get XP. The mobs drop some greys that sell rather well and if you get lucky and a pet drops, that will probably finance you all the way to 60.
---
I'm not okay with any twinks not just rogues, it's incredibly pathetic and laughable. I don't intend on stopping people from playing it.
---
But I do intend on making fun of it and calling out the inherent bullshit with it.
---
Arms, and you will be a good enough tank. 30-50 use your 2-hander for tanking.
---
Are you Horde or Alliance?
---
it stuck vs this one
---
the only possible answer to this is, you're standing in a patch of terrain that's labeled as "water" or something else that these creatures will not go on (also happens when you try to attack something from on top of a building)
---
if it can't path to you properly, it assumes you're trying to exploit and resists everything and regens all HP lost
---
so either the world is fucked up in that particular place, or you're doing something you're not supposed to be doing
---
So that's where all the Baron mounts came from
---
Vendoring items off the boss for money. The best farm methods in the game involve vendoring boss drops. Mara farming works the same way. You can easily make over 50g/h doing this and it's raw gold. Not to mention the influx of enchanting matts brought in to the AH lowering the value of other hard earned matts. If you were to rush to 60 and start abusing this ASAP you could realistically have thousands of gold at this point. Gold that's being spread around reducing the value of hard earned gold. This absolutely does affect the economy and to say it doesn't is foolish.
---
Why is my text so big?
---
May he rest in peace and never be forgotten.
---
Couple thousand gold now = 20-30k later on. Just gotta know what to buy. The problem wont go away by wishing it would. The matter of fact is that people that did abuse layer changes are quite literally set for rest of classic. 
---
And other people grinding gold isnt going to change that later on.
---
i legit do this shit on the daily lol me n my bois got blackstone rings and its funny seein boomers get red in the face after it happens LOL!

The Game i already ruined. First the Raid-XP Bug and now this. Layering really destroyed the Game. People already got what they wanted out of it, its kinda pointless to remove it now.
---
2h arms until late 50's

dual wield fury with thrash and at least 5-6% hit gear from around 55-60
---
Never knew this was a thing. Ty internet stranger
---
Yes and no. I would love to experience the other add-ons with the same frameworks as Classic now. But re-developing all of the content just to make it fit into this mold, is just not happening.
---
This said, should Classic + happen (either with new expansions or free additions to the current game) I don't necessarily need the same story as retail. I would really like to see a B-Universe type of world. And please, for the love of god, don't add new characterlevels. Add better gear, class quests that add new skills to the roaster and post level 60 character progression trees. But no new levels... Adding new levels to Classic will, like in retail, trivialize the leveling experience to the previous max. And I don't want to feel like stop doing content when I reach max level because oh well, it's not efficient any longer.
---
And then there is a third option next to free content and Classic Expansions. WoW TBC Classic, WoW WotLK Classic and so on. They could pretty much ask us to level through Classic and then ask if we want to copy our Character to the next Expansion level. Important: Copy! Not move. If I want to play Classic, I should be able to play my character in Classic. And not make the decision to level another alt because my first one is now in TBC.
---
I just posted a reply about this, I ran straight into a mob to test this and I still got evaded
---
Enchantrix comes to mind, part of the Auctioneer suite.
---
Why are people excluded from the whole group just because they seek the item that the party leader happens to want too? They then have to find a whole new group just because someone is entitled enough to think they can reserve an item over everyone else - who are putting the exact same time and effort into that dungeon/raid.
---
People like you fuel the mentality that this is OK.
---
There are no shortcuts. Roll for your loot like everyone else.
---
Interested in why a locked chest would always be for a rogue.
---
It seems to me consistency would then dictate that if I would, hypothetically, run SM armory or cathedral with a group in which I am the only one with a key, then ALL loot, including the money drops, would be mine.
---

 Auctionator tooltip + TSM will provide data upon hovering as far as the avg price goes. With TSM in Classic you need to manually scan the AH using /tsm scan while at the AH to load it with data to pull from. Green BoE drops are a great place to start DE'ing.

---
I know similar questions have been asked a lot, but I am truly undecisive on this matter.
---
My problem with the economy has been all the single item stacks on the AH... I don't want to spend 20 mins buying 60 linen
---
I guess they'll eventually learn the hard way that that's not going to be possible when it requires ruining 38 other people's experience.  If you guys don't manage to run them out first, I guess.  This just isn't the game for people like that.
---
Just Report him kek
---
I think there are server discords, but so far I've only heard of them.
---
Literally any defense of Blizzard is a thorn in the eye for PS advocates.
---
The problem is that scarcity matters in Classic WoW. If every single Tailor has the patterns from the final boss, it doesn't matter anymore. If every DPS warrior is running around with Lionheart helms that rained down from the sky, the game stops mattering. Sure they're not injecting gold into the economy, but it definitely fucks with the system.
---
Act act like human beings
---
&gt; Also reminder: private servers could hold 6k people at a time on a $200 a month server.
---
You do realize that 1) WoW Classic servers have more active players simultaneously than that and 2) layering has nothing to do with capabilities, don't you?
---
Blizzard introduced layer because of the density of players compared to mobs while leveling. Without layer, you would still be level 20 waiting for mobs to spawn because there would be thousands of people camping a dozen mobs.

Is it possible to level enchantment on alt without getting it past lvl 5?
---
Master looter is when the group leader decide who gets the loot. Commonly used for guilds and tight groups. In this case the leader changed to master looter just before last boss so he could take an item from the last boss presumably for himself.
---
Reserving items is okay, but common sense dictates you tell people about it before the dungeon.
---
Well I haven't played wow in 10 years or more, but from what I gather, they waited 'til the end of the dungeon to dictate which regular item drop is reserved, instead of letting group members know beforehand so they can avoid wasting 30-45 minutes in pursuit of something they wouldn't get.
---
Also they just kicked him from the group for speaking out, it looks like? Very authoritarian.
---
Wait whos this??
---
How and what would that save exacftly?
---
I'd love for them to do stuff like this, but I cannot foresee blizzard doing anything that doesn't increase our stats by an order of magnitude every 4 months, or something else that completely derails the feeling of vanilla.
---
I want to see the magic of vanilla carry on through classic+, but I just have so little faith or trust in Blizzard at this point that I know it won't happen.
---
Blizzard, please, prove me wrong?
---
Does anyone know of any up to date mob grinding guides or tables for 1-60? I don't really like questing but I can just watch a movie and grind mobs on my rogue but I don't know whats the most efficient mobs to grind at what level that give good xp/gold
---
LFM "Dungeon" Full Clear.
---
&gt; Probably rollbacks on everything that came out of the abuse.
---
# LOL
---
Agreed. I haven't really had a single issue with aggro under normal circumstances with any of the tanks I've run with.  Shield isn't really necessary in Classic tanking until late in the leveling process anyway.
---
With a 2hander they should be getting aggro more easily if amything. The reason you want a warrior to tank with a shield is for, well, tankiness.
---
lmao might be the greatest thing I ever saw. rofld at work at this.

Most frost mages do not spec into frostbite while levelling, as it can totally fuck up your aoe grinding rotation.

Any addons that track outbid items on AH?? It makes no sense when I'm outbid on something while I'm not online and it disappears from my "bid" tab on the AH

It's really a realm rollback or bust. The entire server has probably pilfered off of these farmers. Rollback to BRD attunement and patch is legit the only fair way to go about it for those who have killed rage &gt;3 times because classic has only been out for 3 weeks and killing rag in one week seems earned.

---
&gt;I‚Äôm constantly pulling aggro by just spamming frostbolt and there‚Äôs absolutely not chance in hell I can AoE or else I‚Äôll have three or four mobs booking it towards me.
---
How about, you learn how to play your role and how threat works first and then you start blaming the tank.
---
as a healer, I've noticed this too.  The shield tanking means less crushing blows, so less healing.  I've found myself getting healing aggro as I've gotta break out the big heals cos the 2h tank is taking more damage!
---
I stuck in Berserker until around 40, at which point Mortal Strike is really good and sticking in Battle Stance was the way to go. Sure you can stance dance but you're often pooling a ton of rage from one mob to the next and you waste a ton of damage my getting rid of that through a stance dance.
---
Also pro tip, Sunder Armor is really, really good for killing solo mobs.
---
Seen this most times going into AH. How did people pull the mob into there and why didn't it despawn?
---
This is.. now all i'm going to imagine when i see anyone else spamming.
---
Action needs to be taken, Blizzard should start banning classic accounts. After the raid xp penalty abuse I have a bad taste in my mouth for exploiters in classic, and now the dungeon/raid layering abuse. I dont want more assholes ruining the game for their own benefit.
---
Not exactly true. FF14 and TESO were not remakes, both were a huge flops at the start, both reborn from the ashes and are doing great. Obviously established franchise helps. MMO genre by itself is dying because of simplifications and going after statistics and not making a gaming world A WORLD. It's easier to throw in some dragons or other bullshit bosses, make some complicated gear or progression systems and an ability to bypass it by buying stuff from cash shop. It was like that for good 10-12 years, every MMO except few did that.
---
I've played lots of MMOs: DnDO, NWNO, TESO, Allods Online, some L2, some GW2, BDO, BnS, the list goes on. My favourite of all this was DnD Online, I have a great memories about the game, and I didn't even hit the level cap (I played different chars trying new classes and stuff). Only DnDO and TESO had a compelling and interesting world in it that you enjoy playing in. Others were just a rat race in my opinion.
---
And by the way, an established franchise didn't helped LotRO.
---
Sword and board sucks until the later dungeons. A tank's biggest problem in dungeons (especially with AoE meta) is maintaining threat, which is easier to generate with a two handed weapon.
---
I just dinged 60, and am only recently seeing tanks using sword and board again in Schola, Strat, BRS, and the latter half of BRD. Up until then every dungeon group has been a dps fest with the healer keeping everyone topped off - and it's been going a lot faster than dungeons used to go with a million CCs and the DPS throttling themselves for fifteen seconds on every pull.
---
Turns out Classic was stupidly easy after people have been training in retail for the last fifteen years. Enjoy the unbridled DPS.
---
One more kneecap to me enjoying Classic. 
---
There has been so much cheating :/
---
They're excluded from the group by design which isn't fair. That's exactly what I was a saying and exactly the point I'm making.
---
Trying to shortcut the rolling system or circumvent it completely is wrong.
---
I hope people boycott this ridiculous practice.
---
No. You need to have a minimum level of 35 to get Artisan (up to 300 skill) level professions.
---
Level 20 for Expert (up to 225), level 10 for Journeyman (up to 150), and level 5 for Apprentice (up to 75).
---
I'm lbl 46 rogue with 300 herbalism and 275 in alch, waiting to be able to pickup alot of sun grass to make superior mana potion. My question is, will alch give me a solid income later? I'd love to farm quickly to get a epic mount as 60. Is there any trick to alch or is it generally bad?
---
Because you have a lot more people playing and sharing the same AH
---
What's the rush / point of reducing all servers to a single layer? Unless they are assuming by then that the number of people online at a single time will be greatly reduced by the time phase 2 rolls out
---
Herod Alliance
---
I wanna say that was also firelands. They were able to get it high enough to either almost or fully one shot a boss.
---
I may be to blame for about 5 of those alts...finally settled on one character though!
---
Desolace, stv, hillsbrad, ping pong back and forth.
---
The whole 28-42 bracket sucks.
---
Tbf I don't really support 1 people getting the really expensive BoEs even if it's an upgrade as leveling gear. Chances are it's just marginally better than what dungeons provide at the level, but twinks will pay good money for it eventually. I don't like the idea that the dude could just take it and sell it, or that the item is wasted on just leveling anyway.
---
Considering they banned tons of people in BfA for using an XP potion exploit, I think it‚Äôs pretty likely they‚Äôll drop the banhammer on layering abusers.
---
Why not just go to starting locations and slay all 1 - 10 levels? You'll have all the advantage you need, you don't even need to wait for low mana/hp..
---
Mmm does it cancel any cast? Let's say you open trade on a player who just stole the Elite on a long quest chain you have been patiently waiting for respawn. Maybe spaming the open trade would do the trick :)
---
5/5 cruelty is juicy and you will be wanting it, but not before mortal strike. Straight into arms it is!
---
It will be a painful road, but this is the best way to relieve the pain. Stance dancing is critical. Just to set some expectations :)
---
I actually upvoted you, I'm new to wow playing a mage and just learning pvp
---
well then your friend is an enabling assbag.
---
And assuming those people get banned, it doesn't seem like there will be much of a lasting effect. 
---
I think that's why people aren't acting like the sky is falling
---
Does anyone here use the addon Spy?
---
Where ever I am if I open my map up and look some place else and an alliance comes into the detection area for the spy addon it will reset my map position. Basically cant use my map if I'm in a heavily populated neutral area such as ƒ¢adgetzan as it will constantly reset the map position to where ever I am. Any one know a fix to this?
---
Special command?
---
Asked a group of 5 if they could hear it to see if it was just not working on my end but they said no as well
---
you still get rekt by undead.
---
you dont roll lock on ally side ever
---
You are grammatically correct.
---
They don't, IF they opting to go aoe grinding. If they go for solo questing and in zones with heavy ganking they sometimes just do. Been doing it myself while lvling in STV and arathi. They only mess with you once.
---
The image is cropped my dude
---
Especially since your repairs are likely more expensive than his/her repairs. Sometimes you gotta throw money at something just to make it go away.
---
what the fuck are those binds dude?
---
And no cooking mats unless you fish or farm lvl 8 boars
---
That's a 16 minute video, you got a summary?
---
Yeah, I've seen a lot of confused players running around Firemaw. They were all members of the Confused guild.
---
Neither of those professions really make any money tbqh, especially pre-60. If the goal is making money then I'd recommend just getting a gathering profession and selling the mats. Note that you can't track herbs and ore at the same time.
---
Well seema like Snoozy is an idiot
---
Well it's a good thing most of these people were streaming their entire way to 60.
---
The moment paid transfers are in place, Im gonna go there.
---
I PERSONALLY would say mage cause of how good Portals are at getting around. Mage also doesn't have to worry about the debuff limit for bosses so it's free to go any spec. 
---
THAT BEING SAID. Warlocks come super later game (AQ and Naxx) push past mages in dps with certain spec builds and good gear that looks past the debuff limit. 
---
If you're gonna PvP, warlock PvP is some of the most fun youll have in a long time. Mage IS good but after a while you just get obliterated by priests who burn your mana
---
I would agree that mana is the better option. Unless you're doing enough damage to be tanking/off-tanking, you'll normally have a slow 2H weapon
---
So much for "beta testing", next time invite real players and not streamers who want to cash out on behalf of Blizzard by "beta testing" the game for you.
---
I was never a horde player in the first place but what finally got me to reroll was the census data, theres like 50% more horde than ally on my server. I cant stand by idly while my people suffer!
---
And wpvp on the side of the zerg faction always seemed really lame to me.
---
People are split on this. There‚Äôs no wrong way.
---
But this is only the case for Questitems. This does not apply to Items that are not Questitems. Anyone who doesn't have the quest can loot them.
---
how is person A equipping it different from person b selling it buying a boe for their class and equipping it?  the end result is a person has a new piece of gear.
---
What's the rush to end layering? Also, won't that cause world's to be very crowded? (unless they are expecting active number of people to drop drastically by the time phase 2 releases)
---
/mountspecial in game will usually trigger the animation/sound
---
I gave a guy 1g yesterday for showing me where is mailbox in Undercity.
---
TIL that Druids are hunter pets on steroids for mages
---
Almost, but I don't want a third window; I want to the upper window to be able to swap back and forth between a party chat and loot tab because both tabs are anchored to that window, the way the tabs on the general-chat window are.
---
Semi-related, but infuriating story: I was invited to do RFD yesterday while in the Barrens. I had a warrior quest that I was ignoring (Fire Hardened Mail) because I never thought any alliance would run RFD. I figured I'd take the opportunity since it was convenient.
---
I told these guys I had limited time (2 hours) but it should be fine. I was the first one to the instance and managed to shower and shave before anyone else got there.
---
We clear through most of the bosses and then the other warrior in the group says "the quest guy is near the front" so we start clearing back through the pigs. At this point I'm running late and told the group I have to go as soon I finish the quest.
---
We kill pigs, then more pigs, then even more pigs. The warlock in our group says "oh look a quest." Everyone else is familiar with this escort and says "clear it on the way out". He decides to start it anyways. I hearth back and drop group.
---
How would people ask for layer invites in /1 then?
---
And you dont know how much they farmed. There are some power gamers running multiple accounts. Is it a huge issue at the moment. Probably not. But as soon as it got blasted all over here and the forums the number if people doing it probably skyrocketed. However even a few people having massive amounts of gold can cause the economy to go crazy. 
---
You're trying to dismiss claims based off your opinion. You have as much information as I do. The only ones who know are the people actually doing it, which either you are confessing to doing?? And blizzard. So which one is it? Opinion or experiance?
---
With the amount of rage required to make multiple sunsets worthwhile, I could have sweeping strikes up and a few cleaves down.
---
A real man of the clothless.
---
Pretending you don't know who esfand is lmao, stop being edgy Bart :), by the way you fail to see the point of the comment, the comment wasn't about you knowing who Esfand is, it was about you not googling for a second before posting a retarded comment, but sure go ahead :))
---
Imagine being that big of a loser you report that name
---
I was grinding black rock last night. Close to 70k hr so that's where I'll be soo fast.
---
They deserve a ban or a week rerolled of their characters lol
---
they have to actually close the trade themselves for that to work
---
its called respawning.
---
It's okay Torta doesn't give a fuck about Tooga anyways, he's better off. That Bitch!
---
Ahhh that's really cool! I'm loving all these wholesome moments that we're all getting to have! :)
---
Multiboxed once and 2 times duo leveling with friends on realms, things go fast when you know the most efficient route in the end after these years, yet you still enjoy it.
---
Didnt the guild APE exploit layering to level up fast before killing raid bosses? I'm still kinda pissed the world first went to a bunch of exploiters
---
I see a lot of people complaining about how this has "ruined" classic...  It really hasn't.  If you were around in Vanilla WoW, you know that there were TONS of early bugs that allowed duping and everything else imaginable.  There was even a cheat website you could pay a fee to get access to so you had them before they got fixed.  A few people getting rich doesn't ruin an economy long term.  All of this is going to balance itself out. With this bug, the people who did it are going to be extremely visible, and easily identified.  Blizzard can track EVERYTHING you do now, which was something they couldn't do in vanilla.  If you killed Onyxia/Ragnoros, or any other boss more than you should have, you're going to be flagged with a quick "who Ragnaros kill=5" script.  They'll probably put eyes on every level 60 to be safe.
---
I agree with your point, but granted, twinks in very good gear in general, across most classes, delete people quite well.
---
I'm really confused by how you can stand in front a mob and not notice your character is standing still instead of attacking all the way till death, so this might not help, but:
---
I either use autorun or manually hold down forward (w).
---
Autorun: Click autorun and wait until you're at your target. Press autorun/forward/backward to cancel the movement. 
---
Manually holding w: Hold "w" until you're in front of the mob, then release the button.
---
I only use both mousebuttons to walk when I'm lazy, and in that instance, release the buttons when you arrive at your target.
---
In all cases, I use 'a' and 'd' to strafe, and hold down right mouse button to turn around while using forward 'w'. 
---
But this is for playing a warrior, so as long as there's no chance of aggroing other nearby mobs, just use your charge ability on the mob. It should start autoattacking by itself.
---
Whenever I need to manually attack a target, I right click on it.
---
&gt; If the enemy moves and you need to turn around using your mouse, how to stop clicking other enemy in the process?
---
This has never been a problem for me. If you hold the right mouse button (to move around), it shouldn't hit other mobs. If your button is kind of broken, you should get a new mouse. I once had an old mouse with that issue, it was horrible
---
And Italians
---
I'm not sure I totally buy into the #layergate issues, but, they propagate world drops and rare crafting materials which dilutes the value AND over-gears the server. Beyond that, the practical limitations of layers vs sharding is kind of up for debate, as the game has been out for \~3 weeks and layers don't really seem to do a good job solving the problems they were implemented for even playing on one of the highest pop servers, Herod, I rarely had issue getting quest mobs and graphic lag going into orgrimmar, even on a totally full server - meaning - the layers were just not that big of a deal compared to 10 hour queue times which might have been better alleviated with sharding.
---
We get a free mount but we don‚Äôt get to enjoy the noises it makes :/
---
Why on earth is your micro menu front and center?!
---
Make sure you shit on their antics all over the place, get their names out.
---
I was in the same boat, but took a chance last night - didn't have any login queue (even on a sunday) - so I'd think its down to a manageable level if at all now
---
Swords are your bread and butter for pve. As for skinning, if you do a lot of it - vendoring is a good option. Also, check how prices fluctuate on your server, and if you soot a proper moment, drop them on AH.
---
the cheapest grey item in your inventory. It comes from an Addon (don't know which). useful for deleting items when you need room im your bags or vendoring.
---
You can highlight these items by pressing CTRL on your keyboard.
---
I would do the priest, because druid has more overlap with  the rogue. (leather gear, sneak ability etc) 
---
With both a priest and rogue at lvl 60  you will be more versatile in the long run.
---
This thread and the comments were very useful for me: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/csiasf/cheat\_sheet\_for\_warrior\_19201080/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/csiasf/cheat_sheet_for_warrior_19201080/)
---
Level as Arms 2Hand, carry a 1Hand&amp;Shield for dungeons.
---
Also make sure to use rend/sunder armor for leveling, it changes at 20 to AA one mob to build rage then two with cleave or just stick with rend/SA on single. Heroic strike is only useful as a rage dump or final hit so I've left it at rank 2/3 to save money.
---
Peoples are such bitches
---
Oh he gets the whip
---
Whos on first?
---
Don't think a druid is going to have more use for it than me (hunter), so no harm needing to sell
---
a lot of youtube video's say that hamstring kiting is important.  
---
But try  for your self, its annoying and hard to do...  
---
i skipped doing it after 10 levels and its harder in Classic, that it was on Pservers.  
---
I dont find joy in doing it :D, but try for yourself.
---
Lostredditor?
---
Sorry, but the EULA so so vague, it could apply to anything. Does mount "facilitate" game over player who don't use it? It does...
---
I always wonder what kind of people report names such as this one.
---
Any other casual players feel overwhlemed when reading stuff from more hardcore players? 
---
I have a simple mouse and laptop I play this game on, half the time I have no clue what im doing as far as profs go, and I really feel like I dont understand how to play my Mage. 
---
All I want is to be able to get into groups and do all the fun endgame stuff when I eventually hit 60 lol
---
I dont even have any addons because I dont know which ones I should use. 
---
Sorry for all the questions that could probably be answered on Google, but this game genuinely confuses me a lot of the time.
---
*pvp servers suck is your on the smaller populated faction
---
You mean it walks through the wall at mach 5? :D
---
Exploiting game mechanics in unintended ways for personal gain is in general frowned upon. You seriously should not excuse this.
---
Plus, no software is 100% bug free.
---
*Me and the boys*
---
....figures...
---
Even at 1080p does the quality of this video seem kinda low to anyone else? Like is it the bitrate?
---
yes single out the one choice of wording i used good counter to my post, next
---
It‚Äôs your vendor price app telling that that is the most worthless item Incase you need to destroy something to make space.
---
Please tell me you play a troll.
---
Yea it gets up on its back legs but no audio
---
Blizzard does not accept it and they take necessary action against it. And they handle it according to their rules and practices. OP wants to pass out judgement himself and demand that blizzard follow his opinion.
---
What you are describing here is general to reddit.
---
You will have those kind of reactions all over with any popular game.
---
You should have seen the Metal gear survive reddit, were you were forbidden and down voted to Oblivion just for daring to say that the game wasn't that bad...
---
4 days ago my Guild Master claimed priority on all plate armour. I needed on a cape he also wanted so when I won the roll him and another guildy got annoyed with me saying we agreed he gets prio (was okay for the fellow guildy, I‚Äôm assuming because he‚Äôs a leather wearer or sucking the GM‚Äôs asshole) GM tried claiming he was taking time out of questing to help us (the dungeon is suitable to his level. They started calling me an immature baby. Left that guild immediately. All I‚Äôm saying is, if you happen to be part of Pyrewood server, avoid grouping with Whelp Pit‚Äôs GM named Kurotanki. Couldn‚Äôt believe the nerve.
---
Early on it's better to do AoE in a group. Was doing satyr quests in Ashenvale with a priest and together we had like 8-mob pulls, not planned that much but with those extra shields, heals and dots it was working. Later with ice barrier some murloc pulls but mount it's the sweet spot. Also some mobs will be slower which can help.
---
 How do you still need 50g for a mount at level 45?
---
Like, what are you wasting your gold on?
---
I'm having a problem with the new elvui where if more than 1 item needs rolling on I can only select need , greed or pass on 1 item. The other item then eventually times out and auto passes for me. The only way around this I can find is to reload ui I can then roll on the other items. 
---
Does anyone know how to fix this ?
---
Ah, That is it! Thanks bud!
---
Paladin Charger missing it too.
---
Level 14 not long before I get mine XD
---
How exactly is the game ruined for you in particular?
---
Mate you can kill Ragnaros five times in a row. How is this not very evidently worse?
---
If you give any person a reason to report you when they're mad at you, they will
---
It's just petty shit that happens on PVP servers or even just between your own faction
---
Well hes an asshole
---
It‚Äôs from an addon. When you press CTRL it shows you the lowest value grey item. If your bags are full this is the item you should delete if you‚Äôre not near a vendor.
---
Thirteenera is just wrong.  All maces, swords, and staffs in classic have a low low low (0.001% chance or 1/100,000) of being rolled as a 'Destined' item.  (Destined is the item code attribute).  This means that these items can be used in the crafting of the eventual legendary items. 
---
Destined maces are required to craft Sulfuras
---
Destined swords are required to craft Thunderfury
---
Destiny staffs are required to craft A'Tiesh
---
Black market destined items can go for upwards of 20k gold when guilds are progressing the relevant item.
---
I don't like layer hopping in the world but yes it is entirely bloody different. Anyone can stand anywhere in the world and wait for a mob to respawn (layer hop is the fast version of this, essentially)
---
But standing at the end of a dungeon and getting a free boss respawn? The game has never allowed this, if an instance resets you get put back at the start. A layer hop here completely cuts out the intended work to get there and the time.. then you add in raids which are only supposed to reset once a week (give or take) so these people have downed god knows how many bosses in MC when they should only "legally" have had access to what, 3 resets?
---
If you cannot understand this, there are 3 options
---
- you're a moron
---
- you're a troll
---
- you're one of the exploiters
---
Hopefully you are the 4th options
---
- you just didn't get it and now do
---
It's not
---
if you ever want to do any instances at all just go arms all the way.
---
Tactical mastery is the most important talent available.
---
Now end game is getting started, what do we think these beasts will go for on average?
---
On private realms the price of these are so severely inflated, going for 1k easy to high end pve guilds.  Think that price is realistic on Classic? Or is everyone smashing through end game going to make them less desirable?
---
*people who exploit the system are extremely more rich than everyone else*
---
Wait are we talking about WoW or billionaires IRL?
---
Some people like to ruin other peoples fun, and they validate themselves by thinking they're a 'troll' and they think that being that way makes them superior to others, and immune to being trolled themselves.  When in reality they're just sad jerks who aren't happy themselves. So when they see someone that's excited about something, they want to take that away from them because they're unhappy with their own lives.
---
World of Warcraft attracts all sorts of demographic. A common theme among most people that play though is that they like that escape from reality, because maybe for some they're unhappy with what reality is to them. These people are all around us, saying things like "cringe" over someone being excited or "umadbruh" over something that a person can be justifiably upset with. 
---
A lot of people on reddit, and a lot of people in WoW fit this hive mind profile of unhappiness and are ready to try and take away any sort of joy from other people, and they're quick to do it. 
---
They're not 'trolls' there just sad, pathetic, and petty people.  And they're everywhere.
---
If you see someone trying to take away someone else's joy step in and stand up for the person. Validate their joy, and ignore the troll. I really don't understand why people can be so hurtful towards others for absolutely no reason. 
---
also seeing that this post is 25% upvoted means that majority of people have downvoted this. Why downvote someone that's just trying to spread a message of acceptance to others? - Because they're petty.
---
They changed it to master looter, which means the party looter decided where the loot goes. They did this just before the boss instead of telling him that a item was reserved before the dungeon started.
---
Good stuff wont be available for streaming reliably.
---
Amateurs.
---
Even worst than a private server
---
Happy cake day!
---
20/80 and 200/800. There is a 10% discount if you are honored, in which case it would be 18/72 and 180/720.

---
yes, go to holy to have consecration, after that you can go to prot.
---
Consecration+righteous fury make a TON of aoe aggro. You should be able to tank any dungeon fine, as long as the group let you like 2/3 sec to build your aggro with consecration before unleashing hell.
---
The main problem of the paladin is the lack of taunt meaning that if someone took the aggro of one monster, it can be hard to take it back.
---
BAN THEM ALL..........
---
Gnomes have the largest mount of any type not just the Fel steed
---
I find it absolutely insane the way people rationalise completely obviously broken things as being OK to abuse just because they're broken in their favour.
---
In what universe is it ok to abuse exploits? These are the people who try to move labels on products to get them to ring up cheaper. Just because it's in the system doesn't mean it's right or intended.
---
Yeah probably true it just makes me sad when thinking of the ingame community is great beyond belief
---
It's even more fun when you do it in pvp! There's something really satisfying about having to use all your forms to bring an enemy players down. Feels like a true hybrid
---
Jesus. I forgot how wild and cutthroat Stranglethorn Vietnam was. Without layering it‚Äôs going to feel like trench warfare again.
---
*trees speaking in common intensifies*
---
"As rude as that may be. Take it as a sign to start your own groups". Tough luck kid, make your own group next time.
---
Saying things like this reinforces ninja looters, don't do it. Shame them, blacklist or ignore and be done with it.
---
no way you have enough mana for this as a feral druid. story is bs or you're leveling bad
---
This is great! I found it on a guide somewhere.
---
Maybe someone could help me troubleshoot though. It doesn't loot the money I pickpocket anymore (I have autoloot on). So it can look like this at times:
---
Use macro: loot lootbox, stun; kill the mob; loot the mob, autoloot everything; loot again, gain another bit of money that was probably from pickpocket.
---
How does this happen?
---
Well, you can do many things at once and if that is a clash with capitalism ideology then sure.
---
But....
---
I can control my gold income/spending but I can‚Äôt control the happenstance if a Krol Blade drops and the choice is to first decide whether to roll or not and then secondly whether to use it or not. It‚Äôs like if Felstriker, Ironfoe or Dal Rend (MH) drops. If one of them would drop I‚Äôll roll and use it but I‚Äôm not gonna try and buy the others to pass it (who also are more than likely rolling). If I am following what you are saying I would basically have to sell Felstriker for vendor gold because ‚ÄúI have mount higher on the prio and my current weapon works good enough‚Äù. That makes no sense, wasn‚Äôt what I meant and goes back to my first point that you can be doing many things at once. 
---
Same situation with Devilsaur. I quested in Ungoro while leveling and got 8 leathers to make the first piece: gloves. So nothing is sitting in my bank passive. Next time I head there I might aim for another 6-7 leather while mining and earning money that way between lapse chasing for Devilsaur. But yes, you are correct. Until I have the 14 leathers ready it is gold I am not using but then again if I have 6-7 leathers in my bank I know I‚Äôve saved 90g should I decide to purchase whatever I miss for the legs or liquidize by selling them should I decide I don‚Äôt want the set after all and potentially earning more (under the assumption more and more people hit 60 and prices rise since the supply is contested). 
---
And for the record. Never did I claim in my post that someone should have prio on Krol Blade should it drop (your last praphraph). If it drops it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs choice whether they roll or not. I was only arguing that from the POV as a human warrior I‚Äôd use it should I get it from a drop. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it from AH or force anyone to pass it to me as but should I loot it I feel it would be worth using. Just not having to be stressed out about farming for Dal Rends and rolling against 6 people each time would be pretty neat. 
---
But I play in a guild with plenty of private server players and from their perspective Krol Blade is a complete waste since they rather do 150 Rend runs to gear their melee instead. But if Krol Blade can be sold for 250g+ means someone is willing pay premium to use it so it has to be decent, right?
---
What do you mean by stronger though?
---
&gt;the players have spread across Azeroth
---
Tell that to the dozens of people who farmed fucking Satyr horns yesterday on my server.
---
Very true. Good point
---
Time to get ready for another DDOS when bljzz bans these self righetous shites
---
To be honest only layering.
---
I guess they might have a place for twinks so potentially they can yield a pretty penny:)

as soon as a cat gets through character creation the gaming evolution will take place. humans breeding the best cats for the best playstyles. bright future ahead!

My first time joining a guild the other week and within the first 5 minutes got belittled because I said I was a girl following a misogynistic 'joke'. I have an inkling it was because I had better stats than him.
---
I've heard there are add-ons for the game. is there any type of ah tracker?
---
They asked blizzard CEO yes, it was very fine.
---
But on the other side: If people run raids for months and don't get anything, they are also leaving. MMO's build on a reward spiral. And if this spiral stops at one point, for one reason or another, people will get the feeling of "Why am I playing?".
---
This happens way faster in retail because gear is pretty much handed out as candy. But it will also happen in Classic because gear is as rare as a lifetime free ticket to Disney Land.
---
I want to be rewarded for running raids over and over again. This reward doesn't need to be instantly after I cleared it. But maybe build in a safety net for people who are particularly unlucky with drops. If it's in the form of tokens, or other items that can drop in raids to craft these items, I would be totally happy. But having no influence in all of this is also not really fun.
---
A good indicator is what blizzard says is the maintenance time right next to the account and password boxes at the login screen
---
well i kind of gave up around level 38 and asked myself, "self, do you want to farm gold *without* mortal strike, or *with* mortal strike?"

Auctioneer is a good tool. You can do scans on daily basis to obtain info about the prices and their trends.

Maxing it was near impossible, at most you got 1-2 weeks worth of AP out of it and people who exploited it to the max/organised groups for it got bigger bans/had AP removed.

Google how to use slam, until you get mortal strike, for when health isn't an issue. Kite and white attack w/sunder spam for overpower works well enough solo.

You missed BFA WQ exploiting to rush reputations and also missed the 30 days ban for "exploiting" the unstacked xp potions also on BFA
---
WQ exploiting got reverted
---
XP potions got people banned upto 30 days
---
This is just factually wrong, I play paladin myself and none of these arguments are true. 
---
First of all, paladins are a good al around class and we can both heal, tank and dps, AND we do everything FLAWLESSLY
---
Furthermore, we paladins can easily sustain ourselves and doesnt need someone to carry us. The first alliance level 60 on my server was a paladin, which further proves the glory and honor that is held by those who play paladin.
---
If you dont think paladins are the best class ever you are mentally retarded and you should be shot dead where you stand, everyone should fall on their knees and pray to their god whenever they see a paladin pass by.
---
Also our survivability as paladin is off the charts, I can easily 1v2 every other class as paladin because Im basically unkillable.
---
If you think otherwise you're a blind sheep
---
Imagine getting down voted just for a simple post. Lol

Horde/Alliance balance is literally about 50/50 right now, and there's no real problem finding groups at any kind of level. Maybe at around max level it's a bit hard, but from level 13 to 45 I've seen a lot of groups searching.
---
Auction house is going pretty well, though there's not THAT much stuff on it yet. Will take a while for prices to stabilize though. Herbs went for a lot the first days, now the price is going down a bit. Same with other things.
---
WPVP is definitely a lot more relaxed on this server yet. KOS'ing will be different to the players you encounter, but I've been on both sides. Been KOS'd by 30+ (because skull level) alliance, have been ignored by 26-skull level alliance as well. The first true test for me will be hillsbrad, but Ashenvale was quite relaxed.
---
Why even reply if you don't know anything
---
A friend and I are just getting started duo leveling priest and warrior. We just want to level and make some money for mounts along the way. We're both new to classic and we have limited time together so even getting to 40 will probably take a few months. Which professions should we take? Which build for my priest?
---
cringelord
---
How are you having difficulty understanding this? You form your group, you reserve an item. You put it on master looter before the relevant boss. Nobody can do shit to ninja your stuff.
---
I bought it on the AH. It can drop from any mob in Barrens, so the market is filled with them horde side.
---
Dammit how did I miss this
---
Question: Would technically be possible to hop onto another layer where all quest mobs aren't killed?
---
very much this, I tried it, finding a spot to grind takes waaaay longer then just doing solo stuff like everyone else. Unless you go at 6 AM, everywhere is overcrowded for aoe grinding. I always hear other classes complain how OP it is for us to do be able to do it, and then compaire everything to Jokerd's run, but he was 10 lvls before everyone else, so no other people near his spot.
---
Spellcleavage in dungeons is very viable however, a bit to viable, tbh.
---
So you have the trade window open at Qia and last page and then spam macro? (To get the pattern, I need aswell)

Wasnt he farming crowd pummeler? The feral druid weapon that you need to have like a million of to do competent dps/tanking?

Yeah thats a good point. Although in saying that, theres also a few little hidden gems that the odd player here and there knows about. You never know

The forced renaming has been around on RP servers since vanilla

Bugs and layering. What shitty fucking launch. Seriously just fucking shitty. People leveling faster due to instance bugs. People getting unfair more gear due to instance bugs. Several people skinning the same mob, due to bug. Layering making everything shit.
---
That it lags when Orgimmar is attacked by the Alliance.  
---
Comon blizz.  Servers bruh.
---
It's like tanks are like this in every mmo. It seems that the majority of people that play the class have the same personality disorder. 
---
I use to always roll tank in mmo's and it is nice to be the center of attention but I definitely wasn't a pre-madonna.
---
Rogue hear *laughs in improved sprint*
---
Exploiters transferring all good to alts Inc
---
Sure but what about the newbies that aren't sure whether or not the stats will improve their performance and/or wish to fiddle around with it or ask for advice about the item in question?
---
Imho during leveling hands down spirit wins, i compared myself to many mages, with their own accord we used same spells same ranks, the downtime reduction is incredible with spirit. In dungeons i have to drink a LOT less.
---
I will start gearing properly after 52+  when getting into late game. Then it's just chasing your biss and its usually spell power then intelect. 
---
Also this is for dungeons questing and solo play, AOE leveling needs plain and simple Intelect and Stamina, hp and mana ...
---
Ok mate, I‚Äôm not going to argue with you, just please go and continue your crusade in other threads. I will enjoy whichever game I want, even despite your opposite opinion in that matter

What items do these bosses drop that are so valuable?

Did you just kill a mage while clicking and using fade vs a player?? Im impressed.
---
It‚Äôs blizzards game. They make the rules and they try to make them fair. Just because you and OP loves permanent bans does not mean that it‚Äôs the right thing to do. Just like in the real world the penalty is different for different felonies.
---
You got a link to it? Seems crazy a GM would say it's fine to clear a raid twice in one lockout - but if a GM told him it's okay he's fine.
---
earlier post regarding a likewise topic, shows us that they wont suspend your account on the first act.  
---
So OP, your account got suspended, but was this the first notice of Blizzard regarding your name ?
---
Also wondering this
---
Dude n-dale was way more extreme in almost every zone than on classic some quests were just completely undoable. There is a small issue with this on the major peak hours but outside of those there is literally no need for layering man, i leveled my hunter alt in duskwood and i ran into 3 people from level 21 to 23 from midnight to 2 am yesterday? Can‚Äôt remember the last time I struggled with a quest because of too much contest ever since launch days. It‚Äôs anecdotes but the more people the more alive the world feels unless quests are literally undoable. Layerings main purpose is server stability not gameplay quality I can‚Äôt believe you don‚Äôt understand this.
---
Again. Lol. Currency is not a guaranteed boost. There is no item in the game that scales off currency. You have to use currency to attempt to get an item or upgrade. Not on the AH? Not guaranteed. Cant afford it? Not guaranteed. Cant reach someone with the profressions you need? Not guaranteed. I still run dungeons with anyone, but after this mentality is shown I would never run with you again. I wouldn't be mad, just wouldn't want to spend my time with you again. It would possibly get your guild ignored too. Even though you want to hurl insults, I dont think your way is wrong, I just personally dont want to play the game with people that are doing that.
---
Really missed out on calling it a Rave Cave
---
A little of column A and a little of column B?
---
30-40 sucks for questing but great for dungeons..I would suggest running some scarlet monastery and doing easy quests in stv
---
I think the dismissive part depends on your server and the people in it. My server so far I haven't met anyone rude or trying to peddle that crap but they certainly exist and that's what gives me concern about all these games that want to bring back the supposed old school values. Those values are dependent on people *not* being selfish, rude and elitist but the mentality of the past several years has been to min-max everything and find everything optimal and do everything optimal or it's not worth doing.
---
Dark :)
---
You're assuming people will go on abusing this bug and those who did won't get punished.
---
The bug is being fixed, so the couple of thousands won't become 20-30k later on. Abusers will be punished as by recent blue post, maybe they won't catch them all but the worst offenders will for sure.
---
And no, getting a couple thousands gold now won't set you for the rest of classic - assuming they won't be banned for it but I wouldn't be so sure.
---
U no take copper
---
Wait so if you‚Äôre having dinner in a restaurant, and a guy comes over and stabs you with the knife he got with the steak dinner he just paid for, you would blame the restaurant?
---
I think it is pretty dickish when people are just trying to get along and then the one night elf rogue 5 levels above everyone drops in and kills someone that was low from fighting a mob anyway. Especially since there is no reason or benefit from it.
---
At most, and they can't do shit about it as they're stunned for the duration.
---
Blizz permabanned people who abused the enchanting dupe in Vanilla. I wouldnt be surprised if they take out the ban hammer on this one.
---
The original comment you replied to was about removing the mod tag from a comment. You derailed the replies into something about a whole different post. Keep up :)
---
They will do absolutely nothing, as banning everyone actually doing it exposes how awful layering was in the first place and outright lying to the players after it was reported.
---
happy cake day lol
---
Why does that matter. Whats the difference in telling him and making excuses if both result in not playing with him. At least if you‚Äôre honest theres a chance he will start caring about it more.
---
It's not for you to decide wether your zone is overpopulated or not. Layering is done on server basis, not zone basis, and its done automatically. It most definitely is abuse of game mechanics.
---
Ask yourself this - if this zone were filled with opposing faction, and there was no way to force layer change what would you have to do then? There is solution to your problemb that does not require layering abuse, and you know it.
---
/lick
---
The way Blizzard handled the realm population for sure!
---
2 EU English PVP Servers, how could they only make 2 ????!!.
---
Many guilds prepared for several weeks and months to classic . Then the Realmlist came out, and guilds decided on a realm.
---
They tried  to save it by making 1 (ONE!?) realm more a few days before release, but come on, guilds, friends etc were already placed on the first 2 realms.
---
They talked about layers, and they could handle the big ammount of people who wanted to play, because they had their layering, but I still  find myself in queues on 8-10 hours.
---
Lvl 28 with 84g.
---
Wasted 20g on fancy equipment and bags for the looks.
---
Gold source = AH + afk crafting
---
Pick a profession, explore it, read. You don't get gold just from exploits and super farming spots. Every profession now can make money if you put the hours into it and don't get greedy.
---
I can make from 1 to 5g per hour from vendoring, depending on AH supply. From my experience, putting items in AH that are not grindable is BS. You rely on other people's bad choices. Selling cloth, leather, herbs, ores, fish, meat is legit.
---
pala always win in pvp
---
Well, I spent literally 3 days straight at Maraudon, easily over 25 hours. The ring dropped only a handful of times and I was never lucky. On the fifth hour of the third day, rolling against 3 other people, I got lucky. I will never go back to Maraudon again. The end.
---
in my book it's ninjaing if you need just to sell it. it's ok if you actually equip it.
---
If your server is busy enough, you may be able to character-migrate?
---
Don't know if it's exclusive to drain tanks. I'm playing a hunter, and yesterday I was having problems with some mobs in Wetlands. at about 30% HP they'd run back to their spot and start evading, and regaining health. Then they'd come *back* to me with fuil HP, and the cycle would start over (could never kill them). They'd also pul aggro off other mobs that were far away.
---
Good luck trying to kill quest mobs without layering, it's already crowded enough in many areas.
---
I think other than taunt, the main problem was a lack of any defensive cooldowns like Shield Wall to pop in times of need.
---
I find it sort of sad how _few_ changes are needed to really bring all the specs and classes up to par. For ret, just adding crusader strike would be enough. Let alone any aoe.
---
There feels to be more of a competition in getting to 60 now. That reduces the effectiveness of rested. The slower you take it, the faster you do it in terms of /played time, if you maximize rested like any reasonable person does with their alts. But if you grind yourself to 60 within few weeks, it's easy to be starved on quests. I didn't go to dungeon between Gnomer and ZF, which lead to serious starvation on nothing to level on but grinding mobs without rested. There's just not enough quests between 30 and 50 levels.
---
Post on official server forums and discord as well. Blacklist these idiots.
---
So because it's Blizzard's game, people shouldn't be able to express their opinion about how the rules are enforced? That seems to be your argument. "Just don't care about it :)" is what your answer was to OP.
---
Because I can:)
---
&gt; the raid bosses until Naxxramas are immune to taunt 
---
100% untrue
---
You get to decide because it's your group. You are the PARTY LEADER. Everyone is entitled to make their own groups with their own rules. Most groups aren't like this, the majority are standard group loot.
---
Kek [Aim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzES7qwe20Q)
---
Why you are so against layering? I'm playing and never have any issues.  
---
Yes, when you join party - some people in the city will disappear and new one will appear. How it's affecting you?
---
Well to further that just wipe the whole account of gold and gear.  You don't have to ban the character but I still think their should be a fitting punishment. Try to get ahead by cheating? now your way behind. 
---
I think just taking the earnings is too little of a slap on the wrist.
---
Lol good joke m8
---
I would recommend an add on for faster looting. I‚Äôve been told that it solves it most times however I haven‚Äôt actually tried!
---
Machine head agrees
---
&gt; People thinking this has somehow cause irreparable damage to servers are out of their minds.
---
It's Reddit, something is either the worst thing to ever happen or the best thing to ever happen.
---
Unless their a Resto Druid, Which they would have a much bigger mana pool from intellect, and mana regen from spirit, and alot of druid Bis has stamin (bear form) now considering this im sure you would do pretty mediocre damage in cat form all thought catform has decent 1v1 potential when it comes to pve in my experience plus the bleeds help alot, but this is part of a druids rotation, so this story is possible if done correctly with kiting and allowing mana to regen IMO
---
Its a quest reward.
---
Nah, grind is slow, but i can understand, that he wants to be on 60 asap, because i know the feeling. I have fun most of the time with questing, but have the urge to get to maxlevel, so i have no pressure getting 60 anymore. Idk where the pressure is coming from.
---
Obviously, that's specifically why they made the post.
---
You should have messed
---
You keep saying ‚ÄúHe is the Leader‚Äù ‚Äúhe created the group‚Äù like that gives him authority and power to decide anything. Like its an effort that gives him rights. It does not and you are wrong. Everything about this is wrong and should be shunned by any rational human being. But to each his own. :)
---
The reason not to do it is because people will write it in chat, then the high-level counterganks drop in and nobody will get any questing done because suddenly the whole area is filled with people 10 levels higher killing everyone on sight.
---
You sound ridiculous.
---
Buhu - stop crying and go back to a shitty private server. This is the classic version we got. And I'ts the best we ever had fince BC. So be happy and stop complaining.  
---
I am sick of those "layering a huge problem" guys. Technology evolves and the player base does too. You would not be able to kill anything if there would be no layering. And Yes people will abuse it. But what's the fucking point? That he gets an Item which he throws away after 5 Level? And even if he don't - he destroys his journey! Not yours! He will leave the game faster than everybody else because there is no competition for him.   
---
Get over it and enjoy the game!
---
That‚Äôs why I always ask for the loot rules and screenshot the response.
---
There are two different sets of blame here.
---
You can blame blizzard for causing the problem in the first place.
---
You can absofuckinglutely blame cheaters for abusing the system for their personal gain.
---
The first is a mistake, an unintended consequence of a system implemented to ensure we can play the game but don't end up having a hundred dead servers after the initial surge. Can blizzard be blamed for implementing an exploitable system? Yes. It was either a mistake or a conscious decision that they felt was worth it when weighed against the benefits of layering. This was a mistake. It's Blizzard's fault it exists.
---
The second is deliberate, intentional abuse of that mistake in order to get ahead of other players who do not abuse the system. This is a fully valid thing to blame people for, and you are not entitled to abuse it just because it exists in the game. Nobody is forcing anyone to abuse the exploit at gunpoint, there's no instruction to do so, there's no mention of the system existing in the game, there's absolutely nothing implying it's intended. It's the player's decision that causes the problem, thus it is their fault that abusing it causes problems.
---
Blizzard cannot be blamed for players taking negative actions that damages the experience of others. All they can do is enforce it. This is exactly the same thing as people scamming or master looter conflicts, where last I heard if the terms of the agreement are clearly laid out in chat, Blizzard will typically take action to enforce that agreement. If you get scammed, is it Blizzard's fault for implementing the trade window? If someone breaks into your house and steals your TV, do you blame the guy who installed your windows because it's possible to smash them, or do you blame the thief? Removing responsibility from the cheater simply because the exploit they abused was technically possible without hacks is ridiculous.
---
Let's take a less extreme version of your example, because there's no element of choice for the player and they'd immediately take the game offline to fix it if it ever went in because it's so extreme and unavoidable. Let's say there's a bug where when you click on a player 100 times within a minute, they get disconnected. You can absolutely be banned for exploiting that bug, and it is absolutely your fault, because you are making a **conscious decision** to abuse that bug. There's no genuine reason beyond using the bug that someone would want to click on someone else 100 times in a minute. There is a difference between a bug existing that ruins the experience vs a bug existing that people can abuse to ruin the experience, and its existence is not justification for using it.
---
I believe that bagnone has this function.
---
Item can be tracked and that person will get their money back in the mail from blizzard. Easy. Any item they replaced with the new item will also be sent back
---
If these are not fixed soon i'll create a video presenting the exact issues with the mentioned points. 
---
Some people, typically non hunters, still claim that FD is working as intended. It's not. I played hunter in true vanilla, i played hunter in retail and i play hunter again in classic. All the things mentioned are connected to spell batching for sure, but whether it's connected spell batching or something else does not change the fact that it's not working correctly. 
---
1) Feign doesn't always leave combat. 
---
It fails because your movement and your fd gets batched so it kind of "breaks itself". Basically what you have to do is , stand completely still and remove your hand from your mouse so you don't even pivot your camera and then you click it after 1.5-2 seconds. If you do it too fast or you pivot your camera or make any movements at all, you will fail a very high percentage of the time. No error message, no resist, it will just go on CD and break itself and leave you in combat.
---
2) Multiple traps
---
If you have two hunters that both place traps, you have to place freezing traps then you need to space them out A LOT. My friend and I both play hunters and we like to use freezing trap in dungeons, but it can be a real pain to use because if you place them too close they will both trigger on the same mob. This was not the case in vanilla either. It's definately also a consequence of spell batching. 
---
3) Spell batching in general
---
I have also found and reported another bug concerning spell batching that is abusive as hell. But obviously i will not spread it through the community and be part in making it more wide known. The reason why i state this is that even if you, for some reason, don't care about the state of the hunter class then you should care about the state of the game in general and so should blizzard. So my thought process is that the major bug, they will definitely have to look at, either now or once it becomes well known, which it will at some point and at that time they will have to redo the spell batching either way. So lets just hope hunters gets a better outcome of that than the first iteration of spell batching.
---
Players found an exploit in the layering system that allowed them to run the same raid multiple times in a week, when they normally should not be able to do so.
---
Got 4 hours on Butthole and a 24 hour suspension lol
---
Just saying, you may be due for a rude awakening.
---
people who wanna save it incase the video/website/internet etc goes down?
---
I'm currently lvl 30 with leatherworking on 155 and skinning on 225. Should I keep leveling my leatherworking or should I start to sell the leather I gather so I get to 100G faster? To properly level leatherworking I'll probably have to buy some leather on AH as well.
---
But didn't you hear, people are running around with 100s of thousands of gold, server economies are ruined, and everyone has bis!
---
Hunters are legit the worst. So many ninja looters ‚Äúbut I melee often enough thats an upgrade for me!‚Äù
---
I try to be a couple of levels above the mobs as I fine-tune my skills. Mana shield and pots are your friend. Try to save your blink for when shit goes wrong.
---
Is that a working version of Fishing Buddy? It's finally out there?
---
Check out Pond
---
i'm 31-0-8 at the moment. maybe imp charge and imp bloodrage are the difference.
---
I prioritize stamina because it is useful against both casters and autoattackers, and I haven‚Äôt decided to grind one thing. Stamina also creates a greater benefit for what resistance you choose.
---
That's the spirit
---
Try something like
---
`/use [@player] GRENADE`
---
or with shift click on player, otherwise on cursor
---
`/use [nomod,@cursor] GRENADE; [@player] GRENADE`
---
You can add ‚Äò#shiwtooltip‚Äô on the first line to get the correct tooltip. 
---
Note: Replace ‚ÄòGRENADE‚Äô by the name of the grenade, preferably shift-click the item.
---
You‚Äôre a better person than me. If they bodypulled mobs I needed - I‚Äôd snag them without hesitation
---
Just be sure to keep doing it so your name gets around and the people on your sever know to avoid you.
---
Just curious, what made you think it wouldn't?
---
What you wanna do in BRD? What kind of runs? arena only or full runs? Are you going to visit with normal grp oder AE / meele cleave\`?
---
How that would go for me with my luck:  
---
Grinding certain quest mobs, I'm at 9/10 kills. I'm killing the final mob, a hunter walks by and asks for invite to get credit for the kill too, sure why not, BOOM THAT ITEM DROPS AND I LOSE IT TO THE HUNTER.
---
That wouldn't be a problem for me. I'm mostly against the layering because it inflates the population cap on realm too much. I just wish for vanilla server option for classic, with pop cap 3-4k like in vanilla (or even 5k)  without layering. Playing in these 30k realms where 10x more players than in vanilla just isn't the experience I wanted.
---
If some are ok with layering and non-vanilla realms, that's ok. I don't want to ruin the party for you. I, myself, just wish for vanilla server option. There's plenty of people who would agree with me, and are ready to start fresh just to have the vanilla servers.
---
The bad ones are the best if you need kills or drops: wait for them to die and finish off their low health mobs. I play a healing class so this is especially satisfying to me, "oh you needed a heal? Fuck off and aoe somewhere else, I've got a quest".
---
I dislike this kind of stuff. It's fine to say it beforehand but I try to tailor the groups I run with around what class/type of drops they'll most likely want..   
---
For instance, for Deadmines me and my warrior buddy looked for cloth wearers (of which there were plenty because of the coveted Emberstone Staff) so we had a better chance of getting Cruel Barb. That way everyone wins.
---
Thanks for writing that out.
---
From what I see on wowpop, Heartstriker is comparable to Dragonfang so I'll just make the leap and get in the free server trans before it closes.
---
Even if there's a bit of actual PvP going on, anything is better than not being able to make it off a boat alive **every single time**.
---
Here's to hoping that Blizzard will introduce paid server transfers in the future.
---
So to make it clearer on how I do things I Charge and while the charge animation is going off I use blood rage, auto straight into sweeping strikes (this happens rather quickly) macro beserk stance into whirlwind while spamming beserker rage button which is also the same hot key as my blood rage and once I see the whirlwind go off I have a macro to swap to sword and shield and defensive stance in one button push. 
---
Practice on some solo mobs to get the rythym before going into a dungeon.
---
So meine explain layering to me pls
---
Well yeah, that's exactly what classic is. Shadow bolt spamming is kind of what we asked for...
---
This is why I tell my group to have everyone roll need on every boe blue.
---
I‚Äôm a bit off on my knowledge of vanilla loot systems, can someone elaborate on what‚Äôs going on so I can avoid this on my server?
---
Noo yes it probably was for shatter.  
---
Yet it is not worth it to Blink + Nova for that. You waste a good chunk of mana and time while you could just safe it because the priest probably starts running towards you anyway in order to fear you. You could just Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Nova, Cone of Cold, Blink.   
---
Instead of Blink, Nova, CoC, Die :D  
---
But it most certainly was meant to get some good shatter crits in ;)
---
clever
---
If you were able to do more than five clears within an hour it will definitely be bannable
---
Exactly, just because I may see a mage running towards the same mob I'm running towards, I don't have to give it to him - I have just as much "right" to go for it.
---
Trying to level fishing, currently at 170 and I feel like I've hit a wall. Takes about 4-6 fish per skill point now, is that just the way it is 150+?
---
Got my from twitch/curse
---
Yes, that is exactly what I wanted. Thanks a lot!
---
This is what‚Äôs actually happening
---
Blue post reads "We‚Äôve recently become aware of a bug that could be exploited to allow instanced encounters to be completed repeatedly."
---
Alt reset method for Maraudon does not bypass the 5 instance per hour limit. It does not change layers, or respawn bosses, or stop you from having to clear trash again. It does the exact same thing as hearthing out, clicking reset, and walking back in. The clips of the "Repeat Instance Exploit" does much more than this.
---
&gt; 1 guild controlls everything because they are abusing the layering 
---
Someone's been consuming too much propaganda. You shouldn't blindly believe everything you read on the internet.
---
Who cares actually... Why not enjoying the time while leveling....people are like "I have to get to 60 to play the game"  
---
No...the game is a Journey to become stronger. What does it help if you are the first one who becomes 60 if nobody else is able to join your group? You still need a lot of People for the raids...
---
Got called a retard getting my whirlwind axe
---
You are 100% wrong. Him being the leader and creating the group does give him the authority and power to decide. Why the hell else does Blizzard give the power to adjust the loot settings to leader? BECAUSE HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO! Same reason why he's the only one with power to kick anyone from the group!
---
&gt;private servers could hold 6k people at a time on a $200 a month server.
---
Why is this relevant to anything, 6k people on a server isn't blizzlike either.
---
Thanks for the useful bit of information...
---
Ram sounds are in, can confirm this. Horses don't whinnie ;(
---
Yeah just start fucking up all their pulls, and then you got the whole place for yourself. Some of those mages might remember you and will refuse to group with you but that's fine because mages are like sand at the beach :)
---
As a tank I wouldn't join "aoe" groups, it might be efficient but It kinda ruins the game play, in my opinion
---
Used to follow some form of grinding guide as Rogue back in late vanilla, but can't find it with a quick search. Dig deep with Google!
---
I did consider it when they started with the emotes and whispers
---
layering killed classic wow, called it months ago was downvoted then and please downvote me now.
---
This was probably not a smart thing to say around here.
---
The problem is layering wasn't supposed to work inside instances at all.
---
Until you reach 30 and get Fury Stance + Intercept you're screwed if a ranged enemy gets the drop on you. You can try and gapclose but in general you'll die before you can get close.
---
That's kind of just how it is as a lower level warrior.
---
If a melee enemy engages you, then the best thing you can do first is Intimidating Shout on whatever mob you're engaged on.
---
Then make a choice, run or fight.
---
Run: Just GTFO. Hamstring the stunned mob and beeline it away from wherever the feared enemy ran. Then either find a new place to kill mobs or try and get the jump on them with Charge into Hamstring.
---
Fight: Finish off the mob asap. If you don't it will Daze you and then you'll have to deal with being constantly slowed, this usually means death.  
---
Bandage up and get ready to fight!
---
unless you are asmongold
---
Agreed and you can say this up front right ?
---
Do I need a fifth of Jameson every Friday night? No, but it helps.
---
I'm keen on layering. Even with layering I still find it hard to complete quests due to all the groups doing them. Blizzard said there is single digit layers at one time. So let's say 5. Imagine 5 x the amount of people trying to complete quests near you as there are now. It would not be fun. Layering is great.
---
They literally made blue post 8 or so hours ago that they are banning the exploiters
---
Your evil deserves silver...
---
1% from Hinterlands elite quest trinket
---
Lets agree to disagree buddy, have a good one :)!
---
Take a break
---
Can't speak to this exactly but there is a pool/node of fish that can't be reached in stv, north of grom gol near the basilisks it appears in shallow water and is impossible to cast in to.
---
When warriors PM me to join my group I tell them we already have a tank.
---
DF is fine. It's "low" but I've not had a single issue getting groups, plenty of people still joining. AH is not as full as Golemaggs was but still plenty able to buy more or less everything I've wanted.
---
There are several alliance guilds advertising that they have 350+ members. I don't know why you'd want that many, but no reason to assume it's a lie or anything.
---
The world is comfortably full at least at levels 15-42 (my char ranges).
---
Is there anything useful I can do with my leftover Rough stones? Should I just sell them on the AH?
---
*offering a hug *
---
I‚Äôve had some (luck?) getting my warlock pet to spin around his target trying to flank! Pretty uncommon but always a hoot.
---
I believe they've mentioned that they intend to phase it out over time.
---
so no taunt, nodef cd, low aggro and oom fast. thats doesnt sounds too nice to me
---
It's not "agree to disagree" this 100% straight facts, you're just unwilling to accept them.
---
Are there any zones that have a really good story throughout in relation to the Orcs, Thrall or Grommash? 
---
I am going into Stonetalon Mountains now at level 25 but I don't know if Ashenvale would be the better choice.
---
Sad face. Thought it was in vanilla.
---
Again the key here is communication and common sense
---
What's that round circle add-on towards the bottom right? Looks sexy. I want it just for the looks
---
Grinding your reputation to exhalted is a huge gold saver for the 60 mount, think it's "only" 700ish then.
---
Show me a thread that pointed to instances being layered.
---
Those weapons aren‚Äôt even that good in Classic. Don‚Äôt spread disinformation.
---
Well. Hard to argue about that.
---
‚ÄúUp to snuff‚Äù, those booty bay denizens sure love to snort
---
Man druids in pvp are frustrating af, they get their damage off in cat form, heal themselves, and if they switch to bear form I swear I feel like my swords become toothpicks
---
The link the other person posted is decent, but I'll include the actual macro I had in mind here. (For reference the base hotkey I have assigned is "R" but it can be whatever.)
---
    /cast [nopet, nomodifier] Call Pet;
---
    /cast [pet, nomodifier] Feed Pet;
---
    /cast [modifier:ctrl] Revive Pet;
---
    /cast [modifier:shift] Mend Pet; 
---
Hopefully it's clear enough for just reading it, but I can clarify each part if need be. The first part attempts to call your pet if you have no pet out. If you have it stabled or dead, it will throw an error. The "nopet" modifier is good to only cast it when you don't have a pet out rather than throwing an error every time you do have one out. "Nomodifier" helps clarify that this is the default action, as excluding it might call it even when using a modifier.
---
The second part feeds your pet if it's already called. In this case I did not include a specific item. You can edit this to have your pet each a certain exact item of food but with this setup it casts Feed Pet to then have me confirm with clicking an item in my inventory, or right clicking to cancel the feed.
---
The third part attempts to revive your pet while pressing Control with your hotkey (in my case, Control + R). If your pet is simply not called or isn't dead it'll autofail and throw an error. The fourth part will cast Mend Pet while pressing Shift with your hotkey (so Shift + R for me). One could edit this to require combat or some other condition but I find I sometimes want to mend both in and out of combat so I made it more general. If one wanted they could do like Alt for Dismiss Pet or add additional actions, but this pretty much covers the main stuff I want to do with my pet regularly.
---
Level disparity doesn‚Äôt seem to be as strong as it once was. 
---
On 3 separate occasions me (priest) and my buddy (warlock) have smoked skulls (Pally/HunterX2) that have attacked us in open world.
---
IMO, being THE hero doesn't lend itself well to the story that's trying to be told. Being called a hero is fine, but how do you define THE hero of 10/25/40 others in the raid or even worse, out in the world? If one person has the mythical weapons of legend and is the leader of their premiere class group, then so is every other player of that class and it just doesn't work in an MMO story. At least not with WoW's or how WoW does it.
---
How are we all supposed to be the Highlord, wielder of the Ashbringer? I never felt like I was the Highlord because I have no interaction with this group I'm supposed to be the lead of. I'm commanded around by all my underlings to go do mundane tasks but never got to have a say in what we're supposed to be doing. I'm told that I'm the equal of these major lore characters now but I never do any leading. Why am I being called the leader if I'm still being treated like a pawn? Also, why am I not collaborating with other Highlords? Group content is the whole point of MMOs but I never have to interact with another Highlord to do anything related to the story of being the leader.
---
Skinning, Mining, Tailoring, Enchanting.
---
OR
---
Skinning, Mining, Herbalism, Enchanting
---
The second option is pretty simple. You gather and sell to vendors or the AH with skinning/mining/herb. You use enchanting to disenchant things you don't need and sell on the materials.
---
First one is similar. Except you use tailoring to convert your cloth into greens which you then disenchant. Depending on your server economy it can be more valuable to turn cloth into enchanting mats or to just sell the cloth.
---
I'd say go with the first set. Tailoring will also mean your priest can make some ok gear for themselves and can also make bags for both of you.
---
The addon classic codex will also show you all quests available on the mini map. But it won't show quests that start by clicking on an item that dropped.
---
"Ooh do I have a deal for you!"
---
tbf Rogue is probably the ideal class for a tank spec Pally to face, the Rogue will pretty much kill themselves.
---
Okay thanks. Ye I suspect I just haven't been playing as much as my friends
---
It's because they care about the game that they complain.
---
"Skinning a bear should aggro every bears
---
in a 40 yard radius. It makes sense, you are actually skinning their best friend."
---
Would also love to get my hands on that addon.
---
The last Item is Pattern mooncloth right now and thats number 30, so why is it item 38 you buy? Thanks for reply tho :)
---
It doesnt have to affect the economy. Spawning instantly raid and dungeon bosses is bad on its own.
---
People who started late, people who reroll, and servers arent almost a month in, its efficient.
---
I dont play mage, but I played MMOs in an era where you GRINDED for everything. I dont find grinding boring, people find questing boring too - its all subjective.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
"Everyone, has experienced mobs respawn in dungeons". 
---
Nope. 
---
I am level 50 have never experienced this. I also specifically advertise for non spell cleave. But, I have never seen monsters "randomly respawn". 
---
Come on now, when you have. 5 man party and invite a 6th man and all log out for a time and log back in, you are going to play the i didn't know this was possible. 
---
Ban everyone. 
---
That being said, I think if I got banned for anything at this point, I definitely would not reroll. I don't play retail, so I would just unsub account. But I don't buy the, "is this wrong response".
---
The first version of the cables can be learned pre-200.
---
I mean, there is enough mana for this but it is still bad lvling. Never start a fight with 0 energy if you can avoid it. But... he is having fun so fk it. Let him have his fun
---
To be more precise, personal loot was nesesary because WoW in-game communities became so anonymous and souless that you could easly get away with it without any reprecusions - all because of sharding and cross realm LFG/LFR.
---
Your plan of giving the finger to the tens of thousands of players on every realm that didn‚Äôt use the glitch will undoubtedly sow seeds of distrust between players and blizzard. You must not have any time invested in classic yet if you are this gung-ho about a total wipeout.
---
Ya well, I am lvl 51 @ 7d played and found 1 epic and 0 blues. I remember finding a lot more blues in Vanilla. Personal experience says nothing.
---
had to do it 3 times with 2 groups since a guy would always start it
---
Blizz needs to ban all those that exploited layers (for farming, too) and dungeon-raid xp
---
You‚Äôre obviously not very smart if you think blizzard has been successful prior to classic launch.
---
It‚Äôs ok doing it in a 5 man at 60 imo (example: ironfoe emp runs). The key thing is that it needs to be explained and played with everyone at the start (and preferably in the LFM advert).
---
It‚Äôs absolutely not ok to do this any time during the run and also it‚Äôs pretty scummy to do it at all pre-60 imo.  But at least if ur gonna do that then make sur everyone knows before deciding if they want to do the run or not.
---
&gt; how they should release content from here on 
---
Stop making these threads. There should be no further content and if you still insist on discussing the matter then do it in one of the already existing Classic+ etc. threads.
---
All the cleave groups spamming lfg. It's really not that big of a deal especially as a tank that has my choice of groups but the attitude it has created has kind trickled down into the player base. It feels like having a single "cleave" class in a pug group makes people think its appropriate to pull everything heedless of reality... 
---
Last zf group (quest run) I was in we had a warlock, hunter and rogue for dps, not exactly aoe heavy, and the damage output wasn't high enough from any of them to facilitate large pulls, but of course the warlock had clearly been a veteran of spellcleave and behaved as such. Ooming the healer pointlessly aoeing and snatching aggro being in melee range as a caster and acting very put out that I wasn't going out of my way to make the run miserable for everyone by trying to Hella XP Mega AoE Grind. 
---
Obviously this is just one group but it's an attitude I see around. Hopefully it'll get better over time. I was just looking forward to a more relaxed experience while pugging but I might have to simply put together a regular group or be very picky with who I bring along.
---
world layering is functioning as its intended. the instance layering wasnt. its pretty simple to understand why they aren't the same
---
You're mistaken and in wrong subreddit. This is not Vanilla. This is Classic. Classic isn't vanilla, just a vanilla-like retail wow.
---
But you took the wrong stance in your post; the best fix for this would be to open fresh vanilla realms without layering and no migrations. Vanilla players could have what they want, and Classic players what they want. And everyone would be happy.
---
Pet Growl/Distracting Shot one of their pulls out from the pack, drag it around until the mage is almost done with their AoE'ing, and dismiss pet/feign death it back into their face.
---
Yeah man if it gets to that point then fuck them. Kite your mobs into their aoe so they pull aggro. Multi shot into their nova so it breaks before they can blizzard. Trying to think of other shit that pisses me off when I‚Äôm trying to aoe lol but I‚Äôm tired, this is a good start I guess
---
Fuck these guys. I buffed one of them and he didn't buff back, asked him if we wanted to join a group and he didn't reply and then he was constantly tagging everything around me. So I decided to fear all mobs and sure enough two of them didn't get frozen, ran around getting social aggro and got him killed. The asshat had the gall to ask for a ress. I consider myself nice for not spitting on his corpse.
---
Hi, I'm Horde on Skullflame. Looking for a casual'ish guild that has plans to do raiding in the future. I have a few classes between 10-20, I've been trying them out to see what I'll like the most. At the moment I'd say priest, shaman or warlock.
---
Can play sometimes during the week and have lots of free time on the weekends.
---
Do you have any recommendations on those LW items? I only trained the ones necessary (just following a leatherworking guide).
---
And u can deactivate all the modern parts of it :)
---
I also think dual wield fury is awesome, but you need more hit rating when dual wielding. I would wait until 60 and stick to 2h while leveling.
---
As for tanking, just go with fury and put a 1h + shield on, when you're tanking dungeons.
---
Not sure if this is a troll or a Cata-baby...
---
sup yall
---
Precision in the Combat tree. Its on the second row, so I'd imagine every rogue build always uses it since hit is so valuable.
---
Ah, I wasn't home yesterday. I was referring to the blue post earlier this week about using layers to farm large amounts of rare items.
---
Rookie, I've had Taco Bell butt squirts last longer than that!
---
and i got felstriker twice in 3 runs of ubrs. only won one tho.
---
bannable? absolutely
---
will someone be banned for it? that's what we can't say
---
Yeah I'm honestly not sure what to do versus Mages in Wpvp. Blessing of Freedom effectively makes their slows useless, but there's not much I can do about them blinking away or using Frost Nova during freedom's downtime.
---
I can get close to them once or twice but usually don't have enough time to finish them and then I just can't get near them again.
---
At this point if I see a mage I just run away and hope they didn't see me.
---
Wait. 
---
I have picked up the Scarlett key already... 
---
Is only one person allowed to pick it up each run??
---
You dont think Blizzard has the money and resources for a 15 year old game to save people from you ruining their sub again for the next 15 years?

Back in TBC, we cleared the whole of Scarlet Monastery with 2 Hunters and 3 Rogues. It wasn't the smoothest of runs but still managed to get it done. 
---
This run remains of one my fondest memories of WoW.
---
There are multiple loot modes here.
---
The party leader and group did the raid, then just before looting the boss, changed it to master looter(meaning only 1 person can loot the corpse and then distributes it).
---
Master looter is reserved for trustworthy groups because the ML can take it all and run or decide who gets what.
---
After complaining that this is ridiculous having run the entire dungeon on probably group loot, he gets told dont worry, then is kicked from the group, getting nothing.
---
when you stand on top of a lotus node you can switch layer five times to get five trys in a row for a lotus spawn, or not?
---
Are you retarded? Layering outside of dungeons aren't punitive. Can you get banned by using it to farm bosses inside dungeons which is an obvious EXPLOIT? Yes, but that wasn't even what we're talking about you retard.
---
Temporarily banned.
---
Resetting Maraudon was possible with a similar technique during actual Vanilla, and you are still restricted to 5 per hour. It wasn‚Äôt considered an exploit back then and shouldn‚Äôt be now IMO. Using layering to kill her or other specific bosses repeatedly every minute until your bags are full is a completely different animal.
---
Well I ain't seen all these threads when I pop on reddit now and again.
---
It's all still relevant to the page so if you don't like it i'd advise just ignoring these threads in future.
---
Ahhh, the dark times
---
I‚Äôm not abusing anything. It‚Äôs a system setup by Blizzard, and rightfully so. Serve capacities are way higher and as mentioned countless of times a medium pop server is the same as a full server back in 2004. 
---
Whether they needed layering or more servers is not something I‚Äôm talking about, but still. Population numbers are what they are and removing the layers right now, is not the preferable route. It sure as hell isn‚Äôt abusing. I‚Äôm never asking for a layer swap...
---
The fact that you respond like Trump shows how fucking ignorant you are.

Do you have a link for that level weak aura?

Thanks

Mans had 3 posts in the last 3 days begging for people to teach them warrior. Safe to say they‚Äôre not even close to 15.
---
No problem. A note on dungeons, which is where you most likely have your first real interaction with players and where people might have expectations: 
---
Most people I've ran dungeons with have been quite chill when a newcomer to WoW has tagged along - there are always some kids in all games who think they're the bee's knees and won't miss a chance to mouth off at you, but just ignore those. State that you're fairly new to the game or have not been to this or that dungeon before, stick close to the healer (as in not running in the front), mind your surroundings and follow kill order / sheep marks and listen to any possible dungeon advice from the group. 
---
For the most part, Moon symbol is what people want you to sheep, and your priority is to make sure it stays sheeped until the other mobs are dead. Re-sheep as needed. Skull is universally kill prio 1, X is for the most part priority 2, and the rest are a bit free-floating. Your healer will love you for conjuring water and for casting Frost Nova at the melee monster who hightails past the tank and wants to murder the healer (or sheeping it, if no Moon is up). If the tank and healer both can take it and as you to, you can use AoE spells to damage 3+ enemies at a time - only do this if enemies are non elite or group asks for it. AoE means each individual mob more or less dies at the same time, and they will get in a larger number of hits on the tank, draining much more of the healer's Mana.
---
These are somewhat unwritten rules and mage-related dungeon tips - you might already know it all, but hopefully you found something useful.
---
What exactly would I be punished for?
---
A very Aussie/NZ reaction!
---
Pressing alt+up arrow when the chat box is open cycles through your last sent messages. No need for copy/paste.
---
It's pretty slow at those levels even if you're fishing at the proper zones for your fishing skill.
---
Right, but I'm hoping for a list. For example, questie doesn't show https://classicdb.ch/?quest=123
---
Sounds to me that you're so bad at reading that you need more lessons. Go back to your school and show this post, and you might get the help you need.
---
&gt;\- So according to some research in google, magic power bonus on items are same with spell power. But then why those 2 exists differently?
---
Afaik, they don't. It's the same thing. Where exactly did you see "magic power bonus"?
---
&gt;\- Why there is a statement such as "magic power bonus up to 20", what exactly up to 20 refers to. if it is just 20, then why it is not stated as plain 20?
---
Again, where exactly did you see this. Nonetheless, it might just be a reference to [spell coefficients](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow). 20 bonus spell dmg will not add 20 exact points of dmg to instant cast spells, for example.
---
&gt;\- What exactly intelligence do? in character sheet it says it increase crit rate, and uncle google says approx 60 int is %1 crit chance, but then how exactly it contributes to the magic damage? is 1 int=1 spell power?
---
Afaik, int doesn't contribute to your spell power, except maybe for some classes via talents(?). Only contributes to spell crit and mana.
---
&gt;\- Do shadow damage bonus effect drain health damage? Skill tool doesn't say it is shadow damage
---
You mean "drain life" the warlock ability? It should be a shadow spell, but I don't know for sure. Test it out?
---
&gt;For example(i made up all the numbers here to make the calculations easier) lets say curroption deals 200 damage over 20 secs and we have total 100 spell power bonus and we gotta multiply it with 0.6(also made up) since it is not 1:1 ratio for instant cast spells, so it means the damage shall increase by 120. This makes 320 damage over 20 secs which means then it should deal 16 instead of 10 this time. But it doesn't work this way. What am i missing?
---
You didn't provide exact details for your testing so there's no way to tell what went wrong. Maybe mob resistances? Who knows?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?spells=11.202
---
Or the addon Atlas loot for an ingame solution
---
Toubwont see spellcirt gear while leveling ,spellpower is pure dmg .
---
If you had an item that gives you more net benefit from soellpower go with it , if the item has more int but doesnt brake the spellpower item  then stick to soellpower. And you need alot of intelect to be able to cast one or two more frostbolts, but spellpower will still be better if the net +dmg from your manapool is larger than that one extra cast you can gain
---
People need to understand that when leveling there is no OS/MS - everyone needs leveling gear.  Being angry cuz ur tank or healer wants some dps gear at level 30 is pretty fucking retarded.
---
Oh, I don't have to change your mind. Bosses will do that for me when they land a crushing blow on the Paladin killing them.
---
Do you have any evidence to support that? I'm not saying this because I distrust you, I'm just genuinely about this ^^
---
Ok with most of the ideas and I could deal with barbershops even if I don't want them, but keep transmog the hell away.
---
I love that you can tell roughly what great someone has just by looking at them. Does it lead to some weird looking armor sets, of course, but that's part of the beauty.
---
Being able to take a warrior or paladin through a transformation questline starting at 55 would've been so damn cool thematically and would make me feel more connected to the story. Hell that could've been done with Demon Hunters as well. Too bad they abandoned the idea of a hero class.
---
Fun fact! This item was intended to start a quest and the end result of which would give you a much improved version of it. Was cut before launch however so the item is left behind in its current state.
---
Fair enough, can totally understand why with ideas 4 and 5!
---
Hopefully I don't burn out, super enjoying the game so far and really wanna press on with it!
---
Ive only ever noticed it with succubus, and I figured it was a bug with her stealth so I just turned it off autocast.
---
53 and casually in 18 days don‚Äôt mix
---
So not a full list of quests?
---
I agree. If I compare the PoE beta to todays gameplay, you already feel the differences from the start. In Beta I played with a friend and the second area already ramped up in difficulty that we really had to be careful how many enemies we pull at the same time. Todays PoE is like "More enemies, more fun". It is not really possible anymore to die before Act 4. At least if you don't go afk while fighting 30 enemies at the same time.
---
It's a really niche damage spell but it's still useful, and you do use it sometimes. But you shouldn't use it over other spells in a fight that takes place inside of 30 yards.
---
You make data analysis sound like some arcane magical pursuit, worthy of the upper echelons of the Kirin Tor. It just isn't.
---
mage aoe farm spot 95% of time, sadly
---
Cat form gives base AP + 1 ap per agility
---
I think that's a bit of a stretch just to put blame on sharding/cross-realm stuff, which is par for the course here sadly given how much hate that garners.  I don't think it's necessarily false, but it was way more than that.
---
LFG/LFR absolutely contributed by giving people anonymity without repercussions so there was even more incentive to be rude, but it was just an evolution of a disease that had already spread out:  The "got mine, fuck you" mindset too many people have and continue to have.
---
This happened to me yesterday.
---
Warrior was doing a dungeon for the 8th time for a drop and asked us tot not roll for it.
---
So we didn't when it showed up.
---
1 yes
---
also nothing against a barbershop
---
the rest - NO! especially no to collections!
---
It's me
---
Couldn‚Äôt you just Need on it anyway? Or am I missing something?
---
I saw an Orc warrior last night named Jizzcrank. He was well in to his 20s or 30s. I salute you, sir.
---
What realm are you on? Leather prices and competition probably fluctuate a lot depending on realm, that will impact prices greatly.
---
&gt; everyone is recommending holding on to what you want to sell until after the economy calms down
---
This will just create a second surge of supply, dropping prices again, or keeping them low for longer.  The best way to get prices to increase is to lower supply.  Vendor them for raw gold now and remove the items from the economy.  This should be the case with any item that can be easily farmed at any phase of the game.
---
This weekend gone was the first weekend I‚Äôve had since Classic released where I had no plans. 
---
Racked up 30 hours game time in those 48 hours, I‚Äôm kind of disappointed in myself.
---
I love how neither of you wrote exploiting correct.
---
What? Who said that?
---
Is that with 1.08? I haven't been in a dungeon or group since I updated so unsure.
---
In Korea, it was unbelievably more mainstream than WoW will ever be. They literally deferred their mandatory service if you were a professional SC player and had multiple cable TV channels dedicated to it.
---
People who behaved like this played with other people who behaved like this in Vanilla. As the game was built around a social aspect the community polices itself when it comes to which behaviour is acceptable. 
---
Back then there was a much higher expectation in how people behaved in general.
---
It's a situational thing. Whenever you find yourself in a cave or somewhere with chained mobs and stuff it's really nice to have the option to aoe everything. For that reason I went with aoe spec. Maybe I'll die some more in stv but I think it's worth it. 
---
Probably will PvP spec in phase 2 though when the gankfest really starts.
---
But it makes the game playable. You're able ot find groups, be social and play the game as an MMO. Go to a realm like Judgement and you'll spend 5 days trying to find a single group for one instance run.
---
I'd be personally fine with that.
---
Cool with just barbershops being barber shops and not god damn plastic surgeons :P
---
It's a grind in the same way grinding goblin rep on retail is a grind. Yeah, it takes a fair amount of time, but it in no way shape or form takes actual effort.
---
Huh? Permaban. And credit card ban. blizzard isn't the UN so fuck it. Don't play or lay for cheaters.
---
More bans, quicker we are done with layering folks!
---
Then you should think about it slowly and when I say slowly I mean FUCKING slowly!
---
Since I have somebody who uses spy here: Does this addon work only on enemy players or on friendlies too? I'm not a fan of the ignore function but I'd like to have some sort of list I can put people on that are complete asshats regardless of faction.
---
This is nice.
---
Guilty conscience sounds guilty
---
Was this on Sulfuras? Had a shaman ragequit cause I rolled on corpsemaker there.
---
who cares man, an asshole is an asshole.
---
Paladins can win duels, yes. But Paladins are EASILY avoidable compared to every other class. So, in reality people who will stay and fight you are people know they can beat you.
---
I mained a Paladin and I agree with you that we are underestimated but we are not terrifying in World PvP at all.
---
Lmao always check your paste
---
But I killed all of them anyways. In my PvP I'm all about inclusion.
---
Kill hundreds of them to raise/lower faction
---
I don't know anything about OSRS, and even less about those specific items, but if the difference is so negligible, what is the incentive to carry out whatever is needed to get those items?
---
Everybody back in the day.
---
Ouch!
---
Warlocks have two mana bars: their own, and the healer's.

---
When I was leveling my first Draenai (paladin) in 2007 I noticed a gnome on Nightsaber mount, who farmed low lvl Azuremist Isle quests for Mount reputation. A lot of gnomes I know are mount whor... collectionists.
---
I have magic eyes, but yea what enderfx said. The color on the ping indicator changes by latancy
---
Not if he's AoE farming. You don't want people jacking your spot.
---
As a mage I find this mentality so BS, but I have to admit that some Groupe play it like it was super hard and tend to be really slow, I generally leave those Groupe after the first run.
---
But a non optimal group doing decent pull and with a nice rhythm I'll stick out for all the runs.
---
Another fact that make it event harder to find groups. is that now that I have played with lots of mages  we end up adding the goods ones to each other friendlist. Which mean a lot of time I don't have to even put a message on the LFG Chan to find decent AOE groups. 
---
I feel tour struggle, hand there man.
---
It's insane man, I played black desert online before this where you can enable pvp outside cities on anyone who is not in your guild and the amount of butthurt that people get from this is so unreal. People unironically think you are a socially inept psychopath for choosing to kill other players in a game. ?????????  
---
Why all these extreme carebears play on PvP servers is so beyond me.
---
Here¬¥s a radical, maybe too crazy idea.  
---
What if after naxx they tuned CoT and Karazhan to fit groups and raids of lvl 60s?  
---
CoT could be attunement to kara like in TBC but here¬¥s the cool part:  
---
Karazhan wouldn¬¥t drop (better) gear than Naxx. Instead completing it would unlock the TBC talent trees!  
---
This means that naxx content stays relevant, and they could still add new content which besides, is awesome.  
---
Would it make raiding Kara OP? oh yeah  
---
Would it be fucking awesome to see mages with water elementals and locks with felguards? Hell yes.  
---
It would also mean endgame would have more viable specs i suppose.  
---
Just thought of this right now so it might have obvious and huge problems, in which case feel free to point em out!
---
Too bad the guild The Enclave is toxic and actively tries to make the community worse
---
Do you remember what guild they were in?
---
Definitely didn‚Äôt camp this spot with friends recently.....definitely wasn‚Äôt me
---
Go play on a low pop server if you don't like layering.
---
Just shitty people , I have on many occasions asked ppl if they needed for quest when I see them killing mobs one at a time . Invited them and helped them finish the quest. It‚Äôs not an entitled mage problem, it‚Äôs a douchebag problem
---
&gt;Using "pet" to mean pat seems like a relatively new thing, as far as I can tell, born from somewhere in the US.
---
Pet doesn't mean pat.
---
It's usage as a verb in this sense goes back to the early 1800s, not what I'd call recent.
---
https://www.etymonline.com/word/pet#etymonline_v_46228
---
The vast majority of players never knew the names of the vast majority of players who did this shit. I probably knew of like three notorious ninja looters in all of the game's history on my server.
---
My active raid progression says otherwise 
---
And thats my point. Getting gear, getting upgrades, getting BiS is rewarding 
---
In classic most gear doesnt even matter since the content is trivial. You dont need it. Gear is just there to make bigger numbers. 
---
And when you want that, gear is gated behind a huge grind and id resets. 
---
Thats also why classic is losing players so fast right now.
---
Definitely while leveling, but I was tanking about when in an instance.
---
I was leveling a Tauren alt last night, had a quest to turn into Cairne.  Saw this when I got up there I had to stop and listened for a while.
---
How the hell is a group of consenting players agreeing to follow a specific set of rules "being an asshole!?". Do you not understand what you're saying? "It is for the players to decide". That's exactly how it is. The Leader creates a group with a specific loot distribution and the players decide if they want to follow that rule or not. You're either straight up trolling me right now or you have a severe mental disability.
---
Level an alt so it hits 60 before Phase 2.
---
I only mentioned the level as it's the reason I worry about my minion getting the agro.
---
My point being with the minion hitting first I encountered no issues and wondered if that would help?
---
Guys probably sat in the corner of his room rocking back and forth saying 'how? ....how?!.... I definitely threw him off the boat.... HOW DID HE DO IT?! HOW?!?!?'.
---
Yes but many people don't know if someone is an asshole (such as changing to master loot at the last boss) until its too late through a run so this person is saying they would STILL heal them regardless of their toxic attitude as to not get a bad reputation as a healer.
---
Haha still acting like assholes are only on retail. Here's a newsflash for you - assholes are literally in every multiplayer game, that includes your precious vanilla/classic WoW. 
---
Also you can't even do this on retail, like mechanically you can't, so... don't try to bash something you know squat about.
---
It goes both ways. Rogues and warriors roll on ranged weapons that are stat sticks also.
---
I have tested it quite a bit and it works as long as it's not "resisted".
---
If you needed an upgrade to be able to heal the dungeon effectively, you shouldn't have joined a group for that dungeon.
---
I was worried I would get caught in the crossfire until it was pointed out to me that this has been a strategy since 2004 and is in no way shape or form considered to be an exploit. Thank goodness!
---
I quit playing wow for like 6 years while my husband continued to play. Two kids, now 4 &amp; 6 and I'm playing classic now! Eventually you will be able to play again!
---
They have an uncanny ability to figure out what we enjoy and interrupt it. Still trying to get back in the habit of reading and playing piano more since my kids also ruined those for me during the young years.
---
I was tanking in whaling caverns yesterday and the hunter needed on the blue shield from the turtle at the beginning.  Then the guild group got mad that I left. He needed to sell when I needed to use.
---
Just in case anyone asks "How do you recruit?"
---
1: I'll go to a town or city and actually walk up to players and like throw a couple fun emotes at them so they know I'm not just messaging randoms and I'm near them. Then I'll talk to them and see if they're interested in joining a guild in the first place. Then after chatting IF they're interested and said yes to me asking if they wanted an invite - THEN I invite them.
---
2: If I'm busy trying to do stuff I have a very simple short advertisement that I'll put in general chat and people can message me if they're interested. No one's getting random invites without them saying they want one.
---
My old guild reunited and quickly imploded. Some people never change and some people are professional grudge holders.
---
As others have said, you can make macros with moves like charge and auto attack in the same macro. Also, one thing you might try is to get a ranged weapon and use that to pull. Then you can click left click on the mob you want, then click your ranged attack, and the mob should run up to you. Once the mob gets to you, it should automatically switch you to auto attacking with your melee weapon. 
---
About the movement thing, I have found that the most effective way to move around is to hold down right click, and then use the keyboard to run/strafe. If you don't feel comfortable using the keyboard (or maybe the keyboard doesn't work?) Then you can maybe try this: the left and mouse click are keybound to "run forward". If your mouse has extra buttons (which is immensely helpful in WoW) then you can keybind another mouse button "mouse button 4" to the forward run, and keybind Jump to "mouse button 5". Then you can hold right click to turn your character around and face the right direction.
---
I personally use that keybinding to my mouse because it allows me to still move around using one hand (if I'm drinking/eating).
---
They even evade my demon :(
---
I hate this too. Wouldn't even consider joining a guild run by someone so lazy.
---
Holy shi- [I am Swedish](https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/4kztje/how_to_tell_someone_to_do_something/d3xecf1/?context=3), [I speak Chinese](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/2roscz/role_of_%E4%B8%AD_in_%E5%9C%A8%E8%BF%99%E4%B8%AA%E6%81%B6%E4%BD%9C%E5%89%A7%E4%B8%AD%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E5%B0%86%E8%A6%81%E7%94%A8%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%E7%9C%8B%E4%B8%8D%E8%A7%81%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%9C%E8%A5%BF%E8%BF%B7/cnii689/?context=3), and I studied in [Northeastern China](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/4jvksu/going_to_changchun_china/d3bczob/?context=3) where many Russians go to study, so I am quite familiar with the Russian accent. 
---
I would be an almost perfect fit.
---
Linked to my post history if you don't believe me. I don't post much in /r/ChineseLanguage these days, so the example I linked to is a bit trivial in terms of complexity but still.
---
Money is created by selling goods to the vendor and completing quests. Selling stuff between player doesn't inflate the amount of money in circulation on a realm.
---
If there is an inflation issue on any server, it's most likely comming from people aoe farming humanoids than anything else.
---
If the market of a rare BoE is flooded because of an abuse, it will only make its price to drop.
---
Indeed. I misremembered.
---
I dont know why you were downvoted. In all these posts about faction imbalance you always get these people going "but my experience is blah blah blah", but that's totally besides the point.
---
the raw generated gold isn't really the issue as you are spliting it 5 ways and layering dose have a cooldown at a certain point. the real issue is the patterns for the robes etc. that is the real money maker here.
---
Thanks. I was doing well for a bit and now (lv24) I'm poor still. Hovering between 2G (high) and 25s (after training). Good to hear it gets better. I was farming Agam'gor last night doing some Camp Taurajo quests, and made some good money off them (wool, copper, tin, grays and such).

Man I got angry for you

---
&gt;Majority of servers have 1-2 layers. 
---
Untrue. The most populated realms have 5-8 layers. 
---
&gt;I don't even understand how having more players will kill it. Quite the opposite - more people means that there's more chances to find people who you are comfortable to play with.
---
Do you remember in Vanilla when you could name all the guilds in your realm, and knew (by name) every 2nd player you came across in Ironforge? You could even name some opposite-faction guilds and the most feared hordes/alliances that everyone were afraid of. You couldn't dare to risk your reputation by ninja'ing because the word would've gotten spread and soon all guilds would had just ignored you. That's called a server community. And that cannot exist with the huge, non-vanilla realms we have now.
---
But I'm not here against your experience. I just wish for vanilla realms. We could have them them both the same time. Vanilla realms without layering, and classic realms with layering. That way we all could be happy.
---
I will be honest when I say this, this feels like real world and I actually like it
---
no, I am not part of the group who does this, I just think this is awesome and adds another aspect to pvp server.
---
He did come back aabout a year ago on a different account. He never got unbanned for account sharing, and he didn't even do it to abuse lower ranks or boost people. He 'borrowed' characters from people at max level just to test out classes.
---
*Explicitly blames dungeon finder*
---
"Nothing to do with dungeon finder"
---
You got it, dude.
---
Considering I have no clue what you're whining about no it hasn't affected everyone but I promise if I lose 3 weeks if effort cause some fool abused exploits I will delete my account and play borderlands 3
---
For real though is this about layering abuse or some crap like that
---
Ammenar - Fr / Ally reporting in!
---
Totally depends on various circumstances.
---
Oh yea... I forgot that ninja looting was a thing.
---
If you're expecting to be undercut that makes sense. With a stable market and with high volume items I still prefer to just post it for the max time and forget about it. Never really have an issue with not selling personally.
---
Remember that forum post from back in the day about how great paladin is for watching porn? I also played a paladin during vanilla.
---
After the first emote you should start tagging everything and feign death and break their novas and shit. Teach em whos boss.
---
Unfortunately I'm unable to find the video. I do remember it was released during/after the beta.
---
The premise was that if you, a caster, found a high DPS dagger that had the same attack speed as the GCD, you could 'efficiently' auto attack in between instant spell casts. There were two examples:
---
A PvP encounter in which a mage auto attacked and spammed arcane explosion and won
---
A PvE encounter in which an Oomkin auto attacked and spammed moonfire
---
Using it to farm Crowd Pummelers doesn‚Äôt seem nearly as bad as guilds sitting at the end of Scholo or Strat for gold, truefaith, or other endgame BiS gear for entire guilds. And he said in stream if it was an exploit he wouldn‚Äôt keep doing it. But the principle is the important thing for sure
---
Shit guild.
---
Skarm is a pretty popular youtuber/pserver tanking guide guy. I doubt they'll ban him unless he was actually exploiting it heavily.
---
If you manage to resist frost nova, that's like a 2% chance to beat em.
---
If i remember correctly there was a world quest back in legion that was bugged and allowed players to do it repeatedly and it gave AP, there were a few players who used it to max out their weapon only a few weeks into the expansion, they were banned for something like 60 days and all 3, or 4 if they were druids, were reset entirely regardless if they maxed out those weapons.
---
Hahaha, just woke up... phone autocorrect. I can't even type on my phone anymore without swiping keyboard and autocorrect so..

Hi!) I am playing warlock-orc now and want to start alt for future phases.  Slow and mild leveling and then mostly pvp with healer and pve with dd. 
---
Last time I played dd and it was between BC and WtLK.  I played alliance and now looking for advice. 
---
Priest:
---
Pros are high healing, nice undead bonuses, some good utilities
---
Cons for me: cloth, most of spells require casting, no chances to hit someone in Disc or Holy specs
---
Shaman
---
Pros for me: nice and fun leveling, got 31/0/20 spec for pvp
---
Cons: lack of controls, totem management 
---
I am looking for advice from any pvp healer. I watched lots of videos, read guides but can‚Äôt decide) I don‚Äôt want to throw coin to choose)
---
Thx)
---
I ran RFK 3 times as the only warrior in my group for the corpsemaker... didn‚Äôt tell someone they couldn‚Äôt have it though.
---
it's funny because doing is slang for having the sex
---
The cloth items so vastly outweigh the mail in many slots that there aren't going to be many lists that recommend them. If you must wear mail then just wear anything.
---
For example, your preraid bis legs are: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11841/senior-designers-pantaloons
---
And the closest mail item is: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14522/maelstrom-leggings
---
There are bis lists that show alternative items but there won't be any that show maelstrom leggings even though they are the 'best' mail legs in phase 1 because they are so much worse even than cloth spell damage legs e.g. https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13170/skyshroud-leggings
---
Just look who said ‚Äúinv layer pls‚Äù you already ban half of the game hahahah
---
I tried to fish this morning on the coast of hinterlands and just got empty loot windows. It worked on the river near tarrens mill.
---
Also human females have bigger weapon models!
---
Begging for layer change in global chat is painfully obvious not the intended use of the feature that is AUTOMATIC. There is no "change layer" button, so keep your weak arguments to yourself, no one cares about you trying to rationalize abusing game systems for yourself.
---
FD is not 100% drop combat, it can be resisted like everything else.
---
He obviously means 20, easy mistake to make
---
I wonder why blizzard decided to go with 1.13. Imo the content is so easy it's robbing players of the classic experience.  As an example,  if it was any patch between 1.3 and 1.12. AOE farming of low level dungeons was impossible. 
---
In its current state, cosmetically the game looks like classic but in reality it's the pre BC patch designed to make the game super easy. I would even say 50% easier 
---
It's a real shame blizzard is so lazy.
---
Omg dude you and your bois are so cool
---
People forgetting that you get remembered on a server for this shit.
---
Thems is rookie numbers
---
OK ok ok. Let's see how many people get rolled back or banned for this. Then we will know who is right.
---
install the game
---
Classic wow is a good starting point,play the game like you want too.
---
lmfao stfu. negative iq ass comment.
---
you clearly lack comprehension issues and are trying to salvage this by reiterating DUNGEON FINDER over n over.
---
r/Fredderov clearly stated "People from the matchmaking era of gaming"
---
the fact that you choose to only see that as dungeon finder is your own problem.
---
Nope. It was bakey or hanky. Haha
---
Yeah thats why I didnt like a timestamp..You want it, you do it yourself. Or just take our word for it.
---
Too little too late.  People have known about this!
---
Yeah I've also been really disappointed with the community but honestly it was to be expected.
---
A little bit of retail would slip into Classic because of people who got into retail and never played Classic. They expect certain things to be a certain way, they view level 60 and raiding as the end-all-be-all goal, so they treated leveling as such.
---
But more than just that, now that we have Youtube and Twitch and WoWhead, things would always end up being different. Spellcleave was a thing back then too, it's just that the average person didn't know about it.
---
Assuming a playerbase of 1 million polayers, you think it's acceptable to punish 10 000 innocent players?
---
Didn‚Äôt say being an asshole had anything to do with retail.  Selling runs is adopted from retail and has flooded over into classic
---
Banky**
---
If you really want to mage I would go ahead and do it, they make their own food and water and do a ton of damage.  So as long as you're playing the class good I think you will find yourself useful.  The problem with trying to tell you what class to pick is I don't have a ton of information on why mage is your current top choice.  But if you wanted spell caster but more" utility you can go warlock/Spriest.  They may not have the straight DPS of the mage bu they have fun control spells.  And the priest could always respec for heals.
---
The bonus about going back for classic is that we all have a better understanding of how the game works than when we first played.  So you can either streamline the experience with a class you know your good at.  Or take on the challenge of a class you haven't played before because you have enough prior game knowledge to be more effective with a trickier/less familiar class.
---
Tell me
---
Leveling a war is hard and it's very stuff dependant. If it's a reasonable upgrade then equip it, it will make you go faster make more money in the long term.
---
Yes, and the difference is quite large. This refers to players that were changing layers at the end of a dungeon so that they could repeatedly kill the final boss without having to clear the entire instance again. The final boss often drops some of the most sought-after items, and can therefore be quite lucrative to farm repeatedly. Archivist Galford, the second-to-last boss in strat live, for example, always drops a Righteous Orb, a reagent used for several top tier enchants and crafts. 
---
Layer hopping out in the world is intended to be possible by blizzard. Not extremely rapidly, but still intended nonetheless. Farming multiple layers in the crater is just using the tools available.
---
What about hit rating?
---
A given caster will run that instance exactly once for the quest reward, unless grinding xp.
---
Nope, it's false. I made the mistake and checked last night after seeing the comment. I got confused with my terrible memory. 
---
It's been about 1 day, 2 hours I believe. Sorry, my mistake!
---
The number of people whove gotten vitriolicly angry at me for not grouping with them when im just trying to asocially relax at the end of the day....

I wonder why ‡≤†_ ñ‡≤†

indeed. make it dynamic respawn, and half the people quits -#nochanges. make it normal, and the whole realm can forget consumables and world bosses forever
---
&gt;failed 2 exams this week because I didn't Study or slept before going to class
---
Don't be retarded
---
It absolutely is. You cant judge the game up to lol ten. Most classes dont "open up" until about 15 or 20. 
---
Classic is probably the best mmo to get into. It basically started the genre(sorry everquest. You know I'm right)
---
It's not like killing children, it's like killing a less trained / worse soldier than yourself. On the RP side of things there's nothing wrong about killing every single person from the other faction you encounter. The character you're playing could have some sense of honor tho and look for only honourable fights but nothing wrong in not doing so.   
---
Raid looting has nothing in common with this, it's just stealing, and you face the consequences (bad rep etc).
---
It astounds me that people don't understand this.  Fifteen years later.  Can your character use it right now?  Yes?  Need.  No?  Greed.  End of story.
---
You need to buy mount training and the mount. If you're undead/human, you bought "horse riding" for \~20g and a horse mount for \~80g. Once you're Exalted with Darnassus (the elf faction), you'll purchase "sabercat riding" for \~20g, and a sabercat for \~80g. You'll know both horse riding and sabercat riding, so you can ride horses and sabercats.
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous. My mana batteries can‚Äôt recharge fast enough to keep up with my lifetap, and the tanks can‚Äôt stop me from pulling aggro. What am I supposed to do use my wand?
---
Lol how does anyone NOT know that?
---
My life is complete
---
What about this shaman needing on cloth for offspec healing.
---
Try using blizzard instead of arcane explosion. The dps isn't that much worse and you should have much more mana.
---
People with the profession should roll need, in the case of flask recipes. With the epic robe recipes, the guy is literally doing the dungeon for that particular drop.
---
I saw a mooncloth bad recipe drop the other day, the two tailors rolled need, the rest passed.  Seems to be pretty standard etiquette.
---
I saw a boe epic drop in ZF, and axe that grants additional rage on hit. We all passed and the warrior equiped it.
---
I don't think there's a gold value cut-off where need-before-greed goes out the window tbh.
---
Filthy casual
---
Thank you. It is the number one stupidest thing about this game. Not the chat itself (which does fucking suck), the ridiculous loving reputation it has. Someone tells yet another stupid chuck norris joke  and everyone says ‚Äòlol i love you barrens chat!‚Äô
---
Ok, interesting. Yeah, I haven't done a whole lot of AoE leveling on account of being insecure about my abilities and unwilling to fail, so I guess it could be worth it.
---
I'm just annoyed I didn't remake my char from the random appearance it gave me during the name reservation phase...

---
Click the main menu(escape) click interface option then click social and the option to block guild invites and channel invites should be right there.
---
Yes you should try it out and don't read anything about it online, don't obsess over min-maxing, just start playing, maybe download questie if you know how.
---
This game's community and 3rd party documentation is overwhelming. The base game is a gem.
---
I think part of Blizzards mandate of keeping the experience as close to vanilla as possible means they won't let them keep the items.
---
If the exploit was present in vanilla and not patched out then they would allow it. At the end of the day I'll be disappointed if they do keep things, but it's really not going to have the impact on the game that people think it will
---
Lore was literally in the chat. You can look at the vods. He even makes a joke about not getting a bonus binding.
---
If you haven't seen it you're not in the lookingforgroup channel.

There's no mechanic in place to enforce this anyway, why argue about it.

We've been arguing over creating specific loot groups in the post made by u/Jabberwalki22 
---
If anyone doesn't know, that's the player from Herod who was ninja'd while fighting Herod
---
I use ClassicCastbars and it works fine
---
As someone who basically has a KOS list (see other comment) they do work.
---
Also guilds and specific players have already been blacklisted from raiding and high level dungeoning on our server. We have a couple 60‚Äôs and high 50‚Äôs in our guild and a lot of guilds with 60‚Äôs have made note of shitty people and guilds to avoid and broadcasted them to other guild leaders to make sure no one invites them to MC pugs or BRD runs or anything.
---
Mob attacks pet, back in combat
---
Did CTMod ever come out with a Classic-compatible addon? I loved using that in Vanilla and would love to use again.
---
Don't think so.
---
Yeah, no, that is bullshit. Begging for layer change is abusing of game mechanics, regardless if it's done in dungeon or open world, but keep telling that to yourself.
---
It's in the interface options.  Block guild invites.  Block chat channel requests.
---

You're not entitled to an int buff or any kind of buff. Especially if you don't even ask first. That mage was being nice by accepting the invite.

We're in a wow subreddit talking about wow groups. "Matchmaking" clearly refers to dungeon finder (even if it also includes other systems).

Also, he's wrong.

Also, you're illiterate.

I'm not too sure. I know there is a ignore page, so it might be what you're looking for.
---
I don't think they know how Classic works.
---
What exploits are out there?
---
I agree with you. It‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs the only group you can join. If you don‚Äôt like it, make your own group.
---
They might not do that. Many models can work with giving % chance, so they could punish the most likely and scale down. That means perhaps many who only abused it a bit might get off.
---
No one finds these jokes offensive. They‚Äôre just stupid.
---
Still amazed to have seen someone called "Swagstika". Level 20+ somehow.
---
Someone 2 levels above you kills you: "Man what a cheap gank."
---
I kill someone who is in the middle of 5 mobs: "I am so good at this game."
---
Okay, grandpa.
---
Then you‚Äôre playing with bad people.
---
It‚Äôs quite common that I am too of the meters in any group I‚Äôm in, on any dps class simply because most people you meet in leveling dungeons are just not that good.
---
Wheres this?
---
as an affliction lock:
---
&gt; Siphon life -&gt; Life tap -&gt; Life tap -&gt; Life tap -&gt; Drain life
---
Buy a claw of the shadowmancer. Has great speed and damage for the level
---
&gt;New Raids should be tiered on par with the previous raids, not push past it.
---
Pushing the item level rewards of new raids does the one thing we want to avoid that has been plaguing retail for a decade now, invaliding old raids. [I saw this post earlier](https://i.redd.it/f2vh0fj5yfm31.png) which perfectly encapsulates how I'd like seeing additional high level dungeons and raids being added to the game. Coupling this the idea of providing other options of itemization and set bonuses that encourage different playstyles for example would easy incentive for players to go back and chase that loot. This could then be further expanded with..
---
Disagree. This is not what invalidates old raids, catchup gear in new zones and dungeons does, having a tiered raid progression is essential to vanilla.
---
We have an official Blacklist anywhere?
---
I‚Äôm a man! I‚Äôm 40!
---
Devs can't even implement layering without fucking over the game what makes you think they could conceive new content. Just give us TBC pretty hard to fuck that up.
---
It's Irrelevant anyway, he messaged a GM in game to check weather he was allowed to or not, something literally anyone can do
---
go back to sleep and get some help.
---
I'm not available to test it at the moment but for spells I've accomplished that with something like:
---
/Castsequence reset=100 spell1, spell2
---
I'm pretty sure /cast, /use are interchangeable. So I'd expect castsequence will work with items too. 
---
Change the reset value to the cooldown of the first item so it should then always use that if available. 
---
Worth a try but I'm not totally sure it will work
---
Not sure if he has it on this level but berserker's rage would have saved him too!
---
  Honestly I have done this a few times now. Only to Rude Mages that AoE group. I partner all the time with my friend who is a mage. (I‚Äôm a priest) we AoE about 6-8 or as many as we can get, soon as we see others there. We shorten our pull range or we invite them to make sure everyone gets the kills needed.
---
When we see other Mages trying to steal what we start. I fear there tags ALL the time. It almost always end up with them dying. 
---
If you want to join us ? sure we will invite we will also not pull as many to give everyone a chance, but god help you if you try and mess with us.
---
Let me start by saying I have never played any expansions.
---
I do, however, know there is/was a lot of content still lined up for vanilla when the devs switched to bc. Krazan, the place near the dwarfs (don‚Äôt know, never played alliance), azsarha and hyjal all come to mind.
---
Sorry for the spelling mistakes.
---
The group leader make the rules. If anyone doesn't agree with the loot rules of that group, he is free to leave and join another group. It's a pretty simple and fair concept.
---
Private server. Was Anathema
---
Is that working as intended or should it be fixed you think?
---
He's trying to make the virtual world more valuable, which is also admirable. Who knows, virtual world might come in handy some day.
---
I keep having a nagging idea but I don't know how viable it is, or if it would even turn out shit.  It's to do with more powerful instances invalidating old content.  The way I see it, once your core 40 guys are beating end game, it's trivial to gear up a fresh 60 - just run 32 guys with 8 fresh 60s and they get all the drops.  Let's be honest, end game is trivial for all but the very first raiders in a guild.
---
What if instead, when a character beats Naxx, they're given the option to attune for the New instance - at the expense of unable to enter the current raids anymore.  Huge quest chain ends in the destruction of the Onyxia pendant, that sorta thing.  A lore based equivalent of "too big to fit thru the door".
---
The pro's of this as I see it, that all instances would remain relatively challenging.  There would be even greater incentive to level up alts for the 'second wave' of guild runs.  You could tweak the break points, maybe even people doing Naxx shouldn't be doing MC. Don't know what others think about that.  The obvious con of course is gating content from people.  Might get tricky if, say, you lose a healer &amp; someone wants to re-roll one, you might need 39 other alts to get that healer ready to raid the New instance.  Many people will never beat Naxx and this puts some content even further out of their reach.
---
What's anyone think?
---
stupid me, my hunter hasn't got that skill yet xD

Pick up the zep from grom or uc?

That's horrible just horrible.  Filthy alliance dogs.
---
I'm asking if 1% is really acceptable to you. Yes or no?
---
To use your example the children know they've already had their candy allocation but take more because they know a way of getting repeated access to the bowl.
---
TBC did, but work was garbage.
---
&gt;They should have gone with more servers, no layering and server merging when they run low.  
---
I agree with this 100%. 
---
&gt;The layering is good in the long run, but god did they not test this well, so many exploits its nearly ruining everything.
---
Eh, I don't agree layering is good in the long run. Quite the opposite actually, I think it was good in starting zones and for the first week.. maybe 2.
---
Now that we have level 60s running around later hopping farming crusader and devilsaurs it's a problem. Add in the folks just dodging pvp(this is why flying mounts are trash for the game btw) and it's become a problem.
---
It's fun to laugh at the rookie numbers. But realistically 6 hours a day is probably every waking second a 9 year old is not at school.
---
Probley die
---
&gt; trash greys start selling for 1-2g
---
In Vanilla? We have very different recollections.
---
You are even more avoidable as a Holy Paladin. 
---
That was my point, a Paladin is not a threat in and off himself. I'd rather see a Paladin chasing after me than a mage any day of the week. I know what Paladins are capable but they are not the best ganking class/support they are the best anti-ganking class/support. With my Paladin no horde can gank us and I'd turn the table quickly with my Blessing of Freedom/Protection, healing, dispell...etc. A good Paladin is a power to reckon with, but definitely not a class that would scare you in world PvP.
---
*cries in Paladin*

R/oopsdidntmeanto
---
Get it?! Because it sounds like the nword! Funny right?
---
I play a druid. You wouldnt know the amount of times I get shit on for rolling on healing gear when theres is literally 0 leather tanking gear that drops there anyway. Sure, let me tank coz you need one and whispered me, but I cant roll on loot I need lmao
---
Yeah but some really important things won't change
---
Vanilla definitely had a ton of ninjas (there was a period where I was sick of doing dungeons because of it), but to agree, yeah they'd be punished by the local server community. I think the same thing is going to happen with Classic Wow, but it's just the beginning - as time progresses, communities will ostracize such folks as they're encountered. What the OP did is the first step.
---
Yeah it's really ridiculous, I use to game every day playing wow and sometimes call of duty growing I quit when they announced pandas and ever since I havent found a game to fill that void besides path of exile because it's really grindy but that game has gotten super casual now..so glad classic is out. I dont play fortnite but if you look at how its setup or (if you can tolerate it) play a few games mtx deals and their monthly game pass is constantly thrown in your face and ofc all the kids that get it pressure their friends to buy it. Watched my 14 year old cousin play it and he was so sad he didnt have the battle pass that month.
---
I'm actually surprised we don't here more stories like this.
---
I have been in one area total which actually had competition for quest mobs. In most I was happy that someone was killing the others so I don't have to worry about aggroing too many of them.
---
Of course if there is actual competition like with a boss spawn or something, PvP makes sense, but normal mobs are usually plentiful enough.
---
Me: Laughs in Warlock
---
You really think vanilla fans were some form of ubermensch, don't you ?
---
The problem with 6-month bans is that it's long enough for someone to just outright abandon that account. This is Classic. You don't need to purchase the game.
---
The people getting banned are likely to create a new account and resub.
---
Don't worry, he's immune while he's being a spiny boii.
---
That is the reference, yes.
---
Yes I had one drop mid 30's and sold it for about 1g 50s on my server. Take a look OK your AH
---
Short sighted tho; it would be a reason for me to quit if everyone gets ahead by using exploits (for a longer period of time) which I'm not.
---
In the big picture, what is the difference between goblin and gnome engieneering items in pvp?
---
undeserved
---
Head's up for mages, If you're quick you CAN turn in quests while Iceblocked. Helped me in this situation as a squishy boi
---
Create something to let everyone play and minimize queue time. Of course people exploited that. 
---
That‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt have cool things
---
I hit 60 on Saturday. My first UBRS raid had two items on reserve, but they couldn't find anyone who would agree to it.  
---
My second UBRS group had a priest who was doing a quest. He finished it, and then went "oh shit GF aggro bye guys" and left the raid. 
---
And every other 60 group I've joined yesterday had some string attached to it. 
---
I experienced none of this greediness while leveling. Makes me just want to roll another char and continue questing. Fuck  this end game shit
---
Its because you didnt whip first.
---
No it isn't.
---
Joining a group will change the layer. Hence, joining a group to change layer will be the exact point of layering. You are also not gaining any advantages of anyone else. Just because you can't comprehend simple stuff and want to be a crybaby it doesn't mean you're right.
---
Here is one suited to Alliance: [CLICK](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d42v3v/if_you_enjoy_just_grinding_mobs_ive_found_my_old/)
---
Thanks for your response - I was wondering about raid viability, because I've been seeing people forming mc pugs with some demand on specs like sp, enhancement and elemental more and more often. That highly confuses me as this collides with what current class guides say about the viability of these 'meme specs', as they're often called. Back then I started raiding with Karazhan so I can't tell if it's worth the risk rolling enhancement if absolutely no one wants me in their party/raid...
---
Joke aside, why the fuck would you do that ?! This dude spent 2 hours doing this. And after being killed multiple time by lvl 60 he went at Nesingwary camp xD
---
Do you have excess supply, or do you have inflation? Because the two are diametrically opposed...
---
This is absolutely disgusting, I sincerely hope blizzard does something about this. 
---
The luck that Tekniqz bestows upon others is just unfair for others.
---
If the level gap is close, you are right, its like killing a less trained soldier(which is still being a dick imo). But if level gap is greater then 10 levels, its no different then killing children because they cannot retaliate. 
---
Ninja looting can be justified by RP side of things as well.. I'm a rogue and I only worry about myself, I don't care about reputation etc.. I can play that role if its going to decide what's wrong or right. Its not any different if you look from RP side.
---
Its also usual to face consequences after dishonorable PVP kills. His friends and guild can come to hunt you or corpsecamp you. So no difference here neither.
---
Its equally wrong to ninja loot and dishonorable PVP kills.
---
We have the technology!
---
I saw a warrior yesterday with a name something along the lines of Analgorger.

There's no time limit on AoE grinding lol, it's a thing for the entirity of classic.

Yea and you‚Äôre being one

Further LPT: Most-used? Just put it on ALL the abilities

MC isn't working for me on boats BUT you can see clearly in this clip that the MC "went off" in some capacity. This would not happen at all if the target couldn't be charmed.

---
I would really want to be in a guild with you /s
---
Totally agree. This is going to be a big change for a lot of players today. Out of nowhere you're expected to care/worry about your conduct and personal standing in a community which isn't based on score. 
---
It's an interesting social experiment.
---
Yeah if you're not using that many consumables and not really wiping you can probably expect to net roughly 30-40g per raid.
---
I‚Äôll explain why on point 3 this way. 
---
Gear has its identity based on its looks. In retail I understand why they added it, people like certain looks, however it allowed them in the long term to get lazy with new gear design. Why would they spend time if people would mog anyway? 
---
This would be a massive mistake in classic, because as it stands, when you see someone in some badass gear you double take, because they are WEARING it. and it‚Äôs like holy crap look what he has. You notice it and so do others. 
---
If that changed, gear would lose its identity. And moving forward however they wanna take classic, or not, it would lose its identity and they would get lazy with appearances.
---
I'm a little confused with gearing when leveling. Are there any milestones when you should spend some cash on new gear, or just wing it and equip the best drops you get while questing? 
---
I know it's a "do whatever you like" question, but just asking for best practice from the veterans.
---
Oof, fuck that guy. Good thing you can find a new group in seconds as a tank while they need to look for a replacement for ages :)
---
It was obviously an exploit and he kept doing it. Lost respect for Skarm.
---
And the fact that you need to recieve crits to become uncrushable , odd design
---
With the exception of the Gnomish Death Ray, Gnomish engineering is based more on utility, where as Goblin is based on damage.
---
Nah roll back to level 30,and don't unmark completed quests
---
Sorry I used to play vanilla all the way up to cata and left when pandaria came out, anybody on here have a decent guild I can join?
---
Yes but 15 years ago there wasn't cross realm and if you got a shit reputation on a server you could and would find no one was willing to run anything with you. So that nice shiny geared level 60 may as well be a level 2 trade troll because you're going no where
---
Don't you need an NPC to unlock the door to the courtyard? I think there's a second locked door next to another boss too
---
What dat tongue do
---
&gt; I like that classes have strengths and weaknesses. It added variety to the game and everything didn't feel so "samey". I tank differently depending on my group composition and healer. It's just another skill to have.
---
That's why I stop at WotLK. Specs still felt different. A case in point: Disc priest versus holy priest during that expansion. Both viable healers, but with a different goal in mind.
---
&gt;I really loved BC 5 mans, SSC, and ZA, but I really didn't like the other raids. I liked specific fights here and there but I didn't care for the whole experience. I spent way more time in heroics than was healthy. I generally did Shattered Halls, the daily, and at least two or three others. I did not care for any Wrath 5 mans or raids. I did love the quests and zones though.
---
That might explain a lot. TBC and WotLK were especially good in group and raid content.
---
&gt;40-mans are just so epic. Raid leading required as much coordination and communication as any 5 boss fights.
---
Yes, but to have an enjoyable 40man, a good learning curve towards it is important. Otherwise you're just thrown together with scrubs. Classic will not have this problem really as everyone knows the fights, but if they release new content it's gonna start playing. With TBC, the leadup through a 10-man Kara was a good way to learn to deal with the differences between raid and regular group.
---
Not sure I've ever seen someone do the mental gymnastics it takes to suggest someone saying everyone doing the work should get an equal shot at the profits is entitled before. Well done. Enjoy being a toxic piece of shit.
---
And I don't even have to dismiss him before jumping down a ledge!
---
Oh shit, the boss is coming!
---
I'm ahead of the pack at lv 48 and questing in most zones is downright impossible even at my leavel on a full server. Basically every mob spawn for some quests are camped. When I was in the early 30s in stv it took me about 3 days to finish the kurzen quests.

r/HerodClassic
---
Yeah it's tricky.  I've seen quite a few situations in my time playing wow where a person tries to pull some toxic stuff like this and then runs to Trade to claim our group members did the thing they did.
---
Mages spam Rank 1 Explosion to get clear casting procs.
---
Just saying, if everyone else understood what he was saying. Maybe it‚Äôs not him, maybe it‚Äôs you. Just relax and let it go.
---
That's not very nice...
---
In a pug environment, making pre determined rules for your group shows you're entitled and think you have the right to specific privileges, for one reason or the other.
---
That said, if everyone is aware and agrees to it, no harm no foul. I don't understand why anyone would agree to group with people behaving like this tho, but hey go figure. Not only that, someone entitling themselves the right of X or Y item is always a recipe for disaster down the line. Next thing you know they're insulting the tank for this and that or picking on someone else.
---
Bear in mind, this comes from someone (me) who 100% of the time is the person making the group. I know the work involved in searching for people in the correct lvl range and composition for a specific dungeon. And even then, I never demand anything above others
---
My time is just as precious as everybody else, and thinking otherwise is being a self-centered prick.
---
Hahahahahahahaha fucking hell, thank you.

Cause ganking people is fun

I didnt played wow before, but i decided to try vanilla with some friends and its been a blast!

---
Make launch a ghost town single player experience
---
Destroy the economy on every server by having 3-10 layers of Devilsaurs/rares/herbs/mines
---
Destroy the end game pre-bis grind by allowing people to farm end dungeon boss drops off longer/difficult dungeons like UBRS/Scholo/Strat
---
Allow streamers to farm MC two times back to back in one raid lock out with your permission
---
There were reports that after a few days people were arena grand masters. I have saw multiple streamers farm two dozen devilsaur in an hour, 30 black lotus by layer hopping in a few days, and hop layers to loot the arena chest.
---
The damage done behind the scenes is almost impossible to track down and reverse. The economy is ruined and many players have no doubt exploited the pre-bis grind.
---
You quite honestly could not have had a worse launch. If I were to conjure up the worst thing you could have done ‚Äî this would be it. You would have been better off launching with a cash shop that sold pets and mounts, at least then the integrity of the game would be in store.
---
In this case, I can‚Äôt trust that anybody in full pre-raid bis even earned it. I fully expect everyone who has a brain and experience in vanilla to be rich and epic mount by now.
---
I know several people will white knight this post and say that it doesn‚Äôt matter for them. Let me know your opinion in a few months when honor system goes live and you get farmed by full epic/full best in slot armies of expoiters on epic mounts. This affects everyone.
---
Solution?
---
Banning a few guilds or whatever that expoited MC is not fixing everything. What about people who farmed Baron or Drak dozens of times for free for things that are worth thousands of gold like recipe‚Äôs or the mount off baron? What about hard to attain pre-raid bis being attained in a few hours instead of dozens of hours? You can‚Äôt fix it.
---
The only thing you could do, you won‚Äôt, to fix this‚Ä¶ A full wipe of all servers and reset of everything. Relaunch your game. No‚Ä¶you won‚Äôt do this‚Ä¶but it is the only way to fix this. Since you won‚Äôt‚Ä¶Classic is effectively destroyed and has lost all its integrity‚Ä¶whatever little bit it had since you launched a fully nerfed ez mode version to begin with.

So incredibly rude; at that point you just fuck up their farming. They want to be rude so you have every right to hurt their xp or gold / hour
---
I‚Äôm all for duo, or even trio farming with mages, I don‚Äôt understand the logic behind starting drama which will force lower yields per hour
---
though you might have a point from a marketing perspective - i think OP is correct in his statement, that a lot of the gameplay loops got worse over the time. I think there is a certain point in optimization and analytics driven user-experience, where the user recognizes he is beeing "played" and the product loses it's soul.
---
I am a firm believer in the whole ''play the game the way you want'' mentality. However, you are part of the mass of players rushing and competing against each other.
---
I purposely took my time and made three different characters and really focused on getting all my professions to level with me on my main. Also took a couple of days off last week and played something else. This allowed the mass of players who are trying to power through to 60, to get away from me and free up quest mobs and stuff.
---
There's still more than enough players my level to dungeon/group for elite quests and you still get the occasional quest with a tagfest, but most of the time I'm only competing against a couple of other people.
---
I also had a think about it and it means that there will be more gold in circulation by the time i get to 60 than when the faster people did. So things will be worth more and the mats/BoE's I get while levelling will be worth more.
---
What a Chad!
---
Since when is actually using the need/greed system the way it was designed to be used toxic behavior?
---
Annnnnnd Skarm just got banned
---
I'm okay with talking about it. But there have been several post in a short amount of time that are essentially.
---
'classic is dead because of this exploit'
---
'reset everyone's characters on classic because of this exploit'
---
Etc
---
There's no discussion here. When you discuss it on those posts you get accused of being bots and the salty posters refuse to discus. The only people discussing are the people defending the posters.
---
Let's make a neutral megathread for the exploit so it can be properly discussed and we can stop with multiple posts
---
Working as intended. It's always been that way. I used to do a lot of MC buffing in vanilla, and fucked it up a lot lol.
---
I quested from 1 to 60 without missing a beat -- I even skipped some quests that I dislike (I despise escort quests and the quests where you have to kill 200 buzzards to get 12 buzzard gizzards).  I did a single dungeon (ZF at 48).  There's plenty of quests, you just gotta be strategic about it .  Hit 60 with 7ish days played and I had 300 skinning/mining/first aid.  
---
But I wholeheartedly agree with everything else you said.  Not sure what the rush is getting to 60.   For the streamers who were banking on being cutting edge, I get that.  But for average joes it is super odd.  
---
If you're playing WoW just for dungeons and raids, then go play retail.  It's better designed for that.  Vanilla is great because it cultivates this rare experience -- slow paced leveling, professions mattering, scarce item upgrades, working with strangers to complete elite quests.
---
The dungeon grind just seems silly.  Especially because for it to be effective you need Mages and I am fairly certain Mages could solo level faster outside of the dungeon.  It mostly just seems like a way for people to circumvent learning the game.
---
I second the OP. Don‚Äôt get too fucking technical with it just because YOU don‚Äôt see or want classic to progress past classic. 
---
FYI, most of us don‚Äôt. Or the ones who want it too want the current copies of what we have or current realms to stay so everyone is happy.
---
it's not negligible at all, full bis gear in osrs now is insanely more powerful than it was in original 2007scape
---
I've gotta give it to you, not even I thought Blizzard was this stupid. I could almost get behind them saying, kill one boss for us to confirm and then leave, yet they let them reclear the entire instance. And here I thought Lore only pissed me off in retail.

Unfortunately dude, there are no "Moral Laws" in a virtual world. Its not real life, its World of Warcraft - people choose how they want to play in a virtual world, often times choosing to play like a greedy thief.

Almost all PvP servers are Horde heavy, all PVE servers Alliance heavy. Though some are better/worse than others.

Pretty sure it's always been like that.

If you have a bad balance on your server you have to re-roll or look for a server migration. Herod's pretty busy right? Might be able to transfer over.

If you google around you can find some 3rd party estimates of server balance. Not 100% accurate but it's something.

If you love pvp yet somehow ended up selecting a pve server then maybe its for the best if you stay there where other players who actually keybind their skills can't hurt you. Even if you didn't know what the difference between pve and pvp was in wow, wouldn't that make it even worse that you selected a pve server not knowing the implications lmaooo
---
It increases the rate at which you level weapon skills for Warriors.
---
Exploit early and often really only comes into play when it‚Äôs something the average joe can pull off. Spread enough awareness about something to get a decent chunk of people abusing it at certain thresholds blizzard won‚Äôt do anything for fear of losing those subs. If only a handful of people do it blizzard will do something like nullifying the loot you get from x boss due to y exploit.
---
pretty sure it was tongue in cheek
---
My character is 27, im not doing shit. if my acc gets reset i am quiting. F that. Its not much but its the action that would turn me away.
---
Elite Ogres in Loch Modan if you're Alliance.
---
on one hand streamers that done it, and more importantly streamed it, should get hit harder as they are showing and encouraging others to do it. but on the other hand if they done it off stream they should be treated as any other player that abused it.
---
little tough to decide if they should be treated harsher, even if they did it off stream, as a streamer to set an example as they are meant to be the ones setting examples for people they are streaming to.
---
Wolves/cats in badlands. Cats/gorillas in stv. Basalisks in shimmering flats next to gadgetzan.

Aptly names toon
---
I did it in dm by turning a campfire into a tower. Did 100s of runs and never got banned. Lots of thorium was had.
---
You really picked the wrong hill to die on.
---
Everyone is entitled to lead his group in the way he/she desires and other people are free to NOT join if they do not like something, is it that hard to understand?
---
And yes, some instances back then took way over two hours and people did not want to run the same thing dozens of times just to get one item so they usually formed groups where each person had one item reserved in a dungeon.
---
There is nothing about entitlement in most cases, Its about forming an optimal group where everyone has a chance to get what he needs when it drops.
---
You are just being a huge fucking baby about it for whatever reason.
---
As I said before: If you do not like it then find another group or make your own.
---
uhm, there has been a lot of blueposts covering many of the things you mention. 
---
&gt;Folks are speculating the number of layers has been reduced but blizzard hasn't said anything.
---
Yes they have, they confirmed all servers have been reduced to less than 10 layers and some servers have very few layers.
---
&gt;So far I'm not sure we've seen any action on blizzards end with regards to what happens when you layer hop.
---
They have said that they are monitoring this behaviour and adjusting layer-hopping parameters as needed and looking at other means if necessary. 
---
&gt;Also, I'm not sure they're actually going to turn layering off for phase 2, unless they actually double the number of servers and open up transfers.
---
They said phase 2 with layering is not going to happen.
---
And then you have the actual impact of all this nasty layering business. The last bluepost regarding the economic and mat-farming issues stated that their investigation found all the allegations to be grossly exaggerated and evidence had been fabricated. My bottom line:  People need to chill the fuck out, layering is not causing any serious issues and your energy is better spent levelling and enjoying the game. That's what I do at least. Me and my friends are having a fucking blast and layering isn't even on our mind. We play the game, just like we did 15 years ago.
---
I'm jealous of the horde for this one thing here. I'd love a cozy break from questing every few days or so.
---
Sadly the closest alliance gets is the guard's formation in front of storm wind I guess?
---
Those crates, is that where the big iron fishing pole comes from too?
---
Fish while u eat breakfast or dinner.
---
oh look, we got ourselves a spellcleaver
---
Go fish in your sewer !
---
I farmed the mistvale gorillas in the space between the road and lake nazferiti in STV on a PVP server Stalagg. I was ganked once in 2 days (I play mostly at night). It‚Äôs really good gold.
---
Honestly. Humanity doesn't need me to be productive anymore. We will survive as a species without my contribution. Therefore I wish to only have a job that pays enough for all my needs and entertainment and my freetime is mostly used playing games. I don't want a family. I don't want a relationship.
---
not having porn IS the collapse of society
---
We're talking about classic+ though. People love classic (or at least love it compared to retail) as the numbers show - but does the fact that it's currently popular mean that nothing should ever be changed? I love the social aspect and the leveling in classic, but I really miss the dungeon design of retail and some of the new abilities (ie basically every elemental shaman spell).
---
If you like shadowbolt spam then power to you man, I just don't see the game enduring if all classes largely remain that simple.
---
Have you ever played wow before? Every time there has been an exploit like this everyone caught using it were punished (if blizzard deemed punitive measures necessary).
---
Constructive criticism and shitting on the game are two different beasts, and I'm talking about the latter. Regularly seeing stuff like "\*\*\*\* this game is so shit" doesn't really show your love for the game.
---
Can't hurt to try.
---
Yep. Raid groups are effectively elite strike teams, rather than legendary heroes.
---
Ganking mages who are aoe grinding is one of my few hobbies
---
No one is getting banned or punished for this. As long as popular gaming personalities like Esfand abuse it and admit to abusing it, Bliz's hands are tied. It's like when a famous person allegedly commits a crime, we expect they won't face the same scrutiny as a normal person (and they almost never do). Do any of you honestly believe they would ban Esfand and take one of the more popular streams off the air? No way. 
---
Addendum: I have no problem with Esfand or any other personality, just an example since he did it on stream and is popular.
---
Well see that‚Äôs where the original poster had a problem. He I learned the entire profession and when he picked it up he couldn‚Äôt learn goblin engineering. I don‚Äôt know why the post was deleted but that‚Äôs what he had said in it.
---
I definately wasn't expect the queues to be this severe, especially because Blizzard only offered 2 PvP realms at the start. I figured that they knew what they were doing and that the bottleneck would NOT be the server infrastructure.
---
Well, 1 week later and there's suddenly quite a few more realms to pick. So much for that.
---
I don't really mind - started playing 2 weeks after release anyway, so picked Noggenfogger and it's high/full, yet never encountered a queue
---
Lvl 44 10g got my mount at 40 and have 262 enchanting fishing with cooking is da money maker nightfin soup dependent on the realm makes between 10g and 20g per hout u catch enough fisg to make 60 nightfin soup per hour now check ur server how much that is for you
---
I do a /who 60 on my server and haven‚Äôt seen more than 11 on at once on the horde side.
---
I dont give a fuck, I killed Rag and Ony with my level 60 toon and now I stop playing until phase 2 is out to play the new content.
---
Layering here or not I dont care, I got my vanilla flashback and I am satisfied, no point to play without new content
---
Reputaci√≥n pretty much doesnt matter with layering
---
as far as i'm aware they treat them all the same, big guilds that stream world firsts have been hit with bans for exploiting stuff even if they haven't streamed the exploits
---
Layering was intended to work in the open world, not in specific instanced worlds/zones
---
\#NoChanges
---
Well ya should be doing that anyway for pre bis :P
---
Even better if you are a Skinner too I guess
---
That ID went to the new layer and that new computer/server says "I dont have this ID in my records, let me create a new instance"
---
Unless you are in Un'Goro, where every warrior runs about with a stack of free action potions. It lasts for 30seconds aswell which isn't broken at all
---
Thanks, but i mean, can i do decent dps without pummelers ? ( pre AQ )
---
Which are usually bad players or meme specs
---
Is ur horde wailing caverns deviate delight fishing 5 deviate delights go for 19 s
---
Thank you for the reply, I'll probably stick with tailoring then. Not sure what other profession to go with it, I went herbalism for now just for the gold.
---
Probably more than that.
---
Professions, grind out rep, dungeons.
---
Have an arcane rift open up inside the Dalaran bubble! They could use Gilneas too, for other content...
---
What items are best for my level? I feel lost, I am a level 35 hunter.
---
Not really I have record set to my + key and stop recording set to - key. OBS already drops everything in its own recording file so I just leave them there.
---
Do you know you can turn off the verbal indicators like ‚ÄòI‚Äôm out of range!‚Äô and the like in settings? Seems that they‚Äôre distracting and unhelpful in these situations. 
---
You probably shocked the hell out of that guy. ‚Äú*Of course* there was a stealthed Rogue!!‚Äù
---
People still watch TV?
---
What year is it?
---
considering how overcrowded most places are, just opt for some unpopular mobs that arent part of a quest, and which you can skin. there's quite a lot of ridge stalkers and coyotes in badlands, so you might try that, depending on how much you get ganked
---
I know a lot of people loved BT in BC and all of the Wrath raids, so I understand that I hold a minority opinion there. Something just never clicked for me. 
---
Wrath Naxx just seemed like a cheap knockoff like a phone game with stolen assets or something. The content was there but it just felt wrong. Ulduar, the Eye, and that crusader one just didn't feel like WoW. They felt like some other game. I did not do ICC.
---
This is so cute!
---
It's one of my favorites as well! Only about level 25 now, but very excited to get towards the higher level zones!
---
I think we're exaggerating a little, considering the fastest SM groups have all been aoe spellcleaves.
---
Hunters are whatever, I've had more problems with bad rogues more so than any class. Does that mean anything? No, not really, because it's a tiny sample size of the entire player base. I'm sure there's a decent amount of bad mages jumping on the flavour of the month without knowing what they are doing, but I've really not seen a large amount of bad mages more than any other class.
---
Support staff wouldn't handle this.  Programmers and data scientist will run queries against captured data and analytics to weed out the abusers.
---
That's not the problem. They've fixed the exploit. They just need to find certain search criteria (IE 30 Rivendare kills) and ban those players. It's the most basic of lookups.
---
Play horde, undead won't Bea issue

People on this sub hate him though, so they‚Äôll never entertain the fact even though he‚Äôs done inspirational pre-event speeches in this matter all the time

Certain people had 100k gold. Pretty sure millions of gold being injected into the economy at once will ruin it for a long enough time to consider it ruined.
---
happens to me all the fucking time. 
---
search for ‚Äúworld server is down‚Äù - blizz has a page that tells you to either reset your UI or ‚Äúmove your character‚Äù. ‚Äúmove your character‚Äù is a self service support page that moves the bugged character to westfall, then he is unstuck and you can play him again. This has worked around the problem for me (multiple times per day...). i hope they fix it though, what a pain in the ass.
---
Could someone explain what‚Äôs going on? I don‚Äôt play this game, what‚Äôs everyone so upset about?
---
I did my first dungeon run yesterday and you are right.  What really blew me away was that the tank kept apologizing like it.
---
How about no
---
Shitpost
---
Just tell me before we start that you're reserving something. 
---
It's fine if it's advertised. Sometimes I can talk those groups into reserving an item for me and/or being picky about group comp to limit competition. 
---
It's only slimy when you spring it on people right before a boss.
---
Need all boes. Is that better?
---
Well, you do you, but I would still encourage you to try something different from purely gaming. For the sake of having varied experiences!
---
Beyond that, it's your life so enjoy it the way you see fit, as long as it's not detrimental to anyone (=
---
I'm not saying it's right, but this is the kind of stuff that made Blizzard add personal loot.
---
Naw man, that's a nice find but it's nowhere near as smoothe as the original moonwalk. I'd take client side super smoothe animation over this glitched up mess tbh.
---
Dude if your an adult, i really dont know what to say. This sounds like a scenario a 12 year old would come up with...   If you are an adult, just straight up tell them I dont like playing with you guys becuase you are loot whores. Then dont play with them...
---
"Skype with video is a must." Hahaha.
---
You'll have to level it a bit but there are some awesome looking boars in RFK.
---
I think they are around level 30.
---
I don't think there's anything special about them other than the skin though.
---
On your login screen you can right now click the "Shop" button (don't worry, it's free) and click the free server transfer button. You can then move your character from Noggenfogger to Judgement. If you think that is gonna be any better. It's the internet though I don't think you will notice much changes. Maybe leave general chat and world chat? Most people are not actually trying to be racists and whatever, they are just young and uneducated and their intent is actually to make people laugh, not make people mad, most of the time.
---
I am also sure you can find a better guild on your server. Maybe look for a smaller one?
---
Just a tip if you want more mature players, play on the RPPVP server. The only enforced rule is that you have to have a "RP friendly name". Other than that, you can play as you do now, and it's much more mature people there. I don't think you will ever feel forced to RP and it's a jump you can do.
---
Same ran into some KOS Allies on Blaumeux yesterday
---
im a Tank...... its not hard for me to find a group.  
---
If the group performs well, sometimes we can do multiple runs... nothing wrong with that.  
---
Also its called AOE and not spellcleave or some shit

You're implying pvers click skills? But how would I be able to mouse turn..üòÇüëå

"You can just hang outside in the sun all day tossing a ball around. Or you can sit at your computer and do something that matters." - Eric Cartman, LVL 60 Dwarf Warrior
---
This is nice, I watched the video, however I remember moonwalk being far smoother than this.
---
I don't see the fun in doing this hehe
---
You need the item = need. 
---
You need the item after two dings = need.
---
You cant use the item = greed.
---
You can and will use the item after you learn the skill and get level ups = need
---
Your offspec needs it = greed or ask if you can need
---
Its BoE blue/purple = need
---
Its a Gem = need
---
Thats how easy it is.
---
Thisssss lol

That's cheating and should be against ToS. Not everyone can use their phone at work.

You trust reddit over your friend...?

The few days I don't play, kinda sad I missed this

Stack raw power

Int and Stam don't really do anything important
---
I have not seen a single layer reference in chat yet.
---
I'm only 28, so that may be why
---
if you hate mages, take a paladin with you. A single blessing of freedom will transform every fight against mages in a cakewalk.
---
I'm sure they've either sold or found ways to smuggle BoE loot they got to receive it back when they get back from being banned. like BoE money laundering lol.
---
That's why I fuck with then and pull 10 mobs into their AoE. My favorite is the Quillboar Geomancers. I'll pull like 9 of those chuckle fucks and kill myself just to ruin the 3 mages who are being dicks. Mages NEVER survive the geomancers. It turns into a caster battle that the geomancers will win every single time due to their absurd spell damage. 
---
Sometimes I'll whisper "AoE that" and they just get mad and tell me how much of an asshole I am
---
Sure, if you say it before the run starts then it's fine, it gives other people a chance to back out if they want the same thing without wasting a lot of time. It's a dick move to do it at the end of the dungeon.
---
I just want to play devils advocate here. Since i fins myself tending to be salty over the broken market - but also not at the least shocked with the entire thing. 
---
So ill take this side for the argument:
---
People warned blizz that this would happen long before launch.  
---
Blizzard did nothing. 
---
People did what they told blizzard they would do,
---
blizzard should now punish them. 
---
An extreme example but one not entierly unrealistic: 
---
If you behave physically theatening mannen towards me, and i warn you that if this continues i will knock you out. 
---
You then proceed to continue and i, as i told you, knock you out.  
---
Who is at fault?  
---
I warned you what would happen and you didnt listen. 
---
Exactly what i told you would happen, did indeed happen.  
---
Who is at fault?  Me? For doing what i told you i would do if you keep doing what you are. 
---
Or you?  For not listening.  Sure you‚Äôll wake up and be a smarter man for it, now knowing what CAN happen.  But your also left with some form of - if not severe brain damage. 
---
Thats how i see this.  People did warn blizzard whats going to happen.  And blizzard acted too slowly on it. And with no ‚Äùwe are working on a fix, and people absuing this untill then Will be dealt with‚Äù
---
Blizzard were out of touch with this entire re-launch.  6 servers to start? How many servers do we have now? 20?  STILL there are ques.  
---
Blizzard is in no place to punish anyone for layer hopping.  It was a continuous thing with Sharding on retail.  I feel they should look over it and learn to listen to their community that only whats a good, healthy game.
---
Had a duo try to pull the same shit in gnomer a week ago, except they also took any loot (including random greens) that you didnt specifically call out. Luckily they couldn't do the boss without me bc I was healer. I saw them LFGing for hours afterwards. Felt good.
---

WotF is good but warriors can already break fear.

He clearly didn‚Äôt finish the video, silly alliance
---
That's actually an awesome idea, but horde scum would miss the fun.
---
Well I personally usually dont go into a dungeon for a particular item. Rather I do it for the quests, experience and all kinds of upgrades. So I only care to get into one most of the time. If I'm actually aiming for this particular item, I just wont go with them.
---
They exploited to level from any level
---
I‚Äôve been asked twice why I wasn‚Äôt tanking as prot in some random lvl mid 40 instance.

Can the raid leader turn personal loot to off?
---
Off topic but damn, Tai Lung honestly didn't deserve this. Poor guy, he got shafted so hard for some trivial bs.
---
Also he was hot so like, come on. Give the man a pass.
---
If they don't get banned or if their stuff isn't removed. 
---
Also, why do you care who has to "work" for anything? Can't you have fun while knowing that others might have "worked" less?
---
Are you the same guyes that played on Mannoroth in Vanilla?

Nah it's a perfect game for beginners if you're looking for a this kind of game. Beginner or veteran, you aren't getting this from any other game.

I bet Sean Connery could do it

He'll find out how it really is.

‚ÄúGame ruining moves‚Äù?
---
My game hasn‚Äôt been ruined. It‚Äôs great. Why has yours? Is there something you can do about it that blizzard is stopping you from doing?
---
Seriously everyone is so angry about classic being ruined yet I and everyone I know playing it are having a blast. I don‚Äôt give a shit what some streamer is doing to gear up in 8 minutes flat.
---
yeah i was playing 6 hours a day too when i was 9.
---
that's because we only had 1 PC and brother played the other 6 hours.
---
Yeah, just read that apparently folks were abusing layers to farm dungeon bosses as well? So shitty lmao, hope they are perma banned. 
---
At least blizzard is watching this. I wish they didn't have to. 
---
It's more or less in the global chat channels(/world namely). Some people in this thread mentioned there are some channels set up that have things automated so just type things like !layer and it sends you an invite.. but idk about that.
---
Yes, lets just start a screaming match again. It worked well the first 5 times.
---
usually on those random world drops everyone should just need. no reason why u would greed to have someone need it away?
---
&gt; Its okay doing it in 5mans in my book ~~if they ...~~
---
It gives them all the needed publicity well ahead of end game to make sure others don't end up in their group and BS later on.
---
Thats too many "lol"s
---
Yeah, like 1 in 10 and then this guy starts attacking me with the back to the mobs he forgot ;P
---
When these guys get too greedy, I run into their pull as the nova breaks and hit em with the ole Psychic Scream lol.
---
Shitpost at the finest &lt;333
---
Yeah all it does is reduce aggro radius. It's almost like it makes the mob think you're a higher level player, if that makes sense.
---
The blizzard tracking analytic tracks individual items, even junk, you think they aren‚Äôt tracking layers? Come on.
---
Holy fuck HAHAHAHA this one made my day
---
I‚Äôm level 38, and spent most of last night wandering around the badlands + STV trying to find some quest mobs to farm. I think I finally understand why people farm xp in SM, because the whole night I found that every single viable quest mob in both regions was getting camped by a huge number of both factions. 
---
Does anyone have any advice for less crowded areas in my level range? Or is SM farming my best bet if I want to make guaranteed xp progress?
---
Cries in dominos.
---
I mean I‚Äôm not IT guy but I‚Äôm pretty sure anyone could look at the data logs and look at any account that completed a quest multiple times that‚Äôs not repeatable.
---
For example if n=0 for a quest line that is not repeatable
---
So player 1 completes quest that which n= 0, just look at which data log has multiple n=0  submissions. It seems they know which quest too so it‚Äôs simply just plug in data and wait for results... I believe
---
Nice analogy!
---
Badlands has been worse than stv for me
---
Does Hinterlands have any decent levelling content? I always really liked the zone, but can't remember for the life of me if there are quests etc there aside from the Zul Farrak hammer, it doesn't seem to appear of guides.
---
Depends on server, no one can give you a definitive answer. I'd say if you're getting an offer of 1300g take the money and run.
---
This post was made by a priest lmao
---
Show actual proof of that please
---
People were talking about node spam, which blizzard addressed, not instanced layering
---
How do you know that? I heard that it's parsed randomly so there is no way to know for sure what it will look like
---
You kill a boss. You leave party and join someone else's party who is standing outside the instance (a new layer). 
---
The new layer doesn't have the boss killed, so it instantly respawns again, with you standing right there. Kill it. Repeat infinitely.
---
There are multiple serious horde guilds on Gandling, 2 on this screenshot, I already know of at least 3 guilds killing Rag.
---
In all fairness they probably should have tested that you can't layer inside a goddamn instanced dungeon.
---
You aren't forced to drink alcohol at a bar. In the first place, it's somewhere you meet up with people easily.
---
You can also drink coffee, tea, juice, water and even eat. Also, you could have one drink for the entirety of those 6 hours.
---
You extrapolating that being at a bar for 6 hours is akin to being alcoholic is the same kind of assumption that playing for extended periods of time drives you violent or incites you being a public shooter
---
all gold then
---
&gt;So, if you're against to bring a tankadin to your raid group, what are your arguments?
---
As a Prot Paladin:
---
* Aggro requires getting hit. Vritually all your aggro comes from Holy Shield/Blessing of Sanctuary. The lack of taunt makes aggro-switching pretty much impossible. Automatic aggro-switches (Wing Buffet, Conflagration, Burning Adrenaline) won't save you either, since most dps will have out-aggro'ed you by that point.
---
* Huge mana-problems on long fights. Even Seal &amp; Judgement of Wisdom won't let you sustain + your aggro will be crap.
---
* Anti-Mana mechanics (Geddon, Moam etc.) and buff purges (Garr etc.).
---
* Lack of gear &amp; crap scaling from spellpower-weapons, compared to warriors/druids. This also means no crit/crushing immunity, making stuff like Patchwerk impossible to tank or OT.
---
As Paladins we can tank dungeons and some raid trash, but anything beyond that is simply not functionally possible.
---
no, it clers Esfand and the people in his specific raid from getting banned. No one else.
---
You didn‚Äôt answer the question, they asked for a list of all the classic server subs, not the specific one already linked in the comment they were responding to.
---
It does a lot for bliz
---
It's just distributes over the whole spell instead of per tick
---
As a guy leveling in all frost DMG gear, it's a huuuuuuuuuuuge difference
---
Green dragon bosses are P4.
---
Tbh the sons of Arugal look arguably better than current worgen.
---
You don't need a raid group to do spellcleave. It works very well with just a 5 man group.
---
Spin isn‚Äôt useless for hunters though, so still a weird item
---
To be fair, the few lower level kills only made it cause they picked the fight (and I mean the dumbass night elf come on)
---
3 weeks of abusing. Stop abusing. Ok it's not so bad in phase 1, but inceased population as now without layers will effect wpvp too much. I like pvp, but not when the whole world is nesingwary camp because of x3 players at each realm
---
Heh, caught one!
---
Can someone explain this to me? I played a little back in the day, and just started again. Not sure what "on reserve" means.
---
I like the idea of seasonal raid rotations with a shuffle being done at the beginning of a year , add mounts/titles for certain completions or achievements done within each shuffle. I personally like how diablo has different seasonal set gear as well, always makes me wanna start a new character and grind it out. Keep PvP fresh and give fun new incentives to keep making toons. ‚ÄúHeroic‚Äù dungeons could also be a lot of fun as it gives incentive to run old content. Have challenge raids where random bosses can spawn and loot is randomized, hardcore raid guilds can find prestige in beating them on release , and casuals can have a fun shot at loot they might not normally be able to get.
---
still the same company that handled the exploit, i see no reason why they would act differently and spare anyone. 
---
and as you said, Esfand did it on stream. so if there's a vod or any other form of evidence hes pretty screwed, IMO
---
Hard disagree. But state it as you invite people so they can make the decision to go with you or not.
---
If I saw that in barrens I'd whisper to join. This is my type of humor. I'm super casual so the most important aspect of the guild I join is personality.
---
$20 investment to try it out I have wasted 20 on less if you like it join I highly suggest learning to install addons tho or your experience might not be that enjoyable
---
BlackRock mountain is an authentic battleground. Forget hillsbrad.
---
What exactly is supposed to scale? It‚Äôs a 3 second stun
---
I'm really curious to see if this will be a 3, 7 day, 90 day, or perma ban and if they remove the exploited recipes and items from these characters.
---
I think a 60 to 90 day ban and the removal of as much of the exploited material would work. This keeps them available for phase 2 but isn't overly punishable. For sure the gold and items need to be deleted though.
---
Well yeah it‚Äôs the lack of AOE that makes Paladins  not the best DPS choice. For example, I ran SM cath the other day with a Warrior, warlock, priest, and mage. 1st run we did small pulls, focused down single targets. I was too DPS. 2nd rub we decided to do larger pulls and AOE them down. I was 2nd/3rd damage. I‚Äôm not even a reg build. I just put enough points to get SoCommand and Pursuit of Justice.
---
Paladins do very good single target damage. The meme that they do no damage is silly. I literally had a guy ‚ÄúLF1M DPS‚Äù respond back to me the other day saying ‚ÄúI said DPS not handicaps‚Äù for an SM run. 
---
That doesn‚Äôt even take into account the fact that if the tank or healer die a paladin can replace. If the Paladin isn‚Äôt the only person with resurrection he can save the group from a wipe with DI. The amount of times I‚Äôve saved a group from a wipe even with just a well timed BoP or LOH comes to mind as well. The Paladin is also usually off tanking every single pull in a 5 man because most tanks can‚Äôt hold aggro. Their job is make everyone around them better and the fights easier.
---
And multiboxing is banable? I got 5 dots instantly yesterday from a multiboxing lock in un'goro. 
---
The madlads are everywhere.
---
It's a good question. In two years or whatever everyone in your guild has BiS from Naxx and everyone has an Atiesh. What, do you keep playing or is that it?
---
The question is, who thought Vanilla raiding was gonna be harder than retail raiding? I thought the consensus was that the raiding ain't gonna be harder, but the whole experience with classic is 1000x more fun, and that's why you play it. The community, the grind and the fellowships, not a challenging raid environment!

Walking an enjoying the scenery
---
When classic quests even acknowledge the fact that something takes quite a few kills then you can be sure the droprate is below shit-tier.
---
we must go back
---
Shoot I miss when my boy was this little
---
He‚Äôs almost one now and wants to pound the keyboard to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs a great feeling having your little one on your lap, fully wide eyed watching you play
---
theres just no way you are not playing on one of the biggest servers, you would not be saying this if you played on one of the servers with 30 lvl 60s at max level
---
What the hell is the "f-slur" ?
---
I doubt it man, they‚Äôve always just made such shit products. Even when people raves about them in 2008 they were pumping out ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù junk. I had s couple RMA replacements and quickly stopped supporting them in favor of Logitech mice and custom keyboards.
---

My Man!
---
You‚Äôre literally defending a position you are uninformed about. Probably basing it off the tired meme based on late game DPS. Level 20‚Äôs a Paladin with VF and SoCommand does insane damage. That‚Äôs a fact. You don‚Äôt understand why their damage falls off on a DPS meter late game and that‚Äôs okay no shame.
---
All letters are ascii letters.
---
I used mine all the time but as I got older it‚Äôs so much easier for me to just keybind stuff to the keyboard instead, I still use them but moved most of my stuff over to keyboard

Sir do you realize that you are not drinking regular coffee but Colombian decaffeinated coffee crystals?
---
ive heard esfand wen out of mc to get the fire res buff from lbrs , they reset mc by accident this way once 
---
thats why i said 4 kills , people who were doing this multiple times should go
---
i just heard of a vuy who got bot bindings in one run im going to guess they were doing this
---
My God.  Who cares.
---
Imagine thinking the Russian scam artists with their Frankenstein servers and real money trading should be trusted when it comes to population numbers lmao (or anything for that matter)
---
Pretty sure that's retail.  That beard isn't available in Classic.
---
Same exact thing happened to me. Crazy huh
---
Apologising for what!! Not getting aggro back?
---
AUTO CREMATE
---
Because having the best possible item is cool.

Is there some kind of fishing etiquette I am not aware of?  
---
I was following the river near southshore to farm turtles and I saw some guy near a pond. It wasn't any rare or special fish (found like 5 more on the way up), but it looked like the fish I needed to level cooking so I joined in. You know, fishing is pretty chill so maybe there would be some light-hearted chatting. Nope. Dude got real mad and after sending me a long insulting pm and "negative waves" he blocked me. I tried to understand wtf was wrong with him, I could've sent him that damn fish for all I cared, it wasn't the large ones I needed anyway, but since Bnet is a thing now that blocks the full account so I can't do much about it.  
---
I agree grabbing a chest or plant is shitty, because there's only one. But fish ponds, especially basic ones? There's plenty for multiple people in them, it is no different than tagging one of the 40 random murlocs questing people need to kill.
---
Aren't druids brilliant mob taggers with moonfire?
---
My only gripe with my guild is that they constantly span twitch remotes and for some reason It does my nut in
---
im okay with that. i wouldnt evrn be mad if they dont get a temp. ban haha
---
&gt;It‚Äôs better to fade away than burn out!
---
My, my hey hey
---
Agreed, but for example in the past people who have abused leveling potions/glitches often are temporarily banned for a shorter amount of time than they saved by gitch leveling. With the exception of AQ map editing and the saronite bomb glitches blizzard has given a slap on the wrist for every major exploit. If there are people who farmed their pre-bis with this and they only get a 2 week ban and no items reverted - they'll likely still be ahead of players who didn't cheat at all.
---
it's become the de-facto rp-pvp server for oceanic, i love it.
---
I've been waiting for Fishing Buddy to get a Classic update and just discovered there's an alternative version for Classic.

"Those are rookie numbers in this racket"
---
The free market working as intended.
---
He changed it to master loot so he could control who gets what loot, instead of everyone rolling for it like normal. By on reserve, he means one specific person has dibs on the axe if it drops. He didn't specify this ahead of time though, so the OP went through the whole dungeon thinking he could roll on it.

Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old-style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you unfamiliar with Classic, and want a supportive and organized community to provide you with the environment, advice, and the backup you will need to survive on a PVP server?
---
#####What we do:
---
* Weekly city raids. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with city raids let us know in advance, we can bring newbies up to speed on the do's and don‚Äôts of zerg vs zerg PvP
---
* Support our members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE and 1 City. Days are finalized to be Mondays and Tuesdays, 7-10 PM Central Time. If you cannot commit to those times, we have a second raid roster on Saturday and Sunday 7-10PM CST. However, for both rosters we have a dedicated wPvP day on Thursday 7-10PM CST. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can‚Äôt roll on the bindings). In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for wPvP attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
#####Who we are:
---
* Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit
---
* A friendly tight-knit group who share a common interest in classic and other games
---
* Our culture is strictly old-school - we have loads of fun but won‚Äôt stand for pettiness, harassment, racism, or consistent mindless regurgitation of tired memes
---
#####Who we want:
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Someone who‚Äôs friendly, willing to learn, communicative on Discord, and loves world PvP
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you in and teach you. If you‚Äôre a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, or If you‚Äôre a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla ‚Äì you‚Äôre welcome, and you‚Äôre wanted.

#RECRUITMENT STATUS: RECRUITING ALL CLASSES 25+
---
You gotta pump those numbers up! Those are rookie numbers!
---
Clueless lmfao hahahaha
---
Ah yes I like your suggestion. Let's remove layers and add more realms.
---
Now that we're at it, let's make it so you can see characters from other realms, so you can play with your other realm friends when they invite you to a party.
---
The instance reset of that fashion is acceptable. It‚Äôs what blizzard set it to, changed from the old script you‚Äôd run and relog.
---
As for evade bugging, it‚Äôs been in the game forever. They‚Äôd have to change pathing and whatnot to fix that, which could break a ton of things.
---
One way to fix it would be to have mobs snap to players that are evading, but this happens in certain spots in retail and is actually used to make dungeons even faster. It has been used in the MDI with no penalty, so Blizzard condones its use in that fashion.
---
They don't need to get rid if layering, They Just need to put a CD on how often you can swap layers
---
Rank 1 frostbolt.
---
I think it's a carryover from the early arena days
---
Might have been been a nickname for SL/SL 3s with a second caster like ele sham, I don't remember for sure
---
Stop giving him attention then.
---
I played it on and off since 2005 and I completely disagree but okay. Experiences can vary I guess.
---
1. No
---
2. Depends on Paladin's luck.
---
Agree.
---
This is when you invite a friend and you go out off your way to make their life miserable. You hunt them down in the zone and kill them every time you see them.
---
This happened to me yesterday in blasted lands, and after a good 2 hour and some 20-30 times killing the same 3 bullies they logged out as questing had become impossible for them. 
---
Its all about the revenge.
---
Saw one drop in scholo yesterday
---
Fear their mobs. Snare them out of the group. Pull more and FD. Just pull more through their Blizzard.
---
Who are you? I'm fine. I said who are you? I'm fine! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
that's pretty impressive. so now they just need enough gold for elementium bars?
---
No Blizz bad begone now
---
Thats pretty much applicable to any melee class VS mage, unless you've a trinket or get that 2% resist theres no counterplay to frost nova&gt;blink....
---
Answer this. What is wrong with a group individuals to follow a set of rules that they all agree to which effects no one outside of said group?
---
Ratchet sounds much more likely. Good story.
---
You're my hero.  Love all these musics
---
&gt; (You were the first person to bring up dungeon finder in this comment chain)
---
OP: 
---
&gt;People from the matchmaking era of gaming
---
Stay in school, kids.
---
So the kid spent 6 hours problem solving instead of staring at the idiot box? The problem is what?
---
Guild run or not, report them for this behavior OP.
---
I dont hate asmongold and i upvoted that.  Whats your point?
---
Class trainer, right?
---
Nice anecdotes.
---
Fuck off, I've legitimately grinded and quested since Launch and I'm almost 55 now. No one is rerolling shit just because a few people hit 60 way before me using dirty methods. Grow up.
---
Its pretty hard to tell exploits from actual glitches if you see them just once or twice. My raid guild once e.g. pulled chromaggus while doing the whelp &amp; trap room in bwl and nobody knows what caused it.
---
It got stuck
---
What's your /played ?
---
I got mouseover-macros for that kind of thing, that way i can hover over the nameplates of the mobs and quickly mark them even midfight.
---
- /run SetRaidTarget("target", 8);
---
(also enable hostile name plates)
---
I never knew I needed a word to express this before just now.
---
Wym?
---
Hetz
---
Yea, so it's okay cause of that, or what? Get out of here with your bullshit..
---
You watched him follow you and started fighting mobs anyway?
---
Who says it‚Äôs not working for me or that im even playing hunter?
---
That said, if feint death really isn‚Äôt instant that pretty much renders it useless. The bigger the delay the bigger the chance you get set back into combat
---
Ok so the original commenter was pretty off the mark, as video games in my opinion are a perfectly acceptable hobby. That being said though it's important to make sure you try and get out of your comfort zone every now and again. It's not healthy to  have your life completely revolve around anything to the extent you described, that is to say whether it's video games or smoking pot, or even reading books, you need to try and inject some variety into your life and not wall yourself off completely from the rest of the world.
---
At least that's my take on it
---
Always advertise if loot is reserved.
---
I fell out with a guild master over this for void reaver in shadowmoon Valley in TBC. He ended up absorbing my friends into his guild and barred me. I went into depression and got life fatigue. For 10 years I avoided confrontation, even when friends were being toxic.
---
Yeah. Fuck those people and unintentional gaslighting.
---
Lol I had a group yesterday that was mad that I was pulling two a time and using cleave and thunderclap. They wanted to polymorph and slowly move through the dungeon. Best part is towards the end on of them admits his weapon broke first boss and was been running unarmed since.
---
Ya im trying to get a new offhand sword from quest in RFD. That dagger has insane dps but ya caster stats lol
---
It‚Äôs not. People just have preconceived biases and only tend to remember the times that confirm those biases.
---
Layering is not that bad. Infact I'd argue it's a blessing. The fact that Classic has been so crowded I cannot get some quests done even WITH layering means removing it is not an accurate representation of Classic either. 
---
It's a necessary evil and just because people are exploiting a bug with it does not mean it's a bad system.
---
You are nicer than me. If I am grinding a spot and a mage shows up to AOE farm I will Multishot and Arcane another before he can cast his Frost Nova. I will let him kill my mobs. He reset and tried again. I did the same thing.
---
After resetting once more he tried something different, he ran in and started casting Arcane Explosion. He ran out of mana before killing the mobs and they killed him. He didn't come back.
---
Even if you mash the Follow command, it still remains over the corpse.
---
The servers are a lot more powerful than they were before.  Blizzard upped the "active pop limit" on the servers during the first few days after launch.
---
The other reason for layers is client performance.  Some people's computers will melt if there are 5000 players crammed into a single location.
---
&gt;  A lot of players got some heavy bans, some I think up to like 6 weeks or so. Even Preavh got banned!
---
Imagine being banned for intern tier programming errors. Holy cow blizzard
---
Alliance..makes sense
---
Even if we're in a WoW sub, every single little thing doesn't have to directly relate to WoW. Since dungeon finder doesn't have anything to do with his original remark it was pretty obvious he wasn't talking about that.
---
That doesn‚Äôt work. Found that out in ‚Äò06, doubt much has changed.
---
This would be awesome. Reminds me of Ultima Online
---
Do you sell stuff at the AH?
---
You deserved it. Racial slurs in a character name are never acceptable.
---
Wow, you want to do 1-60 grinding? That's intense. I can do that for a couple of levels at most.. but then I have to start doing other stuff.
---
Same, not a rogue but he's still added to my KoS list.
---
This is nothing short of ninja.
---
So what‚Äôs stopping those players from transferring all the earned gold from the exploit to a friend?
---
So Classic has been as awful as you remember this time around again?
---
Also a tank, I just bought a refurbished mouse with 12 thumb buttons, it's still in the mail so I havent used it yet, I've never had a fancy mouse before and rarely game outside of WoW so this will be a new experience for me.
---
Question: when I tank I'm usually spamming 2 or even 3 buttons at a time (I'm a bear, but warrior equivalents would be spamming sunder/revenge/HS/shield block), how easy is it to press more than one button at a time on the mouse? I'm debating if I should keep the maul bound to my keyboard so I can spam that through an entire fight, and tech the other abilities (swipe, rawr, etc) to the mouse so I'm only pressing one button at a time on the mouse. How do you do it, or are you using macros?
---
Now that I think of it macros is probably the way to go...
---
This seemed obvious to me but I guess at least 55 other slow pokes didn't understand his tone of voice either. Gotta love people passing judgement before taking 2 seconds to understand a situation.
---
He might even get "big true".
---
On behalf of my AoE brethren, I apologize. I tend to try and form groups for quests, which then we can all reap the benefits.
---
I'm having a hard time finding groups as hunter. Most people either ignore my responses or say no hunters. Is this a thing in the end game too? I'm thinking of rerolling because I like to solo but not necessarily all the time.
---
They can absolutely track that. However you're still crazy if you think Blizzard is actually going to punish everyone that did this exploit.
---
Will transmog ever be a thing in classic?
---
Cold try Feralas/Tanaris/Swamp of Sorrows/Dustwallow? Perhaps far enough away that it might be a bit more empty- and I guess those zones are less played because they have always been more annoying (not sure on my level ranges but think I'm right!)
---
Launch night I'll never forget this quote.
---
"It's been an hour and you're *ALREADY* complaining?!?!"
---
its too late now. im already overleveled for desolace. but like how are you suppose to know that kind of stuff? to kill those orcs until they drop a quest chain? thats super secret
---
Good lord your formatting is atrocious. This hurts to read.
---
That was my first thought!
---
May I press X to doubt here? WoW character names only got up to 12 characters.
---
You seem to understand my disgust, thank you.
---
The OP it that kinda individual you mention here. To quote him in a comment further down:
---
"Imagine running Stratholme for the millionth time, only to lose the deathcharger to some random pug needing it on his first run"
---
..thinking that he is entitled to said loot because he has done it a million times and calling people "random pugs" -  what a distasteful piece of human garbage.
---
What does /moon do?  It can't do what I think it does...
---
God damn are you serious
---
good bot
---
As a mage main who did nothing but pvp in retail... This hurt me to watch
---
Thanks, yeah, used the wrong word...holy crap was I tired.
---
just yesterday evening , i was questing in ashenvale, running all over that place, buffing others, running around, just running. Then i  stopped, i just stood there in the middle of the road, looked around me, took of my weapon, boots, shoulderpats, helmet. And i started to walk, simple walking, from quest to quest. no fast running, no rushing from one point to another, just walking in ashenvale. from Maevs outpost, to Splinter Outpost, just simply walking.
---
&gt; said anything when I needed greater fire res potion as alchemist, which seems to go for 100g in AH.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Where does it end? Can I need flask recipes too with the excuse of being alchemist?
---
Yes, you can.  If you can equip or use it in a tradeskill, you need.  If it's only for GOLD, you GREED.  It's the definition of the damn word, plus the icon.
---
Communicate with your friends or people in server that care. Or.. you know defend yourself. Don‚Äôt let stuff happen to you. Out play them lol
---
!RemindMe 2 hours
---
I play a tauren and I have a /moo macro, I'm level 53, I like to spam it while riding on my big kodo past low level alliance, just to scare them, I don't gank for no reason.
---
Dungeon finder isn't a matchmaking system? That's news to everyone.
---
Prove it. Some generic bullshit about "layering is bad!" doesn't count. Prove that someone posted this exact exploit in the AMA.
---
200 IQ move right there
---
Sounds like you're projecting a bit there, bud. All I'm saying is RULE 3 EXISTS lol. Screenshots are NOT good evidence of anything.
---
Dismiss your pet. Wait for the mage to run around aggroing things. Use multishot to pull 3-4 of them away before he tags. When he starts channeling his first blizzard hit feign death.
---
The mobs will drop aggro and rush the mage - from a different direction than the rest of the mobs they're farming, interrupting their blizzard and/or forcing them blow CDs early. 
---
Stay on the ground in case they get slick and use iceblock to send em back to you.
---
My Mage is sort of my second main. I farm like this, but I fully expect to get fucked with and try not to be an asshole to other people who need mobs, especially for quests.
---
30 day ban is fine, just rollback their character to level 1.
---
Absolutely only the worst 1% will get banned. I don't even know how Blizzard would be able to check to see who to ban and who to leave alone. You're talking hundreds, if not thousands of people using an exploit. It's not like they'd have some readily made trigger they can check and double back to they'd likely have to check layering times across the board. Ain't nobody got time for that. They'll ban well know twitch streamers that did it as well as any high profile player that suspiciously has a lot of raid gear that is impossible to have by this time. Basically they will ban some to make a show.
---
Every weapon has been reserved for the hunter. Everything is hunter gear. That plate helm? Hunter weapon. Cloth chest? Hunter weapon. Paladin Libram it druid relic? Hunter. Weapon.
---
Compensating for something?
---
Personally I appreciate blizz punishing cheaters.
---
Played a Hunter in Vanilla, grinded to Rank 12. Never ever ever did FD "not work" when trying to FD&gt;Trap.
---
Yeah, probably, but it honestly shouldnt be necessary. If were doing a dungeon with 0 feral gear, im already in full feral prebis, I dont have lotp since im resto specced.. can you really be mad at me for rolling on healing gear?
---
Its the same as it was in 1.12. its the same experience as a fresh server in 2007
---
I totally forgot bandages existed for a while.

Isn‚Äôt layering the reason you don‚Äôt have issues getting quest mobs and graphic lag going into orgimmar?? 
---
Seems like the layers are doing their job, and your implying otherwise
---
Which part of it is a bug? Mobs resetting when they can't hit you and jumping around on things in instances to skip content and save time are things that everyone does. I'd hate to have to run Gnomer without jumping down onto the cog.
---
Thanks man! How about raid or dungeon? Will it affect my dps?
---
I dont like playing WoW, but this does my heart good to see you guys pull together as a community to really apply some social justice.
---
Well paladin + war can pretty much kill any number of mage on them.
---
Maybe it was the QA team that missed it? Maybe it was the OPS team fault that insisted on layering to start? Maybe it was the management team pushing it through cause they can? Maybe it was the higher-ups cause it saved so much money? 
---
Maybe the developers have been against this all long.
---
Thebigone? Oh I remember this name.. generally not a good sign.
---
Big mount, small sword
---
&gt; Identifying those who knowingly abused this bug and taking 'appropriate punitive measures' (Likely bans and rollbacks)
---
Unless they get everyone, this is a band-aid measure and the damage is already done.  People in full gear by exploit reseting MC, Scholo, Strat, UBRS because of this need to be perma'd to set a precedent.
---
holy shit more gizzard fans
---
I‚Äôm not saying that classic won‚Äôt have a population... that‚Äôs the plan.  I‚Äôm saying servers won‚Äôt be at 40k and then layering goes bye bye
---
Last I checked, popular opinions aren't always correct. I'm also on r/classicwow and mentioned that dungeon finder is fine, so that's clearly going to make you nerds mad.
---
Dime a dozen, yall ain't special ;)
---
Most people won‚Äôt create photoshopped chat logs to defame someone in a online game server.

No difference between setting expectations beforehand while recruiting, and building a group of a warrior, 3 mages and a priest, ensuring you get physical dps shit. In both cases you get the gear you want.

Great reasoning, yet again. How much Spelldmg does a lvl 26 mage have?
---
&gt; Can't read thread hierarchies either I guess. Try reading then coming back - or don't, because you clearly have nothing to add to this conversation.
---
So, you answer to a comment from me, where I talk about low level paladin damage, in answer to a guy who says mage dmg is great at low level, in answer to a guy who said paladin dmg is great at low level, in answer to a guy talking about rogues. So essentially, 3 levels above my first comment and 5 levels above the comment you answered to someone talked about rogues and in your answer you turn me into a rogue and tell me that my non-existing low level rogue does crap dmg at lvl 25. And somehow I'm supposed to have missed the thread? What's wrong with you?
---
No... I‚Äôve been playing MMO games since UO, and I‚Äôve seen this kind of thing in dozens of games.  It balances out in time.

49 Fury Warrior. Weapon to go with Thrash Blade? I'm currently using it in the off-hand with Ripsaw in main hand, but get the feeling I oughta have Thrash in main. Best one-hand I got besides Thrash is Vanq's sword.
---
I have no idea why it works in dungeons, but if you look at the top left corner of the screen in the first 0.2 secs of the clip (replay several times)... he was invited to a party by a warrior and that causes the layer switch.
---
I have no idea if the warrior is inside another instance or in the outside world, I really don't know this exploit.
---
Don't just use buzzwords without knowing what they mean.
---
Pretty sure this is against Reddit rules in general. This reddit could get banned for it. I don't follow this reddit much unless the servers are down.

Probably not, they are a mage after all. Possibly the best class in the game.

No, but you are the one who spend his Friday evening sitting in stealth waiting for a Mage to come by and AOE farm, so you can gank him at 20% health with a horde of mobs running after him. 
---
I would argue that's a worse way to spend your Friday evening than to be ganked and ask for a invite to another layer and never be bothered by you again.
---
Not easier mechanically. Just not a mystery. People know pretty much everything there is to know about it.
---
People will get pissed off no matter what. I got kicked from a deadmines group because I kept winning upgrades.
---
No. They were talking about materials gathering in the world. Not instances.
---
It does some quests from item drops but not others, so I don't think it's a setting issue, just an incomplete issue.
---
For example, it shows the pirates treasure questline that starts from a drop from Murlocs in Westfall.
---
The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. Read the subreddit rules, you're trying really hard to turn this into an argument lol. There's no argument to be had here. It's against the rules, and screenshots are unreliable. End of story.
---
I'd say use it.
---
As a warrior you are the most gear dependant class. You should try to have as high a DPS weapon as you can. (If you want to be really optimal, favour slower weapons as well).
---
The only case where I'd say don't use it is if you have a quest reward coming up soon which would replace it. Then maybe you may as well try and sell it.
---
Welcome to classic
---
So which servers are we saying this is?
---
The Dark Knight...
---
I've been playing since tbc, and never have i ever had so much fun just leveling. There is an actual challenge to it. The risk of dying is real. You have to stay awake and put in effort, use every item to you advantage. Make actual money again, no just but a coin with IRL money.  
---
No store, no buying pets, mounts, or other cosmetics. Fucking love it.
---
haha awesome.
---
If you're tanking then it's expected you'll be rolling on tanking gear, not healing gear.  If you want to roll on healing gear then you should absolutely say in before the run.
---
Yep, if you‚Äôre not ahead of the curve or on a low pop server, you‚Äôre fighting 5 other people for the same 10-16 mobs anyway. At that point single-target has just been more efficient for me.
---
I dont really use recount or anything in classic specifically because i feel like dps is not very balanced in classic therefore its useless info. 
---
But i always like having hunters in my groups, they do alot of dps even if they are bad just by autoing and pet attacking.
---
Okay thank you for your answer, I'll probably do that then ;)
---
Did retail take a hard left with how it distributes loot or something?
---
&gt; You are even more avoidable as a Holy Paladin.
---
No because you're not solo :p
---
Why would a holy paladin ever be solo unless they're herbing or mining or something :P
---
F
---
This has nothing to do with instance ID's. Single ID's can be in multiple layers.
---
Does that one work with 1 click though? Or do I have to click once for equipping, and then click a second time to use the ability? I'm asking, because I've tried variants of this, and it just doesn't work. I have to click 2 times; first time to equip shield+1h, and second time (after GCD has reset!) to use ability.
---
I see this shit on Kromcrush every day in every chat channel. At least several times per hour. It's getting exhausting. I am on Horde though.
---
IKR? easily could have gotten another 6ish hours in over a 48 period of time with ease!
---
it took me few seconds, looked like it was just shitposting.
---
&gt;Feign death has been bugged since I started playing. Sometimes it cancels combat, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, and the freezing trap macro works about 30% of the time.
---
It won't cancel combat if your pet is alive and in combat...
---
Mages can also conjure food/water, so mana regen doesn't cost a load in terms of buying food/water
---
Can you show me 1 case of a innocent player being defamed here.
---
Where can I find a list of neutral monsters to kill?
---
And for the type of people that hardcore abuse it, is massive. I still think some would abandon at 30 days anyway, but it sets more of a precedent. If there's a massive exploit in a later phase if you have the worry of a 6month ban you aren't going to fuck around with anything, compared to just a month
---
#nochanges. It was doomed to happen
---
Don't mix the facts there. While shady behaviour might be better in 5mans than raids, it's still not a good behaviour :)
---
There are nice undead warlocks around? Strange.
---
Yeh seen them live couple times too
---
Well...
---
First they will run out of mana. Then they die.
---
You can tank in your current spec till about 58 and be fine. You can always toss on a shield in furry spec for specific bosses that hit hard.
---
I immediately blacklist the entire guild whenever I get an invite like this.
---
If your PC isn't compatibile Replays can run on 10 fps with frame skips.
---
I mean, that‚Äôs a pretty dick move.
---
Defend yourself against ninja looters how? If you whisper them they ignore you, talking to their GM or posting it on reddit is apparently a witchhunt according to you so how?
---
If you're looking for non-intrusive addons to begin with, you should get:
---
Leatrix Plus (Classic): Adds a LOT of Quality of Life stuff.. you can toggle on/off what you want. https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic
---
OmniCC: Adds convenient timers to your bars.
---
GTFO: Tells you when you're stepping in dangerous stuff and AOE.
---
ClassicCastBars: Self explanatory.
---
Auctioneer: Makes the auction house a bit more extensive. Makes determining the price for things much easier. You scan the market using the addon, and it remembers what the cost of things should be.
---
Mages have more spellpower available, so it is easier mechanically
---
I see you never had a discussion about religious topics
---
'for when i run out of arrows'
---
Found the primadonna mage who's never played Shaman!
---
Oh, my sweet summer child ....
---
Tell that mage to go screw themselves, it's an open world and nobody owns any questing zone.
---
You said "he said in stream if it is an exploit he would stop doing it." He was doing it before under the assumption it wasnt an exploit? Hes not dumb. He just got what he needed, like everyone else.
---
This is not the same thing they are talking about here. This exploit lets you bypass the 5 dungeons per hour aswell as spawning at the last boss again and again. The thing you are talking about is just a nifty way to reset faster.
---
Zearthen? Like Zearthen from US-Thalnos?
---
Now that's what I call a Hunter weapon.
---
If this was a couple of days ago I was there, 
---
Got killed like 7 times trying to leave UC
---
As far as I can tell the bell curve seems to be in the 25-35 range, but the game has actually continued to grow (it feels like) and there is a healthy population behind that curve as well
---
As a warrior my new hobby is to kill hunter and warlock pets. Then just walk away
---
Classic hoarder. In denial and blaming someone else for his habits.
---
How early can I start AoE leveling as a mage?
---
What if he was a mage main since actual vanilla? :,(
---
yes, the third one
---
Fuck
---
He's KOS anyway for being a rogue
---
If you move the slider down to 3 it‚Äôs labeled ‚ÄúClassic.‚Äù 
---
If you want to go for the genuine experience

They will just start win trading
---
lol  I did this with a roll20 game in the badlands.
---
This
---
Try and search for duel strategies. The might find it in the wow head guides, they're really thorough
---
I hope there will be consequences... but I‚Äôm quite surprised this went through the testing phase
---
The pig in Elwynn Forest?
---
I really like the way your character looks btw.
---
Buy a lotto ticket
---
I thought they were fixing it with maintenance tomorrow (not a hotfix)?
---
Sadly, there will be more than 50 people like this.
---
I was expecting couple weekinds of just casually questing with friends before, enjoying nostalgia before getting bored and unsubscribe. I didnt even feel like playing until all my friend staryed playing
---
Now 2 weeks later i am watching tutorials, planning my leveling etc. It is again trying to take control of my life. And i am ENJOYING IT
---
Shhh
---
classic.wowhead.com
---
    Dragonscale ‚Äì This specialization is entirely focused on crafting mail armor. This makes it solely useful for hunters and shamans, with several useful agility recipes that can be made.
---
    Elemental ‚Äì The elemental specialization creates leather armor that is useful for providing elemental resistances. This makes it good for rogues and feral druids.
---
    Tribal ‚Äì This one creates leather armor that is focused on spellcasting. It makes a great choice for caster druids, while also being a decent option for rogues too.
---
&gt;
---
At least you can get into groups if you choose, it's a hard life it here for a solo rogue.
---
You were the mage pvp tutorial level and he failed it.
---
I had Warrgasm until like 37 when it got force changed twice. Shame since I've had that name on retail for like two xpacs
---
"strghtkilla" on Gandling eu, 39 druid. Come gank me it's frankly getting too easy at this point.
---
This is awesome drama !
---
Now I hope all the server will know and not play with those guys for a while. The Beauty of none cross-realm server
---
Selling wins.
---
Ban them, BAN THEM ALL!!
---
*Cackles maniacally*
---
Try better next week casual :&gt;
---
What possible reason could I have for making it up?
---
Can anyone explain what‚Äôs happening here to a non-wow player that just came in from the recommended tab?
---
Reference material on the second screen, and people say its easier to look stuff up.
---
Personally i dont have a two monitor setup at home (second one is my TV when i rarely need two), and honestly alt-tabbing is just as fast for me.
---
I feel like there‚Äôs a subreddit for this but I can‚Äôt remember what I had for dinner much less this information.
---
I think you‚Äôre making a mountain out of a mole hill
---
Plus it gets the quest done faster.
---
Most multiboxing is done with tools, but since you have to pay 5 sub fees it's ok
---
I'm having the same issue and it's god damn annoying. I really hope someone got a fix for this!
---
I just looked up my servers subreddit and it's fucking private. Sigh
---
Enjoy the Adventure not the objective
---
with 10 sec of immunity to CC, having 2 mage frostbolting you won't really change anything.
---
I think mine took me about 74 kills. No big deal.
---
Thanks! I think our highest levels atm are 49-50. We got quite a handful between 40 and 50 though, so it's happening... soon. :-)
---
I'll keep you in mind!
---
This isn't retail. Control your aggro.
---
The Enclave is full of minorities, women, and transexuals. If its good enough for them, then what exactly is your problem?
---
I also do this on my Hunter screw mages.
---
Check the [warrior tanking guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-gear-bis-classic-wow#pre-raid-best-in-slot-gear-for-tank-warriors-phase-1). Warriors have quite a few options, but I wouldn't replace Thrash Blade until Dal Rend/Mirah's Song or Ironfoe, if you get really lucky.
---
As an Orc, you can also prioritize axes (Stratholme UD, LBRS), since the racial adds a lot of value.
---
No I‚Äôm just not familiar with them. I don‚Äôt search too much, no add ons, the most I look up is npc locations when I can‚Äôt find them. 
---
I know about layering, no idea how it works or is being exploited.
---
Thats not how reserving works.
---
If the baby represents my sleep schedule then this is 100% true
---
That's possible, but I would expect to see shadows of the problem, as Blizz *has* been pretty open that they are being judicious with the layers.
---
Is it realy by month? Damn that‚Äôs a lot
---
Does it matter though? Even just phase 1 will last a couple months, and phase two is just DiM and Honor anyway. Im playing a ton (37 atm) but Im also in no rush - been taking my time to mine and smith plenty as well as just explore. There's something like at least 2million players right now, the game isn't going anywhere!
---
"I'll fuckin do it again."
---
Can you give the names? I'm horde but I'm always curious. I tend to discourage my horde fellows to KOS and give people a chance.
---
Except rogues. Fuck rogues. Never seen a rogue be a good person and/or not a ninjalooter needing on every spirit ring or int shoulders we drop.
---
Personal Opinion - AOE Grind spots are PACKED right now. I would just quest.
---
Is anyone else losing just 4 hours at a time when they do a few consecutive dungeons? It's like I've stepped back 15 years and it's amazing.
---
This is why I just run succubus, atleast she does more damage and I think seduce has saved me just as often as sacrifice would. Debating trying a dark pact/phased imp but I think that might feel kinda meh
---
How could that possibly have any relevance since my reddit account is not linked to my wow account lol... But for whatever mental record you're keeping no. It isn't. I just think witch-hunting is cringe as fuck and people should be getting banned for it since it is CLEARLY against the subreddit rules.
---
"mooning someone" is basically showing them your bare ass. So that, pretty much
---
Prices were low in vanilla due to Chinese bot farmers. Fight me
---
39 Druid.... lol 
---
People sitting here commenting like they are some kind of god and they haven't even hit 40 yet.
---
I had a priest in my guild complain about ninja looters and he specifically gave out a name.  I PM'd the dude saying WTF and he said the priest was needing on stuff to DE so they had to change the loot table.  
---
Not implying these guys aren't dicks, but if someone is shaming in /1 or /2 always dig a little deeper and do some research, don't take anyone for face value.
---
wowhead has bis lists by content phases.
---
I've always rolled Hunter and I always focus on agility and stamina. 
---
Depending on your build you could focus on other areas. In my opinion Stamina and Agility are always good areas to focus for hunter whether you are ranged or melee.
---
If you are a melee focus, strength can be another focus for you. Or if you are ranged (like me) intellect is another good focus so that you can use as many specialty shots as you want without worrying about mana drain.
---
6 hours 4 times a day?
---
Let them play how they want to play
---
Warriors also top the DPS meters. You can't have everything
---
Boi*
---
So in the 3 days I was part of the grind I saw 2. Our guild has a total of 6 though. I personally don't see myself tanking Rag or Firemaw and so I don't really care to get one.
---
Whoa, calm down over there.
---
I checked last night (Kurinnaxx Horde) and saw at least fifty 60s online. There‚Äôs a few guilds who seem to be competing for firsts. But yeah, most people are 30-40, highest in my guild is 40.
---
Furry spec? OwO
---
Rogue here aswell only thing that sucks about a rogue is that you absolutely cannot find a group with all the "spellcleave or rav warr" farm dungeon groups.
---
What I mean specifically is see how his spell icons themselves have squared edges and zoomed in? That's different from the default look
---
I don't even know where to begin correcting you here. The fact HS is based on weapon damage is fucking irrelevant when its on next attack. **Adding** X to your weapon damage, is X regardless of the speed of the weapon. In fact, having a faster weapon is actually beneficial for heroic strike, not only can you do it more often if you magically have the rage but also the effective cost is reduced based on the white attack you missed out on.
---
So all in all the fact he didnt say its an instant attack is also irrelevant. Hes wrong no matter which way he meant this. As far as normalisation goes too it may very well reduce the gap but it absolutely categorically does not completelt eliminate it. 
---
The formula is base weapon damage + (X * AP / 3.5) where X depends on weapon type. It does not perfectly damage and often slower weapons still come out on top. This is before I begin to mention that slower weapons also have larger range, meaning the base part of the formula has better potential. Also they have better benefit from windfury if you're horde.
---
Kinda want to try healing in dungeons, but I am torn between priest and druid.
---
Which is easiest to play as a healer? I've never done much dungeons, and when I've done it I've always been dps.
---
On Firemaw the actual inner-room with all the dungeon entrances has minimum 30 horde at any time of day. Its a complete shitfest, I'm very grateful to be a paladin.
---
&gt; Intellect does help mana regen, but not mana increase such as this talent.
---
This is wrong. 1 intellect = 15 mana. And only then is the 5% bonus applied. This means that, for every 10 intellect (to make the math simpler) you get 7,5 mana extra by using the talent. Doesn't seem much, but it does help out more than the shield would, IMHO.
---
Your forgot weeeeeed, man
---
You probably will get banned, but dont panic. Something like like this is not likely to face a permaban. This is an error on their part that does not have a significant impact. If you used it for something like MC or Ony, it might be different due to a lockout timer.
---
Picking one quote out of an hour of discussion doesn't mean anything and it loses all context. Furthermore, you'd be surprised how quickly a GM will get back to you when 40 people submit a ticket at the same time and the issue is being streamed to 20k people. You're just on a streamer hunt.
---
Someone asked op what server this was one and they said Herod. I‚Äôm not some sort of super genius who could figure that out by the picture either!
---
Dude has a need to live his life between leftovers and shit. Only could blame himself.
---
&gt; fangay
---
Jesus, are you 13?
---
As long as everyone is made aware of the rules before they get there I have no issues with it. Players need to know what they're getting into and have the option to stay or leave. If the rule is announced midway through that's a different story and unacceptable. On a lesser scale, I had a group for RFK the other day that didn't tell me it was a Corpsemaker run until they were running back out of the instance after it didn'r drop. They never said anything in advance and I needed the last boss for a quest. Other players don't just exist to get loot for you. People need to know what they're agreeing to when they party up.
---
Why do you feel the need to post it on reddit? assholes will be assholes, /ignore and move on.
---
Ok, fine. You want to know the difference? I'm literally running dungeons to get gear. The only reason I came in the first place was to try get gear that might drop here that I want specifically. If you want that BoE belt that's so good for you, go farm it instead of trying to take the only reason I'm there away from me. "The person in the party that's going to equip it and use it should need it" isn't a trolly stance. It's the expected etiquette. If you want to do something other than the status quo, it's your responsibility to say so before we start and not after you've needed something you won't equip that I am specifically there to get because "everyone needs gold".
---
But maybe this is exactly what he enjoys? Just let them play the game, i'm pretty sure that he knows whether he wants to rush to 60 or not.
---
Tank main here with Tank as name, its ultra hard to lvl as tank but your gonna make billions of friends.
---
Does ur toon bend over...?
---
I‚Äôll be getting frost resist trinket and carrying free action potions with a sole purpose to kill mages because F mages.
---
Bear tanks are excellent for pre raid content, and some early game raid tanking can be done. The real reason why druid tanks never makes it in the end is because they don't have shield block.
---
**A blocked attack can never be crushing blow or a critical hit**, preventing damage spikes to kill the tank and lessens the burden on healers, which is why druid tanks are generally counted out as main tanks. While the extra armor, dodge and hp of a bear helps, it will not outweigh the damage mitigation that the shield block provides.
---
Since the only boss mobs you'll find outside big raids is UBRS, the crushing blows aren't a concern and that makes bear tanks great. I love to heal you guys in dungeons.
---
I am 99.83523% sure that Erva420 is not a bot.

---
It wasnt needed as much in Vanilla due to the server pops--but with the server pops being MUCH larger now and most everyone in the same level range, its hard to do anything else if youre wanting to have people play the game.
---
old mans voice: stay a while and listen!
---
What server? I‚Äôd like to post this to my classic screenshot of the day twitter with your consent later today.
---
It‚Äôs funny among friends but that mentality leaks over into the player base making it harder to get groups. I‚Äôve been rejected from group simply because people expect me to mess up or ninja before I‚Äôve even played with them.
---
Thanks for the in depth explanation. I have a lot of levels to think about what I'll want to do it seems. 
---
After applying my hamstring and rend I usually just kite and apply stacks of sunder / apply overpower when I can. So far so good!
---
Reckful got permanently banned from wow, top guilds get suspensions for exploiting and lose the WF race a decent amount.
---
Great tips thankyou - and thanks for the guide, really helps
---
From my testing I‚Äôve found it more reliable to add the /equipslot 16 part to the end of an attack.. seems to be smoother with regards to GCD.
---
if, for example, the macro chain was Ambush &gt; swap weapon for sword, is there a way to specify to only perform the weapon swap if the ambush was successful? In the same way as using say [nostealth] for the stealth macros?
---
I just cant imagine spending the whole game aoe grinding, especially when single target specd mage is pretty fun and insane dps
---
Well played, but you also missed the line of red yelling text "Herod: BLADES OF LIGHT!"
---
I didn't realize my phrasing left it ambiguous whether I was referring to the boss or the realm, the realm being my intended meaning.
---
Yep, WotF and Hardiness are busted in Vanilla. It's a nice change for me since most of my time playing retail, Humans have had the best racial by far.
---
Curious as to why you after against collections.
---
Today had a mage need the staff from the hound boss in Lib that ONLY gives +atk power to beasts because ‚Äúit‚Äôs better than my crescent staff‚Äù. Thank god he lost the roll on illusionary rod
---
I had the problem as well, seems like a known issue:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/fishing-broken/285373
---
Their tech can handle it just fine. It's the gameplay that can't handle it. Layering will be turned off for P2. The only evidence you need is that they've already started offering free transfers off the highest pop realms. Incentives like this will continue until server pops drop to reasonable levels, then the caps will be lowered to the intended level (which Blizzard has said is still far higher than Vanilla server caps) and queues will return for any server still with too many players. 
---
Blizzard is more likely to delay P2 than to enter it with layering enabled.
---
Lmfao good idea
---
If you think the comment youre responding to wasnt sarcastic, you may need to step away from the computer lol
---
Instructions unclear, pooped the delivery guy and at the desk.
---
mages don‚Äôt group up. They are farming for loot they want it all to themselves.
---
Thanks for the tip I had no idea!
---
Okay but new players may not know that, and it‚Äôs not exactly some evil perma bannable offense if you stumble across it and take advantage in the moment. Maybe you‚Äôre mr white knight do no wrong the id say a good deal of people would realize it‚Äôs a bug in a game and not a big deal and take advantage in the right situation. Now obviously all assumption.
---
What does the /s mean
---
Congrats you just stopped people joking about serious topics forever . 
---
Cry me a river
---
Pro tip: You're a priest - put 1 point into holy nova and group with a mage and you too can get great xp, no saltiness required!
---
I'm running dungeons to get gear, too. Hence taking that BoE and turning it into gear. Try again.
---
- Run 5/10 mans for the best non-raid gear you can get
---
- Professions
---
- Faction rep 
---
- World PvP
---
- Battleground PvP (and BG faction/Honour rep rewards) in later phases.
---
Or give thought to this: find a raiding guild that takes casuals and find a way to contribute, for example provision of materials from your professions (Herb/Alch is best for this) or helping their members farm gold or items needed for raids.
---
While this comes with little to no payoff in the immediate term, find the right guild for it and they will likely be willing to include you in raids they've got on farm status when you *do* have time in order to gear you up a bit.
---
&gt;This has absolutely ruined the economy and it‚Äôll never recover! No I won‚Äôt provide proof or data, I will only tell you how I feel. And Classic is DEAD‚Äù is not fine. Its shortsighted and ignorant.
---
That's not very different from saying "the economy is not ruined and I don't have to provide any proof or data" though? It's difficult to determine the impact on the economy that some of the exploits may have, but it's undeniable that some individuals have made a lot of gold with this. They haven't farmed "1000 arcane crystals", but they surely have farmed lots of Felcloth using layering and level 1 characters with auto-invite.
---
&gt; But is it only a pipe dream?
---
Pretty much.
---
Most you can really hope to do is annoy people. 
---
&gt; Is paladin a better option for a PVP oriented shield user?
---
If you want to heal, yes.
---
You mean Ice Barrier
---
Yeah on this subreddit.
---
Where we talk about a video game. Where being defamed have ZERO repercussions for your REAL life.
---
Show me a couple of those please.
---
Also world is not a global channel, it's private that people think is global.
---
Dumb mages shouldn't stop you from being a good one!
---
Is this the bug where you can reset an instance while still inside to get the bosses to spawn? I did once on accident trying to reset instance leave and then getting invitied to a new party and seeing the boss respawn.
---
My guess would be every server, ever.
---
Right? i play horde, but bragging about killing alliance is pretty sad when basically every server has huge horde advantage.
---
They really need to change the way it works, it should auto accept previous quest and start the next one if you are within 50 yards. so many times someone accept the new one right away (maybe addon?) and then the rest dont get the quest.
---
A vast majority of players will not have the gold for their epic mount when they hit 60. Most won't have the gold even weeks or months after hitting 60. Your epic mount is a personal achievement that you have to make a conscious effort to work for. Don't expect it any time soon.
---
And the poster you're responding to isn't disputing that. They're just saying it's not their job to heal the mages so they can AOE grind an area.
---
15k queues are down to 3k, population is already dropping.
---
I mean, there are many retards like you out there who doesn't understand a little class bashing. This post is designed to bash on mages which is fun. I bash on rogues, which I find fun.
---
Only if you take your clothes off for a living
---
What servers are y'all on? On mine I rarely even see people doing spellcleave and it's simple to just get a normal group.
---
I try to stay away from quest spots when aoe farming but I never refuse a group invite if somebody needs kill x of whatever I‚Äôm farming.
---
Well, mages are indeed overpowered as balls. This is just something we're gonna have to live with. As a hunter main I've started struggling to get groups because people often just want 3 mages in their 5 mans, and while thats conceptually boring, it is extremely effective sadly.
---
Atleast we can look forward to TBC, which should atleast do something to mitigate it if the community itself doesn't.
---
I love that people are downvoting you for needing OS gear for leveling as healer, but upvoting the tank who did the same thing.
---
Ehhh warrior with a good advantage will roflstomp you.
---
If he's killing your pet first chances are he has a solid advantage.
---
i agree with some of you post but you didn't quite get what i'm trying to say yet.
---
&gt;  If I am following what you are saying I would basically have to sell Felstriker for vendor gold because ‚ÄúI have mount higher on the prio and my current weapon works good enough‚Äù
---
this concept doesn't work with bop items because you can't sell them to other players. with a boe item it is worth what the market price, whether you equip it or sell it doesn't matter. you don't lose anything (except for a little time selling/buying and i don't think that's enough of a reason for anyone to claim priority on a valuable item) from selling it when you have more important things to buy and buying another when you have got to taht point in your shopping list.
---
bop items are completely different. their value to players who don't have them is way higher than the vendor price, if felstriker were 5g or whatever the vendor price is on the auction house then every rogue and warrior would have one. the value comes from being time intensive to acquire, people spend hours upon hours doing ubrs runs for felstriker so the actual value of the item in the eyes of those players is in the houndreds or probably thousands of gold when looking at the opportunity cost of time wasted in ubrs that could otherwise be spent farming gold. 
---
i know that most players don't optimize their ingame time/gold economy to the max, i certainly don't, but some basic economic thinking is still far from capitalist ideology.
---
What realm? I would love to join just to be apart of this. No one in my guild on kurinaxx likes to fish :/
---
Lmao this has me cracking up so much for some reason.
---
What addon is the scrolling text. I've been looking for a good one for so long. Please.
---
This is correct
---
In arugal server,I always see the Lfg chat that people are spamming aoe farm. I myself is a lv 30 combat rogue alliance. I feels like I might not get into a dungeon group in future because rogue have weak aoe dps. Am I right? What if people only want aoe dmg in dungeon and not the rest
---
Totally with you OP. People in Thai thread just can't seem to comprehend that not everyone is trustworthy and you can't form an opinion of someone over a screenshot. Bravo.
---
It makes me not interested.
---
So relaxed you couldn't just swallow your pride and move on like everyone else
---
If I was on a server where it is just impossible to find a good group for a specific dungeon, I would be forced to accept these terms or I would not be going on the dungeon.  If I pass on them, I might be sitting there waiting even longer to find another group.  There will be a time in the future where certain dungeons will be nearly impossible to find a group because so many will be beyond it and alts might be too spread out, who knows?
---
Nowadays with Classic currently there are enough players that I would first ask the group if there is anything on reserve, or I would mention that I am solely after a specific piece of gear.  If anyone didn't like that, no problem, I would drop out and would be replaced within seconds.
---
However! This (understandable) line of thinking is how wolves and other apex predators became extinct in the lower 48 United States.
---
There's an addon called Tracking Eye (i think) that puts all your tracking skills in one button on the mini map. That's helped me loads.
---
a-mario!
---
Can you link me what build youre using?
---
Guy, you literally put way to much effort into that reply. I find it amazing that the image to be a joke, but my comment is taken literal. This sub cracks me up sometimes.
---
&gt;what? you can buy bigger bags at vendors
---
Man I ain't got the gold for that (I assume -- how much do these bags cost?)
---
&gt;also how do you run out of space so often? every quest has you go back to a city
---
Do you just do 1 quest at a time? Because I do like 2-4 before going back to the hub and that can definitely fill your bags with vendor trash.
---
at least its not this https://i.imgur.com/LMryLv6.jpg
---
Source for 50-50? Nearly every realm has 60%+ horde. Only a few rare ones where there is like 70% alliance

Close youtube and log in for once

Mages are the new hunter bro, didnt you hear, prepare for more insults.
---
Oh, now everyone countering his double down is a ‚Äúnerd‚Äù. Chill out dude - you‚Äôre not giving yourself a good reputation.
---
Theres pve servers for that
---
Thats not gatekeeping
---
Are you on a local server? I've seen these kind of issues with connecting to remote servers.
---
got a lot of good memories from hinterlands.  quested with a friend there on what turned out to be my first max level toon.
---
You too, man.
---
Yeah it's great that you derive satisfaction and entertainment from it. Idc. Literally no one does. It's against the subreddits rules for a reason. Like. In. Every. Other. Gaming. Subreddit. Wow, who would have thought a game subreddit like WoW could use an anti-witch-hunting rule?
---
I saw this happen at Mara, didnt realise it was a bug but I was trying to leave the instance whilst also finding a new group.
---
Hahaha lol got me
---
SHAME SHAME SHAME
---
lol
---
Can someone please tell me what UI this is? Its so nice!
---
I actually like SFK, it's a fun dungeon and I had wanted to do it.  What happened is I just leveled right past it.  Perhaps it's in an awkward level range where there's plenty of other stuff to do and people skip past it.  Plus as you said, it's not easy to get too for a low level Alliance
---
All are viable and will be taken just for the buffs they provide. But if you want to be the best all around healer than Priest is the best option
---
Haha I think you‚Äôre the one taking my comment too seriously.
---
As a mage this is Not a mage problem. Those people would be Dbags no matter what class they rolled.
---
Most mages will invite you to group if they see you questing in their AOE spot. It takes like two pulls then you are done and gone the mage can keep blasting.
---
I‚Äôm a fishing noob so be gentle. Do I have to right click the hook when it jiggles or can I use a keyboard command to reel it in? For some reason I am really bad at clicking in the right place at the right time and I‚Äôm losing lots of fish.
---
This whole Blizzard Redemption Arc is great.
---
0.16477% chance /u/Erva420, that's pretty high.
---
I really have no idea what you are talking about, I play on a German Realm.
---
I went on Friday and it was really busy outside was even alliance there as well on Noggenfogger
---
Warriors are extremely gear dependent in a way that other classes just are not. Add to that the fact that they are a PITA to level and well you know the rest. Is it right for them to do things like what happened to the OP, no. Should they be more concerned with gear than other classes, yes.
---
The only people I put on my ignored list are ninjas or people who don't understand need vs greed.  
---
That way I never have to remember why they are on my ignored list. 
---
Messing with loot is permanent, but if they are griefer or shity at their class, that can be delt with without serious incidents.
---
Classic shaman is great. Mana efficiency is a bust but if you find just the right speed you can do any of the 3 dungeon roles with little down time.
---
Yes, if they are 10 lvls lower than you or you are still lvl 30-40.
---
I use the Questie addon, it's been great! It shows on the map which quests are available to you, and it will show them in colour coordination based on the in-game quest log. So its accurate as to whether you should quest there or not.
---
hater blockers
---
Thanks for the advice!! I've been prioritizing Agility, Strong and Stamina but I've been adding some spirit here and there. I have first aid nearly mastered so I haven't had too much issue with my regen, but I've definitely noticed how much it helps.
---
I understand your POV but it's seem a lot of headache for few seconds at the start of the dungeon. People don't get mad???
---
Well the thing is I have a free realm transfer to heartseeker. If I was going to start over and re roll from lvl 1 then I wouldn‚Äôt go heartseeker
---
They might perma ban the acct but they wont stop them from making a new one. They dont want to lose money.
---
&gt;Also human females have bigger weapon models!
---
Also known as traps.
---
You have it Harder vs undeads that‚Äôs a fact. Undead is the most played horde race. Ofcourse deathcoil can help you but that won‚Äôt change all the situation where it can‚Äôt
---
No, it absolutely doesn't. Don't want to play by his rules in HIS Group? don't join it, simple as that! Him having this rule isn't adversely effecting you UNLESS you join his group. Imagine that.
---
When it's resisted, I get a message on screen that says so. My character still flops to the ground. A lot of times, when I use it, nothing happens at all besides the mana being used and it going on cooldown. I always make sure to stop what I'm doing and don't move at all when I use the ability, so I'm not sure what's going on. I am a noob though. Perhaps it's being resisted, but there's a visual bug.
---
&gt; This is the market that layering will affect the most. Devilsaurs and other open world 'rares' are VASTLY inflated. 
---
If devilsaur leather is abundant due to people abusing layering then the price gets deflated not inflated.
---
mages are fotm scum retards and should be griefed at every opportunity

Hope and Faith are infinitely better names than ‚ÄúFine‚Äù.

Stranglethorn vale, the northern part with a bunch of quests that start in bootybay/rebel camp/nesingwary camp.
---
Desolace.
---
Southshore.
---
Maybe a few quest in Arathi highlands.
---
Alternatively if you don‚Äôt like any of those zones just find a group to spam scarlet dungeons with.
---
on what server are you playing?
---
&gt; Thats very stupid of you  
---
&gt; Thats 
---
GLASS HOUSES
---
My tank gear is all plate. My dps gear has a lot of leather mixed in
---
Cats &amp; Hunters too.
---
False.
---
IMO it's ok if it's not possible to collect every single thing in this game. are you having all possible pets IRL at home? choose one, get a connection to it and stay with it, thats what i prefer :D
---
As a mage I don't do aoe grinding because A I want to enjoy questing B don't want to be a dick  to people who need the mobs C I'm not very good at it and most importantly D my isp is dicking me over causing lag spikes. Point of my post is obviously dicks everywhere doing dick things don't be a dick.
---
Difference between looking for a needle in a heystack and in a bowl with hey.
---
I mean..... wasn't the the entire point of server community? Be as much of a jerk as you want..... you'll just develop a rep and then people will know not to group with you (or keep you on the short leash by not letting you be group leader).
---
I feel for OP but i also understand this will all sorta...... resolve itself long term?
---
It‚Äôs not that much work to redo the UI to be just a free server transfer button... we are talking like one hour of work tops for a software dev.
---
Shift-clicking their name in the chat window should bring up a basic bit of information about them.
---
Nah really long conversations role-playing or actually doing effort for it or searching it aren't my thing.
---
But the spontaneous light rp from time to time is something that makes the game feel more alive and makes the community feel more tightly knitted.
---
Rping all the time isn't my thing and I think in these early stages that people are still more friendly and helpful and talkative.
---
In retail however I think rp realm is the best chance you have to find something remotely similar to the people in classic right now.
---
But knowing blizzard chances are they'll screw this up aswell so better enjoy it while it lasts. :)
---
I thought he deleted his character? I don't keep up with twitch streamers.
---
hum i'm not the type of player who spam multiple key at once, I just press the button right on time for it or as soon as I can. 
---
I'm not quite sure about what your question is for so I will answer for the 2 ways I understood your question :
---
If your problem is that you want to press multiple thumb button at once on your mouse, it's not really confortable to spam multiple but doable I think.  Or you can totaly make macro or just bind your 3 or 4 keys abilities to 1-4 on your KB and bind your 4 first mouse button to 1-4 too, so you can either use the mouse button or the KB bind. 
---
You can bind whatever keyboard button to your mouse button. Mouse with 12buttons are not usually special buttons but more like deported keyboard button.
---
If your problem is that you don't want to press multiple button and are affraid of doing so, then it's depend of the mouse. For exemple, it's really hard to miss the right button on my scimitar but on my naga it was easy to missclick.
---
Interesting thing happened to me with this gun.
---
During tbc I was about 12 and had a friend in my guild who was a good bit older than me, he acted as a kind of mentor for me as I had no idea what I was doing. He helped me install addons because I couldn't figure it out, he added me on MSN for this.
---
When I reached Tanaris after a long time leveling, I remember he whispered me and said 'I have a president for you'. (his English wasn't perfect, but it wasn't horrible) so I partied up with him and he found me out in Tanaris, shooting scorpids with a white bow.
---
He traded the weapon to me, I didn't understand the stats, I just new purple meant good! I thanked and thanked and thanked him, and he told me to take the weapon out for a spin.
---
Now, here you may be thinking 'ah that was a nice thing to do' and yes, it was, but over the next few weeks, I was sent really inappropriate photos over MSN by him, including a photo of his own penis.
---
I ended up keeping this as a secret because well, he gave me an epic and I was an innocent kid who didn't really fully grasp what was potentially going on. I stopped talking to him after this. 
---
It's only in recent years that I kind of managed to connect the dots, I feel like he may of been grooming me.
---
Sick gun tho
---
either here or r/gaming
---
and I know for a fact r/gaming wont even glance at text posts
---
Not everyone is rushing to 60. It doesn't excuse people like that
---
With 3 monitors, I'm having a blast. I do have a nice cheat sheet I can share.
---
Great work! I'd probably suggest adding a new sorting option to filter by most recents macros. It would help people regularly checking your webapp for newest macros they wouldn't even think about.
---
There's also something really troubling me with using a "Play" icon as a "Go to" arrow, but that's just me.
---
What backend tech are you using by the way?
---
...even if this analogy is correct (it isn't, because you don't own Classic), that would still not be OK. It could potentially get you into a lot of trouble with someone who's looking for that cash, be it criminal elements or the cops. And the fault for whatever consequences still lies with you.
---
If a warlock is going to tap himself that low, he needs to also know that it's his responsibility to not pull aggro or get hit by AoE.
---
He can't die if he doesn't get hit.
---
Heal him with spare cycles, observe the 5 second rule. He can be healed when the tank is full.
---
There's a lot of newcomers to the game that are rolling lock, it is not an easy or simple class, in time they'll learn their place.
---
Swim form is a deviate delight fish.
---
I badly want Classic+ but for me that includes somewhat looking at balancing different class talent trees better.
---
I think one if the bigger problems with a Classic+ is everyone has a different view on what that should mean. Even now with Classic you have people complaining Blizzard went with the "easy" patch.
---
ummm alot of horde run gnomeregan. We literally get a quest that gives us a transponder that ports us to the instance. I see groups constantly.
---
BoE epics. Everyone rolls need
---
You obviously don't know what you are talking about.
---
Do addons work for both windows and mac, or are there unique addons just for mac users?
---
Unfortunately fear bomb wouldnt have done anything there (undead mobs), though the buffing might have lol
---
Auctioneer and TSM both have incorrect DE values -- mostly because the data was originally collected via crowd-sourcing and is not accurate.
---
There's talk over in the WoWEconomy discord about it off and on for the last few weeks.
---
it doesnt reset your swing timer right?
---
To be fair, the Undead are just in an alliance of convenience with the Horde.
---
They‚Äôve said there are only a single digit amount of layers. So at most ~800 people in your example
---
I'm just past 7 days myself. I've spent 1/3rs of my life on wow classic since it came out. I didn't have any time off work either.  Hope my wife forgives me. 
---
I'm only 52.. so will probably slow down a bit after this week. 60 in under a month was the goal and it looks like I'm going to hit it!
---
Priest healer here. Ran with 3 shamans in SM yesterday and it went smooth. As far as our group went we just dropped many WF totem and bounced the aggro around us like a pinball. Wasnt hard to heal, mostly doing dps. Im a healer and I approve this tank.
---
Interesting. Not sure I will ever really get it, but still interesting. Seems you've at least found some good sources for your obvious interest.
---
Also this is just hilariously 2019.:
---
&gt; TLDR News
---
Can't help but laugh a bit, however good it might be.
---
Just you wait til you reach Hillsbrad
---
I'm not a developper, but I'm guessing it's a coding thing and was never intentionally added to dungeons.
---
I had a forced name change once during WotLK. I had an undead mage from vanilla all the way to LK named Rottencrotch. Around 75 they made me change my name. I made it to 77 before I quit playing him. Pretty sure he still hasn't made it to 80. I had a hunter named Jager (and regularly ran with a pet called Meister). They made me change that one, too. It doesn't take much to trigger a forced name change.
---
Literally the perfect analogy for this.  Esfand knew something was up and contacted a GM to see how he should proceed.  The people who did this and got countless BOE drops, patterns / plans / recipes &amp; made thousands of gold off the exploits should 100% be at least temp banned and rolled back.
---
The issue comes with the gear that was sold for that money.  So players out there who paid for these items from the exploiters now have the ill-gotten gains.
---
Those drinks are terrible. But as a non mage free drinks are better than paid if I can help it.
---
There's 2-3 horde guilds that have cleared MC already on this server. It should be quite easy to find a serious guild.
---
There is a big difference between editing game files to change the in game performance and abusing something Blizzard lazily allowed into their client.
---
At level 27 you can buy the level 25 water or make it. Of course using water 12 levels below you is going to take a while. You should be able to learn the conjure new water at the 5s of every ten levels.
---
I also see mages refusing to use their wand until they are completely oom. You can use it at 50% and let the five second rule start ticking to help with regen.
---
Why can instances have layers? I get the main game world but why would it need to be on for instanced content?
---
Aoe grinding and rude behavior aside, why not group with the mages?
---
It's over Alliance...I have the high ground!
---
My 2019 version of this is to use my phone or ipad as second screen for reference material.
---
On the flip side, the drops on personal loot are always usable by your spec.
---
Wow they are pulling this over Scarlet Monastery loot? LOL.
---
Agreed. Sure, players should know it wasn't intended to be used like that but when it's something so basic and easy to exploit they should just do a reset and be done with it. 
---
Same with the layering/reset exploits, Blizz should have seen this coming a mile away. Nothing complicated about it, just inviting people/leaving groups. 
---
The AQ bypass was a little different because people were actually editing client side files.
---
&gt;there are items from raids, quests etc which shouldn't be available at the moment but are.
---
I am not following what you are saying here.  ClassicWowhead has its BiS lists broken down by phases. We are in phase 1.
---
What items shouldn't be available that are?
---
Hello, as a rogue on private servers i pickpocketed RFD(razorfen downs) and grabbed the Grave moss there. But this time around grave moss isn't as useful yet because some instances forgrave moss potions(forget the pot name)haven't opened up yet.
---
Yeah, but like the other guy said very few people actually know about it.
---
I've healed for a long time.  I'm open to other points of view, but generally I say fuck 'em and let them die. It's their job to manage their aggro, mana, and health while dealing as much damage as possible.  It's your job to keep the tank alive. If you can spare the mana to toss a few heals at them, great, but no one should expect it and anyone who does is an asshole you should not play with again.
---
They got approval from a GM which doesnt really have authority in this matter.
---
Thank you so much. Got it looking the way I want now
---
Is this going to be considered not an RP name for a guild though?
---
Every time that i see that poor squirrel in the cage with that stupid human screaming close to that poor creature i think the same thing.
---
He sucks to look at. How does he have a career in the being looked at industry?
---
Fuck me, I can't wait for end of Classic gear. Spriest is going to be so rage inducing. The QQ threads on reddit will fuel my resolve.
---
Quest rewards and dungeon runs *should* keep your gear to a level where it isn't crippling.
---
That said, if you're shit out of luck and haven't hit a decent quest reward or dungeon drop in a long time, it might be advisable to look on the AH.
---
Just bear in mind that between skills and needing a mount at level 40, the more often you spend money on the AH pre-40 the less likely it is you'll get your mount at level 40.
---
That's not necessarily the end of the world, though.
---
I am horde on krom crush and never seen it. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 58 but not once did I see invite to later spam
---
Shazzrah, but I guess it happens everywhere \^\^   
---
I think we battled for over an hour :P
---
I disagree. They most likely keep logs of significant instances, along with character snap shots. So rolling back these toons to pre-exploit runs, and you just wasted a HUGE amount of the players time(raid mats, time in raid, wipe recovery).  Add on another 72 hours, just to rub salt in their wounds.
---
The goal is to get the player to behave (closer) to how they should, and retain the revenue stream for Blizz.
---
The goal (should be) for every player is to pursue any advantage they can. So the lines can get blurred, which should be taking into consideration. Perma banning is a little over the top when there are other avenues to restore balance.
---
I dont likenyou after this post. Ive havent had taco bell in 10 years
---
Most people level past it so they can start SM asap.
---
I love this kind of humour! I tried to do an airline speech like "thank you for choosing dungeon 2468 headed to the end of shadowfang keep. Please keep all pets and their taunts off till we are safely landed. We know you don't have much of a choice with who you dungeon with but thanks for choosing us. There is no Mage so unfortunately food and beverage service is suspended for this dungeon"and no one laughed. I chuckled alone at lease
---
Just don't heal Warlocks who tap excessively. I usually have to remind the healer that he or she doesn't have to heal me constantly after tapping.

You can block guild invites in your settings. I'm not sure if that works in Classic but in Retail the addon checks first if you blocked guild invites. If you did, it won't message you.

I ran into a buddy in loch modan the other day questing. We both didnt realize each other was online and it was quite a nice surprise. We ended up finishing the zone together before running Deadmines. I love this game.
---
Does threat modifiers like defensive stance include dmg of dots put on the target while in another stance?
---
If I rend and wound while in battle stance then switch to defensive stance. Does the dmg ticks get the 30% extra threat from defensive stance?
---
Getting a group and knocking out all the Arathi quests you can do is awesome. That's what I did until around half the xp bar, then went and did SM until I leveled. breezed through 33-37 that way, and got great gear in the process (so important for a warrior)
---
Most of my friends seem to be in the 7-9 days /played range. If you're not going crazy fast I think that's probably close to average.

100-120 hours would be pretty nuts pace. Like, speed running/racing basically.

Stop undercutting from 72g to 32g. Thats a hell of a start.  Its just some retard that wants to get his shit sold fast. Instead of getting value.  
---
Its like diamonds. Shit isnt rare - not even almost rare.  But its a controlled market so people save half a years sallary for a mineral.

I second this, kromcrush! We also have a really good horse to alliance ratio hovering just around 50/50

You have to make sure you have 5/5 talent points into Yiffing, but the amount of aggro you pull in furry spec is pretty ridic.

So first time playing mage and getting into contested zones for pvp. Anyone got any advice for going against priests? They‚Äôve been kicking my ass hard.
---
I'm a Ret Paladin who wears hand-me-down Int gear for healing dungeons and my mana pool is consistently 1k higher than what my water restores.
---
its not against the current blizzard wow TOS, so noone will get banned
---
If you shift click someone's name is chat it will show you their Race/Class, Level, and how many are in their party. No plug in needed.
---
I think you mean /cast
---
Unless I'm mistaken /use is for items.
---
I  am sure that even on PVE servers people will be flagged in PVP to get those sweet ranks, it just wont be AS common as PVP servers, I also forsee a lot of FP camping
---
As an aside, what makes them #1 to be exact? I hear about them melting faces all day but haven‚Äôt seen them in action.
---
You must be new to classic
---
I don't see your argument. It's a feature of the game. They made no system preventing your so called "abuse/exploit". You're the wrong one here, sorry bud.
---
Yeah, who knew developing a game with so many influential facets was so hard. Sometimes people can be so ignorant and think the devs can foresee every possible thing that can go wrong. They‚Äôre people too and so far I think it‚Äôs going fantastically.
---
Immune to wand and spells on my priest. Not sure on physical ranged attacks though.
---
I've got 5 days played on kurinaxxx and being a night time eastern weekend player I find it nice being on Pacific because I can do bosses and questing in quiet hours after work and insta find group during peak hours
---
I try inviting people to groups to help with things like that
---
The loot-setting can be changed at any time (even mid-fight, although I don‚Äôt know how that affects loot distribution). Looks like it was changed before the final boss fight, in this case. So, basically, the group leader used this person to help clear the dungeon for him.
---
Holy jesus those numbers on Wyrmthalak
---
My Man
---
I've personally never done anything like this, I just don't have a problem with it. To be completely honest, if someone tried this with some loot I wanted, I'd pass and leave the group, no harm no foul. Everyone's time is valuable. If you want to maximize it this way, don't let me stand in your way. I won't waste yours and you won't waste mine.
---
Server is dead
---
I ran into that a lot recently, in Dustwallow and the Mastery quests in STV.  Each time I've tried to group with them, but get declined, I assume because they don't want to 'split the XP'.
---
YOU TOLD ME THIS WAS REGULAR. COFFEE.
---
Should i worry with my Troll being named Mynuts? :))
---
Not to mention that layering only exists because they decided to pinch pennies on servers. They could have just opened as many as were needed and merged the ones that die out. This is a company known for it's cloud computing investments. It was well within their means.
---
But, some dipshit managers decided "nah, classic is gonna be no big deal. Just open like 3 east coast servers, should be fine".
---
And here we are.

Place the player on your ignore list if you want to keep the guild invites open but not receive his

Just wanna say very few mages have tried to 1v1 or gank me. I think we both fully understand it‚Äôs because I have absolutely 0% chance of winning.
---
Shout out arugal UD mageboys
---
Paladin are a very tough cookie to crack on 1v1 pvp
---
Currently on a pacific server living on east coast. Haven‚Äôt had any issues. Minor lag occasionally but nothing out of the norm.
---
Well I'm a gnome warrior so I just hit my racial skill for the inevitable cc.  As long as I get my hamstring off before the blink its over for the mage.
---
How do you think "go to retail" was said reliably?
---
Rebrand a PVP server to PVE?
---
You must be trolling
---
Yeah I kinda figured it was one of those situations. For the burst I‚Äôve been doing frost nova + cone of gold and fire blast. Then using frost reset to do it again. (Have the increased crit on frozen and starting to put talents for more cone of cold damage) is that the optimal burst rotation? 
---
Also, should I even bother trying to get a full rank Frostbolt out? They usually just wand me to slow the casting and let the dot skills kill me.
---
Not much of an end game atm.
---
Once Dire Maul is released.
---
Sweet!  I'm going farming today then.  Should be easier at 37 than it was at 32 lol...I just wanted that pole before.
---
&gt; No they are not an omnipotent force. 
---
Blizzard doesn't have to answer to anyone. They are the only people with the power to change the rules of the game. They can listen to their player base if they know what's best for them, but they certainly don't have to. Players have influence, not power.  Use you brain a bit.
---
&gt; In the end you cannot catch them all without banning them all, but then  you will hit many innocent people with a wide ban like that. 
---
So you agree with me then? You do realize that my original point was that Blizzard should not ban anyone right? Your entire second paragraph is in agreement with me.
---
go to a contested area such as STV.type in  /pvp
---
hopefully an other faction person does this as well, and you can now bash each other
---
If I can't get a group I guess I'll just run through this daggerspine
---
i don't know but, i will not bend that rule xD
---
When u get on twitch, u click the mods button on the top. Then u will click wow, and from there u will click on get more mods, and then just type in the search bar what ur looking for. And install, they will be loaded onto wow the next time u log in... Get on twitch every couple days, to just make sure that they stay updated. And to check to make sure u have them on in wow, in the character screen on the bottom left u will see a button for mods, and can see which ones are checked that will load into the game when u log on.
---
ah, okey, throw works :)
---
And yesterday you were probably saying "there's no evidence that this layering abuse even exists. Trust Blizzard guys".
---
Mage - Counterspell their HOLY school, not shadow. If you CS shadow they will just heal up and outlast you while their dots tick. If you CS holy they will be able to damage you but you might have chance at bursting them before they do
---
Priest - Dispel is godly, especially against PW:S and Renew. Silence and Fear really help too
---
Hunter - Save your pet stun/interrupt for when they're around 50% health, or just LoS them while your pet eats them alive. If they try to heal just punish with Serpent and Auto while they're on GCD
---
Shaman - Bane of priests. Purge, low CD interrupt, bursty damage, Tremor Totem. Priests never stood a chance.
---
Rogue - Pick your encounters, use Kick and Gouge
---
Agreed, but it's a point you could spend elsewhere at the cost of losing 1 or 2 ticks of your blizzard probably. I haven't needed that 3rd point so far, and I've done way more not-aoe than aoe so far in game.
---
Your sir, have zeroed in on the heart of the matter! It's hard to believe anything that we're told at this point.
---
You'll be down voted to oblivion but that doesn't make you wrong.
---
Vanilla was full of little wrenches like this, Pallies become super useful once you start fighting undead, priests' best damage mitigation ability can't really be used on the only viable end game tank, there's inconsistencies all over, it's part of what makes it great.
---
You‚Äôre good
---
They're interchangeable and /use worked on rank 1.
---
That's from Paladin players who don't have to buy their mount
---
...yeah
---
Step 1 : Form a raid group.
---
Step 2 : Raid a capital city.
---
Step 3 : ???
---
Step 4 : Profit.
---
Back at vanilla it was more of a pragmatic decision by blizzard to balance the faction population instead of a coherent narrative design because let's face it, thematically they don't fit at all. Without forsaken the ratio would be heavily skewed towards alliance.
---
Back at vanilla I was so adamant that forsaken were #notmyhorde. But this time around has more or less been accepted as canon, especially after all the other dubious narrative choices and god-awful writing by blizzard.
---
Christ, it's literally like a Super Mario 1 warp pipe
---
Very awkwardly, you need to find people of the opposing faction that have flagged for PvP in order to get honor.  It is not unlikely that you will see guilds from both sides organizing planned battles in order to get honor for themselves.
---
I had a dude give me 25s for a whole inventory of water when I was questing in Hillsbrad. He was the kindest person I have found so far. I think out of the 50 or so times I've given out water, I've been tipped 5 times. Thats okay though, I enjoy helping. a simple /hug or /thanks is all I want.
---
Not saying you were wrong, you were not. Leaving is always the best course if you feel you are not happy with the deal.
---
Now, did you talk to them before leaving? Saying something like:
---
"That's a nice upgrade for me to, was hoping on getting it, if you want it then I'll have to find another group that doesn't, sorry." 
---
And then see what their responses would be?
---
What about Shamans? They eat priests alive.
---
Fair enough, it just sorta seemed like you were "that guy" :)
---
I tried that twice and got declined because they didn't want to split the XP.  /shrug
---
So I know there's an addon called Spy that let's you "blacklist" enemy players, but is there something similar for players of your own faction? I know there's am ignore function but I'm not a fan of that since that males it so you don't see *anything* they write *ever* which can lead to some confusing moments. I'd much rather have a simple list ingame that reminds me not to trade with the asshat that ninjalooted or insulted me two months ago.
---
'it will be well worth it'
---
Spoiler: it isn't.
---
Because it's there. You know that gamers inherently want whatever is the "best". And that being said, I said BiS, but really it's BiS for melee, and even then there's a ton of flexibility depending on what you're fighting.
---
Nah, just for science
---
"People like you", come on dude. The majority of wow players believe in rolling for very expensive things, such as some blue items and all epic items basically.
---
I bet you're all for only you needing blue items until a twink item drops that you can't use. Suddenly everyone should need.
---
I hope I get a chance to ninja loot you, ez prey üòò
---
Agreed. And while progress may be slower from the outside, when you're done, you've got 5 characters ready to roll at any point. Any classes you want and no need to sit around and level alts.
---
Yes it does so don't use Shield on a tank unless he's about to die. Save it for DPS taking aggro, casters especially so it doesn't interrupt their casting. Don't waste mana on Renew unless your tank is taking heavy damage and don't bother topping them off unless you have a ton of mana and can waste it. Otherwise wait until he's 50% or so and you can use a max rank (or close to it) Heal without overhealing. Then you can sit and wand for a bit while your mana regens. You will have a ton of mana and not have to heal very often.
---
I love how everyone keeps shouting this at Hunters like we're not aware.
---
That's not the issue.
---
Waiting for them to think it's safe each time and then ganking them maximizes demoralization.
---
Wouldn't the absolute worst case scenario be a 100-0 split?
---
You have a 3 minute cooldown and chain lightning, we all now. They have decent burst every 3 minutes. The rest of the time, they are just sitting ducks without any useful CC tools or things of that nature.
---
Don‚Äôt upgrade it save ur mney
---
Sure it does. Its the same exploit that gives him an advantage over other players in a direct violation of the ToS. 
---
 Strat or Gnomer its the same thing and should result in a ban of at least a few months and revoking of their earnings.
---
i'd go with \*minimal but I like it. sign me up.
---
Sort of. PvP servers you have party's raids of higher leveling coming to low level zones just to kill players who can't defend against them but you also have those random 1v1 encounters and sometimes 2v1 or 3v1 and everything in between. 
---
I had my first 1v1 experience yesterday while doing zerker quest. Orc came up and tried killing me in the middle of my bout on the grate I killed him and then finished the quest
---
&gt; First, it's the difference between having 50% mana and 52.5% mana after you end casting
---
This is obvious math though. Since spells use an absolute instead of a relative amount of mana, if you cast 2 bolts and a shock with your mana for (fictive number) 200 mana, that's 50% of a 400 mana mana pool. If you add 5% to that pool, you still have that 5% after the fight, along with the 200 mana you already had, meaning you're at 205/400 instead. This adds up with every subsequent mob, is my point, not the exact numbers.
---
&gt;Second, the amount of mana you regenerate between mobs is constant and depends on your regen and time between mobs, not your max mana.
---
Yes, and what I'm trying to explain to you is dependent on this. For an example, if your mana pool allows you to pull 2 mobs without regen, and you regen about 0,5 mob per mob you kill, you're going to have to drink after every 3 mobs. If you however have the additional mana to kill a third mob without regen, you can now kill 3,5 mobs before having to drink. The real number of subsequent mobs you can kill as a shaman is higher than 2 or 3, but you get the point.
---
I can distinguish the difference but I‚Äôm also not an admin. Please point out where in the terms of service Blizzard is comfortable with minor exploits.
---
ok, you have a problem my friend ... and the solution to that ... contains a lot of fire ... more fire than you could imagine!
---
Stick to normal realms PLEASE 
---
I dont want to see any more alliance waving at horde on pvp servers because its starting to piss me off.
---
Fuck, I'm going to have to buy a scimitar now. I would LOVE not left/right on the middle scroll cause I always mispress it, and an adjustable keypad would solve a lot of my issues with 12 button mice.
---
And I also found the third button on the g600 to be pretty uncomfortable.
---
That's exactly what I do. I just started practicing aoe farming. People would come up and need the mobs. I asked if they needed and invited. Then I'd just tell them my plan and they'd wait for me to pull and most of the time barely help depending on the class. I was cool with that because I was getting what I needed out of it.
---
Nut gachiBASS
---
I know it's not a race, I have limited time to play and with the amount of time it will take to hit 60 I will most likely miss out on some of the content, so I would like to be a little more efficient.
---
With all that aside definitely fun.
---
I find the southwest side of Ashenvale easier to navigate than the northeast.  
---
Also in the northern part I find the roads much safer while in the south I venture more into wild terrain.
---
As a warlock I would rank 1 curse of agony all the mobs whilst following the mages waiting for that frost nova. Got my kills then left the area much to the delight of the AoE mages.
---
Fuck them, it's an open world and it's all fair game.
---
Hold me :p 
---
It's my only issue really, but boy is it a big one! 
---
It's probably the main thing that gives me any interest in the pipe-dream of Classic+.
---
To be honest, they're also interests in specs I have too!
---
At the end of the day, we are all Organ Farmers.
---
Just wait until layering is removed.
---
Alliance and horde obviously have their own geographical advantages in vanilla, but if the ratio is too skewed its made basically obsolete and your faction will have huge problems when it comes to farming and collecting resources, that also means that everything will be more expensive on the AH etc.
---
I absolutely low world-pvp, but it needs to be a somewhat even game to be enjoyable, 60/40 should be an alarm below, and anything below that is just not fun to play.
---
So spell cleave is the only way essentially?
---
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
---
If you use concecration, as long as your allys have given you about 3 seconds to gain aggro before they attack you should be fine. Don't forget to use the reduced threat blessing on your allys.
---
Yeah I did this at literally every spot I grinded at with quests associated. It makes it so fast for the person to finish the quests, who cares if it lowers my xp/min by a tiny bit
---
That's hilarious, on my server everyone intentionally grieves AoE mages. (Probably because there is so much competition that even getting a single quest mob feels like a BiS weapon dropping.)
---
Like, if any mage gets 3-4 mobs tagged, people will intentionally try to free the mobs from CC, or bait other mobs into the mage etc.
---
I've seen it work quite well too. Lots of dead mages.
---
Ok I think you're mistaking 'it would be nice to' with 'must' here. 
---
Would it be nice of the mage to buff and is it courteous? Yes, most certainly it is!  
---
Does he have to buff anybody ever? No, nobody is required to do anything for you or to give you anything at all. Even if you give them stuff!
---
This isn't some perfect world we live in where people are going to, and must, repay your kindness. 
---
And it doesn't matter for what reason he accepted the invite either.
---
What's important is he did, and that way helped this guy when he didn't need to nor was he required to help him at all. Which is still nice. 
---
After all, mobs are free game, and you've got to fight for your slice of the pie. Nobody is obligated to help you just cuz you were nice to them.
---
Lol I work from home and have taken the month off for a "sanity break".
---
Yikes, what an ass
---
Enable "Interact on Left Click" in Interface Options to take the risk out of it. You can also bind a key to Interact, then use `/tar` and your chosen key.
---
It's fairly obvious that something is up with MC, too. Those bosses shouldn't be dying in 30 seconds to people in blue gear, I don't care how "skillfully" you're mashing that frostbolt button.
---
This isn't right, if I understand the question. You need to keep finding beasts that have higher level of the skills (claw 2, claw 3, etc.) and repeat the process of taming a new pet, learning the skill, and then training it to your "main."
---
Is this why warriors keep asking me to transform them into spirits?
---
Let me ask you something to get a baseline. I have the level 20 Paladin quest, and I need an item from part way into SFK. Is it acceptable for me to get a PUG together with the expressed and understood intent to only clear to my quest item?
---
zug zug
---
Warrior becomes playable in PvP with a pocket healer, you mean?
---
Yeah right what? Yeah right they'll get banned/rolled back?
---
Blizzard is not afraid to punish people lol.
---
Have to agree with /u/TisUnlikely here - as a Priest I rarely have to drink unless we get a rough or large pull, or the group in general is just bad and has aggro issues or other such problems that require me to spam heal a lot.
---
thats not true at all. i play a tank and i always dread going into dungeon groups
---
tons of people who attack things way too fast. before i pull things into position. before i generate rage. before i use a single ability. then they pull aggro and its annoying to get it back because i dont have any range from not being attacked
---
tons of people who will get impatient and pull a group on their own while im waiting for people to drink up and refill mana
---
tons of mages and warlocks who drop flamestrikes and rain of fire  with absolutely no regards for threat
---
nobody actually follows skull and x markers. every dps is just attacking a random target and i cant deal with holding threat on all of these targets at once
---
and in all of these scenarios, they blame me and say its MY fault for not holding threat. where are all of these people who will "love me"? why arent all my problems solved?
---
ORB and Psychedelic Porn Crumpets too!
---
i'm just curious to hear from others, right now with HK's off there really isn't any incentive to kill others in PVP.  
---
So is it really simple as lol fuck horde or lol fuck alliance or am i missing something.  
---
When i'm out questing i leave most of the other faction alone unless they mess with me first or another member of my faction. Like i said i don't see any benefit from it and it just slows down my questing.
---
Blessing of Sacrifice
---
Doesn't sound that bad to be honest, I farmed 50 charred spider parts for the armor quest at lvl 23. (Now then, nobody was in the cave in Wetlands lol, finished in around 35 mins). Getting a group to help me in RFK will be a different story though (and I think you need lvl 30 to enter xD)
---
"She dind't swallow!"
---
won many duells vs mages back in the day. gnome racial skill was so underrated. Getting out of the first Nova for free and using trinket for sheep or the second one would usually completely throw them off and get them into panic mode. Technically they can use block, cold snap and still have the upper hand but most of them fucked it up.
---
Good groups would require you to equip the item. Else kick
---
because keeping aggro is much easier in retail. In retail you dont have to think about threat
---
Only way to level has been instances for me.
---
Like yeah I expect it to happen, its a PVP server but the ratio sucks ass.
---
quitting soon due to time but getting ganked definitely helped take up more time tryna play
---
I have a warrior 25, a priest 16 and a priest 8. 2 priests? Wtf is wrong with me. It‚Äôs all part of the game.
---
Or paladin. *nods druidic-ly to druid brother cross faction lines*
---
What are these... 3,400 and 800 numbers?
---
How long does Wailing Caverns typically take to run? Just wondering how much time I should dedicate to running it in the next day or two.
---
Unrelated. What is that XP bar mod in the bottom right corner?
---
Wait what? There's no monks in Classic... 
---
I appreciate the joke, not so much the photoshop skills ;)
---
Yeah the forsaken quest zones were some of my favourite pre cata areas. Very immersive, showing the different aspects of undeath after life - kinda sad in a way.
---
"I immediately blacklist the entire guild" reads to any resonable person that you've blacklisted every single person in that guild.
---
As a mage...I'm sorry for our kind. When I see someone trying to farm the same mobs as me I always try to throw that party invite so that we can help each other out
---
I felt this.
---
I don't think they've even been around for a year. Not where I'm at at least.
---
Ok
---
Their quality is pretty bad though. My $30 Red Dragon Perdition had worked far longer than my $90 razer mouse.
---
Seeing an interesting clip in a compilation that turns out to be some obscure Rocket video hosted literally no where in the western hemisphere.
---
Just vendor them for extra gold, for now.
---
Subreddit rules
---
Oh no, OP got wooshed.
---
Okay, now the warrior doesn't have Freedom on and the mages can resume kiting
---
Fear is our #1 weakness. I avoid Warlocks and Priests.
---
Sounds like a banable exploit to me.
---
what are we even watching  ?  
---
4 guys killing an mob....
---
I recommend binding seduce and turning it off auto-cast.
---
I usually put both hands in the air and press my macro bind key. 
---
Works less than half the time.
---
It‚Äôs like that irl though...
---
Ok see you in phase 2. You knew it was going to be here on day 1. Yet you still showed  up, and you still complain.
---
That's exactly what is happening. Cheers, i was under the impression it was a usual 3 second stun.
---
It cancels mining and herbing as well. Possibly fishing nodes too
---
That's not a punishable exploit though. Just ask Blizzard. 
---
If you exploit layers to kill the same dungeon boss over and over, now that's an exploit.
---
West side noggers
---
I have so much bound to them. As a hunter I have most of my pet control macros on 1-3, defensive stuff on 4-6, and random misc stuff I want on my bars but it doesn‚Äôt get used often on 10-12. None of the spells are really spammable so I feel you on that. 
---
I‚Äôm only level 35 so I have more spells to go. Between the 12 bindings there, 1-6 and alt 1-6 + r, e, and f, I never have to click while in combat. Out of combat I click food, water, and tracking, as well as fun stuff like dartols rod. Also I made middle click on the scroller auto run. 
---
I bought the Razer mouse specifically for classic because I knew how many spells classes get and a lot of them are useful. Trying not click players and have people angry at me in dungeons because of my pet.
---
But now you've already watched it, so why cut anything out at all?
---
Yes it does lol.
---
I used this thing on my hunter all the way to 58 when I got a good deal on a Dwarven Hand Cannon. When both attack speed buffs are up it fires like machine gun, I love it.
---
Nice, I hope it's going a bit easier.
---
If he's focusing your pet to be a dick.... Chances are you won't be able to kill him.
---
Just saying...either he's running with help, is a skull or has some engineering tricks ready.
---
The only reason retail might be worse is because everyone right now is starting over in classic. In retail, there are very few people just starting, and since everyone has seen the content they expect others to have as well.
---
Even then WoW has much less learning curve than a game like League of Legends, but there is a learning curve. Maybe Classic at the moment is going to have more people "willing to help" but I'm not sure. Haven't played retail since MoP. Though I'll probably use that free BFA at lvl 60 to start again.. Damn Blizzard and their schemes :)
---
Same thing happened to me. Some guild member of his started randomly whispering me threats and abuse right before he sent his guild spam. I complained but he didnt give a shit.
---
What's the going rate for the charms? 
---
Friend wanted help farming them, but the spawns were camped and the droprate was brutal.
---
As someone who never played classes, I underestimated anger management. Put the point into it and it didn‚Äôt even take 5 min for me to realize how helpful it is (at least from a leveling/questing point of view).  And swap standing is helpful when you get to certain levels and say have slows on one stance, but not the other two, or maybe an interupt.
---
"If it was illegal to rob the bank they would have made it more secure"
---
Thats basically the argument..
---
I think part of this depends on how you play. If you are focusing on grinding quests and dungeons, you shouldn't really need to hit the AH. If you are taking a heavy focus on your professions then you may have the extra gold to splurge on gear in the AH. This time around, I'm focusing a lot more on professions so I have a lot more money but also haven't gotten nearly as many cool gear drops (I'm 28 and I've literally done 3 dungeon runs) so I've been hitting up the AH pretty frequently. Now I'm shifting back towards questing so I try not to use my gold on AH spending because I'm not making as much anymore.
---
It is equally easy for all classes to start a group. If you're a tank it'll fill faster. This is true whether or not you're excluding people who need your items.
---
This weird "tank privilege" nonsense isn't what that guy was referring to and is way off topic in this thread.
---
Try leveling a warrior and pulling more than 1 mob then we‚Äôll talk about your water problem.
---
I like to Sprint around hitting SS and white attacks on mobs then kite them in to the mage AoE. Won't group for 15 minutes to help others in your faction? Fine, you'll do my work for me.
---
Karma will catch you eventually... Lol
---
They probably saw that Kael was going to be xpac2 baddie and reserved the character files until then.
---
As a complete 180 on your topic, this game is such a good example of different strokes for different folks. I started as a rogue, got to lvl23, and actually quite hate playing it. Afflock is now my jam.
---
If the mage can use potions/trinkets too you're still not beating them lmao
---
I did some dungeon xp farming, but only because the quest zones were overfull. There were no quest mobs to kill. I'd rather be out questing, but the zones/layers are too crowded.
---
At level 47 I'm currently getting 50-60g per day. I remember thinking 900g was outrageous but one or two good BoE drops and I'll have it when I ding 60
---
If you used the recipe yourself then it's not ninjalooting. If you sold it or gave it to your friend who is the enchanter then you are a ninja.
---
Elvui and disable all but group/raid
---
There are a game, where you can get everything day 1 by showing up, no hard work needed. Cheap items, enchants, consumables etc. It needs to be a hard work to get raid ready, to get your epic mount, to craft something EPIC. 
---
 It's sad when they finally get an old game again because they reject the new and SOMEHOW they still manage to form it into something similar to what they detest.
---
It feels like I'm playing a slot machine and I love it.
---
Go whisper tanks and healers. Its always easy to form groups.
---
I'm a horde warrior on Herod... this guy is on the list now.
---
Warriors don't get intercept until level 30 either, so even harder fight for them in that case.
---
Meanwhile my wolf growls when I change stance ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
again, we‚Äôre aware. 
---
Macros include the passive pet command.
---
Ahh i see a man of culture
---
Ahhh, Retail players not realizing that server reputation WILL matter later on. One of the great things of Classic was no name change, server transfer, etc.
---
It doesn't make sense to me  either. Unless you consider what the word "entitled" means. People get a false sense of importance. They genuinely think it's up to others to move aside for them. It's not that uncommon, especially in online communities where they're anonymous.
---
For all i know my experiences are an extreme outlier, but they happened. I have no way of proving that to you anyway, so I'm not going to try. Looking at some comments here it seems like a few others have experienced similar things.
---
Again, I have nothing against aoe mages, I have something against the attitude of some people I have encountered
---
Gd it, this is making me laugh unreasonably hard
---
you have sound on?
---
Dick his butt! Last time he calls you sissy.
---
Ok I'll have to check when I get home thanks m8.
---
I respect that philosophy, but I've got a slightly different one.  I don't think you need to blacklist someone forever in order to teach them right from wrong, develop them, make them pay a consequence, etc.   
---
Totally support people who refuse to play with any given person, though. Different strokes.
---
Are you using the following rotation?: 
---
1. Power Word Shield (first so the debuff drops earlier in the fight)
---
2. Mind Blast
---
3. Shadow Word Pain
---
4. Want until dead, recast shield if needed
---
Also don't forget to make sure your highest rank spells are on the bars. Use the following macro's to ensure they are:
---
/cast mind blast
---
This macro will always cast the highest rank of Mind Blast.
---
Other than that, there is not much you can do to go faster. Level 27 after 2 days /played is better than my priest.
---
Yeah if issues like this keep happening I could see them update the Need/Greed loot rules to something similar to retail where you can‚Äôt roll need on anything you can‚Äôt equip for your class
---
"That character has an exploiter debuff and can not be summoned"
---
&gt; You know they track how many of a boss people kill. 
---
Even if this is true (which we don't know), this still wouldn't help find people who exploited layering in dungeons.
---
You have no idea if they log a timestamp for every single boss kill in the game, and without knowing that you don't know if they have the data they need to identify people who exploited layering.
---
wowhead comments from way back when are still there...
---
Ooo gottem!
---
Snus is also an actual tobacco product, you put it under your upper lip though.
---
Mostly only sold in Scandinavia, it often gets translated to snuff in English. I understand his confusion.
---
Lmao I did this one yesterday. I should have kept count killed an upwards of 40...
---
Appropriate comment as a warrior, since we all know you won‚Äôt be catching anyone.  I‚Äôd say come at me bro, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve got that kind of time to wait for you.
---

Ok fair enough I will re-phrase ''Pretty sure if you're a straight guy trying to get sex in wow you're playing it wrong my guy.''
---
We good?
---
Yeah well, Shamans just have answer to anything Priests might throw at them.
---
* Tremor totem nullifies Physic Scream
---
* Silence doesn't do jack as bulk of damage comes from their weapons
---
* Earth Shock is 6s CD interrupt which means priest can never use big heals
---
* Purge removes Renew/PW:S so priest can't use them efficiently either
---
* Windfury Procs are very sudden and bursty, which means the Priest will need to heal immidately
---
* Grounding Totem is very helpful to deflect the rest of what priest can use
---
* Finally Shamans have access to healing, which means Priests can't just outlast them like they do with Mages/Warriors
---
I‚Äôm not talking about feign death to mobs. 
---
This is a hunter pvp ability as far as I‚Äôm concerned.  And the fact that it only sometimes works puts us at a distinct disadvantage in pvp.
---
I think it was same day. Cleared up to Rag on Monday. Were wiping. Disbanded group to clear ubrs with priest mind control to get 86 fire res buff from a npc. 
---
Someone from outside the original raid without a lockout id reformed raid accidentally putting them into another layer. 
---
When they zoned back into MC the raid and bosses reset. 
---
The next day on Tuesday they cleared MC legit without layering. That‚Äôs why people think he did it twice on a week so fast. Because of Tuesday raid reset.
---
I've been a mage forever. But I decided to level via questing/grinding with frostbolt instead of messing around with AoE shit. Every horde mage that I run into that's aoe farming I purposely engage just because I hate that shit
---
Yeah, some mages are total dicks when it comes to farming.
---

---
*azeroth shattering
---
Refuse to move until they stop using these abilities and doing stupid shit. Or just let them die.
---
The main thing is communicating. Get in touch with your healer, let him know when you're pulling etc. If you have healer on your side they can't kick you even if they want to.
---
There are good people on both sides am I right?
---
i was chaining down huge groups yesterday with a friendly bear tank most fun ever so far like. 2 of us vs 9 mobs. it was glorious
---
So glad I ditched Stalagg on release.
---
Because you have a Notepad on your PC with links to great pornos?
---
I think everyone just thinks you sound like a twerp.
---
&gt;Raiding should be fine for you
---
I'm sure he can't wait until he can finally get into MC and spam frostbolt over and over for 3 hours.
---
idk what ur asking
---
Nope, never have. Not even once.
---
If you going to fight back gets you attacked you are A) to stupid to do it right, or B) it isnt some magical free pass.
---
It isnt in ToS because there isnt one. And the EULA is intentionally vague
---
I'm pretty sure there are more players in Duskwood than living NPCs.
---
Drop rate is around 30%, I bought the burning ones at 30 for about 8s a piece but the cresting and thundering charms have always been 50-60s a piece on Stalagg. I'd imagine your AH is a little more expensive considering we have a huge imbalance on the horde side and are one of the largest servers. I'd ballpark it safely between 10-15g for all 32.
---
The elementals were tough for me at 37 but I guess I was lucky because I only had to kill about a dozen of each one to get my 8 charms.
---
Those are weak numbers, that's all
---
I'm only 56 and rocking 140 spell damage now

&gt; It fails because your movement and your fd gets batched so it kind of "breaks itself". Basically what you have to do is , stand completely still and remove your hand from your mouse so you don't even pivot your camera and then you click it after 1.5-2 seconds. If you do it too fast or you pivot your camera or make any movements at all, you will fail a very high percentage of the time. No error message, no resist, it will just go on CD and break itself and leave you in combat.
---
Personally, this sounds a lot like vanilla to me. Feign Death was always something that had issues, especially in fast paced encounters like in PvP. Scattershot was almost considered necessary in order to FD and drop combat for that reason in those situations.
---
Many classes can improve their buffs with Talents. The tooltip will show properly for you but it will only show the incorrect base line value for others. This is a limitation of the classic wow interface. The improved buffs work just fine for you and your whole party, but your party will never know that you picked those Talents just from the tooltip.
---
So the guild name was true. You got the blade on  kill
---
No I'm tired of reddit making everything some world ending deal. It's not a big deal calm down.
---
Because that's the time they set
---
Because they get ganked twice and want to scream into the reddit void instead of moving questing areas, patiently creating a counter raid or leveling an alt for an hour. I think being outnumbered is better for world PVP as you can always find somebody to fight, BG Queues will be a joke in phase 2, etc. I don‚Äôt understand the negativity either
---
I still think that layering was not a good decision from a game design standpoint. Yes, it let people into the game and all that. I'm aware of the benefits, but the downsides of it (of which many people have already voiced) far outweighted the ability for people to "play when they wanted".
---
There are always a bunch of solutions to a problem, not all of them are good solutions. And my fear that layering was not a good solution has been strengthened every passing day.
---
From guildies begging in guild to get invited to a different layer to avoid being ganked, resource nodes, and now this (and yes I know it's a bug), it feels like Blizzard took their current design philosophy for retail and applied it to Classic.
---
That mage could have won that fight by spamming frostbolt.
---
Is there a way to prioritize ammo used by hunters, or is it automatic? As in I want to use the 1dmg arrow before the 5dmg arrow.
---
Is there any known % changes when you have more characters or level differences? 
---
I recently outleveled my friends, but could do DM to help them out. they said i was too high and would take too much exp.
---
If you organized it and made it known at the beginning that a specific item was reserved and they were okay with it, should've just master looted that single boss to remove shady people from screwing you over.
---
For a game that's been killed, there sure are a shit ton of people playing it.
---
As I said I was alone with a lvl 26 pet so I would have **never engaged the fight.** You were just feeling a way too powefull, probably trying to fill this deep lack of testosterone you have IRL. You killed me 7 times in row **camping my corpse**. If you don't remember it's probably because I was wasn't the only one bullied this night.
---
I imagine you won't assume that shit! What a coincidence to find you on this Reddit.
---
in one of the earlier expansions (wrath?) they introduced something called phasing which enabled them to have different versions of the same zone visible to different players. 
---
in Warlords of Draenor to combat uneven player populations they expanded this into a system called "Sharding" which does that + spawns multiple instances of the 'same version' of a given zone in order to balance player population so people in highly trafficked zones can still experience a smooth game. 
---
for Classic they implemented the multiple instances without 'storyline altered versions' of zones and called in 'layering' - in theory it's because they didn't want a thousand level 5 players contesting the same 20 bears for their ass drops. 
---
Problem is you can manipulate party join/leave to force a layer change, allowing you to kill a rare, elite, or instanced boss then hop layers to a 'new' (or different anyway) layer where the boss isn't dead yet.
---
In other 'modern' mmo's, layer hopping is a sort-of intended mechanic and you can usually pick your layer. 
---
In classic it's a crutch to address the low number of servers relative to the current popularity of the game and meant to be invisible (since classic did *not* work this way.)
---
By exploiting the dungeon reset mechanic....
---
No semen levels?
---
Yeah,and when your friends quit a server that you are invested in because the balance is god damn awful that also ruins my experience.
---
&gt;If you don't like PVP, go play a PvE server and leave the rest of us alone
---
Unlike you I want to play on an actual PvP server, not a 80/20 "PvP" server.
---
I like the irony of this dude hurling insults at people when he isn't smart enough to run back to his corpse, or even talk to the spirit healer.
---
I try not to tank if I can help it. I like it out in the world more. Bears just for surviving over zealous pulls for me.
---
I definitely noticed this by trial and error. 
---
I usually just complete all the quests in a given area, but I've noticed I level much faster by just farming low level mobs in new areas with new quests. 
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
after reaching 9% hit (or more), You need a lots of crit for proccing Flurry talent
---
Might have some luck in the hinterlands with a few mobs.  Otherwise blasted lands.  Also a few mobs in Feralas, but that might be a bit high for "not paying attention"  I cannot recall.
---
Do not specifically spec for healing please. You will hate leveling if you do so. It makes questing terrible. Ret is more than capable of healing dungeons. Just try and hold onto ANY gear that has intellect or healing on it.
---
Once you get to level 20 you will learn Flash of Light, this is your main healing spell. You will pretty much be casting it exclusively.  Until you get to that point you can down rank your Holy light to help you heal. If you pull out the different ranks, i think before lvl 20 you atleast have 2 or 3 ranks circ. The lower ranks of holy light have a shorter cast time and cost less mana. Also be sure to bring lots of water. You should be drinking after every pull. 
---
While healing you can start a heal, and if the tank doesnt really need it you can simply side step before the cast finishes and you will cancel the spell. This is good for timing heals with tank damage. You will also be able to conserve mana this way. Blessing of protection should essentially never be put on the tank. He will drop all aggro and you will prolly wipe. It's more used to be cast on dps who pull aggro. It's very good for mages who are trying to aoe with frost nova and arcane explosion. Also if you pull agro, if you use Divine shield or put blessing of protection on yourself you will drop aggro back to the tank. Try not to run around like an idiot if you pull aggro, this will not help the tank at all. As a pally you can take a few hits just fine. 
---
I think that's about it. I mained pally from vanilla through wrath and in legion. Feel free to ask me anything. Pallys are a lot of fun to play and my opinion are super OP in classic!
---
Well both of you can actually be right. A dungeon can pretty much exist within the same map as the outer world but way above or below the overworld level. This could be the case for every indoor dungeon actually. For outdoor dungeons they just copy a chunk of the world out.
---
Either way, it doesn't matter if they are on the same map or their own instance. This issue needs fixing and that's all.
---
Wetlands and ashenvale are both viable
---
Weird I thought my AH would be cheaper. Crest and thunder go for twice that on stalagg
---
I make coffee. Drink it. Then have to make more. Argh
---
Not much of a guild run if they can't get a full 5...
---
This is only true if you're specifically trying to follow guides and be too rigid. 
---
Between 30-40 you can jump between like 3-4 zones relatively easily depending on quest/enemy density and with RFK/SM/RFD/Gnomer all doable at that point you have lots of instanced options to avoid any wpvp if you want. Clear all of SM once is easily 1 level and it's quick enough to clear multiple instances at a time with each group.
---
Most of the people I see complaining about this are trying to follow guides that 90% of the other players are following and they are confused as to why they keep running into large groups at quest sites.
---
this is how it went in the yeti cave in hillsbrad.  A huge group of Ally showed up, took over the cave and started farming.  Then a level 40 horde and 38 horde showed up and it just grew from there.  It was an all out battle to see who was going to be able to farm the yeti's lol maybe it was just the timing but i didn't have nearly as much trouble doing the hunt quests in stv.
---
felstud
---
Yeah pre 60 dungeons have issues with aggro
---
I use the replay capture on OBS. If you have it turned on it basically records everything, but doesn‚Äôt save unless you hit the ‚Äòsave‚Äô hotkey. I have mine set to save 2 minutes back.
---
I have always wondered what happens when there is a draw in roll.. well.. not all 100s are made equal. F to Mistaken.. he was mistaken when he thought the weapon would go to him
---
I have a lot of questions about layering... Is general chat one layer or is it the entire server (multiple layers in one chat channel)? Is the LFG or world defense channel a single layer or the entire server? If I do /who, does it show me all the players in the zone, or just the players in my current layer? Is there a repository of info with everything we know about how layers work?
---
theres maybe 1-2 mages in 1000 that will be fire talented for now
---
Try to just say to ypure group to allow you to get more than one cycle in before starting dps
---
This is one of the best things about classic and what I missed about vanilla! When mages pull large groups knowing you are there for them too and you either A. Watch them die or B. Tag some of their mobs and run towards them so they can AOE your tagged mobs. The anger they show is delicious and is one of the most entertaining parts of WoW! Dont worry about their feelings, just taste their tears!
---
Must've not had it on his bars
---
i mean ur just wrong. They dont have cc but eles blow people up and can tremor to stop fears and reflect totem too. Or just wf crit 1 shot you. Dunno why u got such a hate boner
---
Wetlands?
---
Wetlands is also an option
---
&gt;The problem I see with everyone criticising it is that they don't have a better alternative to suggest. Layering is by far the least bad option out there.
---
What's actually wrong with things being more classic-like and having server pops that are closer to 2004 than what they currently are? Assuming of course blizz allows transfers to the newly opened servers so that queues aren't 5 hours anyway. We got by just fine with ~3.5k/server then, why does it need to be 5x that now for the same amount of content?
---
This is the only reason I can think of that layers exist in the first place. What is phase 2 going to look like when all of a sudden all 5 layers of Herod are smashed into a single layer? 
---
The real issue is the increased server pops. Layering is just a band-aid that's going to hurt like piss when ripped off.
---
Lmao I didn't miss anything. You're making assumptions based on nothing. I didn't name the item or price or even my server. You missed the part about having information to back up your arrogance.
---
Max rank Consecration does less damage over its entire duraction than a single Holy Shield block, offers no defensive benefit and costs a ton of mana.
---
I guess you could but why? The raids moving on. No need to tie up anyone other than the 2-3 people getting the loot.  
---
Ninja looting wasn‚Äôt common. You‚Äôd see some videos of it online, like someone ninja‚Äôing Rag or one of the legendary drops from garr, but honestly I think I remember 2 moments of people ninja looting on my entire server in raids over 2 years. And those people weren‚Äôt in my guild.  It just wasn‚Äôt a thing. People were very trustworthy
---
Until you tag it, it ain‚Äôt yours man.
---
interesting, I wonder if it's worth having her lash on/off, since in combat her regen is lower either way
---
You sound guilty as fuck, would love to see you exploiting entitled cheaters banned outright, including retail and your accounts deleted.
---
Fuck off and go cheat and exploit in some other MMO, stupid kid.
---
how good is your tanking weapon? i try to keep mine within 5 levels of the content im tanking. also, dps needs to learn not to pull aggro. it's a team effort.
---
/r/ihavesex
---
No I'm just sick of retards like you making every little thing out to be the end of the fucking world. It's not a huge problem but everything is so over dramatized. If you spent as much time playing than bitching maybe you would actually enjoy the game.
---
I had a healer last night that kept letting me (tank) nearly die while at full mana then healing at the last second, appearing to have gone afk or dc'd. 
---
We asked what was up and they said they were playing borderlands and didn't notice we started pulling more
---
wtf
---
Pretty sure there was a way to aggro Cthun by using a hunter's pet in the first big hallway. After clearing to the hallway, everyone would wait outside the raid except the hunter, who aggros cthun, FDs after his pet dies, then you can just use the Cthun teleporter to go right to Cthun, skipping all bosses except Skeram.
---
Man I was in some yeti cave last night getting skins by myself when two horde roll in and lay waste to me.  There was an escort robot chicken quest going on next to me and I figured that's why they were there.  I waited until they were fighting and got both of them.  Felt good.
---
Get fishing buddy addon.  Double right-click to cast, right-click to reel it in (when the bobber splashes).
---
You can put your mouse pointer (and leave it there) over the bobber as soon as you cast.
---
If I could give you an award.. I would.
---
BUR
---
Yea, tank needs to tank all the damage since he has the gear and class mechanics to cut the damage down heavily. Dps need to focus one target so that aggro doesnt get pulled off tank and also so the amount of incoming damage gets lower faster. The tank should mark targets with the raid icons to let everyone know the order. When I heal on my druid if I notice everyone is attacking whatever they want I let the dps know I'm not going to heal you if you pull aggro and I'll mark targets if the tank doesnt know how or doesnt want to.
---
I was literally in the same boat at you last week and found that the following strategy really helps:
---
First and foremost, INT is your best friend! Whether it is cloth or leather, grab anything that will give you INT so you have the largest mana pool you can muster. Next, downranking Holy Light is huge. I always have the strongest Holy Light, followed by the previous two ranks in my bar. This way, I don‚Äôt blow my mana overhealing and you will get a nice feel for it after a while. At 20, you get Flash of Light, which will help you in spot healing quickly when you need it. Since Holy Light is on a 2.5 sec cast time, I always cast it on whomever is taking damage and either letting it execute if they truly need it, or sidestepping to cancel it. Either way, due to the long cast time, your better off casting it snd only letting it execute when they need it. Last thing I‚Äôll mention is mouse-over macros. With mouseover macros, all you have you to do is mouseover the target, hit the keybind and you cast the heal. Takes the selecting of the target with left click out of the equation. Best of luck!
---
Ahh ok the add on makes sense. It was making me cringe so much people writing stuff like that but if there's a way to actually see emotes I can understand it a bit more
---
Either its all okay or none of it's okay. You don't get to effectively give permission to exploit when it exploiting is significantly advantageous then punish when the same exploit is even more advantageous.
---
*when being hit. obviously dealing damage still gains rage
---
Yeah, doesn't really work like that though. It's a ladder, so it's not like you've got a huge advantage just because there's more people to kill; they're all in the same boat.
---
Plus, there's so many more downsides than "possibly better chance to getting R14". Competing over dungeon/raid entrances, a smaller economy, more competition from the other faction for rare crafting mats, harder time leveling in contested areas, etc. are just the start.
---
Then, you've got the issue that the other faction is likely far more geared. The higher pop a faction is, the more people there are to raid/dungeon with, the more gear they'll have and the faster they will progress; I've been on the wrong side of servers before and had people farming mythic raids when my faction hadn't even cleared normal.
---
I'm also hearing of ninjas again, someone yesterday complained about a guy who rolled need on everything (Earthfury server)
---
As I said I was alone with a lvl 26 pet so I would have \*\*never engaged the fight.\*\* You were just feeling a way too powefull, probably trying to fill this deep lack of testosterone you have IRL. You killed me 7 times in row \*\*camping my corpse\*\*. If you don't remember it's probably because I was wasn't the only one bullied this night.
---
Tell the plebs let you build aggro or wipe. Healer should let them die as well.  Healers don‚Äôt enjoy having to burn excessively on dps.
---
I don't have a chair and usually kneel in front of my single monitor. Am I good?
---
If you tank RFK at 30 you'll have an easy enough time finding a group. Theres also a good 1h axe and shield in there
---
No respawns
---
If you die in WoW, you die IRL
---
No unlearning professions
---
No magic, high realism server
---
No leveling up. You start at lvl 1? Gratz, your a level 1 peasant
---
No chat function. All communication is by in game mail or /say
---
Do you think he'd eat the corpses? Or just let them rot beside him?
---
I would argue Shaman or Spriest. Shaman have a slight edge because you can do an Ele/resto hybrid. It sounds like you are basically describing a Shaman. Some guilds might take 1 shadow priest, which is an advantage they have. They will have to keep respeccing though. e
---
the thing is idk what those numbers mean. Seems low but i truly dont know. its 15k people so maybe not?
---
Sounds like you are talking about PVP..... Dunno why you are so retarded.
---
I dunno man, I googled "calm lake" and every picture there looks more like the Ultra water than the Classic water.
---
Jesus...
---
Default raid frames are one of the simplest looking there is
---
Your example is self defeating.
---
The 10% increases raid damage by 100 the 15% increases damage 135. So you‚Äôd want to give it to person who needs it more.
---
You have to escape by putting a \ in front of it, like so.
---
Hitting them with a fear can be great also
---
You both are wrong. It's classic. Its the gryphon rider in loch modan. Check him out yourself...
---
All chats and /who are unrelated to layers. You can see /world and /general of everyone on the server at all times
---
I was unsure about arms for levelling whilst tanking, until I got like 2 points in tactical mastery and then all of a sudden I understood everything.
---
Also the /who only gives you the first 100 players or something, so it isn't a complete list of everybody who is in a zone.
---
RemindME! 3 days ‚Äúrogue addons‚Äù
---
When I gank someone as a shaman
---
i saw someone named sussudio in stv a few days ago. I ran up and said "SU SU SUUDIIOOO"
---
They looked at me for half a second then ran off...
---
round of applause!
---
I am starting to see a drop off of players swapping to BL3.  I think by week 5 people that got the one month sub time and are stubborn about making sure they damn well use their money when they buy something will leave the game too.  
---
The good thing is the players enjoying it are recruiting their friends, families, and coworkers to hop online and do some auto attack grinding!
---
It is just wanting their money.  They'd have banned them years ago with the 40 man multi boxer in wod
---
Same. If I'm not subjected to a group interview with more than a few skeptical officers poring over the entirety of my WoW history with disapproving grunts that I didn't attain any world firsts, didn't attain at least top 10 on worldwide meters...
---
...and then waiting a week before begrudgingly inviting me with a "You're on trial for 2 weeks. No raid invites until you're cleared".
---
/r/whoosh
---
What streamers do you know that used this exploit? People keep saying this without any specifics.
---
Then the elation of finding said video? Not many things beat that feeling.
---
&gt;This exploit allowed players to repeatedly farm certain mobs in dungeons, including bosses, without having to reclear to that location and probably bypassing the 5 dungeons per hour lockout since you never leave the dungeon. This means that the players who exploited this will be able to farm bosses like [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=1853/darkmaster-gandling](Darkmaster Gandling) for [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14514/pattern-robe-of-the-void](Pattern: Robe of the Void) or [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=10813/balnazzar](Balnazzar) for [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14512/pattern-truefaith-vestments](Pattern: Truefaith Vestments) without moving out of the boss arena. It would also work on [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=9264/firebrand-pyromancer](Firebrand Pyromancer) for [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14513/pattern-robe-of-the-archmage"](Pattern: Robe of the Archmage) and [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13494/recipe-greater-fire-protection-potion](Recipe: Greater Fire Protection Potion). And this works on whatever you want to farm in dungeons, so these players are likely close to their BiS gear and have plenty of expensive pieces of gear and recipes (or gold)!
---
&gt;hopefully they get their shit taken away at the very least.
---
Seems a reasonable start. I wonder if they can roll back characters to before they started this dungeon exploit?
---
I get that their actions didn‚Äôt really impede other players, but it seems fair to ding them for their ill-gotten loot, xp, and gold.

Imagine an apartment building. Every floor is the exact same. But as soon as you go in the front door you are randomly teleported to one of the floors. You cannot tell what floor you are on but all the floors are exactly the same. All the furniture is the same, all the decorations, food in the fridge etc. You grab the last soda from the fridge, your friend invite you to his ‚Äúlayer‚Äù and all of a sudden the soda reappears. You have effectively used the same resource twice within a matter of moments because of hopping to a new layer.
---
Azeroth works the same way currently
---
Didn't even get a chance to ask. offered trade few seconds after zoning in. lol
---
I saved an alliance priest he polluted me for a heal we parted ways him moving onto other things while I farmed rep.
---
Just search yours. There‚Äôs a sub for every one I‚Äôm pretty sure.
---
I've mained a mage on retail and am currently playing one now. It's our job to focus dps. A competent dps shouldn't pull agro 95% of the time if they and the tanks are doing their job properly. I always tell any healers that if a dps consistantly pulls agro and refuses to focus dps or let the tank build agro, *let them die*

I did my respect at 40. So I cod get shadowform.

I'm planning to spend most my time in a PvP build but since I'm still leveling I have a hybrid PvP and pve build. Meaning I currently have 5/5 spirit tap but putting 41-45 points into blackout as 10% stun on world PvP feels great at lvl 45

Hello,
---
Not sure if that was because I had to retrospectively edit the flair, so it may have looked like a repost?
---
I have only submitted it the once.

Paladins heal a lot better once they get flash of light.  It is more mana efficient.  It sounds like you may have been 'overhealing' too.  Holy light heals for a lot, and costs a lot of mana.  At your level you'll want the heal to land when the person is at like, 50% HP or less to avoid healing beyond their max HP and thus 'wasting' some of the heal.
---
No it is not. You chose a server where horde is overpopulated. You can just move server yourself if you aren't having fun, or you can move to a pve server yourself. The stats are public and blizzard gave you the option to choose for yourself. Just grow the fuck up you manchild.
---
You don't HAVE to play alliance, you don't HAVE to be on that server. These are all your own choices, and what you want will fuck up other people's games who are not complaining but having fun. I want to kill horde, my server has double the horde, which means I can get double the kill. Just leave the game already instead, your ideas will fuck our games. 99% of the community isn't complaining, only you and a handful of others are.
---
Tauren/gnomes have the largest mount size for their respective factions, but they are the same size (at least since wrath, can't confirm before then).
---
Also, guaranteed to be warm enough with a pocket furnace
---
A lot of people don't look at it from that perspective and just have a passion for PvP.
---
The extrinsic rewards are just extra.
---
Super handy. The only downside is that we already get a ton of skills and macros take away from keybinds.
---
Had this happen in RFK yesterday. Tank changed loot and got the axe then left. Good times.
---
I mean, were they there first? Etiquette dictates that if they are already set up at a spawn/camp, you should "fuck off" because they do have a claim to it. 
---
It gets into more of a grey area if they are roaming a larger area than just a spawn point, but generally as long as they are clearing efficiently (which it sounds like these folks were not, actually.) I'd likely find somewhere else to go. After all, there are plenty of options for questing until the late 40s, at least.
---
At least that's how it was in UO/Lineage/EQ/Vanilla WoW. I know these days the mindset has shifted to "Gotta go fast" and a decent amount of the population just doesn't care about that type of thing anymore.
---
Ditto. I lowkey feel like an ass, Classic is the most fun I've had in ages.
---
I immediately thought of christopher walken from pulp fiction.
---
Total dick move imo
---
It counts, yes, characters that are logged in and playing. But creating a level 1 and leaving it on the character select screen does not get counted. It operates on the /who command.
---
&gt;A dungeon can pretty much exist within the same map as the outer world but way above or below the overworld level.
---
It could yes, and is common in single player games to have interiors below the world like that. It isn't like this in WoW though because you could just teleport hack into unreleased instances if they were just flying in the air above Kalimdor.  Some dungeons share maps with other dungeons though like all of the scarlet crusade wings are on the same map. 
---
&gt; This issue needs fixing and that's all. 
---
 [https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1108314-fix-for-repeat-instance-bug-exploit/](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1108314-fix-for-repeat-instance-bug-exploit/)  looks like it's been fixed already and bans will be going out.
---
Exploiting bugs is still an exploit and a banable offense. Blizzard makes that quite clear.
---
Think there‚Äôs just /cast Revenge, Shield Block, Sunder Armor.
---
I agree with this fully. My point is that to call work  done at a job productive and then assume that leisure must be pure consumption seems like a pretty alienating misconception of the possibilities of what can be done with a person‚Äôs time. I think that as much of our time should be free as possible. But you can do work and create stuff in your free time as well as consume and this too can be leisure, or alternatively you can put your free time towards a cause you choose that isn‚Äôt making money for your boss and this is also probably more valuable then gaming. I like video games just I know there are better things to do with my time and that I would say six hours a day is way too much for me and don‚Äôt see how that could be anything but a somewhat sad state of affairs for anyone. This is not a crazy position to hold.
---
So your farming a leveling instance for a BoE drop? BoE are extremely low drop rate and if you farm an instance for them, you‚Äôd be better off farming gold and buying them on the ah. BoP ONLY drop in instances and only get vendored for little money. BoE is fair game I don‚Äôt care if you gain 5dps or 10 stamina from the BoE upgrade, I‚Äôll do ALOT more with the 10-50g I‚Äôll get from selling it. How am I wrong for that? Please explain and try to change my mind.
---
Classic was huge on immersion which layering completely destroys.  
---
There are a ton more problems with it, but from the sound of it you weren't interested in the authentic experience anyway.
---
Except healer's mana =&gt; health =&gt; tapped mana  
---
Is much more mana than just drinking :)
---
This offends each and every one of my sensibilities.
---
Because you bought your mount already, right?
---
Cool cool - I will do that.
---
Honestly, I don't know if those do. I never lightning bolt because it is just so slow and I crit all the time so I haven't been able to notice if it does or not, but I will give it a test tonight and report back if there is any conclusion to that.
---
Wall of text that only deserves  the following, NO.
---
I'm calling him a lost cause because 22 year olds are saying hes immature outside of a game - and in game he's what I would expect a 14 year old to be like.   Not looking good for that dude if someone who can't even muster up the courage to speak directly to another adult is calling him immature.
---
I bought one for 40g I‚Äôm currently sitting on it.
---
This article was posted the other day iirc.
---
Not really. I am same, prefer to level fast etc. I still play on a tbc private server and classic now.  The game itself is fun, even if you want to achieve things fast.
---
Really? I honestly though that was slow. I have 2 1/2 days on that character. 1 1/2 days was getting to lvl 125 on both blacksmithing and mining
---
Will be soon bro... The biggest problem is that i play from a game pub... Something like an internet caffee, and i need to get permission for it sadly... But tonigt or tomorrow night i should be able to record gnomergan and SM GY aswell..
---
So skinning during leveling, do I pay the 5g to get artisan level? Or just keep as is until I cant skin mobs anymore
---
Awesome! Thanks for the link.
---
Also, it took them fucking 2 weeks to figure out how to fix it and not break the rest of the layering tech code base.
---
At least on the main map, on the minimap it's super useful to know if there's a lone spawn somewhere.
---
Are you angry at the Horde then?
---
In what world is a game that takes 150+ hours to get max level "optimized for casuals"? A game where playing for an hour gets you almost nowhere past level 20.
---
This is a game for hardcore players willing to grind those mobs for a stupid quest drop, or do a dungeon 15 times to get the loot they want. It is the antithesis of a casual game.
---
Sounds like your team was bad, as a healer you should basically only heal the tank.
---
Of course sometimes you need to throw a heal onto someone else, but if the DPS are constantly pulling agro and needing healing that is not your fault.
---
If you find yourself healing too many people ask them to focus the same target, use the marking system to help with this.
---
When you are healing just go for Int and Spirit gear, even if you are ret spec you can keep a set of INT/SPI gear to throw on when you need to heal.
---
Im also using a 2h Staff
---
DPS class gets mad at Utility class for not being able to kill mobs fast. 
---
I love killing mages, it's a blast, easiest enemies to kill by far.
---
Go spam that frostbolt bud, mad skills.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm Horde so I only remember some names.
---
You and I understand porn on a different plane of existence from these here normies
---
This is strange.  I am a warlock and have not seen this issue at all.  Weird that its specific to the hunter pets.
---
Agreed. Even if one person is able to keep their exploited thousands of gold, this early, that's too much power for one man or woman.
---
Details, for DPS, threat and lots of other data (cc break, HPS etc...)
---
He knew what he was doing
---
Started for me today. Was going to fish some in Tanaris to work on artisan cooking and was getting an empty loot window every cast. No fish got away, nothing. 
---
225/225 fishing (artisan quest accepted)  
---
\+3 pole / +75 lure
---
Well i play on a PvE realm so i always wave the Alliance,cus i can't exactly give them Arcane Int.,and believe me one time i didnt see it was a human lock and tried to give him AI much to my surprise when the buff popped over my head :D
---
I spend my time rotating between arathi farms and hillsbrad to farm those mages while waiting for my friends. After getting insta killed for 10 times they decide it doesn't worth it.
---
I mean, we're talking about people who got to 60 in less than 3 weeks, restarting them at lvl 1 does nothing and they'll hit 60 again before the majority of all players.
---
Hi, /u/ChromaticSteak
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d520a5/people_who_gank_people_10_levels_lower_than_you/). 
---
Affliction Warlocks are my target audience. :)
---
In this example the guy says "if you kill my pet."
---
Uhhh... I guess the pet is pretty passive in that case.
---
That's quite rude, I'd agree.
---
1. Currently Layering is needed it will be removed soon, it's not hurting the economy as bad as you think it is. What bugs are people not aware of? I don't see an issue with layering in the current state, it will be removed soon but without it, imagine trying to get to 60 everywhere is jam packed with people questing. 
---
2. I disagree with your point. The larger serve is not the reason multiple people have the same item, the knowledge of the game, advances in computer hardware all need to be taken into consideration. I'd go on to say with smaller servers you'd see more people with the same items. 
---
3. They have already done this with large servers, It doesn't work as much as you think it does. 
---
You're whining for no reason, the issues are not in the game, they are things people think are issues but truly aren't because they don't know or see the statistics. Bugs happen, they fix bugs constantly, report them and move on.
---
Thanks, this is the kind of clarity I was looking for!
---
Yay the Paladin/Shaman prio Still alive?
---
Because some people did it once or twice by mistake, while other did it over and over again. Possibly hundreds of times.
---

---
Incendius appears to be the PvP server to play on, though it's a bit Horde sided.
---
You can use burgy blackhearts  and slides compas/ gamon on retail and test it.
---
r/prequelmemes approves.
---
The bad locks I have had stand right in the middle of melee or right beside them they are never near me.
---
Main thing is to keep your blink for when they intercept you. If you can get him in combat before he can charge it becomes really easy. You can always toss in Rank one frostbolts to keep him at bay if your slow is about to drop off of him. Undead mages will have WotF to make their lives easier against their fear.
---
Locks can't get their epic mount til the next phase this is the 40 mount.
---
The Alliance gets relaxing conversation on the cliffs of Loch Modan, cozy inns with traveling adventurers and taverns buzzing with excitement and revelry, friend. Not to mention the mystical element NElfs bring to the table and the histories the races all share.
---
Elemental for that stormshroud; set bonuses are pretty great though it doesn't give raw stats.
---
The jail should be in the capital of the Alliance, not Stormwind
---
‚ÄúIs the most beloved and successful game of all time worth trying out?‚Äù
---
Gouge is technically the fastest tag in the game, but Moonfire is a close second and it's ranged.
---
As a level 25 noob mage I must be doing it wrong because I can only pull 1 mob at a time or 2 at most if I sheep one.  I once tried using my AoEs on 3+ and got slaughtered.  I get frustrated as well because often I'll target a mob and by the time my slow channeled frost bolt gets there someone else has grab the mob with moonfire or an arrow.  Tbh I think I prefer my hunter to the mage.
---
Yeah I guess that is where we disagree. I think in that example you are rude for pulling people through half a dungeon and then leaving. You should finish the entire instance. You join from start to finish. I think the other approach is just as douchy as the people who join a dungeon and leave when they lvl up or after a boss drops what they were after. It's just bad manners and not very nice for the other people involved. Again, self entitlement. It's the entire mentality of "me me me" I dont like. Bottom line, it is worth their time as long as they gain experience for it, not just loot or quest items.
---
Don't fish from the same "pool" (the swirls that go away after a few fish are pulled out).
---
Try to move away from other players when fishing.  Unlike retail, your bobber sound gets heard by the other player.  Making it harder for them to figure out if it was their bobber making the noise.
---
Shtay a hwile and lissen!
---
Agreed.
---
I thought that was only Horde quest
---
What if you had dunkaroos and a cool lunchbox but jerk-ass kids kept hiding your lunchbox on you
---
The point of discussion threads is not for you to assume you know what someone else meant, even after the guy told you what he meant, and multiple other people are telling you that they understand what he meant and that your understanding is incorrect. You are not discussing, just being annoying for no reason.
---
Where are you getting that from?
---
Where did you lvl your 30s?
---
Give the Ice Novaed mob a little tap to break it free then:
---
Hunter: fake death
---
Paladin: bubble
---
Other mage: Ice Block
---
Rouge: Vanish
---
If you are ever going to grind for money (let's assume you are) then it's better to do that on skinnable monsters, in which case it's better to take that Artisan.
---
In other words, 1 Rugged Leather is 5s. Are you going to skin more than 100 Rugged Leathers? If yes, then you should definitely pick up Artisan.
---
This one is awesome. If you have any others like this, consider sharing them on r/classicwowscreenshots as well. We've got a niche community growing over there for screenshots like this one and I'd love to see what else you have.
---
What ever is that
---
Rank 1 frostbolt, 18-21 damage, 25 Mana
---
Rank 2 frostbolt, 31-36 damage, 35 Mana
---
You get about a 90% damage increase for a 45% Mana increase. 
---
But your highest ranking spells that you use. You can skip the stupid spells like arcane missiles or amplify magic. You should buy fireball for early levels also. 
---
Not buying your new rank spells is asking for death. 
---
If you don't buy new blizzard while aoeing you will be struggling.
---
Private Servers were in a "worse" state for **years** until Nostalrius set the standard for all of the vanilla ones. No serious server before that tried readjusting bosses, items, talents etc. in order to make it harder. Heck, I remember times when feenix was the only reasonable choice if you ever wanted to tackle Naxx.
---
people on the internet wanted legacy servers and cried out for them for years. Then they get them and it's not okay because it's not version X. Take a break for fucks sake. 
---
I mean, the devs went out of their way to reimplement freaking spell batching for no reason other than to make it more authentic for the **Classic** experience.
---
Just remember, your main job is to keep the tank alive. His job is to keep the enemies on him, so that the dps don‚Äôt receive damage (other than any air damage that is unavoidable).  It is the eternal plight of the healer, especially now since many have never experienced and/or have forgotten that you just can‚Äôt go charge through a dungeon. Pulls need some set up. Kill priorities must be established. Dps that aren‚Äôt focusing on the kill list should be kicked. 
---
Unfortunately, many people are stupid, and will disregard the proper way to go about a wow classic dungeon. This has existed since the dawn of mmos. Don‚Äôt get discouraged! If you get kicked because the dps we‚Äôre taking avoidable damage, consider it a blessing to avoid the headache of dealing with uninformed/ignorant players. 
---
The best way to avoid this is to find a guild, or a group of others who know how to run dungeons the right way.
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware blizzard has never resorted to things like chat logs and publicity to roll out mass exploit bans like this because it allows people who keep things under wraps to get away with it like you said. They will likely use a tool to sweep servers and check each characters combat logs to track boss encounters and calculate time between boss kills in dungeons and number of kills for raids bosses etc.
---
It‚Äôll be easier once you get flash of light @20
---
I think they will, they made so much money off of it before.
---
The guy can say whatever he wants now, but he's simply changing his argument because his initial post was stupid. Referencing matchmaking in a wow thread about groups means you're referring to dungeon finder. Period.
---
Wand it, fastest way we can get a tag.
---
I mean, your just looking for a reason to get mad. Maybe that isn't how you invite members but does it matter if he uses that method. I agree with what hes saying. If you don't like it then decline and go on.  If I had no guild and I received this message/invite, I would accept. Then I can get to know the whole guild and decide if I fit in. Is that wrong because that's not what you would have done?
---
Use the addon Spy.
---
You can type /spy kos NAME
---
Gives you a warning when theyre near.
---
But what BoE are you reserving that you actually need in a dungeon? This is just made up situation. People all need on expensive BoE twink gear, but that isnt something you would res in dungeon anyway. Maybe flask recipes is like the one time this is true.
---
There's nothing to hash out, dude.
---
You've said repeatedly that you can just 5 DPS the 55-60 dungeons, because it's "efficient."
---
The only way 5 DPS can efficiently clear a dungeon is if they grossly over-geared, over-leveled for the dungeon, *or* there's a specific scenario where they're able to AoE farm mobs or kite a boss.
---
Your whole "tanks and healers aren't needed at all" thing is grossly wrong and stupid.
---
You'll learn that once you're high enough level to play those dungeons.
---
No amount of childish posturing or discord chats will change that.
---
How do people level that fast? i don understand it
---
I just use mouse scroll forward for attack, mouse scroll backward for passive.
---
Yea, this exactly. You can dunk a lot of Mages as a Warrior if you know what you're doing. The really good Mages will still win, but most people aren't that good.
---
prior to wow it was common knowledge that to level in mmorpgs, you grinded.
---
Short answer, no. You're just redoing the dungeon. iirc, setting your hearth to the nearby village would let you do the exact same thing by just dropping group, adding maybe a &lt;2 minute walk to the scepter altar. People saying otherwise are just triggerhappy because the layering exploit that was just revealed is incredibly major and understandably upsetting, and the bans coming for it are justified. If they fix it, they fix it, but no one's getting banned for a Mara farm that's been deemed acceptable for ages.
---
If you stick with the mage your priest friends will need plenty of peel and protection in BGs.  There's hardly a better class for that. 
---
The play styles are wildly different so it's hard to compare.
---
Is there any reason you couldn't have both?
---
You guys are just trolling, right? Like, you don't actually believe this, right?
---
the dungeon finder wasn't added until late wrath of the lich king. Classic doesn't have any dungeon finder in it. You just have to spam chat to build groups.
---
Can someone ELI5 what is happening. What does axe on reserve mean?
---
Life advise: the best you can do to morons and entitled cry babies: Ignore them. Who cares, they'll eventually move on, you'll eventually move on.
---
Root them and actively hunt them down
---
I mean they do have undead, bulls, ragers and trolls.
---
/petattack
---
/petfollow
---
can use those commands in a macro, with modifiers or however you need to get your pet to attack or set it to follow so it comes back.
---
At the time I was excited my Ret was more viable but as time has gone on I‚Äôm not sure if getting rid of support classes was a good thing.
---
I think I might like TBC class balance better as it meant less skilled players could still raid progression content on support roles.
---
WotLK was where I split away from a long term Guild as they couldn‚Äôt clear the content as the game became hyper balanced around cutting edge play from every player.
---
After Ulduar when ToC came out and Heroic everything became the new content pattern it got even worse. It wasn‚Äôt just a handful of high end bosses, it became the whole raid. Typical farm nights were gone and every night became progression until everything was dead.
---
Normal and Heroic are brain dead minus maybe the last boss in an instance and Mythic has become increasingly tedious. After multiple CEs in Retail and multiple top parses on my Ret with over a year played time since 2007 I finally called it quits back in March.
---
I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong, being in favor of ‚Äúbring the player, not the class‚Äù is perfectly valid and understandable. I just feel like we lost something when we lost true support classes. It made progression raiding too exclusive.
---
It's not just frost mages, everyone seems to act real entitled to quest mobs these days. Questing in the Badlands was half grouping up to push Alliance away from mob spawns, and half fighting other Horde for tags while getting spammed with /rude, /spit, /shoo and various profanities. The game has been overcrowded since launch, how are you still throwing tantrums about competing for quest mobs? It just makes me sad.
---
Yup.
---
The amount of shitty mages makes me happier to be playing a mage. I've only ever played a mage and I can't wait to bait out all of their counterspells later and then clap them.
---
The entire set of quests on that island were cursed as hell on pservers with mobs running through the castle walls and things aggroing from the top room while you were on the bottom floor pulling the entire castle.
---
I don't consider this an exploit. Frankly, I think punishing exploits is dumb. These people were just playing the game the way it was programmed at the time. Don't hate on them because they found an extremely efficient way to progress that you chose not to use.
---
New Blizzard is obvious, but Frost Nova isn't about the damage, you use it for the roots. Gotta save money where you can before you get your mount.
---
You're just creating an echo chamber of "mage are bitches". 
---
Now you're going to reply to me that you don't target all mages with this post, only the bad mannered ones and I will answer you that it doesn't matter, people are not good at not having prejudice.
---
I always invite everybody I see who is waiting for the same spawn.
---
Definitely yes, but can you describe why it feels weak?   
---
Is the damage low, or it's just that you are very fragile or that you have to sit around for hp/mana a lot?
---
are there any addons that will tell me how many yards away my target is?
---
You can't boost from 110-120, which is what these potions were for. So that whole argument is kind of shot right there.
---
And lots of Hordes died. Wonderful.
---
I believe Arathi Highlands and the Badlands are also options. Arathi doesn't have a lot of quests on the low end of the 30s. I didn't quest through the Badlands so I'm not sure there.
---
There are a few quests in STV in the low 30s. The first couple of hunting quests are fair game. Then, as horde, you can probably do the quest for troll tusks from Grom'gol. Those mobs are level 33+ and you may have a hard time if you're not 31-32. You're right that the zone feels much better in the mid 30s since you can do far more quests at that level.
---
Desolace is probably better for the mid 30s too. I believe you can start some of the centaur faction grinding around 32-33 and squeeze a good amount of experience out of that though.
---
Sounds about right for classic lol. My lock is like 13 so I‚Äôm not on your lvl :p have you tried making/eating a sandwich while you do dungeons? Dot and go back to eating? 
---
In all honestly I think locks don‚Äôt have the lvl of threat reduction talents mages do. Not pulling off the tank and throttling dps is a thing tho. Sometimes your D is just to big for the tank to handle.

&lt;Kill Loot Repeat&gt; | Shazzrah | Horde | Semi-hardcore raiding guild
---
Heya!
---
***Kill Loot Repeat*** is recruiting anyone level 45+ in Shazzrah with a keen interest in raiding.
---
**Backstory:** We started out as many guilds do, as a group of friends who have been playing together for 15+ years. We have always enjoyed this amazing game together, and our goal for Classic WoW is to go all the way to the end, and we‚Äôre looking for people to accompany us in our journey!  
---
So far we have managed to create a small community inside Shazzrah (150+ members), but we‚Äôre still looking for more to consolidate our raiding roster.
---
**Raiding Schedule:** We consider ourselves to be a semi-hardcore guild and are going to raid 2 times a week.  
---
Raid days are going to be Sundays and Tuesdays, from 20-23 GMT +1. We might add another day (probably Friday) if there is an interest from many of the raiders.
---
**Loot system**: DKP, although we are still choosing which of the vast plethora of DKP systems we want.
---
**What will you do outside raid schedules?**  
---
Outside raid days we have a lot of people that are keen on doing some PvP, especially World PvP. Most of us played in Vanilla and there is something special about the epic battles that World PvP originates. Come phase 2 you should expect much action in this front.  
---
Other than that, atm we are 100% focused in forming guild groups for dungeoning, to get people to 60 and to help gearing those who have already reached that max level.
---
If you‚Äôre alone and are looking for company throughout your Classic journey, I hope we can be your home üì∑
---
**Class availability:**  
---
ATM we‚Äôre still heavily recruiting anyone with a keen interested in raiding, ***however***, tank slots have been filled and we are in **dire need of healers**.  
---
Of course we would rather to have a 40-man raid filled with the considered ‚ÄúOP‚Äù specs, but any spec and class will be considered, regardless of the build.
---
**Any special requirements for joining?**
---
* You should at least be able to participate in one of our raiding days.
---
* We would like our members to be active on our Discord.
---
* In Discord we advise anyone to have a proper mic and to be able to speak a decent amount of english.
---
**I‚Äôm sold, where do I sign?:**  
---
If you are looking to join our small community, feel free to whisper H√©llscream or Camelbob in game. You can also jump into our discord and chat a bit with us before considering to join.
---
**DISCORD:** discord.gg/Ej7U5Qv (just copy and paste this link and paste in the address bar in discord)
---
SexyMap! It's amazing and looks fantastic.
---
Enhance currently; at 40. 
---
I was half tempted to Spec full defensive skills in enahnce and try to tank since tanks (and by tanks i mean tanks that can actually hold threat on more than one target), are like unicorns.
---
Hello everyone! I‚Äôm coming from r/all. Would someone please reply with an explanation of what‚Äôs going on? I find this very interesting and am not that busy at work at the moment. Thanks.
---
I believe there is an option for current segment or overall data when you mouse over the options, if I‚Äôm not mistaken this is what you‚Äôre looking for.
---
That was wotlk, in BC you couldnt get tabard till exalted with faction.
---
Yup! Tho I have been thinking about it since I saw this post and if you‚Äôve ran a place a ton of times and politely make it known in advance I guess it‚Äôs not that big a deal. Like most things it just comes down to how u approach it
---
As a mage I'll AoE farm where I want haha fuck you lol
---
It could just be me but I don't think I ever bought a clock. I had one, a red LCD one like that which my parents put in my room, and those things refused to die. And then later I used my phone. But that still would have been on my desk in 2006.
---
I don't know about the community, but when I originally played vanilla I only had 1 other person I knew IRL to play with and he was super uninterested in the game.
---
This time around I have a steady group of 5 friends and we're all super into it. We rotate and form groups together, help each other with quests and professions. This is what I always wanted, so its like reliving the past but the way I envisioned it.
---

Skeram? I'm pretty bummed it ended up like this. Skeram was supposed to be the big Herod/Stalagg spill over realm but looks like it just pure Horde.
---
Lmaooo this dude
---
Just to chime into this. Hunters fall off with each phase as the pet doesn't scale with gear (at all) so damage wise they wont be as good as the at the start. Hunters usually get no more than 3 spots per raid, so competition is high for hunters at end game.
---
I remember in wrath I ran the raid in wintergrasp(vaults of something?)
---
The leader ninja'd all the tokens that dropped off the last boss and maybe one was his class. Dalaran was buzzing with his name for like the next week.
---
This title can double as an entitle.
---
I think it could be possible but very difficult. You would have to perfectly time the energy tick every time without seeing the timer (is this possible lol?). Also you'd have keep track of your mana (in your head?) somehow so you know if you can powershift or use heals etc. Rogues use energy timers too and warriors use swing timers, so don't feel like you're cheating by using add-ons to do more dps.
---
People have been 60 for a few weeks now.
---
If someone plays an average of X hours per day, their class is Y, their group composition is YZABC, and they use EFGK consumables, what is the theoretical maximum of non-exploitative kills *for each boss in each dungeon*?
---
If you can't answer that question, then it might be a sign that you're oversimplifying this issue.
---
Is using a 2h sword a good option for a hunter? I googled a bit and some people said yes because dps typically isn‚Äôt a priority for hunters and  ‚Äúdamage burst‚Äù is better. Is this the case?
---
You‚Äôll never beat my charge-hamstring combo! 
---
/s
---
No, no you shouldn't. I think theres a fine line between people avoiding a queue and killing UBRS boss 30x in 1 hour and making 2k in gold.
---
Those are for classic servers.

I also played a mage all of vanilla its not that hard to make it either. I would gladly help someone out. You just sound like someone I wouldn't want to play with in general.

yes.
---
THere is a 400ms delay of the pressing of the key, and the stuff registering on the server, and whatever your ping is of receiving the data.  It could feel like your FD is bugged, but you wait long enough to stay in FD and you will get out of combat.  It is people playing on really good internet, but the game itself is set in the really bad internet age.  That is why a lot of times when you want to trade someone you run past each other, then come back to the right position to trade.
---
Because it turns you on?
---
With that logic, you wouldn't fuck the same person twice in the same room and same posture
---
I can't speak for Linux, but I can confirm this isn't just an issue in Windows, I've had it happen in Mac OS as well.
---
Post production manager, whole team works on Macs... I specifically do a ton of copy pasting... It's gotten to the point that I always just spam cmd+c a few times just for good measure.
---
+1 zperl is great.
---
Yes-- weaving is what should be done. It doesn't make sense to wait until oom for 2 reasons. 1) Demon skin adds some pretty good health regeneration that you'd miss out on and 2) drain life does a good bit of damage itself, and if your already full health, it won't be nearly as beneficial to use. I also make sure to put Siphon Life on all mobs that have been pulled, that way I'm getting health back from each.
---
This is not how it was in Vanilla, there is plenty of video evidence available.
---

---
When do you want to start exclusively doing dungeons to grind BiS?
---
I have been primarily healing BRD for 53+, in shadow spec. I'm heavily considering swapping specs now at 57 to start healing level 60 dungeons, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to find groups or not at 57.
---
That's a solid strat, I'll give it a try next time.
---
Hmm, I spy a guildie.
---
Warrior lvl 50 looking for suggestion where to go next.
---
I've only leveled in dungeons. ZF is starting to slow down but from what I gather I should keep at it until 52. Ppl only seem to do mara for the quests and then the boss runs. I've heard that there are xp runs in BRD that you can do at 52? What about ST?
---
I hope you pulled everything on that group and wiped them
---
Rogues ninjaing with pickpocket, and that warlock keeps ninjaing soulstones. Ninjas everywhere, I tell you.
---
&gt; sand at the beach 
---
When all that sand reaches end game they'll all be rolling need for the same cloth gear.
---
Whole raids full of mages, but only 1 cloth item drops X)
---
I'll illustrate the point using my hunter.  As a BM hunter, I can easily take mobs higher level than me, several levels higher, in fact.  But even with mobs my own level or +1, my pet takes more damage and I have to use more abilities to take the mob down in a reasonable amount of time.  So not only is the killing slower, I am stopping to heal the pet and/or drink much more often since I am likely using more mana than I can replenish naturally between mobs.  
---
Now give me mobs that are -2/-3 and I can kill them quickly with just one serpent sting, one arcane shot and autoshooting.  Likewise, what damage my pet takes will probably be recouped before I get to the next mob.  So basically I can kill indefinitely without ever (or almost never) stopping at all until my bags are full.  Sure, I get less xp per kill, but I get a lot more kills and, more importantly, I get a lot more gold.  Since acquiring gold and not xp is the point, there you go.
---
You keep pwning me! Wait, or am I pwning myself again? Dang, wait or is it the street sentiment? Gah! Dang it is funny how that works.
---
I once went to kill a mobs for a quest, and a mage saw me happily pulling mobs in the area. He proceeded to pull too many mobs to tag them before I could, I proceeded to sit and laugh as I watched him die. I wasn‚Äôt even trying to fight him for mobs lol.
---
I had a Tauren Druid named "Bullshift" and blizz didn't care
---
If you feel the need to resort to being offensive and racist to try and be _funny_, clearly your sense of humor is severely lacking.
---
Mage here, currently lv 36, bit slow at the grind due to working 50 hours a week. Fuck them. It‚Äôs Classic; it‚Äôs in their best interest to build positive relationships with everyone. It‚Äôs a few mobs, they (we) have to kill hundreds to Lv, they(we) will live. They could be Cool Boy McCools and just invite you so you can get the quest done and be on your way. Yeah, the XP is halved but, it keeps you from being there which is the prime objective, to be honest. With all that being said, I have to add this; no way you could pull more than 3 mobs as a Hunter so don‚Äôt act hard and say you could mess the pull up by tagging them üòä They would just watch you die and take the mobs after your lifeless body hits the ground üòò
---
From 40 onwards it's quite straightforward as Shadow Form drastically reduces damage taken. Otherwise Priest's good bet is to try "outlast" the rogue instead of fighting him. DoT him, heal yourself and whittle him down. This is especially true for Horde Priests, Devouring Plague, Weakness and Shadow Shield are all amazing anti-rogue tools.
---
And my inventory!

Not ready for raiding yet, still enjoying the slower pace leveling and grouping and doing quests together than Retail where everyone just solos everything.

I hope that isn't gangster rapped

some Quotes below, but you want to prioritize agility &gt; Strength/Attack Power &gt; stamina &gt;spirit &gt; intelect  
---
 "Agility is a primary stat for both Rogue and Hunter."  
---
"Most pieces of gear you acquire as a Hunter will not have any **strength**  on them, and the ones that do strength is generally a minor part of the  equipment. It is a slight DPS increase, though nowhere near as good as  Agility or even just plain Attack Power. "  
---
 "Stamina is a vital Attribute for PvP.  In PvE, Stamina isn't as quite as important, but it can still play a vital role when dealing with Boss mechanics! "  
---
"Overall intellect does not do a whole lot for Hunters. "  
---
"Spirit isn't that useful either, though it does provide some passive health and mana regeneration for the Hunter making it good for leveling faster because of less downtime."
---
Good analysis, won't argue with that, just personally noticed HoTs didn't work well for me. I will note that my Rank 1 is more for 100% HP crybabies or for dropping on lowbies in passing.
---
I'm a 35 mage with enchanting. I stopped disenchanting greens and blues I get because I decided to stop leveling my professions in favour of saving up for a mount.
---
I've been vendoring stuff I would previously disenchant. Is it more lucrative for me to disenchant then AH?
---
That's not an exploit.
---
What is the importance of #showtooltip? Shouldn't you be able to cast Aspect without the showtooltip part?
---
TLDR is: OP ran through a dungeon with a group and then at the final boss, the party leader of that dungeon turned the loot rules on to where only he could distribute the loot. Thus locking out anyone else in the group from getting a chance at any loot. In this case the Ravager axe that most warriors want and most likely OP wanted.
---
Usually something like this is discussed before the dungeon run not at the final boss. So basically the OP got the rug pulled out from under him.
---
Everyone in my group said private servers were significantly harder compared to this
---
&gt; So many people wanted Classic, just so they can play it like retail (Rush 60 by mindlessly go from quest marker to marker with questie, or aoe dungeon farming)
---
lol, people alt-tabbed tp sites like Thottbot all the time in vanilla, and questing addons were super popular by 1.12.
---
Very nice lol, it's my favorite spell.
---
Sacrifice your Imp, elemental weakness your target charge up that soulfire and watch them melt.
---
Spirit strength and stamina are lowest priority, but not useless - if an item has agi and strength I could still use it for the agi even though it would benefit the rogue more. If an item has intellect, that‚Äôs still a large upgrade for me, even though it is for casters too (and I‚Äôm not talking about cloth gear either)
---
They are unoriginal and cant think of a better name without alt key codes
---
Perma ban.
---
In addition to perma-banning any large amount of gold sent to other accounts as well. Streamers included.
---
I think you missed the entire point. Are you unfamiliar with the Tier 0.5 upgrade questline? I suggest looking it up.
---
The inside of this pc......RTX 2080ti intel OC 9900 processor....but nostalgia tho! xD
---
I hope they ban him just because of that horrible picture. I refuse to play the video, but I'm internally imaging a hyena cackling idiot in his mom's basement who screams into the microphone.
---
No Smunky to my knowledge.
---
Shitty behavior is shitty behavior and there‚Äôs really no excuse. This guy had the audacity to basically wipe his group for an item that MIGHT drop. You can want/need an item but there‚Äôs a certain way to go about it, especially in a party with 4 other people.
---
Gimme OSRS but for WoW update method.
---
I'm not sure there's any confirmed source that this was used in a raid. Probably a good way to get a suspension/ban...
---
I do this and my childhood was pretty terrible. Some of us actually learn from bad experiences though.
---
Sorry, did not realized they banned for that.
---
In World of Warcraft there are dungeons that require you to team up with people to take down because they are more challenging. Taking down bosses in these dungeons drop nicer gear that needs to be split somehow between the players (One guy might get the helmet, the other might get the sword, etc.) You can probably see where the drama comes in.
---
So there‚Äôs built in systems in the game to determine who gets what. One way basically allows people to ‚Äúroll a die‚Äù to see if they win an item they want. Another way called ‚ÄúMaster Looter‚Äù designates one person to have all authority in dividing the loot. The jerks in this screenshot started the dungeon with the ‚Äúrandom‚Äù way, but then at some point they sneakily changed it to ‚ÄúMaster Looter‚Äù to basically swipe the good stuff for themselves. These dungeons also usually take a long time to do so it‚Äôs a pretty shitty thing to not be transparent about.
---
the video is cut right before anything happens. its literally just a guy saying "classic is different from vanilla"

New priest here the wand stopped me going back to a rouge, 10 levels later at level 21 and I'm having the best time I've had in wow and learnt a lot more with macros and what not. Love the priest life
---
There is no rule governing how many ores and herbs you farm or how many times you kill Hogger. There is, however, set rules for how many times you can run 5 man instances and how many times you can down raid bosses. Someone having 3 times the amount of arcanite crystals they should reasonably have access to does not break the game in quite the same way as having a guild full of folks with Thunderfurys and full sets of tier gear on week 3.
---
Should they ban half the player base then?
---
Everyone and their mom has been abusing layering
---
Learn to read idiot, I'm not saying they should be immune to criticism. Just that they are doing a lot better than most other game companies today and have always done so. Read a book kid.
---
Same for me, always works
---
Was?
---
How do you join the looking for group channel? It's not default in cities I don't think
---
&gt;	You need on items meant for your class. You don‚Äôt need on items which are only an upgrade because your current item is trash.
---
Disagree. If it‚Äôs an upgrade, hit need. It‚Äôs what the button is for.
---
Mage here whenever i see someone doing the same quest as me i invite them to the party and help them finish it !!! But hey they are a bunch of spoiled dudes out there..

I know exactly what comic you're talking about, it's a gnome talking to a flight master and he's like "Wouldn't you want me to not keep my feet on the ground?!"

Lemme see if I can find it.
---
Went as a tank to one of those "AoE runs" in SM cath. First time with a death in SM. And there were multiple... I'm pretty sure a normal run with proper pulls and no downtime is more efficient.
---
Had a druid tank come in with a fishing pole and cloth gear on once..then need rolled on the 2h mace and said sorry war i need it more. Druid was level 24..lol
---
If you ever see one of the opposing faction grinding them hit them with a Viper Sting and laugh as they get killed.
---
Prowling as a Druid I think I keep giving the appearance that I‚Äôm being aggressive, I only want to stealth open on mobs üò≠
---
If you're a mage trying to spellcleave in a regular group, then you're going to be the mage that pulls aggro on everything and then dies while complaining about the tank/healer.
---
It's sad, too, because mages can also excel in groups like that. Sheep, silence, great dps, etc.
---
It's hard to beat a good mage.
---
Why I left:( I wanted to be on a high pop realm, but as alliance that world became very hostile, couldn‚Äôt grind mobs anywhere from 45 plus without getting camped
---
Made the swap to heartseeker, best choice I ever made
---
So much this. Everyone wants to try to cleave despite not having any idea how. So then they pull the entire room while I‚Äôm drinking at 30% mana and are surprised when I can‚Äôt heal them.
---
Same, day after launch. Probably would have spent it in the queue anyways
---
Agree with someone else - that mouse is one of the best designs ever, and they're almost indestructible. Great setup BTW - Gateway2000 - niiiice!  :-)
---
The group changes the loot rules right before the last boss so they can have 1 specific item for their tank/Warrior (looks like 3-4 of the 5 ppl are in same guild or are friends) - reserving an item can be done, but normally this is discussed before a run starts so people don't waste their time if they also want the item or don't agree. This weapon in particular they are referring to is part of the current melee AoE meta for mid level content.
---
OP notices the Loot change before boss pull, and you can see the resulting convo where they boot him and go on to fight the boss.
---

Does it bug anyone else that the world map zone boundaries bear very little resemblance to actual playable zone areas?
---
Yea, locks give me trouble til I get travel form. Then I just have to constantly run in, attack, run out, heal, repeat.
---
No, I'm a complete asshole. That's why you shouldn't invite EVERYONE to your guild, because people like me are out there and only want to fuck up your guild's tra la la.
---
I don't even accept an inv, I tell people to tag as many as they can and I'll kill them all for them so they get full loot and xp. I get people hate aoe grinding mages so I try my best to reverse that image.
---
I can hear it in their tone of "voice", they're over 18, which is all the more unfortunate IRL.

Wait a second.. couldn't you pull the Drake from wetlands, that is required for the Horde to do the Onyxia attunement quest bug him out there and the horde could not attune anymore for a week?

It uses census data from an add-on then people upload it.  It's not perfect, but it'll give you a decent idea.

See I plan on being an earlish raider, problem is for raider engineering is BIS. But has zero gold making value
---
I think it's just because layering is applied at the realm or at least continent level, so dungeons just came along for the ride.
---
Based off the wowhead survey published over the weekend, Kirt has the third-worst faction imbalance
---
Wtf. Why is there even an option to change it midway after accepting it?
---
This is why I love Reddit.
---
That's exactly correct. I might have some screen shots if anyone's interested but I'm at work.
---
No layering would make it completely unplayable given modern numbers on servers.  Hell no. They are going to get banned so we all can move on. I hate to quote billzard un ironically but you think you do, but you don't.
---
Yup, the bubble is just a false sense of protection at that point.

This kind of shit is why retail is the way it is. I‚Äôm so glad they made it personal loot on everything.

2) I got BS Pattern for Mithril Spurs last night. Currently worth like 15g on my server.

Naw there are tons of quests in south shore to pick up and most of them are the highly sought after kill X amount quests. I did wetlands but skipped duskwood and red ridge. I just logged on to check out STV and it was super mild this morning and was able to get all the initial quests done in no time. I think it just comes down to the time of day. All the kids are in school atm so I didn‚Äôt get ganked a single time.

It simply didn't fit into any of the professions.

Do upgraded skills not automatically equip themselves?  I had read that they didn't, but whenever I upgrade something it seems to automatically replace the old one in my bars.

This is a side debate and one that I dont care to involve in so Ill keep it short. Absolutely less players were focused on ah, but thay doesn't mean noone else was. The items I utilised were high supply / high demand and as many players were, as we all should know, leveling proffessions and using even using them to generate more silver for skills etc. many players had the chance to see this lucrative opportunity.

I guess you're in the minority then.

Spot on. We should be extremely weary that we are all welcoming this trend to gaming with open arms. There a fine line between breakneck content production and cynical recycling, and we are much closer to the latter. This is an obvious way to bump up subscription numbers between games, to get people back on battle net etc. That it took them so long to deploy such an obvious marketing coup, one that they spent years quashing with teams of lawyers, should worry everyone. We are accepting that we will never get an experience like 2004 WoW so we will just settle for its facsimile. I like playing classic again but if anyone thinks this is an omen for good things to come in the industry, you are crazy. They are gonna spit old games back at us with updated graphics and call it a win.

It's not quite as extreme as people would talk it up, but it does get a bit more difficult as you go on. Once you start getting higher up it'll get more taxing on resources, and there will be less quests making leveling take a bit longer. Additionally, class plays a big part of it. Paladins and Druids are going to have a much easier time surviving than Warriors or Rogues for example since they have strong healing and don't use much mana for damage.
---
Below level 10 is essentially a tutorial. Mobs are a bit easier, quests are very straightforward, and your out of combat regen is quite a bit higher.
---
When I was level 8 I hadn't even left the starting zone yet.
---
Every player is different, and you may find it gets more challenging as you level and enter new zones. You'll also find that the time it takes you to gain a level also increases the higher your level.
---
I have killed several warriors with rank 1 frostbolt nova and blink. They literally cant do shit after initial charge/intercept
---
I'll never understand groups like this. Instead of being an asshole just don't invite classes who can use a 2h axe. Really it's not that complicated.
---
Back in Vanilla, I think I only ever saw one mage AoE farming. I'm starting to see it all over the place in Classic.
---
I've mostly been able to play around it, but they're making it difficult for me to get the lesser elementals I need for my quest in the Badlands.
---
Good thing I'm patient and need a ton of iron/mithril. I'm just looping around the Badlands, trying to kill a couple elementals every time I pass.
---
Fighting a rogue is like AoE grinding as prot.  You just block him to death.
---
Yeah I can usually just do the quest for them in one or two pulls and then they leave lol
---
A lot of fun plots to the quests there. Pop culture tie ins.
---
First of all, I never claimed I wanted anything from classic.  You're just putting words in my mouth.  Just because a lot of people wanted "the vanilla experience" doesn't mean thats what everyone wanted, and definitely doesn't mean every player HAS to play according that.  Yea leveling is pretty much the whole game, but that doesn't prove your point at all.  Some people will just enjoy questing/leveling more with a quest addon.  Some people will like classic for other reasons than questing.  You can't say someone isn't playing the game right because how you play and have fun is entirely subjective; especially since it doesn't affect how you play at all.
---
It used to be called Omen Threat Meter :) There is now a Classic Threat Meter but haven't tried it yet.
---
Ah, I see. Thanks for answering
---
Blizzard had 3 options:
---
1. Use the final state of Vanilla as the starting point for Classic. Basically Easy Mode.  
---
2. Make Classic progressive just like Vanilla, a 1:1 recreation.   
---
3. Make Classic progressive *and* up the difficulty slightly to account for better computers, connections, add-ons, more seasoned players, etc.
---
What we wanted was #2 or #3. What we got was #1.
---
Name checks out.
---
I hear that excuse a lot. There's a fundamental difference between questie and tabbing out to do thottbot. Tabbing out to look something up on thottbot takes work. You weren't just tab out looking up a quest *immediately* upon accepting it. You would give it a genuine shot, and if you couldn't find it, you could either ask general chat (promoting communication between players) or tabbing out and looking it up on thottbot. 
---
With questie, it's just stream lining the experience to go as fast as possible, taking away the sense of journey and exploration and turning it into mindlessly going from one dot on your map to another dot on your map, exactly like retail wow.  You don't go through every nook and cranny of a town to find quests you might have missed because you can just go to the dot on the map, just like retail wow. It turns questing from a small section of your long journey to max level into just a chore that is delaying you from reaching max level.
---
With questie, you don't need to communicate with other players at all.  Imagine Classic WoW if Mankrik's Wife was just a dot on the map you could see at all times. There's no reason to ask where she is. No sense of mystery. You already know where to go from start to finish, just like retail. There's no sense of getting lost in the world, as the game was intended to be. 
---
I'm not even against looking stuff up if you can't figure it out for yourself after a genuine attempt (and asking other players),  but using questie just turns everything into a grind. It's just a retail wow habit.
---
Mage here, and I fully agree that untouched mobs are free for the taking from anyone (isn't that common sense?), but messing with someone's aoe pull is really fucking BM imo.
---
Ok, thank you for that information.
---
So the potions only applied to level 110+ characters?
---
I didn't.  A lot of main tanks do.  A turtle build 5/0/46, is garbage for pvp and questing/farming.
---
Having to bounce back and forth while getting hefty repair costs is very expensive.
---
I'm so excited to have all the Fraggle Rock/ Nintendo Easter eggs back. And the Linken quest line!

How do you be careful of that?

You're right. I missed that. I don't know what "I down own a just" means tho.

"Most people think this is a shitty practice"
---
How do you figure that. Most people in wow? Most people in this sub? Most people in these comments?
---
You say most people like you have done a poll. Classic wow sub is full of the same type of person and not a good representation of WoW's player base. This is just you making a big deal out of something that is very minute.
---
I can tell you're triggered. 
---
You don't have to justify your greed to me, I understand it well enough.
---
What classes rolled on it btw?
---
Retail WoW - Single player game with multiplayer options. 
---
Classic WoW - Multiplayer game that punishes you for not having friends. 
---
That‚Äôs basically my view of it.  Neither is better or worse if you‚Äôve never played before, but classic is a lot better if you enjoy more of a challenge across the board and want to have a more active community.  You‚Äôre kind of forced to make friends and find people to do things with.
---
* Regen is buffed before lvl 10, so you don't usually need much if any food.
---
* 1v1 at level 8 you should always win, no exceptions.  Some classes have more trouble than others with 2+ but most can at least run away.
---
* You're in the starting zone.  It's not that big and there's not many quests, and most of them are centered on 1-2 quest hubs.  Of course you don't need help here.
---
* Levels before 10 come pretty quickly but there's an increased requirement for each level.  Soon they won't come so quickly.
---
How hard it is was probably overdone somewhat, but play up to lvl 30 or something then go play retail for a bit and you'll see the huge differences.
---
Nah just keep levelling. You‚Äôll get a decent green soon enough.
---
there is a website for figuring them out,
---
https://f00l.de/wowtranslator.php
---
Depends on the sort of game you want to play. Both are rather different.
---
Classic WoW is a slower and more methodical game. It's about the adventure, meeting people, and grouping up. Your character is just one of many out in the world and you'll often need others to succeed. The game thrives on its social aspects and can be quite grindy at times.
---
Modern WoW is much more game-like. The leveling experience is streamlined and you can blast through leveling zones on your own. You can click a button and automatically build a group for dungeons--very little communication required. The game narratively treats you more like a hero as you level up. The game focuses a lot on the toughest content available at the maximum level and it is more mechanically challenging once you reach that point.
---
There are more differences than that and you can certainly have a fun social experience with modern WoW, but that mostly revolves around finding a guild that does raids.
---
Classic WoW is a more social experience and more about the journey. Modern WoW is a more independent experience (initially) and focuses on a more mechanically challenging endgame. Both are perfectly good games to give a try right now, just depends on what you're looking for.
---
How do you do that in a raid? Someone leaves the reinvites 39 people??
---
Yo chill out.
---
You always get compliments on sloppy runs where people are almost dying because they notice getting healed. If everything goes well and you're keeping people topped off then three out of four of your party members can just forget you're there.
---
Will blizzard ban everyone that exploited the dungeons
---
Respawn rates in vanilla were like this.  You basically have as little as 15 minutes for respawns.  Each instance was tailored to add difficulty, this was incentive to make sure groups were prepared and worked together to avoid wipes.
---
I think the patrols in Deadmines are as low as 5 minutes for the Swordsman/Wizard combo.  
---
For SM Cath/Arms/Lib the first respawns happen at 15 minutes, certain mobs can take longer.  For the GY is also 15 minutes but it comes with quirks, only certain mobs respawn, specifically though, the single mobs named "Unfettered Spirit" can be farmed on a 15 minute timer with a 5% chance to respawn as a rare boss of the 3 in there.
---
how do you differentiate an exceptionnal player and someoen with 5 working neurones for MC tho?
---
'' congrats, you move out with barron geddon bomb'' ?
---
What the fuck has Blizzard done?!?!
---
No one cares about your Mara farm.
---
Something that could easily be done accidentally by hitting shift.
---
Some of us had to choose pvp realms to play with RL friends. But then again, it's what I naively chose back in vanilla too, so I know what's in store for me.
---
Nah only increases the armor reduction
---
Didn't know about that, thanks!
---
I'm pumped about going to Feralas. I love the dense forest zones so much, with the mist/fog that'sall over it. Make playing a hunter feel so damn immersive
---
Ensidia and saronite bombs glitch. Same shit - exploiters deserve perma bans, fuck their reputation. Burn em all.
---
I draw fantasy maps, mainly for D&amp;D but I was excited to return to Classic WoW so I drew my favourite starting zone. It made me realise how good the maps in the game are, I couldn‚Äôt get close the quality of drawing they have.
---
Anyway, this map is free on my [Patreon page](http://www.patreon.com/mapsbyowen), I consider it fan art so hopefully it doesn‚Äôt break any copyright.
---
Let me know if you‚Äôd like to see more. Enjoy!
---
Zoura janai... katsura da!
---
Need the same help also lol it‚Äôs annoying
---
Can confirm, 2 out of 3 times I apply Immolate on a mob, it goes straight at me.
---
Until you reach end game content, need on any upgrades. When you start getting to Sunken Temple or higher is usually when people are going for prebis. Check boss loot before running the dungeons if there are any items you may be concerned about rolling need on, just ask the group if they mind if you roll for it as it would be an upgrade, etc.
---
 Just try to be courteous even when others aren't.
---
 As a warrior we catch some flak early on for upgrades as well because we can use leather mail and cloth.  Pre level 20. There is A LOT of gear and most pieces get replaced quickly anyways. Just don't take stat sticks that may be a small upgrade for you, but huge for someone else unless its p preBiS or BiS.
---
The kodos are completely silent, no running sounds, no mountspecial sounds not even any fall damage sounds, completely silent.
---
I agree. I'd be fully in favor of dungeon and raid mobs/bosses having their damage increased a little at the least. Possibly their health as well, but I don't think it'll happen.
---
I got a triple crit doing that once and the other guy was at 20% instantly.
---
Falcorn, Defender of The Alliance.
---
Maybe you're just a shitter who can never beat a druid, but if you think this is true you're a retard.  Vanilla pvp is the burstiest shit ever, most classes die in a single CC damage combo.
---
I think it's a bit much to call it selfish when they're simply doing something that is one of their classes greatest strengths. The only issue here is that they were treating this guy poorly for trying to quest as well. But there's nothing wrong with AoE farming as a class where that's the fastest way for you to level sometimes.
---
Good idea, thanks.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Rejuv, sit in bear, stun, cheetah
---
Best to do the last 5 levels or so in dungeons to get equipment.
---
Maybe respec resto at 55
---
Idk about the stat priority @60 but during leveling getting a crit saves you more time and health than slightly increased overall damage
---
I'm currently playing as a warrior and this is my ultimate fear. My favorite mage style though was 3 minute mage with duel trinkets, one shots for everyone.
---
Everyone attempting world first anything abused layering.
---
Not sure if I am alone here, but basically *anytime* I see somebody clearing doing the same quest as me, I invite them.  Quests are faster with more folks killing, and two people means twice as many successful tags.  No need to fight when we can share.
---
It doesn't really matter does it?  Me and my friends started at the same time and we are all different levels. We chat on discord and have a grand old time.
---
I rewatched with sound when I saw the power up edit, I was not disappointed.
---
Agreed a huge margin. I've been camping a mob or you know just getting mobs for quest, someone comes within range i send invite, huge percetage accept, the ones that don't were just passing thorugh, and not once but a couple times now, i'm like how many more you need? and they'll say none was just helping out WTF???? I'm f'ing HOME!!! Here to stay.
---
Freedom downtime is healing time.
---
I have that mouse.
---
I've bought 5 mouses since I decided to retire it.
---
Each one eventually breaks and I go back to that one until my next purchase.
---
like 8 other shamans
---
yeah it could be a copycat, but its just TOO MUCH of a coincidence. 
---
Hellow fellow guildy! Forgive me for being incognito, but I got a guild leader to gank. lol
---
if you know any Horde that would be down to gank this guy periodically, then lets get them rounded up.
---
Gnome and dwarf racials are both pretty solid for PvP, though.
---
I'm gonna call DSS for forcing your children to play Horde
---
Love the game.  Love this post.
---
/yell MEATS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
---
You can right click it and add it to separate tab, and it'll remove it from that main "General" window
---
ban that amonggold cunt already
---
Ask Mankrik's wife, she knows where it is.
---
Call me old fashioned but I don't really like it.
---
Not sure what their policy is now but back in the day they'd make a list of accounts flagged for botting and banned them months later. This way the bot account was already worth the money and the botters bought new ones after every ban wave. Additionally they'd make an announcement about banning thousands of botters for publicity.
---
None of you guys know the exploit.
---
People cleared to boss. Killed boss. Kicked a player and waited 45 seconds for the kicked player to go to his own instance layer and reignited him to go to his layer then kill the same boss over and over until you got EVERYTHING. Multiple people got rivendare mount that way.
---
Blizzard said bans are coming.
---
That's what this is about
---
I tried to get the 3 mobs for these heads for that undead. Her former family or something.
---
Was impossible, mages AoE grinding just constantly had them tagged or killed.
---
Literally neither of those is caused by spell batching.
---
End game and levelling are two very different things though
---
My heart goes out to you for even attempting and wasting all that time leveling as resto. Cap and respec!
---
I don‚Äôt want to be dramatic but this has killed WoW Classic for me. This exploit was up for at least a week and I don‚Äôt see a legit way to rectify the sheer amount of gold that has been funneled into the game. Banning the players and rolling back items is one thing but trying to track all of that gold is pretty much impossible.
---
I don‚Äôt see how they honestly fix this outside of making new servers altogether
---
comparing people in twitch chat to gambling, eh? 
---
Reddit has reached new heights of ridiculousness armchair psychology
---
I used to keep a notebook next to my keyboard and make notes on players like "total jerk" or "very nice", I need to start a new one for classic. Your server reputation was so important.
---
I dunno, pretty sure I was playing on an LCD by the time WoW came out.
---
I love that one of the most recent translations is "ligma"
---
thanks the the info lmao
---
Can you explain what hashtag showtooltop does? I'm working with macros in the game for the first time and want to write them myself instead of copying and pasting from the internet. I have a mage so I use stopcasting for counterspell and polymorph. 
---
Also is there a way to time delay a macro? Can I make one to conjure a bunch of water and food without having to cast the spell myself each time?
---
A lot of people seem to think it is
---
That's an odd number. On EU-Shazzrah you've been able to find 11 hordes having campfire outside U/LBRS entrance for a week. I'm afraid that's a small minority of them too.
---
What benefit does a pre-raid instance get that a instance reset doesn't get? Are people doing it to bypass the 5 instances/hour limit?
---
I like you.
---
Just hit 34 last night as a resto shaman and it‚Äôs going well for me I think. I have a bunch of friends playing and an active guild so I‚Äôm in a party 80% of the time.
---
How many times did you had to reset ragnaros? Just kidding gratz
---
Yes, but that's a good thing. It's not the same as when I first leveled when I knew nothing and was really inefficient. In fact my second character I even bought a guide to help me level faster. Classic quests are really bad about explaining stuff and helping you see where it is. Also some of the quest givers are hidden away.
---
But please mention it when searching for people then. If you write LF caster DPS you're more likely to get a positive response than if you decline everyone who is not the desired class. If I am declined by a group based on my class without it being mentioned when looking for people, my default reaction is to think you a lootwhore who only puts up a decent front.
---
&gt;What I don't get is why people bother with those groups.
---
What's not to get?
---
1. They don't need the gear that's on reserve. 
---
2. They might like the gear that's on reserve, but they can't easily join a different group without a reserve.
---
A reservation isn't any different than any of the other of many transactions players make with one another in the game. The main thing is you need to advertise it ahead of time.
---
Rogue wins until they hit the execute phase i believe, Longer fights= a warriors dream, Short fights= rogue.
---
Warrior with Recklessness, Death Wish in execute phase = nobody can compete once geared.
---
dont fap shame him
---
Hopefully they don't allow paid name changes.
---
rogue in PvE for melee dps.
---
Different times in 2005.
---
I just looked at your post history. Wow, you are truly an toxic, elitist fuck. I always thought those are just stories.
---
First of all, I can say whatever the fuck I want. And secondly, the sub is filling with a th people complaining about all kinds of shit and wanting to add/change the game. This game was never easy, and that made it fun. These days it's all about easy game play, and fast progression. There definitely is a wrong way to play a game. When playing guitar hero you don't use the guitar as a keyboard.
---
You should be fine as enhance the content isn‚Äôt as hard as we thought it was back in the day, but if you prefer Resto I‚Äôd say 55+
---
Yea my morality is that any mage spamming AoE outside of dungeon is free game. Let the questers have mob priority.
---
.... Then again I find anyone spamming dungeons equally guilty and corpsecamp people going from gadgetzan to ZF all the time
---
I'm just a poor boy, living frugally.
---
This happened to me as well on my priest a few days ago where a mage came and stood on top of me as a group of 5 murlocks killed him and he started cussing me out as I wasn't healing him. I was like dude, it's not my job to help you farm.
---
Dude it's way more efficient i have no idea why everyone thinks that trash works with elites frost is a drawn out kill not fast at all and the drinking........
---
lol? 
---
killing members of the opposite faction to take their tags...is the #1 reason to play on a pvp server. 
---
Its a pvp server, there is nothing dick about killing members of the opposite faction--ever.
---
tbh, classic is getting pretty much cancer with all these groups asking for spellcleave, mages doing AOE. All those people think they the only class that can work shit out, fuck that lol
---
Good point.  Its hard to complain if you try to fix the problem you are having.  And who doesn't want to complain!?
---
Yes but it would take a higher dosage.
---
shit, if you play mage right they can't even do anything with charge or intercept. The stun for intercept happens before the charge connects, so you can blink as soon as you see you're stunned.
---
Even without players WoWs story has multiple "the hero"s.
---

Huh, so that's the mental gymnastics human players use. Interdesting.
---
Also taurens
---
Super nice to have but probably better to keep lvling. Lvl 30 greens will replace
---
Ahh as someone whose bought most of my twink gear already I didn't even conceive people would wait to buy it. Lol
---
The alliance and the horde need to make peace. The real threat to azeroth is aoe farming mages. A truce to never interfere with someone killing an aoe farming mage of your own faction
---
Evil genius
---
There's no rush. Classic isn't going anywhere. Just play whatever you feel like in the moment. I've been stoked to get Windfury. I just hit 30, unlocked it, then decided to roll druid to dick around. No big deal. I'm getting the Shammy itch again. 
---
If you are absolutely dead set on leveling both now to get them up asap, I would let one get fully rested exp while playing the other. 
---
I can't help with those specifics. Not experienced enough in warrior or mage.
---
Calm down kiddo. It's just a game.
---
We‚Äôre on the same page! I was agreeing with you, just pointing out how silly his use of the exploit was. Like at least go all in, farming crowd pummelers is easy and quick already lol
---
I'm really hoping Blizzard drops a severe ban-hammer on abusers, regardless of what they abused it at (raid kills, dungeon boss farms, whatever).
---
No shit dude ü§£ she's like a copy of you, just a mini one
---
I don't think classicrealminfo purges its data correctly. Could be wrong.
---
Well.. I fucked up then. I just hit level 30 and I rerolled my talents and spent all my point on the resto tree.. I just really like healing. My gear is int + spirit as well.. I don‚Äôt know how much of an issue my reroll of talents is going to be though. Guess time will tell.
---
Seems reliable enough to me. There doesn't seem to be any variance within the same specific mobs. And all it does is add numbers and/or percentage to the normal health bars of targets
---
I'm more worried about why people just do random invite expecting to get quality member.
---
but then it's a RP server... so who cares about quality.
---
I had a forsaken mage named Jiz and he was banned before I made it out of tristfal glades
---
This is why I roll on Normal servers.
---
Wands should cost mana. Change my mind
---
I think more what it is is that there‚Äôs only small difference between good mage and bag mage.
---
I wish there was a huge monster atlas that has the stats for these guys, like armor and what not, as well.
---
+1 for sexy map. Just made it a clean square and increase Scale.
---
No they become extremely powerful... games not new, we know what end game pvp looks like. Warriors delete people later on.
---
    /cancelform [noform:2]

cancels all forms except number 2 on your class bar (0 is human form). To cancel any form, just do
---
    /cancelform

No not at all

If you google every quest or have it on screen

If you feel it interferes with your experience you can just not use it

Thanks a ton. I‚Äôll check it out

Oh, duh... you definitely said Epic and not Rare. lol, my bad!     
---
    
---
I‚Äôm on a lower pop server and I made a Mage alt just to give me a better shot at getting one through AoE farming! (Or at least have the money to snag it if it does ever appear on the AH!)
---
Layering also changes players you see iirc...
---
It happened in Maraudon for sure, I remember seeing gnomes swimming around in the hydra area.
---
I bet you are...LMAO
---
You are mad af. and wrong af.
---
Yeah, with grounding totem and a pot it usually doesn't matter when a mage jumps me unless I was below 50%, which then like w/e lol.
---
That phychic scream though! Always seems to make me run off in the absolute worse direction too! 
---
WF &lt;3
---
What server are you on? On my server bags are going for vendor prices. Add in the cost of making the bag and the AH cut I‚Äôm losing money.
---
Blizzard permananned those folks back in the day, but who knows what ACTIVISION-BLIZZARD will do. Turning away paying customers just doesnt seem their style.
---
60, you may have to drink more until then but you can heal everything including strat/scholo/brs as enhance. If you‚Äôre fortunate enough to get pulled in to these end game dungeons before 60 it‚Äôll make your life easier to respec, but I wouldn‚Äôt suggest doing so unless you expect to dungeon grind that last 2 levels.
---
I made one with aspect of the cheetah  and /s  SPEEEEEED  and I always have the voice of jeremy clarkson in my head when I hit it :D

At first I thought yes, and avoided any questing addons until about level 25.  Then I realized I was just looking up like a third of my quests which was getting very annoying.

Kurinnaxx already has bounty hunting threads on the forums. I feel like if it gets to the point where you have to take a bounty out on someone, that person has already won.

1hr in classic
---
I mean it's a brother forsaken and harming the humans is practically harmless. He's doing the lord's work against the warmongering Alliance.
---
Maybe this is just me, but I‚Äôll respec to resto around 55. I‚Äôm going to heal at 60 anyways, and there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll get your pre-bis gear if you‚Äôre not healing the dungeon.  After 55 you will be running so many dungeons to get attunements and gear, for me it‚Äôs a no brainer.
---
Forsaken still need to eat to survive, so it seems that the basic biological processes of human life are still running.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that their cognition is still governed by basic human biology and substances that affect cognition (e.g. stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, etc) would affect them.
---
Yeah.

which bartender do you use for classic? I can't get it to work for some reason.
---
How do you expect to hold aoe threat on a shaman?
---
As a man of culture I say that the Logitech g600 is superior. More buttons and easier to program. My favorite feature of it is the third face button you rest your ring finger on. The mouse would be perfect it it had a smaller button or two on the right side where you rest your pinky.
---
True it‚Äôs confusing sometimes.. I worry about the addon skipping zone quests tho
---
I see 4 on the front page right now...
---
Yo something is off about the dark whelpling.  My buddy got his on his 10th kill and there are like 6 in the horde AH for like 30g.   Meanwhile all other whelps are appropriately priced.
---
If you think there is any class who doesn't have access to cc I highly doubt you have ever played vanilla. Every class has access to hard cc (which is the term you were looking for earlier btw since shaman have soft cc).
---
I will leave it with you to figure out what that means.
---
May as well play retail at that point
---
Just curious if the #nochanges crew would be opposed to the hypothetical implementation of expanding the class/race combo to what's present in retail. I want a gnome priest and a troll druid :/
---
I'm as confused as you
---
Not with this method. I did not want to name drop anyone but just look up esfand.. a GM told him it was cool to kill rag back to back. Im on my lunch break so cannot find the vod right now. Regardless i have seen multiple nearly fully tier 1 players running around which is very epic. Ive seen three baron mounts as well. THAT mount. Yeah just reset layer and kill boss 30 times a day.
---
Probably won't actually at that level.  As long as your weapon is intact you should be fine. I mean, the standard for lolis is already lolable.
---
Pretty much :)
---
How the hell does a rogue find it hard they are the dps kings. They output more damage than a mage even if one is aoeing.
---
I was made back in 2004 probably when pornhub existed for 5min and torrenting vids was the way most people did it.
---
You‚Äôre a hero - even if I were the opposite faction I‚Äôd clap for you
---
It means that an item (the axe in this case) is reserved for someone else instead of being a random roll like most drops.  It's not  uncommon for someone to form a group with certain items reserved (to guarantee they get it, you see) but this is the sort of thing you mention *before* forming the group, so somebody who is also there for the axe knows not to join your group since you've reserved it.
---
The issue here is this person stated it right before fighting the boss, so if the OP was there for a chance to roll on the axe, he won't get it.
---
The incentive is fun, tbh the honor system is lame anyways so even after its added killing randos will have no "incentive"
---
Im was a 37 alliance on stalagg, transferred yesterday. Too many people quit randomly during quests because it was just impossible to do anything with how many horde there were, not to mention finding questing groups on alliance was hard to begin with. 
---
Its unfortunate, stalagg at release was looking like one of the most hype servers but it will be a pve horde only server soon. No one on alliance past level 30 will do anything besides sit in SM because dungeons are the only way to progress.
---
I bet the people who play mage also play singleplayer games on easymode
---
blizz doesn't care unless your name gets reported. all someone has to do is have themselves and a few friends report your name and then itll get changed even if it's not obscene
---
Same but if its a quest area and there aren't enough mobs to go around, they are dead.
---
I love the diablo vt.
---
The most disturbingly amazing name I saw was some random dude in General chat in STV was a gnome called Gnonce.
---
oh ok, ill try that. I didnt want it doing any funky.
---
This should be a guild name
---
&gt; predominantly preferred by young white women
---
I think that's the perception, but every party I go to, some dude in his late 30s is the one who brought them.
---
Elitists are in everything, it's not just video games. Anything with competitiveness has that "elitist" group who looks down their nose at others, some may not like it but the rest of us don't feed into it.
---
I'm not saying it's right, it's just something that's there, like bullying.
---
Ive not personally been called elitist as I despise gatekeeping but I don't pretend they don't exist and QQ when they do something or get somewhere I haven't.
---
Oh I totally get that and it makes a ton of sense... I just wish there was a way. :/
---
But... That's just what RP is, I don't understand how it relates to D&amp;D... Do they use character sheets outside the game and roll for stuff and etc?
---
Not hard when there's several exploits out there, ya know.
---
Feedback the real MVP there.
---
HS is also a threat gen
---
If you are rolling on healer gear the healer should be told, they can find another group if they want and not lose an item that might only drop 1 in 10 runs.
---
Im a mage, level 55 atm, mostly aoe world farm and some dungeons.  Im on horde side.  Not ONCE has a single fellow horde spit at me.  Not once have I seen a horde spit on another horde.  Im on Incendius.
---
Is this an Alliance only thing, everyone spitting on each other?
---
The difference is that layering was never intended to be applied to instanced content like dungeons and raids. That is literally a bug, and abusing a bug is definitely ban worthy. Asking for a layer change in guild chat to avoid PvP or to farm mobs out in the open world is, unfortunately, layering working as intended.
---
It can be resisted.
---
My bad! i had a candy in the first like 15 seconds, really sorry about that
---
Nice work!  Tirisfal is my second favorite zone right after Silverpine.
---
Especially because if the mobs kill them then they take durability damage
---
There's the camp is western plaguelands but that's fairly difficult for level 35s to use.

I ain't found shit

Ashbringer earlier there was this one gnome rogue what a dick he was to me. I got my own back tho, never saw him again
---
You definitely SHOULD see a pet bar, to issue basic commands like attack, follow, stay, etc. Are you using a custom ui that may have it disabled?
---
PoM pyro is good for some laughs. Standing up on top of the dome/cage thing in the middle of Gadgetzan is free luls on a 3 minute cd.
---
Mirah is coveted by prot warriors going into MC &amp; Ony. Keep that in mind!
---
back in the day it really made a difference being on the outnumbered side, especially for BGs, because you'd get them to pop way  more often. being on the higher numbered side sometimes you could barely get one BG to pop if you were lucky. granted now we'll have cross-realm Bgs from the start, but it still makes a difference. I notice on my server (horde dominated) that most horde don't even bother with world pvp, but most alliance certainly do and they tend to roll in groups more frequently, which means they win more often. they are forced to be better coordinated and it helps them quite a bit.
---
Thanks :D &lt;3
---
Yep Shift + Left click the icon by the minimap is super nice.  I keep mine off a lot of times now as the objective markers can hide herbs/mining nodes as well.
---
It happens.
---
Honestly I think the worst part about AOE leveling is that it sets you too far ahead of the quest zones you'd normally go quest in - not that's necessary, but sometimes there are some quests that are introductory (Shimmering Flats &gt; Badlands) that set the pace for leveling, and if you're now 10+ levels ahead, you have to go figure out where your next move is.
---
Re rolled onto blaumeux last week after getting a warlock to 55 on queuemane, couldn‚Äôt handle it. Blaumeux seems great, don‚Äôt get stuck in queues and the server has a healthy pop.
---
As a mage my self, please keep doing what your doing. Aoe grinding below 60 quest mobs is dick move to everyone else.
---
Fairbanks. I got to 40 in the first 10 days though. I also had mining as my second prof.
---
Feel free to keep your head buried in the sand. Nothing to see here folks. Just an angry lunatic who wants to scream at the world.
---
Imagine a Forsaken with the munchies.   \[Cannibalize intensifies\]
---
Mages blinking when you are CCed are terrible.
---
yeah that sounds like an exploit entirely, should've  reported with screenshots
---
It's probably because mage is the most popular class now which will invariably attract lots of noobs who don't know how to kite and cc properly. For example, I know a friend / mage coming from wow retail who thought polymorph was a useless spell. Gives you an idea.
---
Don't even respond now when mages wanna join groups for dungeons because they just wanna AOE farm and me n my homies are just trying to max out and have a laid back dungeon run
---
I've tried that a few times, but nothing changes. :/
---
What was feasible and could be pulled off without waiting another year or two (at best) was #1. The don‚Äôt have a reference client for each patch back to 1.1, they have to recreate it. Considering they weren‚Äôt aware of how popular it‚Äôd end up, it‚Äôs understandable that they would deem that amount of time investment as too high risk.
---
My eyes hurt just looking at it.
---
As a horde shaman getting on the boat in BB, i accidentally dueled a priest. Luckily my windfury was able to kill him before he got MC off (didn't know MCing people off the boat was a thing). Ally priest who saw this then MC me off the boat anyway.
---
Luckily my inn was set to Ratchet so after hearthing back, I waited at the docks and wave at both priests as they come off the boat.
---
They are not high. People are abusing layering
---
That might be a little too far imo. I get that this is a game so politics won't be as much of an issue but having a social credit score is not something I want in my video games.
---
Seems like "screenshots" and videos of the game on this subreddit are being recorded on devices that are getting more and more potato like that the bitches shouldn't have be dug up yet....
---
Side note I see this animation bug sooo often and man it looks retarded, I saw my mate do it once and told him and apparently he didn't see it only me so dunno what causes it but I wish it would get fixed.
---
Like droping ears?
---
Sounds like the game itself needs to change it so you can't change loot rules after the duty starts.
---
Do you watch sports?
---
Lol yeah bruh, just buy the rights to the entire Warcraft IP, a few million dollars in servers, and just do it yourself bruh.
---
It's so easy, too.  If you pull, Frost Nova.  If they're still on you, Ice Block and they'll all switch back to the tank.
---
Layering abuse and more people/server.
---
Can confirm. Rolled ally on Kirtonos and couldn't level past 30.
---
Probably the same as why people drive their 40 year old car from time to time. I could totally find this amusing!
---

---
And we don't want to be known as one of them, that's the point of this discussion. I'm not Jaina, you're not Varian, he's not Saurfang. There's an inescapable disconnect when you are lauded to be on the same tier as Tirion along with every other paladin player.
---
I freezing trapped a multiboxer's leader, and watched the rest just keep running down the path. Took a few potshots at them and just left. Waste of arrows.
---
I'd at least partially chalk that up to far more people taking only gathering professions while leveling and only the 60s and really dedicated people taking crafting.  I know that some things were in super high demand early on, lile liferoot was crazy expensive once the first wave of warriors were hitting their 30s.  I imagine prices will start going up once more people get around to filling out professions.
---
Plus, a lot of the money you make as a lowbie is selling stuff like wool that's a pain to farm at 60, but when 80% of the server is getting wool, it'll be super cheap.
---
You kite her. There's videos of people doing it on YouTube
---
It takes up so much time tho, which I dont hAVe
---
Hmmmm https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d4zs3b/instance_layer_exploiting_guild_blade_of_kill/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Yea you just told all the ninjas to not brag about ninja'ing lol
---
Where can I buy that desk?
---
Moo
---
&gt; free class based source of income
---
hm?
---
That's not how it works. Players would have more gold relative to the items on the AH. They would be better off. 
---
The abusers are siphoning the gold away from legit players and because those players need to spent gold on fixed cost things like abilities, mounts and repairing they have much less gold. So even though the prices on the ah are cheap, the players are proportionate much worse off. This is compounded by the fact that there's effective a price floor for AH prices since beyond a certain point it's better to just vendor it.
---
Fairbanks was chaotic to say the least
---
They supposedly scrapped the SC Ghost, but who knows, they could be working on something. I'm pretty sure we will get info on Diablo 4 this year, but we'll have to wait and see. A new MMO would be awesome though.
---
Also, if you do not rank it up, and you‚Äôre grouping with another warrior who also seems to sunder, you won‚Äôt be able to apply yours.
---
I strongly disagree with this statement.
---
There are many ways for this to go south quickly for the mage, and one warriors have their pvp trinket it becomes possible to bully mages.
---
Little things like sitting in defstance and shooting your gun while novad really add up - if the warr is an engineer he can also do a lot of tricky things.
---
Doing the lord's work, my friend.
---
I don't think you need alt, mine just does it with up.
---
Thanks for the feedback! I just started youtube like 5 days ago and english is not my first language which is why everything maybe seems more forced than it really is :P
---
&lt;3
---
In 26. I was like 12 the first time I played wow. So yeah, I grew up with kek
---
So you think people are stacking up as Horde to purposely imbalance the servers? How are they managing that then? 
---
Also, servers tended to be just as imbalanced, or balanced for that matter, back in the day. This isn't a conspiracy or anything new.
---
There are more players on a server so ofc more epics drop especially at a stage where people are grinding to 60.
---
Yup, the old rule of thumb was to wait until the tank had 2-3 auto attack phases before engaging as a caster.

NO CHANGES!!!
---
In all seriousness they've fixed other bugs, so maybe?
---
1. Make sure your tank is healthy
---
2. Make sure you are healthy
---
3. Make sure everyone else is healthy
---
4. Attempt to proc Spirit Tap
---
5. Wand away for some DPS
---
For healing:
---
* Is your target dying? Use PW:S to save some time and then Inner Focus + Greater heal
---
* Is your target actively taking damage and is above 50 % health?  If yes use efficient heal (Heal, Greater Heal)
---
* Is your target actively taking damage and is below 50 % health?  If yes use fast heal (Flash Heal)
---
* Is everyone taking damage? Prayer of Healing
---
* Otherwise use Efficient Heal or Renew
---
Other cases:
---
* Did you pull aggro? Fade
---
* Do you have multiple mobs on you and Fade doesn't work? Physic Scream
---
I usually watch (mainly listen) to streams while playing solo. I usually watch Asmon, Madseason, Hobbs, Crendor and Sequisha
---
There's no noticeable changes to the look of my desktop, but I confirmed it's been downloaded and I restarted my comp. Yep I ran diagnostics and it didn't come back with any defective parts.
---
Blizzard is unlikely to tell us what action they take, but don't worry. The people who get banned/suspended over it will loudly post about how they were unfairly punished so you'll find out from them, at least based on past patterns with this sort of thing.
---
There are a bunch of quests to kill stuff, but half of the quests are elite quests in jintha alor. Id recommend going there with a grp of 4-5 since you need to kill like 80 trolls or so.
---
yeah, I meant MMORPG.
---
What if they buy a class change 
---
I‚Äôm not starting off every instance with a debate on a subject many people like yourself can‚Äôt properly grasp. Waste of time. If you win the roll and want to give it to the guy who ‚Äúneeds‚Äù it go ahead. But it can be sold for gold that saves you farming time for said gold. If he wants the item, he can spend that same amount of time that item now saved you, farming the gold to buy the item. That is FAIR. It removes any chance of the loot being ninja‚Äôd like I‚Äôve seen happen many times when people play the way you do.
---
The continued success of retail shows the same.
---
There are enough people playing it to warrant making expansions for, so let's not pretend like retail is dead.
---
But why tho
---
Not a question at all, but whatever. In the wow subreddit, someone asked how long it would take to go from 1-120 and someone commented that he created two characters yesterday. One of them is 28 and the other is 40. I've been playing classic every day since release and I just hit 30. I love this game
---
I want BE paladins. Cause all my friends are horde but I wanted to play a paladin lol. Also, viable raid tank build for paladins would be nice...
---
By that logic people should never be banned for hacking or botting either because it's blizzard's programming that created the security flaws to enable those things to happen
---
They wont do that. Makes no sense business wise. Cannibalizing your own product isnt a smart move. Others might try tho but not blizzard and giving how wildly popular classic is atm i wouldn't be surprised if blizz owns more that 50% of the entire mmorpg playerbase. And if that's the case they wont be willing to split the fan base in smaller fragments. New mmorpg from blizz would make 0 sense right now
---
That cleavage is deeper than Ragnaros' submerge
---
If they made the group they literally are entitled to decide who they bring.
---
Well my point is that all these people bitching have no idea what it takes to make these games happen. It‚Äôs easy to bitch when you put in zero effort or brain power.
---
It‚Äôll still work.  You‚Äôll just get a message that states that the target cannot be pickpocketed.  But it will still go ahead with the pickpocket.
---
Btw, make sure you have auto loot on.  Otherwise it will cancel the pickpocket when you do damage and you won‚Äôt actually get the loot.
---
It‚Äôs not that deep monkaS
---
I prefer to parade them nude around Stormwind whilst ringing bells and shouting "Shame, shame, shame," at the top of my lungs. The townies join in and usually throw feces at them. It's a grand old time.
---
Currently the option to migrate characters from an overpopulated realm only gives you one option and that option would be the same server type.
---
Well you can go the VOD as twitch allows only 1min vod
---
It depends on the situation. If you're a warrior and you roll on a caster helm because it has a few more stamina than your current, it should be obvious that it will be usable for the clothie in your group for way longer than you.
---
So this is my first run honest try to wow, got a druid and a lock in their 20s, I often see people recommend macros and such for various uses. I tried to set one up but it didn't really seem to work. Is there a guide for dummy's on how to macro/useful macros for each class?
---
I know revenge feels good now, but what will it really get you? It wont make you grow as a person and will only waste your time trying to make life worse for some idiot on the internet.
---
I'd just cut my losses and find another guild.
---
We all need to sell BoE blues or epics don't we?
---
It's pretty doable if you drag any type of ranged mob into the mages AE or use fear on their packs.
---
Not necessarily, if that blink is to get out of range of an impending blind and is then immediately followed by a sheep until blink is back, it might work.
---
Oh shit waddup
---
I have found it depends on the server. I was alliance on a server and leveled to 55 and ran into nothing but nice people while questing and dungeoning. 
---
Switched to horde on another server and it has been idiots galore. People not wanting to group for kill quests, people waiting for you to Aggro things around a quest item to run in and snipe it and run away, people needing on everything, etc. 
---
I was blown away and to me it seems unlike vanilla a majority of the kids play on horde.
---
Lol this is the literal definition of ‚Äòknowingly abusing‚Äô the bug. RIP this entire guild
---
No addons , let them learn the game and realize why they want an addon
---
36 is the level you can learn Rank 3 Mind Flay.
---
Doesnt sound like it installed it. I had this happen at work with a laptop, it does the download and restarts with no change. I would try running the install one more time. Use the update assistant from microsoft.
---
He probably got to 60 just using frost nova and blizzard
---
&gt; Why? because the typical blizz approach to exploits like these is a slap on the wrist AT WORST.
---
I doubt they will enjoy being banned for a month.
---
I never understand people that try to do shady things. Let people know what you want upfront and you're far more likely to get what you're looking for without burning those relationship bridges.  
---
I saw a group on horde side yesterday looking to form a group posting ravager on reserve. A far better way to go about asking for what you want. Not likely that you'll find a war or enh shaman that will go for that group but at least no one is getting hosed with shady tactics for loot at the end.
---
To be fair though, it sounds like a lot of people are just encountering other people who are dicks. I don't think the act of AoE'ing mobs is bad by default. But having a run in with a dick is always gonna feel bad, no matter what class they're playing.
---
U know u could get him perms banned.  A simple report that he‚Äôs threatening to kill you.  That stuff is not taken lightly by big companies like Blizzard.
---
It's a small world after all!
---
the few times i did tank, it was pretty stupid easy to keep threat on 3-4 targets just by rotating earth shock and autos.
---
Try to get into maraudon princess runs for the mace perhaps?
---
Yes, I was trying to find the WoW daily comic and am sad to see it is gone.
---
No. With imp charge you conveniently have 25 rage on charge. So charge in and switch stances mid charge that way your first auto swing isn't wasted. I have a macro that switches to defensive stance and casts bloodrage right after.
---
I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs one specifically that give you ranges, I do know that there is one that will turn your spell red if you‚Äôre out of range. Also, bartender may do the same thing but I haven‚Äôt looked too far into it.
---
Yeah I would still report him, even though you got YOUR mats back who knows how many he has screwed
---
Because people don't invest the same time and energy into beta as they do the real game, and they never will, because they know it is all going to be blown away.  And at some point, you have to accept that beta testing cannot include too many people or last too long, there are diminishing returns for every extra week or batch of players you let in.  There is a sweet spot of having just long-enough of a beta test with just enough users to fix all the game-breaking bugs, and you accept that some stuff will be missed and get fixed in the first patches.  Hell, I bet there were literally bugs caught during beta that they just didn't have time to fix before launch, thats the nature of software development.  Nobody ships a bug-free product if they expect to make deadlines.
---
A level reset doesn‚Äôt seem like an appropriate punishment.
---
The gold + item wipe seems right though.
---
Haha neckbeards of today
---
I wonder how many hunters are going to be salty about that (hunters get the epic quest bow from MC so strikers mark goes to melee, too fast for hunters anyways).
---
When did I say that? The dick part come from the mage 3 levels higher acting cocky with AoE to try and kill me :) Put the humor tag for a reason
---
Ice block???
---
He is a shame for every horde player.
---
He should have rather died than accept help by a gnome.
---
If you're not actually using dice rolls for actions, I still don't understand what separates this from organized RP events.
---
Every RP guild I've ever been in has had storylines outside the scope of the game itself, not far off a campaign of sorts.
---
I'm not trying to criticize you or anything, I've just played a lot of both and am trying to understand what you mean/how that would work lol
---
&gt; Not at all. You've said multiple totally newbie/stupid things, so I'm accurately assessing you as a newbie (or just bad at the game in general).
---
You realize there might be a world where you're wrong? Lets chat so you can learn more about me.
---
&gt; Oh of course. Now you're just going to claim that your ridiculous claims are only possible if you're "super l33t like me!" Sure, kid. I'm sure you can efficiently run every dungeon with 5 DPS and no tanks/heals because your "l33tness" will somehow keep the boss from 1-2 shotting you. Have you ever seen how fast a dungeon group gets wiped when the tank dies? Yeah, that.
---
Taking 5 dps is against the norm for a reason. You have to be solid to pull it off. I never said anyone could just do it. You keep taking the discussion away from where it started for a reason, you're wrong.
---
&gt; The only way you can play 5 DPS is if your grossly over-leveled, over-geared, or you've found some specific exploit for that one encounter.
---
So it is possible and you're wrong? Weird. Just need you to see it now.
---
&gt; Oh gosh, classic. That one's a blast from the past. The old "That stupid thing I said was actually a trap! And you weren't smart enough to see through it! AHAHAHA" like you're some kind of yugioh weeb activating his trap card. Truly a classic pre-teen comeback. 9/10.
---
So you didn't read it hte first time I posted that it was a plant? Wasn't a stupid thing, I just gave you a simple example of you being wrong from first hand experience from last night instead of reciting my accolades from 15 years ago. Then you said "anything higher than that will need a healer" and I proved you wrong against with SM cath farms the next night. Now you're saying to do 55+ and I guess I'll have to prove you wrong again. Funny how you only remember the ONE thing and blindly ignore anything afterwards.
---
Lets chat, you waste enough time on reddit I know you have 10 minutes where we could talk. The fact you keep denying my request shows you're a bigot who can't expose himself to another person's dangerous thoughts!!
---
If this is a thing for classic i need it
---
Here's a clip from my stream about that fight
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/482296203](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/482296203)
---
Yes but people want 46-48 groups for Ulda. That's stupid.
---
I simply decline any invite of any kind that isn't preceded by at least a "/say can I join for this mob kill?" I then subsequently ignore any whispers or angry say/yells from the person and go about my business. Can't take the time to be at least marginally social with me, then I have no obligation as far as I'm concerned.
---
On the flip side, if someone takes minimal effort to communicate I'll probably accept the invite or send one of my own without hesitation.
---
I also don't get upset if I get in a hurry and invite w/o asking first. One should live by their own rules after all.
---
Thats why you resheep after 20 sec
---
No need for a board. Just peek inside the cells and look at the poor souls.
---
We could throw paper zeppelins and happy rocks at them too if we weren't in classic.
---
Still faster if you pull more and let the mage do aoe on 4-5+ than hitting one mob at a time
---
This is similar, for sure. But I think you are right regarding the timeframe.
---
Damn it, stop it because I can't, hahaha xD
---
Succubus seducing/Blinding an AoE griding mage after they make a pull is very entertaining, just saying.
---
Max server pop in Vanilla was 2500 people so. Yeah.
---
Tbh even if it wasn't its still stunning you and grounds for retaliation if you feel like it
---
Realtalk: Porn is bad for your mental health and widely available to children.
---
There are only common fish in Classic, not sure what you mean.
---
yeah it's surpsing how important the wand is until 40. I need my mara wand upgrade next, but I'm getting to the dungeon running for bis stage in leveling.
---
I explained the game and all classes by style and let my fiance decide what she wanted to do from there. She comes from Skyrim/FO4 where quests are marked and directed, so after her quickly becoming frustrated I installed Questie and she was much happier. I planned to duo with her originally, but she's still learning the basic keyboard movements so I let her experience the game at her pace and she's been enjoying it. 
---
I haven't micromanaged anything, but I've shown her some tips (shes playing Warrior...) and answer any questions she has while explaining basic mistakes to avoid.
---
Feign can be resisted by mobs but not players.
---
Everyone in the raid wanted to skip the egg boss in ubrs, not on my watch.. easy leather chest for me heh
---
The problem for Blizzard is that as far as we know 1.12 is as far back as they have an actual working game client.
---
Anything before that would require a bunch of guess work. Sure, there are patch notes to reverse engineer 1.12 with, but there will have been a whole bunch of undocumented changes throughout vanilla. 
---
I'd rather have an accurate 1.12, since it's at least faithful to some point during vanilla, than guess work progression.
---
The book remains full
---
Iin my case, the tank was upset that i needed a cloth wrist. I thought it was pretty weird lol.
---
You're literally a siren of the sea lol
---
So cast charge cast defensive stance cast bloodrage? I'll have to try it out
---
I do not think resetting an instance is in the same ballpark of this exploit considering it's an intended part of the game and you have to reclear the entire dungeon.
---
Some of you fuckers, specially you level 60 fuckers camping SM need to take a damn shower and nap. These fuckers hit 60 in like a week just to camp scarlet monestary...
---
Those are Exclamation marks my dude.
---
none of that makes him a dick. He lost a legitimate pvp fight on a pvp server.
---
Grats on winning the fight. Your "joke" doesnt work.
---
Bruh you level 8 lol.
---
Exploits take advantage of something already existing like bugs or glitches, hacking and botting require third party programs to access game data and edit it if I understand correctly. That seems to be a pretty big difference to me.
---
Exploiters are still responsible and should face repercussions, I just think permabanning is a little extra. That's just my opinion though, I'm sorry if you disagree.
---
Dude, this is the same as dungeon resetting without the chance of getting ganked outside lmao.
---
Funny story, but getting killed over competing for mobs/resources isn't ganking.
---
That is pretty easily explainable: You have more people per server. Way more.
---
ooo turning red will still be sort of what i am looking for, not quite but it will do. is bartender the add-on you refer to or is there a different one?
---
They won't exactly stay online for that long when they realize their situation. A board with their name engraved on it however will remain.
---
There was changes to prevent this abuse of looting later on in the game. But like was said, this was how the game was at this point in time.
---
Also, the boss fights are generally 3-5 mins long, getting there in this instance / dungeon is probably around 15-30 mins for a average group. The drop itself is not guaranteed (maybe 1 in 3 to 1 in 4?)
---
So wait are you asking to add a World channel that wasn't in vanilla to be policed by Blizzard?  What happened to no changes?
---
If you make it a point up front, you can set it to master loot before the boss to completely eliminate the chance of some idiot ninja-ing it from you.
---
Use a rank 1 aoe ability after they frost nova, itll break the snare and fuck up the mage before the blizzard.
---
&gt; I have nothing left to say but I really want the last word
---
3k or so.
---
Mooo
---
Yeah I want this.
---
Lol what you are smoking? 
---
First off, aoe farming pre mount does teach you some important things in general. 
---
Second...other than jokerd, hardly anyone is getting a full aoe leveling experience. Who would want it anyways, unless you‚Äôve been on private servers and don‚Äôt care about experiencing the whole game. 
---
Personally I‚Äôve been questing, aoe grinding, doing normal dungeon runs, doing spell cleave dungeon runs...fuck it‚Äôs all fun. 
---
I‚Äôve never played mage before and I really like it.
---
I have never once had this in classic, maybe it's your ISP limiting bandwidth from certain servers or maybe your internet sucks? More populated areas like city's use more bandwidth. I dunno I've only got 1Gb/s and haven't experienced this even when the city's are packed.
---
Or redridge
---
You really want Mining to go with Engi so you can gather your own mats. Without it you are kind of stuck buying stuff from the AH which sucks. You want your money to go towards skills, gear and mounts early on.
---
Tailoring is good because it doesn't require a gathering profession, you gather cloth from humanoid enemies instead. So really you can take whatever you want alongside Tailoring.
---
Skinning isn't a bad option, some tailoring recipes (eg: silk bags) require leather. Taking Skinning will allow you to make those without going to the AH for leather and gives you some income selling the excess.
---
The most common is enchanting. Mainly because you can use cloth to make greens and disenchant those greens. But you won't gain a whole lot from having enchanting early on.
---
If you want to pick up Engi for PVP, the best bet is probably waiting to switch out after 50 or so. Then you can buy all the mats you need to skill it up from the AH and as a high level mage you should be able to AoE farm the money really easily.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve never ravaged a low health clothie that‚Äôs drinking.
---
The thing with AoE mages though is that they hog all of the objectives and disrupt the questing experience for a lot more people, even if they aren't actively trying to be a dick to people.
---
Dropping the snark for a minute. Honestly I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Players abusing an exploit is annoying to people wanting to play legit. The only people that should defend the abuse are those that did it. I can see no benefit to defending it otherwise.
---
Reserving loot in a pug is for pussies. But if you ARE such a pussy, you make it damn clear what is going down as you are inviting people. Spread his name everywhere.
---
I want it more public. Like a shaming pole to which they are chained and must remain online 48 hours evenly spread over 6 days.
---
I have created a seperate tab for lfg, whispers, and guild. I have also created a new window for item drops, rolls, exp, and put the text to smallest and have it on top of the chat box.
---
If the mage sucks, yeah.
---
You must be a hoot at parties
---
Ah okay. It‚Äôs prob just because I‚Äôm behind the curve. I just hit 31 last night.
---
 Walk with the Earth Mother.
---
Shout out from the ZF group you were in.
---
Lmao, I ran around for like 5 levels with a mining pick simply because the offhand I acquired was better than the staff I had equipped.
---
I got that one too mine is in mint condition
---
Transferred from Whiteman to Arcanite Reaper. It's very empty. Take that as you will. It's pretty hard to find a groups instantly for dungeons like Whitemane, but mob tagging is never an issue now. The AH is pretty much dead, but I'm sure it'll have some life within a few weeks. There is no queue time though which was important the most important thing to me at the end of the day!
---
Seal of Justice's judgement in pvp restricts movement speed. I'm not sure how exactly it works, as it just doesn't work on shaman ghost wolf, but it sure destroys people trying to run with feral swiftness. Not sure bout travel form though.
---
Doin' the same my dude; though I'm Alliance.
---
it's the excitement of it that is rewarding.  Sure, you gain nothing,,,,no drops or experience at least.  That isn't what PVP is about though, it is about the rush you get from the gank.  The challenge of the duel and testing your abilities against a real humor instead of just mob after mob.,  There are 4 jazillion quests for you to get to, that is like the whole game....just questing gets boring.
---
lmao, thats where you're wrong...
---
Alliance doesn't group, they just want to be asocial.
---

I didn't start WoW until WotLK, but channel creation as far as I know was always a thing.  It requires people to join it to give it any weight, if people leave it has no power.
---
He means he can run away from them well.
---
That's what I want to know, I plan to make universal build so I want the bare minimum so I can max out ice shards, frostbite and shatter and the arcane mana bonuses.
---
&gt; you shouldn't waste their time and let them find a group where they CAN get the loot they want
---
I agree 100% this is why I specified "up front."  If I were to make a group for me to go get X loot, if someone didn't want to join because they also wanted X loot, no hard feelings, GL, wholeheartedly hope you win the roll when you get a chance in your next group, let's both try to maximize our time in game.
---
Guess it helps with the improved cast time with talents
---
I play bfa when i want to feel like a demigod for 30 minutes then go back to classic.
---
We really are the same after all
---
Having seen 3 or 4 of these threads, I haven't seen a single person convinced. Just starts a screaming match.
---
&gt; If a mage blinks from a warrior before he intercepted, the mage has lost. 
---
Maybe but why would a mage ever blink away before the interception? 
---
Standard mage v. warrior opening would be: warrior charges, so mage frost novas and WALKS away. Warrior then intercepts, so mage blinks away. 
---
If warrior doesn't open with charge then mage can just CoC and R1 frostbolt to their heart's content while meandering away, tossing in the occasional fire blast for good measure. 
---
Best chance a warrior has is to resist the frost nova after Charge, but if that's the case, mage can reset with polymorph and try again. 
---
The only time a mage should lose to a warrior is if the mage panic blinks before intercept...which I'll admit can happen when I warrior ports right onto your face. But if it's a frost mage with Ice Block they still have a safety button and a chance to reset.
---
Have them read the game manual. It will give them the basics on how to play. Then let them do the first zone by themselves. 
---
After that group up with them and go out exploring, but don‚Äôt dictate the route, let them decide where they want to quest.
---
If anything yet direct them to an online resource where they can get help, then introduce addons afterwards.
---
hate to break it to you: it has nothing to do with the class they're playing and everything to do with the player
---
Very simple, start together with her on a  fresh lvl 1.
---
Let her pick a character, based on brief descriptions.  Then you pick something that works well with her choice. 
---
Then just go play, and let her take the lead.  Don't tell her what to do, just do quests together that she picks up.   You can say things like " oh we are lvl 4, we should go back to the trainer because the trainer has new spells for us every 2 levels."   Then let her find the trainer
---
Never did I put words in your mouth. 
---
Point to where I did, this is very disingenuous of you. 
---
I pointed out that your absolute statement of "Just a friendly reminder that if a person needs an item and proceeds to equips it, that constitutes as needing something!!!" was poorly thought out and incorrect. You worded it wrongly and that is not on me, it is on you. You shouldn't be upset you got called out on that previously referenced statement.
---
Its lol in orcish
---
It didn't drop but the axe did and technically it is an upgrade.  Sometimes that's the way the cookie crumbles.
---
One extra week of raid loot is going to break the game?
---
Sounds like the GM even told them "We are going to review after the weekend and may remove the loot that drops", which seams fair enough.
---
Okay I watched the full vid from Garr to Baron and... Are you serious or just trolling?? 
---
They didn't reset instance or anything between the pulls. **They just got both binding to drop in the same run.** Lucky? Yes, exploiting? No
---
10 man leveling exploit, but honestly more the concept of exploiting by streamers.
---
The evidence is video recorded, often they brag about it. But it's quite unanimous that across games they don't get the same punishment as they would if they were unknown.
---
I still have my old 19 inch Amptron CRT that I bought in 1999-2000. Works perfectly if anyone is interested...
---
I group with people for kill quests 100% of the time
---
Classic+ system would be epic, pretty much play as a bounty hunter
---
I have had several friends close to MMOs try vanilla for the first time, and they have seemed to enjoy it the most when they've done it alone, rather than having someone that knows everything they should be doing, tells them "just go kill this" instead of letting them read the quest, tells them how to spec, etc. 
---
If you tell them what to do it's just a slower version of modern games, if you don't, it's the game we all fell in love with :)
---
Reminds of those clumped up masses of baby spiders
---
True but typically it‚Äôs the druids picking fights first with a pounce or ravage so I‚Äôve learned to avoid them if I can help it.
---
This statement is rooted in identity-theory insofar as we are unable to conceive of things that we cannot comprehend. But the theory of multiple realizability states that I can reasonably assert that other things can have a similar mental state to me despite being different things. For example we consider dogs to experience pain, which is a mental state, because of the similarities we share as organisms. In this way, we also consider the octopus to be able to experience pain, even though it has a fundamentally different neural structure to most other organisms (60% of its ‚Äòthinking‚Äô occurs in its arms). This is the basis of functionalism that Turing uses to claim that machines will eventually be able to ‚Äòthink‚Äô as long as they behave as though they are thinking. (This is still a heavily contested debate).
---
Therefore, it does not necessarily take one to know one. But it might and could...
---
The two weps from the last boss in Ulda are very very good but also very rare and difficult to get. I would just tough it out until you get thrash blade and go dual wield or the axe from the gator in Mara
---
"Tons of guilds" define tons? because my server has about 4, I wouldn't know about the quality of the players, but I truely doubt they couldn't clear current normal content.
---
max level
---
CastCursor goes around the cursor, sort of the same idea.
---
Not if the guildie refused to get his body back. Eventually a ganker will get tired of waiting and leave.
---
My point is people expect everything blizz ever released to be perfect. Bugs occur in every game especially rpgs and especially mmos. The game hasn‚Äôt been out two weeks and all these people are ready to crucify blizzard, like they do with literally anything blizzard does. All these people are screaming that blizz is lazy, doing this purposefully, cutting costs and doesn‚Äôt care about their fan base when none of that is true. They‚Äôre not perfect, but they have the most entitled fan base in gaming and it‚Äôs annoying, and it‚Äôs fan base is what‚Äôs ruining the community of the game, not an occasional bug.
---
 I literally played with them yesterday (SM Cathedral). It was just us in the group and I asked if they were looking for more. Stayed at the entrance for a while while Yezzan tried killing some of the entrance trash. I ended up leaving after we didn't find anyone for like 45+ minutes. Got it on my stream. [https://clips.twitch.tv/ArtsySullenTigerShadyLulu](https://clips.twitch.tv/ArtsySullenTigerShadyLulu)
---
The whole point of the game is to be one of them. You're considered "THE HERO OF WESTFALL" before you even hit level 20. This is not and has never been a sandbox MMO. Also those characters should be looking up to us considering their claim to fame is just being war veterans.
---
I certainly do have favorites, but I'd rather just happen upon them once in a while in the wild instead of saving them.
---
Like a month ago Countdown to Classic interviewed some dude that does multibox and they talked about how it was banable if you use it to get advantage on pvp
---
Nothing against you doing it that way.  I just hate that I get groups, I tell them I‚Äôm a feral tank/dps ahead of the invite, then they ask me to heal.  
---
People need to get out of the 2005 mindset.  Private servers have long since proved that feral tanking is not only viable but preferred for certain fights.  I can‚Äôt wait to gear out and start proving doubters wrong.
---
Matte black.
---
I need a vanish macro that will /yell something that the alliance can understand.
---
Very unlikely
---
Yeah pretty easy to get away from with most classes, but if you run away in fear don‚Äôt you still die inside?
---
I mostly avoided it on my priest. Did one full run for the quest and a couple extra Cath runs. Didn't get the head, or the staff/dagger from library, or anything really. But I didn't want to deal with that shit with the 3 mage groups fighting over the caster loot. 
---
Now I'm level 43 still using a staff from Blackfathom Deeps, and it doesn't really seem to make a difference.
---
Why am I not surprised
---
Many servers are offering transfers at this time.
---
Historically, not many Western guilds will be running on Eastern times, very few people raiding at 3-4PM Western. If you are a night owl like me and like to start raids at 9-10PM then it works out great.
---
The curve was like last week tbh
---
Being downvoted for pointing out facts.  Is /r/ classicwow just a bunch of people who hang out in Barrens chat?
---
&gt; for 1 month
---
lol was this supposed to be sarcasm? Thats seems extremely lenient
---
rip glider
---
Murlocs absolutely have quests tied to them. Every time I went there to quest for Mirefin heads there was a mage grinding. I asked for an invite and was just straight up ignored. I just wanted 12 heads to feed my Ogre friend :(
---
Where did they say bans are coming?
---
but thats the thing. You can ban people for being assholes.
---
&gt;Some of them took hundreds of runs using the edited map without ever being flagged.
---
I got mine after 4 10 years ago and was never caught. Guildie of mine back then did 20 and got banned. Was just luck.
---
Dunno, I've been using only 2 points and not had problems.
---
Knawlidge
---
I didn't use it until I was lvl 18 and I would just look it up on classic WoWhead if I got stuck anyway, so no. Most of the twitch reading the quest tells you what you need, Questie helps the rest of the time.
---
I gank 100% of mages farming and iron grenade every single pack of mob near aoe farmers. 
---
16% of my server is mages so I give no as I am melee trying to kill the few mobs I can tag.
---
Maybe? I don't know a lot about macros but having startattack means you can remove the attack command from your hotbar which is pretty nice n
---
You forgot Curse of Elements
---
Pretty cool man, well done
---
He came off a little rough but you're definitely looking for something to bitch about. There's nothing stopping you from reading the message and declining, or turning off auto guild invites. I've played with a few from their guild and there's no issue
---
Yea this is what I've been doing, although I just bought all my moves which was a huuge waste
---
&gt; My experiences as a Shaman have been sitting in a group with 2 warriors, still looking for a tank
---
At what lvl? because right now I'm lvl 45 and at lvl 43 was tanking Uldaman with fury and arms just fine.
---
I had a rogue friend in vanilla retail named Wargasm... I miss ya Destromath buddy
---
Let the battle begin
---
No you can't. Turning the graphics up just makes the water better, and gives more grass. It doesn't use the new models.
---
Really not worth going out of your way for specific gear at these early levels. I would recommend staying away from the AH for buying and stick to just equipping what you find and quest rewards as you start running dungeons and continue questing upgrades will come.
---
Someone near you is in combat with a mob. They use a thing called aoe aggro or area combat. Even if you aren't in the fight at all if another player pulls a mob near you and you are in combat your combats will be linked.
---
Oh, there is a quest outside of mara that gets you thrash blade when you kill princess.
---
Yes, but hunters get 2 ranged attack power from 1 agility, it‚Äôs not just about the crit
---
Playing a priest and heal dungeons from time to time. I use Clique for healing with the built in raid frames. Can anyone suggest an add-on that will show incoming heals? Am I okay with using the built-in raid frames or should I download an add-on for frames?
---
Nah just transfer them all onto a server filled with exploiters and ninjas. 
---
Call it Australia.
---
I play on a PvP server if that matters. 
---
Its wasnt a disease stack. Im sure about that.
---
Now i need a macro for mooning someone and calling them a primadonna mage
---
Zoom in, its high res
---
It‚Äôs nothing like account boosting. Ultimately these people are coming because they want to, if nobody wanted to he wouldn‚Äôt do it.
---
You don‚Äôt have to like what he‚Äôs doing, but ‚Äúforcing‚Äù them to play on another server wouldn‚Äôt change anything and is unnecessary.
---
Could also be profession quests that they don't have the required skill to pick up.
---
Priests are pretty overpowered early. I mean they are a solid leveler altogether, but first 20 levels are so they are very powerful. Especially if you get a wand. Buy a lesser magic wand asap or just wait til 13 and get a greater magic wand if you cant afford the lesser now.
---
That version was in classic. 
---
Makes a huge difference when solo farming Mauradon. I used to do this on my hunter in classic for hours at a time.
---
It's what funded my undead epic mount for my orc hunter.
---
Never once even received a warning for it in classic. I even had to get a GM to fix my hunter once due to being stuck at a loading screen. Explained to him exactly what I did. He fixed it then wished me luck on my farming.
---
You're right, I probably shouldn't have phrased my comment that way. If you look at my other comments you'll see that I do think these people are responsible for exploiting should face consequences in the form of rollbacks or temporary bans, I just dont think that taking advantage of an in game bug should face the same consequences as hackers or gold sellers.
---
Most of em are bad then.  Its not like they check to see if the warrior is a gnome beforehand, they just do the same combo they always try to do.  Mind you were just talking world pvp since thats all we have so far.  Everyone is still learning how to pvp and unsure how to deal with each class.  I'm sure things will be different in a month.
---
pretty self defining, really
---
I have a sneaking suspicion your ‚Äúhome‚Äù layer is based on when you created your character.
---
If I play super hard and get ahead of the crush I‚Äôll be in zones that have very little competition, but if I return to that zone later that night or the next day they are packed.
---
Also I can return to older zones I completed a few of days earlier and they have very little competition.
---
Further this with me inviting newer lower level players in my guild and they get my layer in a lowbie zone with very little competition but their own home layer is packed.
---
It's pretty typical for tanks to take first orb. Largely since they're in demand, and there's basically nothing in strat live for a tank loot-wise.
---
If it's some rando DPS though? Guy can go to hell.
---
Ay if it's in the game it's up to the developer to fix it
---
I thought about going Mage for AoE grinding and PoM/Pyro, but found there was a **second** Mage class that replaces that wussy frost stuff with badass shadow stuff, has a personal succubus, makes it rain fucking fire, **and** gets a free mount at 40. The only downside is that you can't be a Troll, so no Hadoken Shadowbolts.
---
provides a blue post showing its against the TOS
---
still argues it not against the TOS
---
You can't make this up
---
Have your friendly neighborhood paladin cast Blessing of Salvation on you. Boom, solved, or should I say "SALVED", ahhhhhh good one *self high five*
---
In all honesty, salv is great because it allows you do dps earlier, and do more dps without worrying about threat. I find dungeons go much more smoothly and faster with a paladin using his blessings situationally as opposed to "Mana = Wis, Might for melee" or kings for the lazy paladin...
---
I think he's being funny.
---
Correct. Posts back to 2005 on Wowhead confirm this has been annoying players for 14 years.
---
now imagine saving up all your gold for like 10 levels to get a mount.... gratz on 40 but i wouldnt feel that special if i just talked to 3 npcs and got a mount
---
&gt; I *never* attacked anything that  was already pulled by a mage (they body pull so technically I could mess  that up for them, but didn't). All the mobs I went for were  "unclaimed". 
---
Damn... Where do you play that this actually happens at all, as a warlock pretty much EVERY TIME I dot a mob in a busy area a mage or hunter will insta tag it anyway away from me.
---
Oh you know they can find every instance of this happening..../s use your brain if they were to find an instance of every person later hopping and what loot they got from it, it would take them years even with automation.
---
You are one dense piece of shit. He literally had to spell it out for your autistic ass and you then call him a pissy little dweeb? Go to sleep and never wake up you braindead fuck.
---
Seriously, we only want videos where struggle is absent please.  If its not completely one sided, its not even interesting!
---
I pick up everything and sell everything either on ah or vendors. Just wasted all my gold on moves which I didnt need
---
LEvel 8 lmao. The mobs 1-10 are made much easier on purpose
---
Lol nice
---
As a rogue I love AOE mages. They have so much love to share with so many mobs, and I can enable them to meet quicker.
---
And this my friend......is why world PvP in Classic is going to be so awesome. There is always the risk when trying to get the reward. Being flagged for PvP just always makes the reward so much more well fought and worth it once you've achieved your goal.
---
##*Harambe disliked that.*
---
What mod are you using for Scrolling Combat Text? I can‚Äôt find one on Curse/Twitch client.
---
But those favorites are gone or aren't in HD if you want to look at them years later.
---
I get that. But I feel the saying "Innocent till proven Guilty" can go a long way. I owe the Horde nothing, but I love that feeling of helping someone, and ten levels later seeing them and they remember you.
---
You're embarrassing yourself if you don't care that people use your tax money to be unemployed and play wow. Or you're an unemployed piece of shit yourself.
---
That's it?
---
I just want a pet cat :|
---
What? It's clearly way fast.  You fail in the beginning or in certain new areas with new mobs but you get the hang of each pull/area pretty quickly after that.
---
As a tank you have pick of the litter when it comes to groups. At your level I think a wipe or two is forgivable, but if your group is wiping due to plain stupidity I would just dip after the second wipe. As a tank you can find another group ASAP.
---
Grouping with guildies or finding competent healers/DPS and adding them goes a long way though.
---
I didn't play in a week, but was 32 with 20 gold.. Think some grinding needs to be done, but I don't mind.
---
Yea it wasnt a we written title.
---
cringe
---
It was fine on launch. Just a huge chat, then it turned into a 2nd LFG channel. So I gave my 2 sec notice and bid them gl and didnt regret leaving.
---
They still are! They just came out with an intellimouse pro model this year that uses one of the best sensors on the market for competitive play.
---
Why do you think gold influx would not be relevant to AH economy?
---
Yeah definitely not wanting to judge others too hard (especially since I main Hunter), but Warlock does also seem to attract some nooby players who don't want to learn how to play nice with others.
---
On the side note of Hunters though it amazes me how some continue to leave Growl on or have their pet on aggressive for some reason.
---
It gets worse in the higher levels. They ignore whispers and invites. Fear their pulls and they will finally respond.
---
I would have asked each mage individually if they were cool with me being in their one person group to get my X-mob then I would be out of their hair instead of fighting against AoE mages.
---
That being said, I haven't seen any "right of way" or anything of the sort when it comes to mob killing.  It's Every-Person-For-Themselves.  I have seen range guys tag mobs when melee's are clearly running their hearts out to it and not make it in time.
---
That's when you ask to group up.  I almost always get a "Sure" or "okay" and off we go.  Killing mobs is so much quicker when we are in groups.
---
I‚Äôm glad some of these people aren‚Äôt judges, deciding on how to punish criminals. There‚Äôd be people on death row for some silly shit.
---
We're most likely going to do 1 more split run with &lt;Norrath Classic&gt; and then both guilds go onto their own things.  
---
Ping me in game, we can talk about recruiting. We're currently closed because we have SO MANY PEOPLE, but that doesn't mean that's going to be that way forever.
---
What other service is there that allows you to completely AFK and still level that isn't account boosting?
---
I've healed quite a few who killed me directly after. I just stand and /sigh lol
---
Woah, swinging big dick
---
I think its because healing in retail is so much different than classic WoW, and a lot of these people are new to classic.  And also....every damn warrior insists on 2h tanking for some reason.  Had a tank the other night who kept dying, yet didnt take the hint that maybe he should throw on a shield and use defensive abilities.  (I'm not a healer now but played one a lot over the years).
---
Been using this mouse for years. I'd be helpless without it at this point.
---
Yeah i guess We just dont agree on the subject :) which is perfectly fine!
---
You'll probably have to at some point anyway, I got stuck in silverpine due to the quests out leveling me so had to go to Barrens to catch up. Barrens has so much so it'll be good for a long time
---
Have you done this recently?
---
I tried doing that on my druid. Died it wetlands ran to IF to use the spirit res. It put me back in the wetlands graveyard with res sickness.
---
Remove the gear and give them a debuff for the next month. When you mouseover the debuff it says "Cheating scum"
---
Enough weekends ahead to go outside again! Untill that time....for the allia...horde...
---
Probably don't even have to steal one. 
---
          
---
I was waiting around there for the named farmer to spawn and loads of people give him the elixir and just run away quickly so they don't have to fight Enraged Stanley, got 3 or 4 kills that way.
---
I'm trying my hand at drain tanking, and so far at 35 it's hasn't been that great. I'm hoping Dark Pact improves it a bit, but like you said even with improved life drain and fel concentration it's hard to be efficient with it.
---
Have you seen an orc trying to use a wand in classic?!?!
---
I think people are focusing too much on the word gambling. OP said similar to the thought process of 'it could happen next', next being that the streamer acknowledges your message in chat. They're not directly comparing it to gambling, just that to them it reminds them of one specific aspect of that mindset. This being the people who sit and spend their time interacting in chat.
---
Have you tried sweeping strikes whirlwind into cleave. Some massive damage and I usually hold all the threat from 4 mobs just off he whirlwind. 2h tanking for the win
---
Then you just taunt any stragglers, mocking blow is good for stragglers too
---
Yes, that. The whole "classic will bring the community back!" stuff
---
Wasn't that funny but I corpsecamped a lvl47 multibox abuser here today, felt good to see him get some justice for his cheats.
---
Got power shifting on lock down, and yeah I know ive been dreading that farm lol but we do it out of love of the spec!
---
but only if you have a high level friend with you to back you up right?
---
2nd this notion. Also accounting boosting is paying for the service. Next your gonna tell me your annoyed that Asmondgold has like 700+ gold because people just hand him shit like that as candy. Or that he has 3 full guilds at his beck and call and its unfair. Shit like this happens all the time man.
---
its just a faster way to reset the instance, the recent exploit is layering within instances so you can kill bosses back to back without moving
---
I'm almost 49 but I've every bit of my journey mostly questing through the world.  I have found interesting sights and locations of lore that feel so alive.

Because in Vanilla they tried to keep some of the RPG aspects of MMORPG. There is a lot of like, actual RPG and story and stuff, this is not my first time on vanilla but it is my first time as alliance and I find myself often reading quest texts out of curiosity, despite the fact I am following some minmax power lvling guide and want to hit max lvl asap.
---
As long as you‚Äôre not neglecting any responsibilities, you‚Äôre good.
---
Because It's generally faster to have the optimal comp
---
You don't hold different opinions, you're just factually wrong.
---
I'm not a bigot for thinking that flat-earthers are stupid.   Likewise, I'm not a bigot for thinking that 5 DPS isn't anywhere near as viable as 3 DPS and a Tank/Healer.
---
In what fucking world do you think skipping majority of trash in dungeons by abusing decorations is intended game behaviour.
---
As long as Blizzard doesn't say this isn't part of the game, it's a part of the game.
---
don't think he's saying whether blizz should allow it or not, just why they do.
---
I got an official GM reprimand back in 2006 for using the phrase ‚Äúasshat‚Äù in general chat. I think your rose-colored glasses are on backwards.
---
I report all or these posts
---
Like, progress while watching TV or doing homework?
---
Not much else, most gathering professions are going to put you in a little bit of danger so you'll need to watch out for mobs.
---
If you are a class that uses multiple weapons, you could go train up unused weapon levels on low level mobs that can't kill you.
---
Lmao skinning? That's a joke.... I vendor my leather. Not worth the 5s you get extra for using the AH. Everyone went gathering professions.
---
I used curseforge for mine, here's the link! https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mik-scrolling-battle-text
---
How do you people not read any comments at all lmao fd is bugged because half the time it doesn‚Äôt resist it doesn‚Äôt do anything at all besides use mana and the cd.
---
Did you use the circle of transparency bug to break into people's houses? Or the magic reflect/criminal flag bug to kill people in town?
---
I am trolling? Is everyone here an unemployed piece of human flesh which we better get rid off. Get a job and stop feeding off my money you useless meatbag
---
How so? This is my first time really watching him, I just thought the scenario itself was funny.
---
No it wouldn't. and doing =/= doesn't just make your statement true; same tier of skill is the same thing as being equal in skill. 
---
If you look at 1,000,000 players and took players at rank 499,999 and 500,000 their skill would be virtually equal.  499,999 could be a warrior main and 500,000 could be a mage, and 99/100 times the mage will win. Likewise, 500,000 is a mage and 500,001 could be a warrior and the mage will still win 99/100 time. Their skill levels are the same, but yet they obviously play different from one another because they don't even share the same moveset, or style of play. 
---
I'm not going to continue this conversation because it seems like you've decided this is a hill you're willing to die on and I'm just not that interested in arguing with someone over such a bizzare topic.
---
&gt;the following macro doesn't select a spell icon for some reason:
---
&gt;    #showtooltip
---
&gt;    /cast Frostbolt
---
I don't see why that wouldn't show the tooltip/icon of your highest rank of Frostbolt. I think you didn't mouseover that macro after putting it in your action bar or you didn't select a different macro after creating that one. In both these situations it will just show the red question mark.
---
I was wondering about dungeons... im at level 20 and i see that horde has a dg to lvl 18-24..
---
My question: any dungeon will have Quests at entrance or i need to get Quests somewhere else?
---
People stay at entrances or i need to gather people in the city?
---
Also side note, tell grp to be snaring if there will be runners
---
Such a weird contrast seeing this post and then looking at my other monitor where barrens chat is spamming N-bombs and ‚Äúrape female gnomes‚Äù.
---
Glad the ban had a positive effect on ya.
---
You are the one that named your reddit account after him........
---
You can actually read /2 and see everything people are doing and looking for unlike /4 which is just endless people spamming their LFM SPELLCLEAVE and LFM NEED TNAK macros completely drowning out anyone not doing SM, ZF and BRD
---
I'll have you know I got my wetlands ooze bag in less than 100 kills.
---
Idk, I have my lv 30 hunter, plus a 15 priest, 15 lock, and 10 druid
---
The message reads like a 12 year old typed it.
---
Oh crap. I haven‚Äôt done it recently. Maybe they patched it?
---
Okay. 
---
Me very mad.
---
If you can't accept that other people can play a videogame more than you then idk what to tell you buddy.
---
Hah, that was me during vanilla. Baby would wake up hungry, I'd do the night feeding and a little farming or AH-tending.
---
The scarlet letter punishment, I like it, lol.
---
Imagine thinking people don‚Äôt have petpassive petfolllow macros.
---
Escrow accounts would be cool, though. Then I could send you X gold that you could redeem within 30 days on the fulfillment of some condition. As long as they are to X from Y, that's a hard condition. "broadcast"-style bounties aren't a good idea, see Eve online.
---
No its not, they that would cause them to lose WAY more.
---
I do think so. Vanilla was a simple time and it requires very little individual skill to complete the raid. It's more about group coordination and time investment.
---
Opinions rely on subjectivity, which, by default, makes then incapable of being factually true or false, because facts are merely propositions of truth independent of anyone's opinion.
---
Stole the words outta my mouth.
---
I'd take that deal!
---
1 res vs countless maulings from crocs and other wildlife =(
---
Same.  If it's clear we're both in the area to kill a named mob i'll accept and send out unrequested invites.  If the quest we're both clearly working on is a "kill X amount of" type, i'll probably do the same thing.  If it's a gathering quest though, I don't accept any invites.
---
Ban
---
!remindme 3days
---
Try that in the game and not on Reddit. Isn't such a great working theory.
---
Unless that's changed for Classic, if you run to another spirit healer and rez you'll be teleported back to the graveyard closest to your body. It was to prevent people from just doing ALL their walking as a ghost.
---
"What a fucking asshole, I hope you never reproduce. Calling people random like you had any status in a fucking video game. People like you make me sick. FUCK. YOU. NERD. Fred I need your autograph okay I know it sucks okay"
---
Yup. I also get this butthurt over something I see as just a game. Lol. Relax.
---
After watching the video several times, a few things stick out.
---
* The priest uses a health potion and desperate prayer.  The mage uses will of the forsaken but no potions
---
* Had the priest not used both potion and prayer, he would be dead.
---
* Majority of damage against the mage was shadow word pain plus damage from feedback
---
* Feedback excessively damages the mage because it is not based on amount of damage received but the number of hits.  AE spam is the worst spell to use against a human priest with feedback up
---
In otherwords, the strategy used by the mage works against lower levels and low health players.  Having both racial cooldowns up as well as a greater health potion tilted the fight towards the priest.  If the mage was aware of what feedback does, he could have wanded for more damage instead.
---
Yes, a frostbolt spam would have done significantly more damage and killed the priest.  Yes, the mage didn't need to run in and eat a fear for his nova.
---
This is not being a dick, it is pvp.  The priest outplayed the mage, significantly.  Even still, had the mage been better, this post wouldn't have been made.
---
Yeah I could see how some would take polymorph the wrong way haha I'll stick with the old sheep and split haha take some health and let me blink out hahaha
---
We had one Alliance NE Rogue on Drak'Thul (Noonies, IIRC) that was the entire PVP for the Alliance at 70. Unless you brought a fucking Sunwell raid, your ass was already dead if you were on the Isle of Quel'Danas.
---
He wouldn't do the "1% gank". He would wait until you were at full HP and then murder you.
---
IQD was a world PVP mosh pit, and I miss it so much now.
---
It's always going to be like this. People want the old feel but when something stronger comes along, even if they disagree with it, they will use and abuse it. Now of course this is different as it's an obvious "bug" or exploit but the point stands. Classic could add LFG and the community would ree but I imagine 90% of people would use it without even trying to make parties the old way.
---
This is the case with OSRS as well. If a better way of doing something is introduced, people will use it. Agree with it or not there's no reason to do something worse when something better, even if dumb, exists. 
---
Once again I realize this is an exploit vs feature but still. Tis the bitch of life that I would not doubt fall in to if it was a feature.
---
It'll be a little slower, but doable. There's a YouTube video that compares Resto vs pure feral. I think it's by Skarm or one of the popular druid tubers.
---
Yup no doubt.

GROB MOB GROB MOB

Fewer players will see your posts in /trade because it only works in major cities. Pros use /general and /lfg

Got any tips for a 35 lock trying this out. Even with Fel Concentration and Improved Life Drain, it's still hard to be efficient with it.
---
You're barking up the wrong tree little boy. Fuck off and go ask your mom for money to play wow
---
Lol you edited your comment. Its obvious your (uh oh spelling nazi here) trying to deter the convo, so ill just leave it at that!
---
I always hated the idea of playing a human in a fantasy game, it seemed silly to me like in a human in real life if i'm playing a fantasy game I want to be something else, but sadly in original vanilla I had to play a human because there was no way I was going to play something as ugly as a gnome and I wanted to be a mage lol
---
I still own and use this alarm clock. Stole it from my parents‚Äô house when I went off to college and it hasn‚Äôt left my bedside since.
---
if they make a habit of it, i will fear the mob
---
All those cds used and the guy still losing lul
---
Great story!
---
Didn‚Äôt know about that, I like it too &lt;3
---
I would look at a leveling guide so you don‚Äôt have to respec later on. Check out dives drain tanking guide if you don‚Äôt know one.
---
Otherwise I would say CoW is not very good, I always use either CoA, CoT, or CoE while leveling. I‚Äôm only lvl 35 though for comparison.
---
Why? Put them on your actionbars and hotkey them.
---
That's the exact opposite of what I said (and what you quoted), because I include the exception that you ethically may not want to do it. 
---
I also specifically reference righteous indignation and reddit's tendency to ramp themselves up in a frenzy fueled by self-crowned moral superiority. I even said I was fine with a rollback; it was specifically the frothing-rage calls for permabans that are ridiculous. 
---
And you've kind of proven my point. The only punishment you think qualifies as a punishment at this point is full ban, because you didn't even comprehend the things I said were reasonable as "punishments" or "corrective action."
---
It's a game. Calm down. The economy is fine. AoE Grinding hundreds of thousands if not millions of humanoid mobs did infinitely more damage to the economy than a more-than-usual # of rare items being on the AH (which tends to drive prices down, not up).
---
How not?  If people had the fear of losing a character completely for actively engaging in exploitative practices, they wouldn‚Äôt actively engage in exploitative practices.
---
Yeah you right we should just take your word as evidence. Not like blizz hasn‚Äôt said themselves that it‚Äôs bugged or anything.
---
Mages would find a way to blink out and then go layer AoE farm.
---
Any other reason for choosing priest over other healing classes?
---
But how often do you need to powershift while levelling:)
---
The fun thing about druid is you can use your other forms as needed. Need tankiness?, use bear. Need to be sneaky or get some extra dps while low on mana?, use cat. Need to go oom even faster?.... uh use moonkin?
---
But really, you can level fine as a resto druid. It won't be as powerful, however, you still have the situational utility to do things other classes can't.
---
It's just tryhard douchery. It seems to be prevalent in some servers, mostly absent in others. 
---
With that said, I (bear tank) accidentally wound up in a melee cleave group and that shit was fast.
---
Question about loot types for dungeons:
---
I ran DM for the first time last night and had the loot options set to "Need before Greed", which I thought made sense. I was told this meant that you could only roll on items you can use, and that proved true for some greens.
---
However, on 2 bosses, both a cloth chest piece and then a staff dropped, and I (a Priest) never had a chance to roll on them. Was something incorrect with the loot type? Or am I not understanding how Need before Greed works?
---
Nothing like that, I honestly don't remember what I did to get me sent there. I just remember that I was in there for a bit, got talked to, then banned for a week. I based my antics around this webcomic at the time of the player who all they did was loot charactrers so maybe that? But knowing me it was probably something lame like running a macro.
---
It's too fucking real holy shit
---
May all the luck in Azeroth be on your side, finally got my shoulder yesterday.  Lookin cute, feelin cute.
---
 (Ran ~26 times, only saw the Ravager, pants and Shoulder ONCE! every other run it was the helm @_@ )
---
I hear ya, I will be doing the same with a 1/29/21 build that's similar to Skarm's, but a few personal preference tweaks.
---
I spam hellfire FOREVER. If I get heals, cool. If not, I go out in a blaze of glory...
---
How about you let him play the game instead of rushing him through the game for your own satisfaction. I'd stop playing with you if you would not let me play on my own pase.
---
Less than 25 mins.
---
I ran my hunter here the other day, found it dead. Spawned in about 12 mins. There is also a rare wolf spawn in the same area.
---
Make a macro 
---
/target The Rake. 
---
Spam it till you find him.
---
He seems to spawn in the northeast corner of the Golden Plains area.
---
People think paladins are the OG primadonna. Nope, always the mage.
---
Yeah I feel that, I can never find what I want on there :( that should work for you bud, mine is default too except the font and the font size :)
---
&gt; what makes you think a QA would of found this?
---
they should've fucking tested by themselves, lol. layering its their creation. this is not a simple hunter pet pathing bug, this is something game breaking that should've never been shipped. treating it is a regular bug is baffling.
---
Napoleon syndrome. Like short guys on lifted trucks.
---
True until level 46 then it becomes considerably easier, especially with crafted gear. The blizzard rank power spikes are real. Level 52 is the next upgrade and should allow for smooth sailing from that point on. If mobs resist frost nova it's still pretty fucking close though.
---
Yeh I‚Äôve made it brd/lets have to use a sword and board.
---
While leveling, you can get away with not keeping a healing set, because it's been easier to find a healer than a tank for most groups, so I've exclusively tanked instances after healing RFC once. This assumes you're willing to tank, and you really should be, because it's easy and it allows you to control how many mobs are pulled and where they're pulled to.  You have to worry about some idiot tank who pulls by charging into a room, and then ends up aggroing other packs and wiping the party.
---
Not really, seeing as warriors don't gain rage on Absorb hits
---
Former DPS shaman here, I've been running dungeons mostly and usually ended up healing anyway so I swapped to resto to dump out more heals and plop down totems.
---
better than nothing.  Back in the day you had to read each quest like 5 times then check thottbot or wowhead or whoever the fuck was around back then and read the comments to find the location of almost anything.
---
You have a nose. Therefore I should punch it.
---
Makes a lot of sense apparently according to your statement?
---
Yeah I dunno. Probably shouldnt tell people how to play for reasons of *nobility* like who really cares. Horde cheap shots me I cheap shot them. Its wpvp for a reason. 
---
Helping out an opposing faction on a pvp server for brownie points is purely subjective and trying to share your story to convince others is indeed shameful, considering the whole purpose of a pvp server is for realism and the slaughter. Nothing more satisfying than smoking someone in the back with pyro, knowing they have to run the whole zone to get their corpse , hence why both factions do it. It's why we are here. Crying about it wont change shit. 
---
,
---
They were still very expensive compared to the resolution/size you could get from CRTs. I bought a new 19" Viewsonic CRT in late 2004 and got 1280x1024, which was awesome for the time.
---
Oh okay glad I didn‚Äôt miss anything.
---
Okay friend, why do you report all of "these posts?"
---
What server are you on?
---
Yeah, that is +healing. You are prioritizing correctly, especially for dungeon healing/leveling; spirit is by far your best stat and should be prioritized heavily IMO.
---
+healing isn't really worth it until it makes your lower-ranked heals a good bit more efficient than your max ranked gheal. You'll need calculators to figure out what that breakpoint is based on your level/spell, but it's gonna take hundreds of +healing to be worth it.
---
Around 7-8 or so, est, I think? Am.
---
As a rogue/druid player, yes. I gape in disbelief when some Ally scum thinks they can just come over to my area and start killing my spawns. That's gonna be a swift stun lock into death if you don't back off fast.
---
Glitching should turn into bans, especially for twitch punks.
---
Mine were always cut in the shape of Cthulhu
---
Ah, that explains it, then, thanks!
---
I'm glad I play alliance. I never want to find out how it feels to get reckbombed by Hand of Rag.
---
&gt; You do realize ice block lets the warrior stand on top of you, regain health, and line up an attack + ability you can't avoid, right? 
---
Which is why Ice Block is a last resort. You should never need it between Frost Nova, CoC, Frostbolt, and Blink. If the warrior manages to resist some CC and you need to shake a stun or hamstring but don't want to or already used Blink, then you can Ice Block and wait for Blink or Frost Nova to come back, or just insta block and unblock. 
---
&gt; It's a delaying tactic at best, and the longer the fight goes, the more it favors the warrior. 
---
Depends on how long. Warrior has two gap closers, charge and Intercept. Charge can only be used once. Intercept can only be used every 30 seconds. Mage Blink is on a 15-second cooldown, Frost Nova on a 25-second cooldown (20 with talents if you spec into it, or you get double casts if you spec into Cold Snap). 
---
If Mage survives the first charge and intercept and can start to kite after that, there's nothing warrior can do about it for 30-seconds, at which point Blink will be back up. But the fight should never take that long since Mage with a little bit of wiggle room can rain down death on a slowed warrior. 
---
So Ice Block is a delaying tactic but only until Mage's shorter CD's cycle, at which point there's nothing a warrior can do.
---
I down loaded bustrea's leveling guide and addons pack.  Been good for leveling my warrior from 27-47.  Usually green and lower yellow quests to kill.
---
Ah yes, I remember Lagrimmar not so fondly lol.
---
Very smooth! I probably wouldn‚Äôt say the last think and I also probably wouldn‚Äôt be invited to as many groups :)
---
My sister and her friend (both Priests) we‚Äôre harassed, groped, and cat-called by an elderly dwarf and his gnome buddies on the tram to Ironforge.
---
Most of the stuff about Paladins being bad was about PvE as far as I know. Ret is awful even while leveling (take it from me - I'm leveling one as Ret and it's barely passable in the 20s, and it's pretty much downhill from here with the lack of something as OP as Verigan's Fist at higher levels). Prot might be decent for tanking dungeons on the way up, and you could probably make it work in raids, but you'd likely be much better off with a Warrior in most, if not all, situations.
---
Depends on the food/water as there are different kinds that restore different amounts.
---
It‚Äôs a shame, I can‚Äôt /inspect anyone now and be amazed. All I can think of is layer exploiters.
---
Makes all those fetch quests much more tolerable, so, so much of Vanilla's pacing was based around it taking forever to go back and forth between questgivers.
---
Getting a mount greatly reduces that time, but at the cost of a relatively large amount of gold. It's only because we've been through this before that anybody worries about getting \~120g by level 40. Back in the day we were all blindsided by it and didn't wind up getting a mount until 46-50.
---
And when homies is removed even more layering!
---
Id complain to the waiter, but I conjured it.
---
I dont think bleed damage can crit in vanilla though right? At level 60, strength is def the priority once you get to the soft crit cap which is pretty easily done afaik, especially with +crit gear.
---
ah okay, was before reset. 
---
the server reset and this started happening to people is what I'm gathering.
---
I know I'm a few days late but I just saw this. I've been leveling full feral, are you just switching between which specs to apply your talent to at each level? Or do the full 30 into feral and then switching to resto?
---
Im not butthurt over the game, nothing like this ever happened to me while playing, but people like this make me puke a little bit in my mouth.  People who condone such behavior does aswell,
---
There it is .ü§£
---
I absolutely live for hearing the gnome death sound from some cocky mage who thinks he's got it.
---
Many mages start a fight me for no reason and a lot of them end up trying to run or poli (im druid lmao)
---
Gameplay automation (botting). What's even worse is that it was a rotation bot.
---
Not even close to competing with thrash blade for rogues at least
---
Noobs are still a thing.
---
Curse of weakness should almost never be used. The only time it‚Äôs valuable is in pvp for throwing on hunter pets, and even that is up to debate. 
---
Normally, in the low 20s, you want to respec to get improved void walker. Wait until you have the talents to get that as well as improved corruption.
---
&gt;Next your gonna tell me your annoyed that Asmondgold has like 700+ gold because people just hand him shit like that as candy
---
Not only OP but also half of this sub. Those jealous bitches don't get to play the game themself because they always be complaining about minor shit streamers do that have 0 impact on their own game but still drives them retarded
---
You can't be mr fun and relaxed after all that acidic replying my dude, but keep your chin up.
---
Sometimes I feel like this sub thinks the game came out in 1994, not 2004.
---
Dont make me come over ther a.....*phases out*
---
The speed is great, but the damage isn't there till cat form.  Even then it's not great.  
---
So yeah it's a bit of a slog.
---
I've been all about rushing to max, getting my gear getting into raids and pushing that heroic/mythic content (expansion dependent). For years I chased wowprogress and world of logs ranks. 
---
But this is the 2nd coming of a 15 year old game that has been continually played for the near entirety of that 15 year gap. There's just about 0 incentive to go fast. Just keep pace. 
---
Like I dont want to be level 45 when p2 comes out.  I dont want to be just getting into UBRS when motherfuckers are walking around with Ashkandis. Me in t1 quality them in t2? I can handle those odds.
---
I went to wetlands at 20-23 then red ridge to finish elites now probably gonna go to dusk wood at 25
---
Are there any recourses out there for learning how to play a Rogue in PVP? I don‚Äôt care for all of the ‚ÄúPVP guides‚Äù that just tell you talents and gear and stuff. I‚Äôm looking for something that can teach me me how to be a good Rogue player and actually talks about mechanics
---
Lol you‚Äôre an idiot.

The trifecta
---
I don't remember it but I like it
---
I have the Booty Bay/Grom'gol flight points and the Undercity one, but I can't fly from one end to the other of the Eastern Kingdoms. Do I have to take the zeppelin forever or do I just need additional fight points? The closest to STG are the arathi/hillsbrad ones...
---
You can get a Starving Mountain Lion from Hillsbrad at 23, they are also 1.20 speed.
---
I'm not the person who commented that man lol.
---
All I did was comment on your reply "How so" because it's pretty obvious how asmons streamer persona can come off as obnoxious.
---
Learn 2 reddit.
---
Just dont roll on a pvp server. Ganking lowbies is a tale as old as time, its par for the course.
---
Questie shows quests out of level range that can‚Äôt be picked up yet. Sometimes it shows turn ins for quests you‚Äôve already turned in. And rarer still, it occasionally shows wrong faction quests on your map. 
---
It‚Äôs far from perfect but it is a great aid.
---
&gt; Too many (AoE Grinding) mages think they're going to be the next Joker
---
Yea, Jokerd's strat only works in very specific circumstances.
---
You need an empty zone with good conditions for big pulls AND you either need people to not be aware of what you're doing or you need layering.
---
just based off the survey that has been posted on this sub a bunch of times....  too lazy to link it for you and my memory could be wrong admittedly
---
If the icons are getting stuck on the map after you accepted the quest, if you reload your ui they should go away.
---
Yeah. Although i can drink it on the first slow and then be slow free the rest of the fight right? Either way, that damn potion is the only counter, if it even can be considered such.
---
Yeah, this issue doesn‚Äôt have to do with mages. Just people being assholes really.
---
i just hate gnomes because they are so small for me as a tauren but i cannot punt them
---
yes it did this post is a lie carry on
---
I've never had any problem and I never write the []. Like you said, it's the default value, it should be strictly equivalent. Unless there's a bug somewhere.
---
Good job to Lifetap for hanging on with all those mages in the damagedealing meter during the whole fight  :D
---
Which game?
---
Afaik that's a thing but also takes a bit of gear since you need to have the Mana to outheal the damage and still consecrate. Or so I've heard. Seems fun though.
---
I highly doubt they will catch everyone who‚Äôs done this. Just the more severe cases, and maybe not even all of those :(
---
Thats how I had my daugher when I was raiding ZG in private servers lol.
---
Maybe clear up to Rag again and just destroy the loot grabbed up to Rag sending a message to Blizz about it
---
Thanks for the article!
---
Well, that's exactly why. The addons have to be completely rewritten for the modern API.
---
Which addons are you talking about though? Because the biggest questing addons in Classic are the same ones that were popular on private servers for 12.0.1 clients - Questie and ClassicCodex (which is based on pfQuest from private servers).
---
Can't play a game yourself? Here let me automatize the whole game for you. Hunters don't need skill, you making it even easier?
---
Well, that's exactly why. The addons have to be completely rewritten for the new API.
---
Druid isn‚Äôt a slog. Isn‚Äôt no mage or hunter but it might be next in line.
---
Hmmm. Makes me wonder. Maybe as a paladin I could grab 3 or 4 and just tank them for 8 mins to get back at them.
---
No hero classes.  At all.  That wouldn't fit into Classic.
---
Some things that don't change vanilla but offer a surplus of replayability would be severs dedicated to Season characters, Challenge servers (e.g. Ironman), &amp; Harcore servers in addition to the normal, persistent Classic servers.
---
I understood that reference.
---
Best of luck mate :)

Nice triple post dipshit

I already use RTY for abilities, and by pure coincidence, my auto attack hotkey is on T.

&gt;the guys who try to ruin my aoe pull, three of you jumping on me? You just cost 3 Horde, questing and minding their own buisness, their life. Now if I kill them, the debt is paid.
---
I understand this. But what about your fellow alliance getting camped out in STV for example? Do you not care about them? I kill every horde I see because somewhere out in azeroth is an alliance member who was killed by horde
---
"The fight favors mages sure"
---
Glad you can at least acknowledge this lol. 
---
"Warriors can run a mage oom via def stance swapping and forcing them to burn mana on control / escape rather easily unless extremely undergeared."
---
With evocation and mana agate I have never once run into mana issues in a duel as mage. Most of that mana spent on control is also doing significant damage. 
---
"Warriors can kill a mage in an intercept stun."
---
Which is why Mage's Blink the intercept. Also, Mana Shield, Ice Armor and Ice Barrier if you spec that far into Frost make mage's insanely resistant to physical damage. 
---
Even with improved Intercept it's a 20-second CD, so it will always be worse than Blink. 
---
The mage could also have Engineering. If you want to factor in professions then you also need to look at racials, like how UD mages can shake the fear from shout. 
---
If you're depending on a ranged weapon as a warrior to fight against a mage you're already dead. 
---
A skilled warrior can beat a mage, it's not a 100% lockout. But if skill and gear are equal, a mage wins 9/10.
---
Yeah we played since vanilla. Just never had such a gold shortage so it's nice having a steady cash flow. He's throwing leather on the AH and I'm making pots as quick as I can.
---
I wish Blizzard would allow me to sort between bid and buyout, its smart but annoying to have auctions listed as a 1c bid.
---
&gt; I feel like I've properly substantiated everything I"ve said. You don't provide content to the discussion you just say "you're wrong, stockades".
---
Well, let's review:
---
You say stupid shit.
---
You brag about running stockades.
---
If you wanted me to take you seriously, you should try:
---
Saying intelligent things.
---
Talk about exactly how you 5 DPS clear all of the end-game dungeons.
---
... but you haven't done that.  Funny how that works.
---
&gt; Just have to prove you wrong one by one until you accept a new way of life.
---
I keep asking you to prove me wrong by filming yourself do this.  And oddly enough, you're completely unwilling to provide that evidence.
---
&gt; That was fast. You get it now! It is possible! Hooray, lets put this to bed!
---
I see you've just gone full stupid.  =P
---
I gave examples of edge-cases, whereas your claim was that 5 DPS was always more efficient than Tank/Healer groups.
---
Now you're trying to weasel out of it by saying that rare edge-cases and exploits prove your point.  It doesn't.  It just makes you look stupid.
---
&gt; I've already done it man.
---
Still waiting on that video proof.
---
&gt; Should be fun. Weird stipulations though. You keep having to narrow your argument further and further to support your claim. Weird how that works as you get backed into a corner?
---
Less talking, more doing.  =)
---
And of course I'm listing all the stipulations.  You're just stupid enough to burn through tons of elixers, flasks, potions, bandages, etc and then claim "look, it's more efficient!"
---
If your claim was true, then you'd be able to take a group of 5 DPS, with average gear for that level/dungeon, and clear those dungeons faster than Tank/Healer group without using any consumables (because you claim it's more efficient, and burning through consumables isn't efficient).
---
Get going, dude.
---
Botting is a bannable offence, if you think you have some proof, submit it to Blizzard so they can examine the case.
---
People staring all day at AH or running addons all day on a second account (yes those people exist) *is not* botting, even if it *may* seem like it from the point of view of someone who doesn't play the AH, it's legit gameplay.
---
Banning addons is not a solution, banning bots is, whatever they do.
---
Wow that‚Äôs rude as fuck of them. When I‚Äôm AoE-Ing things I try to take turns with people doing the quest, and I‚Äôll even throw them some flame strikes/blizzards/explosions on their own pulls when I‚Äôm waiting for a spawn. They‚Äôre probably the same people who flame on retail over stupid shit
---
I've simply decided to not help any mages. If I see an allied mage getting ganked by enemies I let them do it because screw mages. 90% of them are annoying as hell and do nothing but zoomercleave from dungeon to dungeon anyway.
---
Here's also a quest to go to Badlands,  you know just in case you wanted to spend the next 45 minutes traveling.
---
I was lvling up a mage and a lvl 27 hunter rolled need on lvl 15 magefist gloves that was a huge upgrade for me and beat me out.  Huntards will be huntards.
---
Once you hit 23ish as frost mage you can AoE level. It makes them tier 1 levelers and a lot more fun. Theres a lot more thinking involved and a fun risk/reward involved as well.  The build revolves around maximizing your slows, pulling 4-6 mobs, and using blizzard to kill them all.
---
This is sad. Get help.
---
Wait the one i did was in the badlands but i only had to get 5. I think i killed 7 lol
---
Merc stealth goat wow keyboard
---
How would you notice your revenge har borne fruit? He stops playing?
---
If video games are making you sick, maybe video games aren't for you.
---
This is exactly what I've been doing on my alt.
---
As a warrior, prioritize green quests, and do lots of dungeon farm runs!  All of SM, and ZF:GY are good farming dungs
---
The nice thing about Classic is that you'll still have the chance to do everything you want when you finally level to 60.
---
3. No witch hunts or brigading. Don‚Äôt encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community.
---
Which is why Mage's Blink the intercept. Also, Mana Shield, Ice Armor and Ice Barrier if you spec that far into Frost make mage's insanely resistant to physical damage.

---
If it's an upgrade for me, i will hit Need.   
---
Anything else i'll just Greed.   
---
If someone explicitly says something before they Need/Greed i may pass or trade it to them if I win it.  
---
But anyone getting salty AFTER they hit Need/Greed kind of brought it on themselves. People get saltier about gear than anything else. I just don't get it... especially on these low level dungeons that will be replaced sooner than later.
---
Thanks, should work with classic too right ?
---
My rotation is Shield (before engage), then SW: Pain, Flay, Flay, Flay or Mind Blast, then wand to death.
---
Blizzard on a 3min CD üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Use ClassicCodex, looks and works much better imo.
---
This isn't a mage issue, this is a shitty person issue. AoE is just a tool in the tookit, I'm super squishy and thats my method to not one at a time kill. I typically limit to 3 mobs if its a low population in the area I'm in, and two mobs if its a somewhat populated area. This keeps my survival rate up. My favorite part about the spec is grouping with a couple people working on that quest and going to town on splash damage, because I feel like im carrying my weight with the group since it's one of the strongest aspects of the class. I main'd a mage from 2005 -&gt; BFA, and I rolled a mage in classic. I'm not seeing any difference in how this is playing out from how it was in vanilla. Maybe just more people doing it that are bad at it now because they watch youtube. You can't expect etiquette from people in this game, it's just not how it works. Add them to the list of people you wont group with and keep on keepin on.
---
You know what? You're totally right. I guess I'll just take my 34 year old ass and go back to Hello Kitty Online.
---
 In fact, I‚Äôm a lot more proud of these 4 new 14-slot bags that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new tomes and scrolls that I bought.
---
You have to keep in mind this was 2005 and it was definitely a Chinese gold-farmer we were fucking with.
---
Resto,feral,tank are all viable endgame not just resto
---
Did not mean to spam comment, Reddit acting funny &lt;3
---
You can play Horde and still never find out what it feels like lol.... You can't /sit to build stacks of Reckoning anymore.
---
Windfury though...
---
Did they not msg a gm and a gm told them they were allowed to kill
---
It was pretty widely known that pvp servers would be wildly imbalanced.  If you picked Horde with that knowledge... yes you are knowingly imbalancing the game.
---
Hence the quotes. I'm poking fun at his shit pronunciation.
---
Put Blizzard on a 3min CD üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
There's not much you can do with a large level-difference, except ask them to go slow. Lack of rage due to miss/parry/dodge can also ruin a pull for you that early on. Just don't worry too much about individual runs.
---
Pulling multiple enemies back just requires people not to attack them until they're where you need the group. People should understand this. If there's casters use corners and line of sight to get them within range.
---
‚ÄúWhoa‚Äù? I saw your comment, but I had to test it first to confirm if that was the one, and it wasn‚Äôt.
---
What a shitlord response
---
If you're a mage and can't kill a warrior you're trash.
---
Lots of people work normal office hours. With a 5-hour queue, they simply wouldn't be able to play during the week, at all.
---
really? wasn‚Äôt he farming manual crowd pummelers?
---
The early nerd gets the worm
---
/cancelform does every form ;)
---
Guilty
---
Do you know how you can manually put which rank you want in the macro? I‚Äôve been trying to figure it out and can‚Äôt get it, all tricks I try use the max rank anyway
---
Well it‚Äôs classic , so it may be awhile before I‚Äôm full t1, but considering how much raw gold I make doing so, I think I‚Äôll be fine , I‚Äôm 41 bought my mount when I singed 40 bought all my skills and still sitting at 50g ish , are repairs cheaper with better rep?
---
Gz but the timeline of the chat confused me. I was like why the fuck are rogues rolling on the eye...
---
It‚Äôs no rush, plenty of players aren‚Äôt hard grinding or being optimal
---
I imagine something like this happens if I kill too many alliance and become too infamous. Encourages me to slaughter more of them.
---
GAS GAS GAS
---
No since this is not part of wow classic and can only be added by an addon.
---
I genuinely do it understand the appeal of telling other people what you do or do not find humorous.
---
So, I haven't really fought many warriors on my mage, what exactly would I be counterspelling?
---
Nope. Enemy cast bars without an addon were not a thing in vanilla.
---
I don't think he's a troll. A lot of people feel that way. This isn't some minor exploit.
---
Class colors are handled natively in the wow client
---
If you can't kill a warrior as a mage you're garbage
---
Meh.  Show me lvl10s.  A lot of people level their bank alts to lvl 5 for DEing
---
ALL THE THINGS
---
&gt;so underrepresented factions will get even more underpopulated over time.
---
Yes, I think it will be a snowball effect, some people will get fed up by being ganked everytime they do anything, even running to instance portals. Then they will quit or transfer, making it worse and it will just go on until the entire server is fucked.
---
I am considering finding a close to 50/50 ish server that I think I can invest my time into without it being a wasteland in a month or two.
---
Especally if Blizzard stays quiet.
---
Impressive how you've played for 11 years as a gnome and still be wrong. Gnomes most definitely do not have bigger mounts than taurens - they are somewhat inbetween "normal" size mounts and tauren size mounts.
---
Also, you should be able to put bounties on your own faction's dickheads for Horde to collect.
---
MAN I would LOVE that.
---
I hate that people can exploit bugs to stockpile gold. Otoh, devilsaur leather can be really hard to farm for, and it's a necessity commodity, and by putting so many into the economy it will result in a price reduction. Which is actually a good thing. So I don't know.
---
Question is. Did they kill you?
---
Can someone explain which encounter was being exploited? I would assume it was the BRD arena or the stairs in ZF.
---
I‚Äôll be fine I think lol
---
Sea monster inspired by gutierrez, can't blame you he's the master
---
One thing could be is that u dont have to place max rank there when u get upgrade, as the macro will always use max rank
---
I mostly single target farm. I only AoE when there arent others around. I cant play more than 5 minutes without being ganked. I literally have 19 hours at level 37 now because the corpse camping is bad.
---
Yes but that is leveling and in phase 2 my guild is done leveling. We are just going to be in safe areas in town and only leave for the world as a raid to farm honor . I think being on the less populated faction has its benefits so long as you properly roam and peel from areas you get outnumbered .
---
&gt;I mean... who cares?
---
The constant spam unguilded people get?
---
Girlfriends love the queue system
---
I like how sturdy everything is. Today's stuff gets rekt by cats
---
I think they should take away all 40 man raid loot from everyone across all realms, buff the numbers of mc and ony by like 40-50%, then open them back up with layering bug fixed like a fresh start.
---
That's what I'd do if I didn't have a friend group trying to build a guild.  
---
Then if it's not very active, hop to another one.
---
Once more of the community is at 60, things will shake out a little better and it will be easier to tell which guilds have a solid raiding group.
---
Nope, already fixed with last night's ~20 minute downtime.
---
What are you, a ninjalooter sympathizer?
---
&gt; it makes you sound like a salty child 
---
I'd agree with this sentiment if there was more vitriol behind the message, or if it was vulgar.  ‚Äúlol gg buddy enjoy your ban‚Äù is pretty harmless, and could potentially serve as bait if the user responds appropriately.
---
I mean you and him are still saying you're proud of being able to kill people that have 5 mobs on them and are probably lower level
---
I follow pretty much the same dot logic. I put only put immolate on targets if its 3 or less mobs. 3 or higher i use hellfire/rain of fire. but only if I know I won't take aggro or if there's a mage using frost nova.
---
The rare time recording your screen with your phone is okay
---
eh not really? they could just as easily have made it so you couldn't change loot rules mid-instance.
---
Slow down there, Satan.
---
Well, right now this exploit topic is big stuff, particularly what punishment. OP probably knew what they were doing and are purposefully stirring shit by posting this zero context video.
---
Won't lie, i put faith in the OP and was angered by watching this clip. I don't know the streamer, couldn't tell their sarcasm. Anger should be directed toward the people putting up these posts in order to incite rage.
---
I genuinely do not understand the appeal of telling random strangers on the internet what you do or do not find humorous.
---
Story checks out.
---
After a **full week** of transfers the server has grown considerably and is not "dead" as advertised after **1 day** of transfers.  Still no que. After 5 days of data collection the server went from about 831 total active to over 2087 total active using the wowpop census.  Obviously that's not Herod, or Farleina levels but it is about a full vanilla population. Population is growing and worth leaving a que for.  If you still want to hesitate and sit in a que, feel free. I wont tell you how to spend you 15$ a month,  I can only say I felt it was worth it for me.
---
Frostnova? Oops, looks like my Multi-Shot finger slipped, my bad.
---
I‚Äôm jelly.
---
I'm a skinner on the character I'm playing with my wife, and I definitely plan on taking us through Stranglethorn and Un'goro for exactly this reason.
---
This happened to me last night in Rigger's Cove. You need like 20 hats and 30 mob kills.
---
In my case though. It was opposing faction mages.
---
Mages might be hot stuff, but let me tell you one thing. Nothing is weaker than a mage trying to AOE farm.
---
Let them get all those mobs clumped up. Start their first Blizzard and BAM cheap shot. Now they have two options. Sit in the stunlock (and die) or blink forward into the mobs (and die while taking durability damage).
---
After a few deaths... Everyone was single pulling their mobs.
---
Tigress fang tookme over 40 kills, gorilla sinew took me 3 lmao
---
Do what is fun for you! For me it's a mix of questing, grinding an running dungeons! Enjoy the game as you enjoy it!
---
Damn I wish I had a desk to play on
---
It really was back in like 2015
---
That rogue was just salty. Almost any class that can use a one handed sword (besides mages and warlocks) can benefit greatly from Cruel Barb.
---
A hunter can (honestly should) use two cruel barbs with +15agil enchants all the way to 60 (unless you want to PvP where a slow 2H is ideal).
---
Hunters are basically the only class (besides PvP feral druids) that benefit from all the stats on that ring at all times. (Maybe ret pallies, kind of.)
---
People are always gonna bitch when they don:t get what they want. Fuck 'em.
---
If you did the exploit once(as in killed boss, it reset and you killed it again) - Warning/loot taken
---
If you did the exploit up to 10 times - 1 week ban/loot taken
---
If you did the exploit more than 10 times - Perma-ban, deleted character.
---
Gotta pump those numbers up
---
I mean, why not just heal, but say you're feral and rolling need on that stuff against rogues?
---
I'm a "dps" spec warrior but I always say I can tank in lfg channel and tank lots of dungeons and dps in some too. You don't have to be heal specced to heal. 
---
I feel like you're missing a chance for an easy group when you see "lf1m healer then gtg..." In lfg posts.
---
Same thing I did back in 2005. Sounds like it's your own mindset pigeon holing yourself into 1 role just bc of your spec
---
the /moon emote works better for bubblehearthing
---
also make sure you have the 12 second bubble, otherwise you will end up embarrassed.
---
Depends on the circumstances. Was it for your off spec and against their main spec? 
---
Were you using a 2h weapon and needed a on a 1h?
---
Were you rolling against the tank for a 1h weapon which would benefit the whole group to let them have it Vs. your not being able to equip it yet?
---
Or is it just a priest and a mage squabbling over a wand? In which case, go for it.
---
In any case it‚Äôs generally polite to not roll against someone who can equip a drop now, when you‚Äôre under lvl. You‚Äôll likely see the drop again before you can equip it while they‚Äôre probably about to out level the dungeon.

Raid Times: Tuesday/Thursday 6-9(PST), subject to change as more raid tiers are released.
---
Description: We are a guild built around clearing end game content, but don't want our guild members playing this game like a full time job, interested in experienced players but more so people who are fun to play with. We currently expect players to hit 60 before the end of the month so we can start raiding all together as one unit and clearing content as such. We have a rather friendly and understanding/helpful environment, all officers are friends and close to one another IRL and are transparent and understanding/helpful as much as anyone else, we hope to add you to a part of our family/friend group :)
---
Recruiting: Currently looking for Melee DPS and Druid/Shaman healers to fill the last remaining slots in our raid team, a Druid Tank wouldn't hurt either, but all are welcome to enjoy the friendly environment the guild has.
---
Contact: Feel free to mail or whisper my character Greemoth for more info or for a guild invitation, our discord link will be with the guild info.
---
Let me know if you have any questions.
---
Also, feel free to respond to this thread.
---
I would mainly quest but run each dungeon at least once to get its quests done.
---
I hear there a guild meeting at the entrance of SW last night.
---
Out of curiosity, would master loot be a temp fix to this problem? Or can‚Äôt send loot to a player who hasn‚Äôt done the quest?
---
Please tell me that's a sleeper
---
Don't call it "rape".  Put a positive spin on it, and call it "surprise sex".  Then it's not so bad, because let's be honest.  Who doesn't want surprise sex?
---
Did you have rabies?
---
No ones gonna waste gold on pets right now, most people are still saving for their mounts.
---
I mean Blizzard permabanned an entire guild for one raid exploiting a GM item that a player somehow acquired.... Didn't matter if they were part of the raid they were banned simply for association. I say delete ALL of their characters not just the one they exploited and ban/investigate any character they traded gold/items with, gotta be thorough.
---
Gnomish death ray? pls:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6J40oaIbmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6J40oaIbmo)

When I hit 60 I'm coming back to STV and just murdering everyone without mercy.
---
I hear there was a guild meeting at the entrance of SW last night.
---
I don't kill horde mages aoe farming, I hamstring and stun and fear them to let the mobs catch them and finish the job for durability damage.
---
Then I /laugh.
---
/yell IT'S HUNTER LOOT
---
Dude grats! Now if you‚Äôve done your Ony quest you don‚Äôt have to touch UBRS
---
In computing, it's really not.
---
Exploit is exploiting a vulnerability in software etc, while abuse is just misuse.
---
I fully support simple AH scanners like Auctionator. The default AH interface is pretty terrible. Any player should be able to see prices across all pages and buy/sell accordingly.
---
I'm kind of against the ones that automate the process further, but there's nothing to be done about it.
---
Is it a leveling guide? If so, no. Wowclassic.live is probably one of the best guides and put together so nicely. It‚Äôs perfectly free and catered to your class and race. Hands down the best routes for questing i‚Äôve taken and it‚Äôs accurate down to the exp.
---
True that
---
No on ever says let's run DM meaning Dire Maul. They say DMN or whatever. Therefore DM is still Deadmines.
---
&gt;Such as playing off-stream
---
I'm not trying to defend the boosting at all, but Tim makes a living entirely off streaming. This isn't really an option most of the time unless he wants to sacrifice his paycheck.
---
Don't those 12 slot bags at vendors cost like 5-10 gold? That's a lot at early leveling when you're trying to save for a mount.
---
I'm constantly having my bags full and I have 12 &amp; 14 slot bags.
---
I lost a blue BoE sword The Black Knight for 3s on the AH because I‚Äôm an idiot and listed it while drunk. Anyone else make some dumb mistake early on?
---
I think this is brilliant, it's a big ask but I'd love to see the full world in this style!
---
This quality has poster potential üòä
---
Archeage has this.  Any time you attacked a faction member, or took anything that someone else planted, it would leave red footprints behind.  If enough people reported the footprints, you'd become 'wanted'. 
---
If you died with the 'wanted' tag, you'd be taken to a courtroom where other players would judge guilty/not guilty, and they'd get to select no time/moderate time/max time.  Depending on your offences, the max time could be days.  
---
In pvp you'd focus whoever had the wanted tag first.  Thin the herd out by sending people off to trial.  Good times.
---
Not bots.
---
Sometimes when questie won't update properly you can type /reload ui and often it'll fix that. Sometimes not, sometimes yes.
---
I think my favorite thing to do as a Shaman is watch a warlock sacrifice their pet for literally nothing.
---
Yesterday I encountered a mage that pulled 20 mobs in WP. Somehow I got on the aggro table so they came running to me when he died and then I whispered him, telling him he should be more careful because its annoying af for me to deal with his shit. Then he replied with some toxic bullshit. GG
---
Trying to convince us or yourself ?
---
" Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is".  -2pac changes
---
Man it feels so good seeing soooo many players coming together to blacklist someone on both factions
---
They're animals! And I slaughtered them like animals!
---
You lack vision!
---
I recently inspected a fellow frost mage, lvl 38, and was amazed about his full azure gear, absolutely dazzling! :D
---
Yep.  As someone who got to enjoy negative resists before they were patched out, coe always goes up with seduce.
---
This happened to me last night for the first time in Arathi Highlands. I was doing the quest "To Steal From Thieves" from UC and you need to kill three named mobs. Three mages were fighting each other for AoE farm and I was waiting on Feldan (close enough). While waiting I started killing a lob or two nearby and this mage ran over and started wanding anything near me. Being the proud shaman I am, I chain lightninged his pull and stole a couple back. Fair is fair. You don't have a fucking deed to this farm and I took a couple of mobs back he stole from me (in his twitch-fueled uber leet leveling frenzy).
---
Now this mage, named Darling (with one of those funky character a's) on Kromcrush, clearly had some respawn timer add-on. Because he ran over and instantly tagged the mob I was waiting on to "teach me a lesson to not steal his farm." 
---
I'm an adult. I have a full time job and don't get to play a lot. So I thought to myself, don't be confrontational and just wait again on the mob and get out of here. Be the bigger man and let the man-child mage have his way...
---
But then the orc in me came out and I was overcome with an irrational bloodlust, looking at you Gul'dan. Why should I have to work around some self-important asshole? What lesson do I need to learn? That I deserve to play and enjoy the game less than this tryhard soulless leech? So I ruined his day. I tagged every mob that spawned dropped fire totems everywhere he stopped. He tried to compete with me but didn't understand the rules of the game. I was never going to beat him at AoE farming the area, but I absolutely could make sure his session was terrible. He tried to tag the named mob again but no one beats a target/earth shock macro.  
---
For all you mages out there who think you're too hot to trot, if you play stupid games you win stupid prizes. This is a community-focused game. And if the community is unhappy with you, you probably earned it. Go back to BFA where you were used to playing alone and only looking out for yourself. Also I think guild wars still works or try dota. Stop ruining the experience for others so you can pro-level grind to 60, Magetards.
---
If you're going off of wowhead's dates, that will be incorrect, as it runs according to the Korean Calendar, not the one that we use, iirc.
---
Zoom
---
Yeah... Don't you go Moonglow because your pre raid Bis gear can't sustain swiftmend build efficiently... Im pretty sure you shouldn't be rolling swiftmend until like bwl gear into AQ but I play feral tank with a 0/30/21 off heal spec so I won't claim to have the pure healer talents on point.
---
Not a mage issue, it's douchebag issue. 
---
 I was killing murloc in Swamp of Sorrows and some orc warlock named "yourdumb" come up and aoe feared my halfdead pack.
---
Then he told me not to steal the quest mobs and play the game the right way.
---
I'd been there alone for half an hour, not even taking all of the mobs because I was busy doing laundry and stuff and this was the first time I'd seen him.
---
 Just be courteous to your fellow WoWers, we need each other!
---
[Here is a quest guide that lets you know about all of the quests for each dungeon](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/dungeon-quests-classic-wow)
---
Some quests will be easy and you can just pick them up from a giver or have them shared with you.  Other quests require a chain to unlock so you'll want to do that prior to looking for your group if you want the items/xp/gold from the quest.
---
I dont know why people care that rich people have money then you. You have no chance anyway? Why are concerned with economics, healthcare, and politics; just enjoy your station in life. The elite class will always blow you away so who cares if they cheat rig the system and pedophiles your kids. #gamerlogic

I was killing murloc in Swamp of Sorrows and some orc warlock named "yourdumb" come up and aoe feared my halfdead pack.

Human Mages aoe farming in Arathi @ the orc farm. I've ambushed the same 3 ladies about 10 times in the last 3 days.   
---
They all pop their iceblock at the same time when they are 25%. I can't not ambush them....
---
Why do you think we roll alliance? Gnomer is flight path adjacent, we basically have a farm of gnomes and can kill all we want whereas you gotta track em down.
---
I know it's very unlikely, but I would like them to pull a Dota 2 in the sense that they should keep the original WoW world and mechanics mostly the same, but update the engine/visuals to modern standard and polish/replace some of the quests.
---
More a retail question, since its classic.
---
Blizzard commented that they want to update the AH system and its something they will look into in the future.
---
I tghink its complet dogshit, ppl have abused the ah with addons for years. Abd theres varly any fees etc. 
---
So they put things on ah with with 1 copper bids, if you bid on it its instant outbided.
---
Id say theres something fishy going on, but im not a programer so i dont know shit...
---
30 % ah fee
---
Cant cancel auctions
---
And make ways to find lowest buyout and bid seperate

I hate the ppl who "play the economy". But the wow has no form of anti inflation taxes or anything that makes it a real economy. These ppl have allways ruin the fun of others and i my mind can get the proper rules and taxes that avreal economy has.

That would be great.

Easy fix. Be the tank.
---
The calculation of how many tries *should* give at least one positive result is done by using the chance to fail:
---
10% drop chance means a 90% probability (0.9) to fail.
---
This means for 10 consecutive runs the probality to fail equals 0.9^10 = 0.3486784401
---
Rounded to two decimal places we now have a probality to fail at 0.35 or 35%.
---
And this again means 65% chance of succeeding (at least once) in 10 runs when having a drop chance of 10%.
---
EDIT: So the important note here is "should." We're not calculating a true drop rate, but expected. Instead we're using the statistical probability of failing X times in a row, inverted.
---
Well if you're into something, you should be commenting on wowhead. There are people there far more resourceful and willing to check and correct things. 
---
If you want to stir the water here and get people on subject, make it more clear. Everyone understood that you don't know how to use google and downvoted your post.
---
There is nothing spotting you form using that pet.

But, some pets have better stats than others (i.e. attack speed). You might want to look at [petopia](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/) to seek which pet you could have.

He have a video of him reading the Exploit on his stream and he clearly didn't know it was possible.  He explicitly said he wouldn't do it because the chance of getting banned was too high.  Asfen on Faerlina have a video of him resetting Molten Core by accident and his first reflexe was to send a Ticket to Blizzard to notice them.  He was coming back to Molten Core just to down Ragnaros but realised the whole  Raid was reset.  Blizzard gave them the "ok" to clear the raid again.
---
Tipsout on one of his video said he tried it several time with different parametre and said it was easily doable and abusable.

I doubt Asmongold is stupid enough to jeopardize his WoW Classic and WoW BFA account, his ability to make money IRL (no stream no money) and ruin his  reputation.

Hunter Pet Question here. Orc Hunter lvl 31  
---
I picked up my first pet at level 10, a cat from Echo Islands. I've grown very attached to him and have never tamed a single other pet. Can I continue to use this once low level cat who has grown up with me all the way to 60, or should I be taming other pets for skills or better stats? Thanks!
---
I dunno about your case, but I saw a lock take off a +14 shadow power chest for something like a 6/6 int/Stan chest. He equipped it, I‚Äôm pretty sure it wasn‚Äôt an upgrade .

Multiboxing was only bannable on private servers because you can make 100 accounts, on the other hand blizzard loves multiboxers because more money for them
---
Who called me!? No I don't like people doing that waiting for my patrol!
---
True true, it‚Äôs a good idea
---
If they did this, they are retarded. If the recipe truly is rare and you have multiple, you can just list 1 at a time for whatever price you want and only list another when the other sells
---
Why not start something you've never played before?
---
&gt; Since mages have very little tools other than damage. 
---
Wait, what? Frost mage has 31 different flavors of CC, interrupt and utility.
---
Damn 60hours a week??? It will take me months to get to 60, I'm only level 27 atm. Only get online once a week for a few hours.
---
Because there are obviously more efficient routes through your standard rotation.
---
Also, and this is the big one, you have to play this game at or ahead of the curve, anticipatory and reactionary, and you can do neither of those things if you're playing solely at the pace of one set of spells in list order waiting for a combination of gcds to get to the relevant spells, if they're even there.

Not much in terms off cc. Fear and mind control till fear off cd

Yea, same. It‚Äôs gotten to the point google knows I‚Äôm asking a wow classic quest question as I‚Äôm typing it in lol. Reading the quests only do so much plus I‚Äôm crunched for play time nowadays.
---
&gt;I have spent the vast majority of my WoW life playing hunters, I have levelled more hunters to 60+ than I can count on one hand, in retail and on private servers. I know what I'm talking about.
---
This is my first time playing hunter, so obviously I have to yield to you here as someone who should know more about the class but...
---
&gt;The amount of mana regen you get from spirit as a hunter is insignificant and it only gives you mana if you haven't used an ability for the last 5 seconds which is virtually never going to be the case unless you're using your abilities poorly. It's true it's better than nothing but it's so insignificant that "borderline useless" is the correct judgment.
---
Ok, you are going to have to excuse my ignoring your prior experience with hunters on this one, because... 
---
You are telling me that when I am grinding, run out of mana, and am sitting there auto-shotting mobs spirit doesn't help with efficiency? You think I should be sitting down drinking as my pet does the rest of the damage? WHY when my auto-shot accounts for over half of my dps, so why should I sit down and drink when I can auto-shot and regen mana while doing so? You lost me on this one. Hunter experience or not, spirit IS useful to a hunter.
---
Each their own experience, right!
---
Yare yare daze...
---
As a mage, I always make sure to invite the ppl running around for quests, especially those who may struggle to solo (read: Paladins). Cant see why you questing offends them :|
---
This is exactly what i was looking for. thank you!
---
Time is the real endgame boss
---
Doesn't matter cause you still reach the layer cooldown very fast and it becomes very long.
---
This only effectively let you do an extra clear or two an hour on average.

Nothing gamebreaking. Sure, exploitive, yes.

The raids... gamebreaking.

I just want blizzard to allow me to sort by bid and buyout.

I'm a mage myself but I don't like the aoe build because servers are just too populated for it.

When I'm grinding specific mobs near aoe mages, I'll tag my mob, pull them into their pack and let them do the work for me.

Fucking kills me. Maybe I'm sadistic. Muahaha.

---
What server server are you on? I am on high pop Skeeram, and while I'm enjoying the game I think the community sucks compared to vanilla  (never played retail though). 
---
It's just too competitive for spawns , and especially world quest boses. Doesn't matter how long you've waited , its dog eat dog on sniping the respawns.
---
Also in dungeons ppl will just leave as soon as they get to the boss they need. I was so confused in WC why everyone in my entire party left and then realized on atlas loot my class was the only one who would get a decent drop on the last boss.   I dont recall this ever happened once in vanilla, unless it was discussed when building the group.
---
Reading the forums it seems the auto LFG implemented in retail has made this normal behavior.
---
Crusader was a bitch to farm 15 years ago when the vast majority of the player base had no idea where it dropped. Now everyone knows and thinks they're gonna farm it... sure.
---
I feel bad that I‚Äôm trying to learn how to AOE farm. I don‚Äôt go out of my way to take mobs and I try to do it in very low populated areas, but this has made me rethink what I should be doing.
---
Yeah, i looked for anything with that and couldn't find it. u/maxwyfe linked it below if you are interested in it. 
---
Thank you again for your help!
---
Thank you so much for this!!! This is amazing info!
---
I know you CAN autocast it but I thought you lost a lot of DPS like that?
---
I've dabbled with other classes before but didn't seem to mesh well with them for one reason or another. I suppose I could try it again though.
---
imagine sitting in a 5k person queue and you're in jail when you log ing
---
As long as they are snared with Imp Blizzard/CoC you don't have to stress too much.  Basically you just gather things up in a clump and then pick up mobs that get free.
---
If a clothy is being an idiot and not staying at range(if using blizzard) or at least properly kiting then they suck
---
Oh and as a mage I don't know what to say about the lock except maybe ask if he can start with RoF before hellfireing
---
There's plenty of non-boe upgrades. The policy I've always seen is that the winner would offer anyone in the group to buy, possibly at a reduced price, if they want it for an upgrade.
---
30-90-permaban depending on the severity. And of course roll back on every single gold they made. Default them down to 1g.
---
I'm assuming majority of exploiters are now trying to hide the profit on other accounts.

Fuck retail
---
It'll be a cheat the day Blizzard says it's a cheat. Which isn't any time soon.

With that being said, if I'd see a bad boxer in the wild, I'd corpse-camp them too for free honor (at phase 3).

Did I hurt your little Pally feelings?  I am sooooo sorry.
---
So I downloaded update assistant and it ended up doing another fresh install of windows, which was fine. I then updated it with the 1903 update, but the problem is still persisting.
---
so you suggest people start learning aggro management past lv.50? Where else should they learn it than in low level dungeons? Tanks and DPS alike. IMO
---
Is nature's grasp really worth it? It seems fairly situational to me. Also wondering why you wouldn't just build into a classic HOTW spec on the way up, since it seems like the melee crit bonus from full feral wouldn't mean as much leveling as it would at 60 in full raids? Appreciate all the tips!
---
Can you not read? Them tagging mobs isn't what I'm talking about
---
None of them are official though
---
My Forsaken priest on retail wears her outfit. I‚Äôve definitely gotten a lot of comments from people who are slightly unsettled by an undead in such a revealing costume. But I love the look, and the chapeau is great!

5-6 days isn't the norm. A normal /played to 60 is like 9-10 days, and that takes a solid month at 8 hours a day

I will dig this up, thanks for the info

what's on teh bottom of the monitor?

I'm a nice guy and yet get body camped by Horde 10+ (skull) levels above me. I guess they're afraid of the competition leveling up.

I level full ench but with a healing gear set. Gets the job done more than fine for the dungos and also still get to be a boss in wpvp whacking kids with big windfury
---
Depends on the amount of people exploiting. If it's very few, then what you say is correct.
---
If it's many, then may try to undercut each other.
---
Also, your thinking is right in one way but there is another avenue to consider. These people are obtaining these items much quicker than legitimate players. This means there is less cost in it for them (since in this case the cost is time). These people can sell the product for MUCH LESS than legitimate sellers and STILL make way more money due to volume being pushed. Also, the lower price means more people are more likely to buy because they can afford it more easily, meaning even more volume of sales created.

Pvp, Hunters use their class abilities to win fights. Not my fault if one can't escape my pet while I circle them with my bow. That's called out playing.
---
As a Paladin on Grobmob, I look forward to cleansing this filth.
---
This is why when I am playing I solo pull, the ONLY reason I start doing AOE farming is if I am getting a bit irritated at the drop rates of things.    After I get 1 or 2 drops, I resume single pulling until I get pissed off again.

Emotes only work with "preset" emotes like /wave and such

LCD monitors were already a thing in 2004...
---
loot roll can be started by anyone in the party or raid, same on retail. if it drops on your kill then it will be sparkly FOR EVERYONE to start the roll. so the mail thing isn't true, unless either no one clicked it, or you run the dungeon/raid solo. I mean after farming for the firehawk mount, id have countless epics/rares/magic items posted if i didn't bother looting anything, but in a full raid? nah
---
This has been happening to me too, lol!
---
There's a stablemaster that allows you to keep your pets. You could stable your first and go find others that have skills you need. For example, if your current pet doesn't have growl you would find an animal that does. Then you should be able to teach your original pet growl -- I don't remember if this exactly the case, I haven't played a hunter since Wrath
---
Pay attention to the chat log. Unfortunately these guys were purposefully leaving the other party members in the dark. So just keep an eye out. If you're on Herod add these 2 guys to your blacklist.
---
A guy named Tyrone wants to know your location.
---
For leveling just auto cast...end game pve and pvp you can look up macros for them
---
You're sick and you need help.
---
I have only had mages who decline group invites. Usually if you do an emotional plea and say you'll only stick around for as long as you need the mobs, they cave and let you tag along for quest objectives.
---
Best MMO was UO but WoW is fun too.

It has. Got my free 6600 exp over the weekend and I've been sippin on the free water outside Orgrimmar.

And wands... I suppose that counts as a weapon, right?
---
I'd bet these kids are from Retail. ez money
---
Funniest part is how it went to a Paladin.
---
I see your point but at the same time I think it‚Äôs also about finding your meaningful engagement in your party type. Like, next time if it happens again, it make your goal to never have a single frost mage have to move out of a blizzard channel. Make a game out of it that way and see how you make the party more effective while also finding meaning in your own class. Plus you obviously do WAY more damage to bosses then they do so, you‚Äôre really helpful there as well. I think it‚Äôs just about how you think about it.
---
Edit: grammar
---
Fuck their greens.
---
Pick what you enjoy and don‚Äôt worry too much about raid spots. Hunter is actually easier than priest in that regard anyways. Priests suffer from debuff limits.
---
Tanking as a pally right now is a nightmare. No I'm not taking the shadow priest for dps I dont care how long it takes. Not a single one has proven they wont mindblast a target that's not skull and die in seconds.
---
I'm on Grob Horde side as well, I've seen "The Deathstalkers" pop up recently and this explains a lot regarding the poor quality of their members (had some bad experiences with them thus far).
---
Thanks for posting this though, I've add Huin and The Deathstalkers to my guild and our allied guild's blacklist; I doubt they'll be around very long regardless, given poor leadership like this it's probably a pretty unstable organization.

Yeah lifetap is brilliant!  I think we were a bit messy with the sons and some mages including myself were manaburnt

As someone who's healed for so long I just compliment the healer whenever I can. Especially if the tank makes a dumb pull or a DPS does something wrong and the healer has to pick up all the pieces.

This must reck Intel igpus, they struggle with bloom, and particle effects.
---
I think windfury proc is worse!
---
I‚Äôd also like to know. I wish it was affliction as that is my favorite spec but with the debuff limit per mob I doubt that is the case.
---
Reminds me of the time Mothboy - Drak'Thul solo PVPed an entire Alliance Kara raid.
---
They were just AFKing and he walked up and slapped them each with Seed of Corruption.
---
Remember, SoC **explodes** when it runs out, and there were ten of them going off one right after the other.
---
Why did you waste so much time coming up with this convulted scenario. This is not blizzards current standard model for reset timers, including what they launched in classic.
---
Just an example. I can easily keep track of dots on up to five or six mobs.
---
hahaha we discuss this all the time
---
if this is true then i should have no problem but i do.. i can show up any raid time and 100% attendance and stay true to the guild but i can't even get my foot in the door, it's what's keeping me from leaving. i've invested DAYS of playtime into this guild
---
Have to admit, he's a bigger person than I. I don't help alliance on principle.  
---
I'm on a PvE server because I already did the quest-with-head-on-a-swi..-crap-I'm-sap'd/dead thing the first time around. 
---
They still find a way to be annoying. Wish I had an insta-tag spell(lock).
---
Haha never any hordies around wonder why :-P
---
There's no reason you can't heal leveling dungeons as a shadow priest. 
---
But if you're torn between wanting to be a caster, but enjoying the security provided by a pet, what about trying warlock?
---
Bro all I see in chat is an endless amount of people forming groups for DM and stockades lol. Trying to find groups for higher level stuff is actually harder since most people aren‚Äôt even at that level yeti does the people that are already have their own group going on since day one.

---
I don't think anyone has ever said that paladins aren't the best aoe tanks but the fact that they don't have a taunt and their horrible single target tps is awful is why they are considered bad tanks
---
I always put my back against the wall
---
RemindMe! 18 hours
---
Pally's seem to be the absolute best at AOE tanking in instances, at least in the 40-60 range. They have much better AOE threat than warriors.
---
What I dont understand is why do you care so much? It's one person who is ruining their experience with the game by having everyone else play the game for them.
---
Turn off the stream and move on with your own experiences with Classic, make friends,  do that one thing you never got to do when you first entered the world.
---
How one person chooses to play the game may not be the way that you play it, and that's ok.
---
Disc is actually the recommended classic leveling spec currently
---
Guess I‚Äôll just die.
---
Lol I see what you‚Äôre saying but thats not fun for me, thats not why I chose rogue as my class and spending an hour or more doing that feels like a waste of time for me when I‚Äôm still iffy on rotations and want to practice that.
---
It doesn't if you have the all ranks toggled.
---
I would never talk to possible guildies the way that toolbag does, but really though, people have been doing this since vanilla. Like, just decline and move on.
---
search twitch for msbt, its a addon for customising battle text. you can change size/font/color of all the types of damage. 
---
my fave mod is nameplate scrolling battle text, my damage numbers look like they drip from the mobs nameplate.
---
&gt; maybe I'm just a dick
---
Yes, you are.
---
I have plenty of experience with b and c, newer to vanilla hunter so haven't checked for d.
---
b if I sick my pet on the target, many times it'll run at it, especially if the mob is already running towards me and somewhere else, it takes a few seconds for it to finally hit the mob with anything, whether it's growl, auto attack or bite, which gets very annoying when you're trying to quick farm and the pet won't do anything until the mob is in your dead zone
---
c. on both defensive and passive, I do see it often that my pet will just sit over the corpse for a few seconds doing jack all before coming back to me, though if I tell it to attack someone else it will
---
Our guild runs a constant blacklist, as do most others. FB gets away with stuff anyway because they have so many people that some fraction of non-FB players who don't pay any attention to "guild drama" don't realize how scummy they are, but they're otherwise anathema on the Horde side and constant Alliance targets. And I get a distinct pleasure relentlessly curbstomping any Enclave player I see. They're the only guild I'll actively corpse camp.
---
Reputation matters a lot on RP servers, and Huin is on a crash course to pariah status with his behavior.
---
I like it, have a debuff that keeps them in, and it only ticks down while you're logged in, forcing you to actually serve the time.
---
I think it's hilarious how many people aren't configuring their add-ons and it is posting items at vendor price. Meaning they actually make less money than if they had sold it to a vendor due to the listing cost.
---
Don't ban the account, but delete their character. Then maybe hardware ban them from playing on that server in the future.

really only takes a couple seconds next to a mage to kill em, and it happens
---
I never complained. I simply explained how I deal with it.
---
I've been tanking / have seen many other paladin tank and they're the smoothest runs I usually have tbh. People who think paladins can't rank are the same people who attack enemies before the tank even has a chance to hit them.

No you have to go to a vendor for that one

Fair enough. If you aren‚Äôt getting the practice you want on rotations then leveling up faster and getting more skills isn‚Äôt helpful.

Questie has issues, like it's smart to have different icon for gather and kill quest. Imho it's better if it were to use uniqe icon per quest though. It gets messy quick. If you wanna complete quest to kill a Leader Type Monster but he's got the same icon as 50 other kill quest icons it's beyond sane to try to find it.
---
They drop off humanoids as low as lvl 34-35!
---
All great points here.  The nice thing about classic it the talent trees allow flexibility!  The classic community is full of great people.
---
Samwise is the guy smiling, I believe he was the lead artist for Vanilla. Designed many of the characters we know and love.
---
it does have diminishing returns tho, and heals the warrior to 100% , and this is assuming 1v1 combat with no one around
---
Drops in WoW are independent events. Meaning if a sword you want has a 50% drop rate off of a mob, killing it once won't increase the drop rate to 100%. Again, past events don't have influence over future outcomes.  
---
If there were logic in the game to account for drop-rate failures and the rates could change 'on-the-fly', then yes, you'd be correct. But that's not how it is. Rates are static and the drop-rates are independent events that have no influence over each other. Some quick googling will show you why you're wrong.

It's basically a PvP (battlegrounds) only character. As long as you've completed everything you need to, you just camp the Warsong Gulch gate and queue up. Some people enjoy stomping on people leveling (since they won't even be competitive against twinks), some enjoy building a "perfect" charger, and many others enjoy the way certain classes play at certain levels and the community that forms.
---
They added NPCs at some point that allow you to freeze your xp gain (the Alliance one was humorously named Besten Slahtz).
---
I am leveling disc and I am not having any of these issues. Did you take 5 points in spirit tap? That really helps.
---
How did the orcs know what a Menu was?
---
I doubt it. The exploit used in Vanilla was something completely unintended by the system and it was used maliciously.
---
The layering "exploit" is a different case because it **technically** was working as intended. But people found a further use for it. Almost like wave dashing in smash. Its not exactly a bug, but something the devs never intended to be a result of their engine.
---
I wish, everytime i see mages doing this, they ignore everything around them.
---
I don't mean to be snide about it, but neither of you should have those guild names. In-game factions and famous lore characters are not allowed to be referenced, let alone directly mimicked, in guild or player names.
---
I think that the letter is a reward for his quest.
---
As long as you're not needing on melee weapons with on-hit effects, or pure strength, upgrades are upgrades.  Do what you gotta do.
---
SCORCHED EARTH, MOTHERFUCKER
---
I want 20/10 man stuff similar to ZG. Especially Karazhan.
---
Just revamp all the incomplete stuff they had to leave out of the original release.
---
I hit level 18 last night
---
Lmao this is diabolical
---
It's just `/reload` no need to type `ui` after =)
---
Rule number 3 will probably be invoked soon, I'd bet this kind of post will be insta removed soon. I really think we need a regulated/moderated blacklist addon or something.
---
Rogue is definitely the most disposable and replaceable class.  I learned that lesson the hard way back in retail vanilla.  Now I play healer classes exclusively
---
ITT: A bunch of people that have no sense of punishments that fit the crime. Glad none of you are judges doling out criminal sentencing.
---
So you can't deal with a bit of trash talk? Let them bitch and moan at you. Nobody owns any mob in WoW, that's what the tagging system is for. If you manage to tag a mob it's yours, let them drown in their salty tears.
---
Did you consider that Horde players killing you are also questing in the same spot and you took all the mobs. As a Horde rogue camping aoe grinding mages is one of my favorite pass times, I see it as me liberating a questing zone for both Horde and Alliance to use free from the evil forces of aoe mages.
---
Look at me! I hate something that most people enjoyed or didn't have many issues with!
---
Ya I feel like back in vanilla the "huntard" meme seemed to be the big one I remember. You group with a hunter, expect them to maybe be a 10 year old kid who is bad at the class.
---
This go around it seems like Mages are the class I avoid because half the people playing them are just min/maxing for speed and high damage. Which is fine, play how you wanna play. But I dont' wanna play with someone like that until I'm raiding or doing hardcore pvp at 60. Out in the world questing or grinding mobs or doing a dungeon with one of those people is just anxiety inducing.
---
I would add to what others are saying to give people the benefit of the doubt by a large amount. The hunter's shots could have been on cooldown and he couldn't burst down a full speed runner. (But you're right, concussive shot was probably available...) You can assume they're younger or less experienced or don't care or are just bad or anything like that, and then play so cautiously as others have said such that it would be very hard for them to mess up the run, and you aren't really relying on them for any skilled play, especially after the first wipe.  You can choose how much patience you allocate, but I think it's fun to be maximally patient and do your absolute best such that you clear the dungeon even if the rest of your group is a bunch of nitwits. 
---
Someone could have spotted the priest's low level in advance, and organized the group such that he didn't pull anything (maybe). There are usually more things you can do (eg. hamstring,) and it's best to just do everything you can, since you don't know all the details of the others' situations.
---
You can also do as you're thinking and group up only with people who play well, and that can be more fun, but you have to have friends online for that. I'd agree that it's acceptable to leave after four wipes, but preferable to do whatever possible to come up with a successful run. (ie. two-way discussion, improved strategy, extreme patience...)  Though this is all optional.
---
This is literally how resets worked at launch.  Cascading was a thing.
---
This one has always been a weird problem. It feels like multi boxers obey the letter of the law but not the spirit, and Blizz made the call ages ago and it's way too late to take it back now.
---
I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôd have to press it twice. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to automatically retry the players previous action. I suspect this is intentional from Blizzard to help prevent automation.
---
Yeah, how dare people play the game they want to play it. Instead, let's be an absolute cancer to the community, focus on camping/ganking them for no reason other than that we're salty that we can't aoe farm, and then ruin both their fun and our own simultaneously! /s
---
Like seriously, how incredibly petty of all the people in this thread. AoE mages are not some hivemind dead-set on making it impossible for you to get mobs. We're just trying to level, and as it turns out that's the best way to level on a mage. Really just seems to me like the lot of you are salty that you can't farm as quickly and so you're intentionally going out of your way to ruin the experience of AoE mages out of spite.
---
Huh. Really? I've always thought Shadow was the way to go.
---
You can't mount on most structures no matter what they look like.
---
Growl specifically comes from the pet trainer, but most other skills you get by stabling your main pet and taming other beasts to learn their skills
---
I was trying to show at least a shred of pity. It's the best I could do.
---
Rp‚Äôers are like nazis. If you don‚Äôt conform to their approved method of rp then you will be shunned, reported, and possibly cussed out. They‚Äôre the most intolerant group of ppl on any game despite them claiming the moral high ground and acting like their shit doesn‚Äôt stink. I have been flamed in game before ( this was back in Vanilla TBC era) bc I was running instead of walking around Orgrimmar on an rp server. They will attack you for just playing the game, while your minding your own business btw, bc their lives are vapid existences. They‚Äôre the ppl who will cry and bitch bc your not speaking like a Victorian era aristocrat.
---
Rp‚Äôing, not even once.
---
That's kinda what we all do here, no?
---
Stop multiposting. Holy shit
---
I liked it except all of our reading timing was different so for some we were waiting and waiting for the next line to be typed while others had to refer to the chat box to finish.
---
I upvoted that just because it upsets fanboys like you. Don't personally care about streamers at all or what they do
---
Probably horde.
---
Fear of Warlock's in PvP is one of the main reasons I rolled an Undead Mage. Even then I don't pick fights with Locks lol. They're just too hard to kill and have so many ways of ruining your day.
---
There's a spot in hinterlands?
---
Well clearly that was a lie
---
Sadly Brill is beyond my reach, but in the contested wastes I will show no mercy.
---
the entire subreddit is like this at least
---
It was on my laptop actually. I am posting this from my phone.
---
That's what I'm doing. I've been having a great time just taking it at whatever pace comes natural to me, and I've made sure to slow down and try to hit dungeons and do questlines that I never did when I played in 2004. I've had so much fun just kicking back in Redridge or Duskwood and digging through the quests whether it was the most optimal leveling route or not.
---
I would gladly waste gold on a pet, I always wanted the rare ones and they were hundreds of gold back in vanilla. I never got a cool one, I'M GETTIN ONE THIS TIME AROUND.
---
Can anyone recommend an add on for me? I want to know what the vendor price of an item is (so I can e.g. know what to throw when bags are full). I‚Äôd also like to be able to get a sense of AH value/what you get for DEing it, so I know what is best to do. Thanks.

Mouseover macros are life-changing.
---
Still more than 6 days for world first 60.
---
MC is pretty much doable as a PUG.  With 15 people you could have the core of the raid and fill it in with randoms.  Also, you could be the fill-in for the raid.  It's kinda up to you man.
---
As far as not leaving your friends you should ask yourself some things about the guild. 
---
1. Why is the guild dying? 
---
2. Do the people at the top spend time helping others?  
---
3. Is there anyone recruiting? 
---
4. Who's running the raids?
---
5. Are the players in your core group who are playing key roles?
---
We're like 2 weeks and change in.  It's a little bit early to throw in the towel and despair about your class choice I think.  Unless you're packing a full group of raid ready people then you're going to need to make some new friends either way.  It doesn't mean you're leaving your current ones behind by any stretch.
---
Pretty straightforward tbh, because you just burned everything.
---
Int shout (even if broken it holds for a moment), piercing howl, wait for nova, walk over, win.
---
I miss my cat sleeping on the old CRT. She can't fit on my new monitors and hates the desk.
---
Why not both? üòÇüòÇ
---
I did some testing. It looks like the mobs have to grant experience to me in order for my pet to gain any experience. Mobs that were grey to me gave zero experience to my pet.
---
Not really, demand doesnt change just because supply does, so those farmers will have a hold bunch of mats that take forever to offload.  They've have a small competitive advantage due to having more supply until their stock runs out, after which it will be like it never happened.  The impact will be small and relegated to a narrow section of the market, hardly "destroying" the economy.
---
Maybe got carried through SM armory
---
If I was doing this I would of just done the last 2 lines. Why do I see so many macros with that first line. What does that do?
---
If only 1 person in a group need q-items you can still use group loot. Once the corpses are looted the person with the quest can also loot if the mob dropped the q-item. That way you don't need to worry about someone ninjaing blues and greens
---
Ungoro was the best zone for me by far. Was super u populated for some reason and a ton of kill quests.
---
Added to KoS list.
---
You will outlevel the gear you gain early on pretty quickly, so it's not nearly as impactful as late game gear which you could be using for months.
---
FTFY: They act like a dick; respond equally.
---
I saw them on the minimap
---
I've seen people smoothly walking backwards, was that just some client sided animation bug on my end? Legit looked like they were holding W but their character was facing backwards at an angle, like reverse corner strafing at full speed.
---
If you like casting and pet solo leveling highly recommend Warlock. Provides support to the team, deals great dps  and can solo.
---
Yeah same, we must have been privileged
---
His guild name is called "Raiders of the Booty", you should try to get in contact with his GM to let him know that someone is making the guild look bad AF.
---
Ok, that's what I thought but the previous poster mentioned the ToS which I thought was strange. 
---
Yea, taking loot like that is a good way to get blacklisted in the community but I wouldnt expect blizzard interference on either side.
---
Was it cosmo or jak?
---
I remember the day, during the days before TBC, when they banned everyone who used Glider.  It was a glorious day I might add.
---
Super viable, and incredibly engaging. You're like a rogue, but PvE is actually fun!
---
As long as you're OK with tanking from time-to-time as you level, and it sounds like you are - do it!
---
I'm a feral tank, and I'm thinking of rolling a DPS warrior alt, too.
---
No no no, send them to retail!!! That's the worst punishment they can receive.
---
UBRS - Shammy Shoulders.  50+ times.  This was before BWL was released and MC was still new and exciting.  Finding someone with a key was difficult.
---
It just never dropped.  I never reserved it, but people would remember me from other runs. It did drop once, and some other shammy got it.  It was fine.  It's the game.  But yeah...
---
I eventually got it.
---
On my paladin when I eventually rerolled. 
---
&gt;_&lt;
---
And all of this because I could not be arsed to edit my first comment... damn
---
Then maybe wait to level to farm then or buy on the AH
---
That is possibly the smallest mouse pad ever created :o
---
Same with my s u c c
---
So to expand:
---
0.1% = 0.001 to succeed. 99.9% = 0.999 to fail
---
0.999 ^ 2301 = 0.10004339195341913551958363536758
---
rounded to 0.1 that gives us a 10% chance to fail, which we can then use to infer a 90% chance to succeed, given 2301 attempts.
---
different people can have different oppinions
---
Chuck Norris would exploit and get you in exploit jail.
---
YES. My favorite macro on my gnome.

I was aware about when making this screenshot but it it didn't matter to me that it is :D because i was about to play different character

---
&gt;WoW doesn't end at the confines of your own party and guild. I am aware of the world that exists around us, and I'm not chuffed about it.
---
and
---
&gt;Fine, but that's where the end of this game begins. A few months of that and there was no point to playing Classic.
---
yeah, it's fair i guess. won't be longevity there. i've already had a friend kicked from a guild because he was levelling an alt and not spending ALL HIS TIME on his main, despite the fact that he was playing on his main more than than most people do *dispite* having an alt to do questing with friends and such.
---
ehh, we'll see how it pans out.
---
i wondered if it was primarily the matchmaking queues to blame for destruction of community (in games, in general), as this has ruined pretty much all other games' communities (as opposed to old communites that built around servers, you got to know people etc...)
---
but now im not so sure. there are secondary effects and maybe pandora's box cannot be closed.
---
&gt;"you think you do, but you don't"
---
"this is why we can't have nice things".
---
Oh it's not my addon? Who told you that?
---
Reddit is dying it‚Äôs the apocalypse
---
Fair enough, was basing that off wowclassicbis.com and some less informed hearsay, I suppose.
---
&gt;/cancelform
---
Didnt know you can use just form. I used "/cancelaura \[stance:X\] Form Name" with every form and macro :) Your way is way cleaner. Thank you!
---
Am on Sulfuras too. It's a shitshow at the moment
---
As a hunter who is about 1/2 prebis geared that has been soloing princess for guildies to get rings...its not worth the time if you are doing it just for vendoring the blues. 
---
Takes about 5min to get inside and get to princess. It then takes 7-10mins to solo her because she 4 or 5 hits pets even with max armor and nature resist.
---
The only way to kill her is kiting with cheetah and arcane shot. If you bouldered once, its a FD to reset and start over.
---
Take 2 gathering professions and dont spend the gold
---
I've just been ignoring people with this addon. It's annoying enough in retail but kinda understandable. Here it's just bullshit.
---
The thing I realized I hate about the zone is that there are no humans to cannibalize or collect cloth off of. Makes it hard as a melee unless you come there stocked up.
---
It's not kidnapping if you can convienetly log out to escape.
---
Check your realms discord for a guild recruitment channel, see if any are looking to fill slots for immediate raiding schedules or ask them when they plan on starting.  Ask in-game in a major hub, you shouldn‚Äôt have any issues finding a few guilds with a compatible raid schedule.  If you‚Äôre there, and ready to raid, it shouldn‚Äôt be hard to find a group that need dedicated players.
---
Quest in the less popular zones. Example, instead of STV go to dustwallow marsh or desolace.
---
I agree 100%. My only point was that OP is no better than the people ganking him. For all he knows, someone ganking him could be applying the same logic he is. Or they could have an 'even holier' reason for ganking.
---
im only level 10 üò≥ i need to play more
---
that would be funny :DD the ui wasn't designed with raiding in mind. It only takes speedrunning into consideration for the most part.
---
Basically, if you want to Max out your dps you need more control. 
---
For example as a rogue you would want to pool energy before using a trinket to maximize the attacks under the effect of that trinket. There also times when abilities are almost off cooldown and you would want to wait that split second and cast your harder hitting ability instead of delaying it for a filler spell.
---
That said, in classic some classes just spam one ability so it's a moot point.
---
The mage frost novaing a caster lololol

2004 probably looked more like 1994 than 2014
---
Haha! I wish you luck in it! Make it rain gold, mate! :D
---
None of these things affected my enjoyment of the game whatsoever. I‚Äôm just a dude in my late 30‚Äôs leveling a priest currently at level 36 and having a ball with my friends. On my way to 60 I‚Äôm running dungeons and when I hit 60 I will raid. I‚Äôd venture a guess that &gt;90% of the player base is in a similar position as me. 
---
Really what I‚Äôm getting at is that just because people exploiting these bugs affects YOU (and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm sure it does.  Whether it be a tangible or psychological effect, it doesn‚Äôt really matter), that is not the same as it affecting EVERYONE.  I think these ‚Äúsky is falling‚Äù type of posts do more to affect the overall feel of the community than the small number of people doing the actual exploiting. 
---
....but then again, this is only my opinion.
---
Found the Ninja looter!
---
Agreed.  Modern assets in general would be amazing.
---
None of it has any impact on gameplay.  Hell, make it an option box if you don‚Äôt want to use it.
---
Interesting, why would 2 extra whirlwinds tick instantly after windfury and after the ravager proc has ended though?
---
no but guilds are gathering to make sure they're warriors get the ax. Most likely going out with a 5-man and farming the few things they need real quick and killing cyclonian. Leveling as a warrior has been very brutal, much worse than any other class I've leveled. This axe at level 30 helps greatly.
---
Less popular zones or dungeons. If your on a pvp realm then this is just part of the experience
---
That guy isn't frozen because of a mage. There are basilisks nearby. But I assume this is just a joke on the fact of warrior vs. mage
---
ty
---
This along with competing for mobs seems to be a large part of the reason so many people are dungeon grinding.
---
It really isn't.
---
Ya dude, I was hesitant to join a pvp server as in the past , pvp on mmo were never my thing but seeing actual players being treated as my enemy (cant understand them, kos, aggro, etc) is a blast. I don't take this game serious enough to get mad when I cabt complete a quest due to horde. I signed up for this shit. It's fun as hell.
---
Yet, just like the other "layer abuse" posts, I only see people speculating on how they can abuse this system and not any real evidence of actual abuse.
---
I'm very intentionally taking my time and appreciating things this go around. Been leveling my mining, fishing, cooking, and first aid; been doing all the hard/annoying class quests that I used to just abandon; been taking time to read quest text. It's been fun, but I don't often get to sit down and play for several hours at a time and just hit level 24 last night.
---
Dungeons
---
No, only if you‚Äôre some weirdo who thinks alt-tabbing to wowhead constantly preserves some experience for you. I mean, to each their own, but weird flex for sure.
---
Ah thank you!
---
to be faaaaaaaair
---
Jokes on you, I'm still slow at leveling!
---
God, I hate questie.
---
Underrated zone imo. Sunken naga ruins with coral reefs, lockboxes for rogues, tons of fishing on the coast including shellfish turn in for good money, giant elites patrolling including rexxar, burning blade fortress, demon invasion, goblins, centaur war with unique factions, satyrs up north with good drops, giant skeletons down south, kodo graveyard pvp area etc.
---
I 100% understand they will never perform up to warrior stands when BIS/bear. But if we‚Äôre talking about dungeons then I don‚Äôt expect BIS war/paladin. All I‚Äôm saying is why not give them the benefit of the doubt instead of jumping on the min/max train that‚Äôs being carried over from retail. You‚Äôd be quite surprised how efficient they are.
---
I just got my G600 on Friday and, after 10 years of Naga use, I'm sold on it. It fits my hand better than the Naga. The clicky right side panel is going to take some getting used to, but will be a great modifier button.
---
Thanks for the insight. What are you doing, if anything, for gold making?
---
Find a group to quest with! There is strength in numbers and you can make some friends along the way!
---
That's interesting! I literally grinded the entire level 53 trying to get the flawless sphere.
---
Pyroblast is a thing too.
---
I started at 32, hit 40 with 100g
---
Gay
---
Yeah tons of videos to watch. I will also do this as an alt because when I played back in the day I never tried doing some of the soloing challenges that you could do in dungeons and that was my 2nd thing I wanted to do. First being a 1-shotting windfury proccer.
---
It took like 30 seconds to comb through it. What your point? Your to lazy take 30 seconds or you are not smart enough to divide something by the stack amount? Or both? Is that what your getting at?
---
There was a group of 5 on stalagg than ran by me all on baron mounts yesterday. I was wondering what in the actual fuck. Now I know
---
why is your keyboard from '92 thou?
---
I don‚Äôt think it matters while leveling.
---
That's the great thing about long flight paths...
---
Prove it
---
Nice work. I setup my macros the first week of release and was hoping to find more refined versions.
---
Why does it matter if someone take a bunch of bounties and doesn't end up doing them? He's just not going to get paid, that's all. I feel like you're over thinking this, man.

I once ran with a guy in the beginning of bfa they needed help in heroic and my guild didnt need loot from it since it wasnt mythic.  The rule with me helping heal on bosses i dont need much I pretty much give 90% of my drops to said guild i dont need but if I need something give me the same shot as your guild as a chance since I am giving you my time and repair money. The gm was my friend he agreed . The thing is he collected terrible egirls who cant play the game this one was a ‚Äútwitch streamer‚Äù by twitch streamer she basicly showed cleavage And the gm gave her gear and carried her and demanded his guild  gear her.  
---
Basicly we got to heroic zul i didnt have their discord anymore because some of their users are sexist asshats.  And i cant stand them but I log on her twitch he had everyone follow to hear the call outs and  at this point the gm had to afk .  I end up hearing the girl say okay guys remember if stuff drops no pugs get anything.  The only peice of loot i needed was from him. I handed her and his guild members tons of gear.  I basicly told them fine if people who are pugs cant get gear from your runs then Im not helping you guys.
---
I informed my friend the gm what she said and why If he needed help go elsewhere. According to my friends he blew up in discord at all of them including the egirl about how they dont do that in this guild and that just lost one of the best healers they can get to help out and hand gear to them .
---
That's you! Holy shit dude, can I just say thank you from the bottom of my heart for making this work, I main druid, and the first few days of playing I was missing this functionality so much.

REMEMBER TARREN MILL AND THE HILLSBRAD FIELDS. NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY DID TO US
---
Well, at least the whole "classic community" lie can die now.
---
On Fairbanks we still get 2 hour queues on the weekends
---
I actually do. I'm sorry i can't help it :( on a serious note tho I play the game a little bit differently from most people so this ui goes even deeper than you see in the screenshot. this is just the surface.
---
After seeing this I looked it up and it appears you are correct:  For linen and wool, it is better to vendor.  For silk and runecloth, it's better to make bandages.
---
It's like crack, you log on just to go fishing, 33 hours later , you have no idea where the time went.
---
No I‚Äôm saying that in bgs mages won‚Äôt be top tier either. They are good but much of vanilla pvp is Rock Paper Scissors unless a massively geared warrior has a pocket healer.

MOUNTS FOR THE RIIIIICH

Its about the same.
---
The amount of actual xp you need is much higher, but the amount of downtime doing class quests, no mount, etc. is also lower. The actual half way point iirc is level 44?

Just hit level 40 last night. Not in the biggest rush but its coming along

Dude, nobody was abusing layering to farm copper vein, lmao, they were doing it for expensive mats like thorium, which require a higher level toon.  And again, regardless of the mat, the exploit is closed and the supply will eventually leave the economy.

With the other person getting crit he's using Blessing of Sacrifice, which transfers damage to you... but that doesn't seem like that should proc Reckoning.
---
Are there any high level popular zones that favor Alliance?
---
I played warrior for years in vanilla as MT during raid progression.
---
All I am saying is that in leveling dungeons aggro management does not matter as much as completing the dungeon as fast as possible.
---
I think 40-60 is faster. The 1‚Äì20 is quicker than 20-40, but after you open up skulls and farmable dungeons that are easier to access... it can move faster.
---
Either 42 or 44 is considered half way. Can't remember which one.
---
Combat, sword/mace main hand and dagger offhand.
---
The halfway point in terms of time spent is generally somewhere between 40-45, so youre about halfway
---
So am I just killing the princess or other bosses too? And how do I reset the instance after that?
---
Hopefully you used ethical loot rules for a prestigious item.
---
No loot council or dkp. Prestigious items should be open role to any main spec that plans on using it and meets raid attendance threshold of 85-90%.
---
Any other way is unethical and takes advantage of other peoples time investment so an egotistical maniac can feel good about themselves.

---
I believe level 47 is technically the halfway point experience wise. I would pretty much 100% guarantee 1-40 is faster than 40-60, at least for 99.9% of people.

I want to feel small, incremental gains as I level.  Dragon Warrior on NES was my first introduction to the RPG, and grinding out low level slimes to upgrade from a bamboo pole to a wooden sword (or w/e it was) gave me a sense of progression.  I want to struggle and earn it, not be given an OP loadout right off the bat. 
---
This is what Classic is giving me.  I played until lvl 30 back in the day but wasn't really into it enough that I have this 'nostalgia' factor in play. 
---
For me, I'm enjoying the game because I'm seeing my DPS slowly tick up as I upgrade my gear bit by bit.
---
I think sitting makes you get critted by enemies thus stacking faster, not sure though never played paladin
---
It's usually their first mail gear, since Scarlet Monastery is the dungeon you run while you reach level 40 and will run it approx. 4-6 levels more.
---
Yesterday I'm farting around in the Hinterlands when a level 60 pally dismounts, kills the mob im working on and then opens a trade window and gives me 3 stacks of mana pots and then starts bandaging me.

He replies "Just giving back :)" mounts up and rides away.

Honestly I'd never blame someone for trying something out. Who doesn't?

But if someone keeps doing it to gain an advantage that's when punishment should be harsh.
---
Why not make them hostile to all factions (including horde and alliance), so players and NPCs can attack them on sight. They wouldn't be able to repair, group, buy items, go into any city or populated area... best they could do is go out in the middle of some area and farm mobs, even then, their durability would eventually fail and they'd have to equip grey and white items from drops to at least have some armor.
---
But who do you really blame? The game isn‚Äôt as hard as vanilla so what do you expect players to do.
---
Thank you for the help!
---
Lol that would make sense! Thank you :)
---
Can't powershift cause you lose leader of the pack every other shift

What I meant by that is to hit the neutral AH in Booty Bay or Gadget to see if any alliance are trying to unload the ones they farmed up. Assuming the Alliance aren't idiots posting it for what the Horde can trade it in for, you can usually just pick up however many stacks are there and make 50s-1g a stack for bringing it from BB/Gadget to Desolace
---
Well usually barrens chat is just people sucking around. Nothing about layering or shafting has come up. At least that I‚Äôve noticed

IME you don't have to RP too often on RP realms. You just have to not break immersion or other players' RP. It's fun, because I don't do a lot of heavy RP or anything, but it's around you in the world, and you can jump in and out of things as you want (so long as you're not interrupting someone else's roleplay).
---
Not that big of an issue - only one quest
---
Classic is rough.
---
Well that's a great way to go oom before their health bar does.
---
As far as I can tell from my crit rate in recount, it seems that the crit rate you can find for a level 60 (INT/59.5 + 1.7%) is flat across all levels. After hours of questing I was running 3.5% crits.
---
I have 126 int = 2.12% + 1.7% = 3.82%. Close enough.
---
Getting a piece of gear with another 4 int is going to add a whopping .06% crit. Virutally meaningless.
---
But adding 4 damage? That is an immediately measureable change.
---
Not a big set back for me. I don‚Äôt use Charge by pressing 1. This is how I use Charge: 1111111111111111111111

I don‚Äôt know why this is engrained into me, but it is. I was that guy spamming Q constantly while running around in CS. I guess I‚Äôm ADHD.

I've never ninja looted anything in my life, nor would I ever, but when did they world become so sterile that ninja looting a virtual item in a video game gets people so mad they have to take time out of their day to complain to the developer.
---
Yeah, ninja looting is a shitty thing to do, but it's in the game. I thought the whole love for classic was built around the idea the world was supposed to be alive and immersive. Shitty people exist in all walks of life so it stands to reason they would exist in wow.
---
If Blizzard believe the practice is so wrong then remove it from the game. While it's in the game, it's fair game as far as I'm concerned. It's not like it's exploiting a bug, it's an actual game mechanic.
---
People really need to grow thicker skins. It's these kind of complaints that result in games being so diluted that the whole social aspect of a game gets reduced to nothing. See current retail for proof.
---
No, it opened trade. Didn't cancel his "opening" cast though.

Growl should always be on autocast while leveling. Everything else depends on the pet.
---
Claw IMO should *always* be manual. It is a focus dump, if you put it on auto your pet will be out of focus and not cast growl on CD like they are supposed to.
---
If you have a cat with bite/claw/growl (optimal DPS pet) I would leave bite/growl on auto. Bite is higher damage/focus than claw, and bite/growl can still focus cap. Hit claw on pull for early threat, and spam claw when you are close to focus cap to dump.

As someone who plays the game, I have no respect for anyone that judges others on how they choose to play the game.

---
Being a tank sometimes means being the babysitter of the group.
---
You should be making the first move at nearly all times, which means you need to have an understanding of the dungeon, the mobs you are fighting, and the basic abilities of the party you are in.
---
Now, it's not always the case, but tanking certainly lends itself to being the leader of your instance until you get in to raids.
---
You'll become intimately familiar with threat, which is much harder to manage in vanilla.
---
It's super rewarding and good tanks are a downright necessity for any serious raid group. You can have alt healers, and you can deal with shallow dps, you simply cannot be successful without proper tanking.
---
Wouldn't you just .. bubble .. then hearth?

I'm a Level 34 Druid and I just finished most of the quests in STV. Is Desolace the next big zone? 
---
I'm guildless and playing solo (outside of impromptu "hey we're killing the same shit" groups) so I'm sort of looking for places and quests that are soloable and relatively quiet because Alliance are severely outnumbered on my server and the Horde are aggro. 
---
Also I haven't done any dungeons yet, what are the mid-30s dungeons I should look for groups for?
---
They're about the same in specs. The X250 is more portable at 13 inches while the T450 is 14 inches. I would advise making sure the hard drive is an SSD.

Alright well I'm going to believe the guy with an explanation over the guy who can only say "clueless".

I think you were allowed to repair, you just couldn't use any gear of green quality or higher. I could be wrong.

This would be a bit different since you could use anything that dropped, but if would be a finite resource. Would actually make crafting profs quite useful while leveling.
---
You‚Äôre entitled to your own opinion, we will continue to be successful and grow. Our years as a guild since WoW‚Äôs initial launch and our ability to adapt to the game and continue to thrive over the years is proof that no matter what you feel, there are others who don‚Äôt feel the same as you.

No that is a terrible reason. The real reason is rings before level 32 or so are almost non-existent. If it has stam at all, everyone need it. 4 Spirit is meh for everyone.
---
I was level 44. Gave 40 as a rounded reference
---
40-60 can take almost as much time as 1-30. You have to keep in mind though that you can get from 1-10 in less than 3 hours. It also depends on your class and how you choose to level. Some classes are better at quest leveling due to their abilities or their mobility, i.e. leveling a druid or shaman that have 30-40% move speed increases is faster than leveling a warrior who has no mobility enhancements. You could also choose to exclusively level by doing instance runs constantly if you prefer a more mindless adventure.
---
This is pmuch what everyone is copying atm, I dunno if he's using some different variant tho.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_MHIkMhSfc

From the video description:
---
&gt;Today we will talk more about Reckoning. I got 3 different things to show you. 
---
&gt;I already commented the first macro on my last reckoning video, it is a simple /startattack /stopattack macro. If you spam it, you don't have to worry about starting your autohits right after a crit, or at the end of a swing. The macro will simply double or triple hit for you. This is really important for PvP if you get critted 3 times in a row, since the macro will then unleash damage similar to Windfury.
---
&gt;Second thing I showcase, is a macro that benefit from manipulated Reckoning. By adding /sit in the earlier macro, you will thanks to spellbatching be able to get critted by enemies a lot more, and those crits will also be able to proc Reckoning. This is especially useful against enemies that got fast attack speed, such as Rogues or Shamans. Less valuable against enemies with stronger hits (a Mortal Strike crit really HURST)
---
&gt;The last really important interaction is with Blessing of Sacrifice. If a tank gets critted with Blessing of Sacrifice activated, you will get a Reckoning charge. By coordinating with your tank, you can cheese out a lot of Reckonings this way even in PvP
---
&gt;Or you could put it on a tank that aint defense capped, that are tanking a lot of adds (paladin tanks for example) and thanks to him you will be a really strong DPS!
---
I'm horde for life so I've never had to make that choice, I'd probably still get sword since you will be getting sword spec.  I'm not really a rogue expert, for vanilla I've only leveled 1 on a pserver before.  Maybe the dagger is good since the offhand speed but eh.
---
If anyone has more than a certain amount of Raid boss kills (say 20 Geddon and Rag kills), then it is pretty obvious they abused this.
---
If there's 1 or 2 extra clears than weeks since release, it is more likely they were not intentionally exploiting it, as it is a bug.
---
Very easy for the to track I'd imagine, and so I'm confident everyone who abused this method of gear farming is about to get *CLAPPED*.
---
You see a hode player walking past, usually you would just go on minding your own business but you see that he has a 'Bounty 3 Gold' status message, you kill him and it's over. 
---
What it instead should be is; you go to a hunt master, view the lists of bounties, see a 5 gold bounty for a level 40, pay the %10 fee, receive information about player's name, class, etc and where and when he was last seen. Go there and start tracking. Players that did not sign up can't see if he has a bounty and even if they killed him they would not receive the prize.
---
Probably is to avoid people flooding tickets so they just have a rule to say no
---
Lmao the no-lifers on this subreddit have no context of what real time is like. 8 days played time to 60 is fast for the average player. 6 days is very fast for an experienced player prioritizing speed leveling. The game has been out for 21 days now. 6 days played time to 60 today for the no-lifers means you‚Äôve spent 29% of your time, including sleep, playing WoW. Not eating, not sleeping, not working‚Äîonly WoW. Or if you include 8 hours of sleep per night, 43% of your waking hours playing WoW. 
---
Now if we assume a slower leveling speed, 8 days played, that‚Äôs 38% of your time, sleep included, playing WoW. Or again with 8 hours of sleep per night. 57% of your waking hours playing WoW. 
---
The average Classic player (someone who almost definitely spends more time playing video games than the average person) is nowhere near that level of no-life status
---
You gotta put poisons on
---
It does ‚Äòt quite work like that. 30 isn‚Äôt the halfway point in terms of XP to 60. I forget what level is the halfway point though

Bear all the way. Feral is by far the best leveling option for druids (and one of the best leveling specs among all classes). Unless you specifically hate melee and is a boomkin at heart, I'd recommend sticking with feral.
---
I would recommend something like this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023250213425100001-55000131005
---
The biggest choice you make is, do you want imp hamstring or imp charge? If you want imp hamstring, you would only put 3 points in 2h weapon specialization. If you want imp charge, you can put 4 points in 2h weapon specialization. Imp hamstring will save you a lot in the open world, but if you're solo worried about tanking ability, I would consider imp charge over imp hamstring.
---
As for the play style, you want to charge in (with 2h on), sweeping strikes, switch to berserker stance, whirlwind. That's your opener. From there you have to make decisions based on how things are playing out. If you're low on health, you want to switch to defensive and probably throw on a 1h and shield. If you find that you're sitting on a high amount of hp after your whirlwind, you might consider staying in berserker stance and getting off a mortal strike and another whirlwind. The amount of threat and damage you throw down on a sweeping strikes whirlwind is absolutely nuts. It's usually enough to hold aggro the rest of the pull. For just maintenance threat building, after your opener, just tab target and sunder in defensive stance until you are ready for another whirlwind or sweeping strikes. Usually the pull is over before you can get another sweeping strikes off. You can use sunder and revenge while in defensive. If you are pulling a large amount of mobs (maybe like 5 or more), consider hitting demo shout and battle shout on the pull, then doing your SS+whirlwind combo.
---
There's a few macros I use to facilitate this that I can post if needed, but you can probably find them or create them on your own. I use a macro for equipping my 2h and another for my sword and board. I then have a macro for switching stances. When you press it normally, it will toggle between battle and defensive stance. If you hold shift, it puts you into berserker stance. I have a few others that are used, but those three are the bread and butter of playing this way.
---
You really get to fully utilize your kit as a warrior tanking as arms. As always, make sure you are being considerate of the healer when pulling. You'll get a feel for the play style as a whole the more you practice it.
---
there's clips of it happening in a raid you fking moron lmao

I never thought that this comic was that funny. Did she put  one of those bank dye exploder things in the hat or is it just blood? Or is the punchline just the contrast between the verbosity of Whitemane and the simplistic "lol" of the player?
---
I've literally never had anyone make comments against me when I tank dungeons and I've only tanked so far in Classic.  I've done WC, SFK, SM: GY, and SM: Lib about 4 times.  No one has once made any comments besides, "This is really good with a Druid tank."  Which I think was just because they were used to bad warrior tanks and didn't have anyone actually mark a single mob.  
---
I don't tryhard and mark every single mob with an icon, but I do keep skull bound to middle mouse.  I open with a mob skull'd and then right before it dies, I switch to another and tap middle mouse.
---
this might actually be the saddest comment i‚Äôve ever seen. imagine backpedalling this badly.
---
You are a monster. This is the speak of a monster.

Yeah. I kinda figured that much. Its just odd.

Because those are the ones that are the loudest, and most annoying.
---
Now that Ive got my mount, I‚Äôll remind you not to skip my secret farming spot in STV, the Crystalvein Mine. The basilisks are easy kills for a experienced farmer, drop some high-value greys, are are right in the cusp of dropping thick leather.

---
Good point, he did look quite poor.  
---
Terrible posture and his clothes were tattered, torn at the knees and elbows...
---
Obviously we don't know the actual release date, but general consensus seems to be 3-6 months is most likely.  Phase 2 doesn't have any raid, it does have Dire Maul though, so I could see it coming a little sooner than the bigger raid centric phases such as the ones for BWL, AQ40, and Naxx.
---
The odds of hitting 100 are the same as hitting 1 or 72, or any other number because it is random.
---
The likelihood of ANY set of 3 numbers between 1-100 will be 1 in 1 million. It doesn't matter if the series is 100, 100, 100 or 1,2,3 the odds of both are 1 in 1 million.
---
I can prove it by showing my work, I'll use the 1,2,3 set in my example:
---
* For the first roll there is exactly ONE result that we are looking for "1" and with One Hundred possibilities the odds of getting this result is 1/100
---
* For the second roll there is still exactly ONE result we are looking for "2" again with One Hundred possibilities the odds of getting this result are 1/100
---
* The Third roll still has ONE result we are looking for "3" of the, you guessed it, One Hundred possibilities again leaving us with a 1/100 chance
---
* To get the total probability we simply multiply the fractions straight across giving us 1/1,000,000 or 1 in 1 Million
---
This same process can be done for any set of 3 numbers because each roll is independent.
---
I think the part you were getting hung up on though is that the roll was the 100 specifically but because each roll has equal likelihood the specific value does not change the overall probability.
---
"retail" has been the term used by players on private servers for years and years.

There's lots of quest rewards that have hybrid stats...

(Just make sure you know how to downrank, how MP5 works, and manage your mana and you should be fine.)

After that I intend on rolling a secondary char to level which will feel like a breeze compared to trying to solo quest the early game content as a Rogue since they are very under-powered.
---
So I hear it's hard to care about your rep when there's 6k of the same faction on your server. Is this true?
---
set your tank as focus

How's the mafia doing?

Why do you have pushback?  You act like you don't have fear and pws.
---
Suspecting at this point you're just bad.
---
Thats not a bug. Ive played a hubter since 2006 and it worked like that until mid cata
---
Cross realm was BGs only until they made the change towards the end of WotLC
---
I've been having a lot of fun healing dungeons on my holy paladin (SM atm), was just wondering what gear stats I should prioritize the most as I'm leveling. +Healing spells or intellect?
---
Completely random suggestion, but right click on the wow .exe and click the box "disable full screen optimization". I had a super weird graphical glitch (that was almost always accompanied by a stutter- the stuttering would also sometimes happen on its own) and this fixed it for me.
---
Sorry I'm not very new to WoW. What is "mob tagging" referring to for alot of exp?
---
0-40 and 41-60 are about even
---
You‚Äôre joining the guild not joining that nights raid, if you actually want to be in the guild a few nights on loot ban does not deter you in any way.
---
Man that setup looks incredible. Out of curiosity, how does the internet connection work for truck drivers on the road? Do you have to hot-spot constantly--or do truck rest-stops usually have good enough wifi to play games, etc?
---
This is awesome.
---
Level 26 horde mage stuck with quests that are a little too tough. Any good aoe grind spots to get a level or a two?
---
Is that Bukkaki the one on Kromcrush? I've done a couple dungeons with him. Good dude.
---
Duo with her, my gf had only played Minecraft before this, and now she‚Äôs a pro priest who keeps me alive :) I‚Äôm a lock btw. I def Installed questie though.
---
Honestly the leathers and hides are high value enough where it‚Äôs not a tragedy to vendor it
---
Agreed, they are part of the guild and the raid, they should get the benefits of such.
---
On pvp server, STV discovers you.
---
Yeah problem is that dw builds have issues with glancing blows and the only thing that removes them is weapon skill. Plus there aren't many good end-game axes

---
But can you greed it? The guy above makes it seen like you can't roll at all if you can't use it. The way you explain it sounds fine to me.
---
Yes paladins have no option to put their taint on enemies.
---
you vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about...
---
Is it lame? Yeah. But who cares? Is it impacting you or your ability to play? 
---
Let people do their thing. He's using his celebrity status as a streamer to his advantage, and not in a toxic way.
---
The level of quests is not always relevant to the level of the mobs needed to kill for the quest.
---
Yeah, I mean using bombs as a part of your rotation was *super* common in high end raiding at the time.
---
Wondering this as well
---
Blink frost bolt, frost Nova frost bolt dead. K O
---
I think it's because I used to play on a PvE server that had absolutely zero horde on it. The neutral AH just wasn't a thing. I can't imagine people checking it regularly. I love actually having two factions this time over.
---
Haha so my problem with Skeram is that my party reaches the 5 person limit, and then another 2-3 person or fewer party comes to compete for the  first hit.
---
There is no scenario in which it is ok for you to claim loot before hand. As i said the rolling system is in the game for that reason. If you want all the loot for yourself invite people who dont use the same gear.
---
Screech ;)
---
I'm sorry sir, you've taken a wrong turn. This is the anger and outrage forum.
---
I wouldn't say they excel the most... They have their pros and cons, like the other 2 tanking specs/classes, but people are more used to having Warriors and even Druids tanking for them, so many of them don't adjust well to the different strategies (ie.: letting the tank build some aggro) they have to use with a Pally tank, who is certainly great, but only as long as he holds aggro, once he loses it, things get crazy, fast.
---
Also, they have to stop and drink all the time, which healers and casters might appreciate since they also have to drink, but which also makes the runs a little more boring, at times.
---
Personally, as a healer, as soon as I'm at 25% mana and drinking, or at 75% mana when not drinking, IDC if the tank is already pulling more groups, but when I'm sitting at full mana and waiting on the tank's mana, I can't help but feel like something is wrong.
---
WHAT
---
Some games I think that also allows switching between ranged and melee changes the stats depending on what is equipped
---
Maybe at raid level... Anything prior I don't think it matters. That's my point.
---
It's not perfect but it's helpful to me. Make sure to go into options and disable Focus, and then /reload ui

weird, I've been enjoying the game quite well.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for! I feel OK but definitely not living up to the hype the class seems to get. I am thinking the shatter combos might be that answer.
---
idk try harder? facts stand this is not a "bugged mining node" or blizz would have fixed it
---
yeah fuck me asking if theres some cool lore or something surrounding it

What do you mean?! Marriage fixes relationships IRL, didn't you know. Its only 2nd to having a child with someone.

/s and then /wrists for having to write the /s
---
Yeah I kill undead on sight. Too many untrustworthy undead rogues.
---
&gt; IMO youre the person I dont want to group with. No one is obligated to give you anything.
---
Good thing nothing in the game forces this. If you don't want to agree to the conditions, find another group, they'll find another member.
---
Got this around level 31 or level 32. I asked a buddy who was level 37 or so to help me grind the bloodscalp tusks, then he left to run sm cath so I shelled out the 8-10g to buy the elemental charms. Went to the quest giver and got lucky to find a group of 4 with 2 other warriors ALSO looking to get their whirlwind axe. 
---
I've been thinking about running a service where I help new level 30 warrs get their whirlwind axes, but I just haven't found the time after dinging level 40 and working on my profs... WoW classic problems
---
Yeah this sounds like something I want to be a part of
---
Racist
---
Im only level 42 and I have every freaking button bound already. Maybe I can have a few more that I push with my feet.
---
You would both be to blame.
---
I ran a WC as enhancement and was surprised I actually didn't need to heal, as they already had a healer. I think I ended up healing more (and had way higher DPS as well) than the "healer." We most likely would have wiped several times if I didn't stop to pick up the slack.
---
If you are going to run dungeons. I would suggest switching over to one of the two endgame builds at 50ish. I've seen a few Druids fall flat on their faces trying to heal Mara these past couple of nights.
---
Had cuunt and it lasted about 10 seconds after posting in world.
---
So insider trading should be okay?
---
Emphasis on "was"
---
Nope. If I buy a movie ticket, I get the full movie. If I buy a music album, I get all the tracks. Why the fuck when I buy a game, I get only 60% of the game and other stuff is behind MTXs? 
---
Say what you want, it is bullshit. I don't care about f2p games, since I've spent A LOT of money myself in LoL, Warframe, etc. In a fucking Call of Duty game they release literally the best weapon in the game and hide it in lootboxes. A game where I already spent 60 bucks to get it.
---
People tell "oh but modern games require a lot of work and money" NOPE. The amount of money is actually less then it was in like 2010. Everyone is reusing assets, everyone is hiring cheap outsourcing, the jobs pays less, and the technologies are researched. But look at the executive's bonuses at EA or Activision. Each one gets a budget for a whole fucking game.
---
He got a cool axe but his server reputation is ruined. Seems like a good trade to me.
---
Not sure why he decided to wand when in frost nova when he had so many options but its clear he was messing with higher level mage.Could have also use HS ^^
---
Crit
---
I think addons definitely contributed a lot to the 'downfall' of WoW.
---
While classic can't/won't be affected by modern addon use and their widespread acceptance, classic+ can be.
---
So many addons simply remove and/or replace gameplay to such an extant that the original is not there anymore.
---
Questing addons and AH addons come to mind, for one.
---
A 1h that will carry to 60
---
Those come with Dire Maul
---
You‚Äôre looking for ItemRack.  I believe they are still working on getting outfitter to work in classic.
---
I always do this, dont think my server roleplay too much tbh never see any funny talk in the general chat or anything very boring and straight to the point.
---
Same here. My growl is on auto-cast, which works fine. Claw is also on auto-cast as the primary attack method. I do have bite, but I rarely turn that on since the focus dump is too great for practical purposes. 
---
I found that what's more important than utilizing Growl, is timing your shots. In other words, don't pull aggro. Let the pet run-up and get in the first hit. It's not fool-proof, but the chances of holding aggro is much better than if you were to land the first shot and the pet is having to take the aggro from you.
---

  tanks are high supply, low demand 
---
This phrase does not mean, what you think it means!
---
I love that unveiling cinematic so much.
---
Just use  your brain and go to another spot / zone.   no matter your lvl there is always quests to be found where you are not ganked 24/7
---
You just have to avoid the obvious bottleneck spots like hillsbrad or North STV (Nesingwary camp)
---
My group cake walked through Gnomeregan at 29/30.  We even 4-manned the last boss because our mage's keyboard shit the bed the moment the tank pulled.
---
Also, no Razor Fen Downs quest that I know of should be green at 30.  Are you sure those aren't Razor Fen Kraul quests?
---
Youre missing the point. That system is in the game to give everyone a chance. BUT If I ask you to let me have it and YOU AGREE then you should not roll on said item.
---
Drain tanking with a succubus is apparently the most efficient.
---
A lot of people just upvote anything that doesn't outright offend them.  I watch my daughter slide through memes upvoting anything that doesn't outright offend her, never spending more than 2 to 4 seconds on any given picture.  upvote, swipe, upvote, swipe, upvote, swipe, upvote, swipe, and only 2 seconds have passed.  It's absolutely stupid.
---
NOT ME!  I think I've upvoted a grand total of maybe 30 posts on reddit, and I've been on reddit a good 3 years now, (nevermind what my cake day says).  You sir, are my 31st upvote!  Congratulations!
---
Agreed
---
Likely can't send since they wouldn't be an eligible looter.
---
Loot is a long term investment on the part of the guild. Giving loot to an unproven trial who has a good chance of not being around in a couple weeks(either because the trial flakes on their own, or doesn't pass trial) is usually not smart. Guilds are generally looking for players that are interested in putting the team before themselves.
---
&gt; Honestly, for you to think it's ok to claim loot ahead of time is way less ok than what this person did.
---
What? Discussing loot rules before a run begins is always okay. 
---
If you disagree with those rules, then you leave the group and find another. You don't agree to them, knowing that if the item drops you're going to say fuck it and roll anyway.
---
It's a ninja move, and assuming that there are chat logs where the mage agreed to reserve an item before the run began, it's actually reportable/punishable. Although I also don't understand why the party lead wouldn't change it to master looter before the boss just to be on the safe side.
---
Being married necessitates love. Hah. You should meet my parents.
---
It's been since literally TBC release since I played Paladin full time so take this with a grain of salt.
---
I always went for INT to get a bigger mana pool while leveling.
---
&gt;Even in the absolute best case scenario where they only do the exploit once that is still effectively 2x speed farming and completely unacceptable.
---
But that isn't the case as I've just told you.  I've layered just to be put into areas with the same or more people.  My "farming rate" is the same because I'm in the exact same state as my previous layer.  
---
People are much too spread out now for layer hopping to be a worthwhile exploit.  You can change layers once and that's it for at least 10-15 minutes.  If you're just standing around for that long you're wasting time doing nothing.  
---
It's not a big deal at all.
---
Not when your friends are on a PvP server.
---
Not to be too much more of an ass, but can I ask how old you are?
---
But that isn't the way he did it so it's objectively wrong. This sub in a nutshell
---
what
---
Oooooo, as a lowly shaman, I did not know this!
---
Has anything ever been added onto the west end of Tirisfal?
---
I rolled on Grob and never did an RP server before either. I never see anyone doing RP! Everyone is just questing. I do more RP than anyone I‚Äôve met. I like grouping with mages so I always say hi to them and try to get them to go on adventures with me. I have noticed that people are frequently willing to go do something adventurous even if it‚Äôs not necessarily the most efficient in terms of XP. Like I met a mage doing a quest and we decided to explore this crypt together even though neither of us had a quest for it. 
---
I read about RP events on the Grob subreddit but haven‚Äôt seen them.
---
I did a 24 hour non stop one day. Didn‚Äôt kill me
---
Now I know what I want for my enhance sham.
---
Things are only retail if they're currently available for sale. They were retail at the time, but are not retail currently.
---
I mean, I think it's more you dislike the type of person to call it retail. They tend to be pretty negative/critical towards it (ngl, myself included).
---
I dunno, this is really charming and has a very pleasing aesthetic on its own. It's just as good for different reasons.
---
I think you are trying to say the copper is not respawning in your layer, specifically because it is respawning in another layer. The very short video did not show that at all.
---
Hold on there killer. There is little to no chance they end up doing perma bans. Perma bans are usually a phenomenally egregious breaking of the ToS, this doesn't fall under that imo.  Should they get a ban for multiple weeks or months? Yes but to ban someone forever doesn't make sense. Besides the fact that they could just start a new account and power level to 60 again. There is less than three weeks of investiture in the most hardcore account by now, so starting fresh is not a huge problem in the grand scheme of things to those players.
---
You too buddy. Do something for yourself for once instead of asking everyone else to do it for you. If you have half a brain you can see the effects of this in real time.
---
A lot of raids (mine included) tanked Arthas very close to the edge in p1 so the pillars could be used to stop yourself from getting knocked off. 
---
Don't remember the radius of the bombs off the top of my head, and impossible to say without seeing the strat they used in those attempts, but it's definitely not out of the question that bombs were hitting the edge and Arthas at the same time in p1.
---
I always hang out outside on the path so I can kill alliance before they get killed again inside.
---
Ragnarok used to have this
---
Okay, its only a couple weeks if hes focused and plays 2-3 hours per night, and 4-6 on weekends. That should be 2-3 days played time which is more than enough to hit 40 on a warlock which is relatively easy to level.
---
fair enough, to me the plates are great for clarity and that's why I use it, I like the information to be easily accessible and with the plates it is more comfortable for my playstyle
---
I do understand not liking plates because they clutter or for other reasons, personally I love em

Leatrix plus is one of the most popular addons out there. It already has this.

---
The biggest issue you're going to face is your group not wanting you. I've tanked every dungeon (up to RFK) so far smoothly without wiping. But you need to be a good tank. Gear and talents are important, and bring consumables. My parties never wanted me to tank, until I did and they were amazed. It will get way harder 40+ you need to keep up on gear. It's a lot of fun and viable (not optimal). These are 5 mans dogg no need to min max.
---
I am new to warrior but I did this on my hunter as well, which I am not new to... I keybound auto attack to the \~ key. So if I try to rend, and see I don't have rage (I don't hear the rend sound, or maybe I notice beforehand and I don't even try to rend,) then I look down and if auto attack isn't on I hit tilde (\~). I also obtain in instinct for whether auto attack will be on based on what has already happened. After charge, it'll be on, but if the mob comes to me while I have zero rage, then I know to hit auto attack. An auto attack macro on rend would likely be better and free up the tilde key for something else, like ranged attack.
---
hehe ok m8
---
Screech reduces boss attack power
---
Owls have higher armor than most other pets as well
---
If you want you can train an Owl specifically for this task, higher than usual ranks of natural armor/stamina and they are extremely beefy tanks that also greatly reduce the damage of the enemies they're fighting.  
---
Screech also does pretty good AOE threat so you're less likely to pull aggro with stuff like mend pet or the occasional multi shot
---
This looks very very similar to Ark Inventory, will have to check it out and see how I like it.  Thanks for the suggestion!
---
ever notice the tram goes east/west when IF and SW are north/south of each other?
---
Appreciate the advice, thanks for taking a min to reply.
---
Why would they build anything into the game that wasn't in vanilla? Horrible idea.
---
This is something you had to alter your client to abuse. The layering thing is completely done within the game. This is a totally different thing.
---
I didn't get it til I read your comment.
---
It's hard to say exactly. Even if you found the mid-point in experience (which isn't 30), you'll be gaining more xp per kill and be able to use mounts, more abilities etc that vary leveling speed/time.
---
I agree with the other poster that normal questing would lead to 0-40 being about the same time as 40-60. Maybe 0-45 = 45-60. With dungeon spamming though, and SM/ZF being so fast, you can really skew the numbers depending on your class.
---
Back in Vanilla an old buddy of mine made a char named "Jewkiller" made it to 40 before they 3day banned him with a name change.
---
Lol. K.
---
Well, my point was in response to the OP saying mage's don't bring any tools to the table besides damage overall. In the specific  Lock vs. Mage fight, your CC is going to be less effective (again, minus counterspell which is honestly the tits since the upgraded version includes a universal 10-second silence). 
---
You can't really kite a Lock because DoTs. You can't poly their pet because it's a demon. It's just...not a fun fight for the mage lol. But it's silly to say the mage doesn't have utility. Ice Block into Blink are great for escaping. 
---
And Poly&gt;Pyro&gt;PoM&gt;Pyro can one-shot a Warlock if you're lucky and is probably your best chance for winning a 1v1. But only if you're specced into PoM/Fire and only once every 3 minutes. And if those two pyros don't delete the Lock they're going to Health Stone/Fear/Drain/DoT, basically mega heal and ruin your life. 
---
Shit, and if they have Soul Stone up they'll just rez and revenge murder you. 
---
As a mage who used to main Warlock TBC through Cata, if I see an enemy lock in the wild I'm not picking a fight. And if they do CS&gt;Poly&gt;Blink away for a heroic retreat.
---
There is a max lockpicking skill you can have 1lvl=5points in the skill. You migth have hit the cap for your lvl

rolling restart probably, usually 15 mins, applying a hotfix

if it's anything more they'll tell us

"We will be performing an unscheduled rolling restart of all realms. We apologize for the short notice on this one folks!"
---
i mean it's the biggest issue of all time tbh
---
A lot of the time it's seconds before their group pulls a named quest mob.
---
Not relevant bc cross-server BGs.
---
You can decide for yourself https://wowpop.appspot.com

In the middle of a dungeon :) :) :)
---
Best part is max ranging the soulfire then directly after you cast an immolate in to an instant conflag.
---
1 hour long shutdown to fix people who are exploiting layering instances like molten core.
---
I used to play a private server for an older game that actually had jail. Your character could never leave.
---
However, with it being a private server, I found a way to teleport anywhere I wanted. So, the GMs kept jailing me and I would teleport out later in the day.
---
They eventually asked me how I was doing that but I told them to fuck off and they deleted my character.
---
Jokes on them, I can still do it to this day.
---
in a dungeon hoping this shutdown is short
---
In general, no. A few quests are part of a chain that leads to something nice though. You can always look them up first if you're worried about it.
---
Maybe you‚Äôll get a temporary ban, but if it was one time and you didn‚Äôt benefit from it, you can probably reach out to Blizzard and they will take it off.
---
But honestly, Blizzard is far more concerned with major abusers.
---
I gave 3 people 25s each for repairs after we wiped a few too many times on SM Cath and then Both the loot drops were for me. The guy who rage quit immediately after we downed the boss did not get any silver lol
---
some websites and services do respect these things. for example, ebay used to work with blizzard to remove listings for things that violated the Blizzard ToS. It was a working relationship, though, one that I imagine Blizzard established by reaching out. Facebook and Youtube, though, are pretty notorious for not giving a shit until they get pressured into it regarding advertising so it's no surprise they wouldn't, and I wonder if Blizz even bothers trying to get help taking those ads down anymore.
---
10 times is a lot for only 1 week ban. Anything over one time should result in a permaban
---
this. as a rule, you should have this option enabled on all your chars. let's you know who the mob has aggroed, who that filthy alliances is looking at etc.
---
Did that this morning.
---
People in the back didn't hear you.
---
As a hunter the Corsair Scimitar Pro is a godsend...I honestly can't imagine playing without it.
---
Just came here wondering the same thing. Would have been nice to have a popup or something to say how long.

How can I see the targets health/mana figures? People keep suggesting UI addons but I prefer the normal blizzard UI
---
Eks dee

Details [Here](https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1173435188618989571?s=20).  Fixing an exploit that has to due with layering in dungeons.  Should be 15min
---
Ok, so you're not talking about Goblin Gliders... what was Glider?
---
Was it a normal chest or was it a locked chest. And was he the rogue?
---
it says that about tomorrows maitenance for me
---
I.d recommend some addons like Questie for example. You will find quest locations very easy because they are shown on your map. 
---
Youtube tutorials about classes are useful as well. In general as Tank Warriors are the best. For DPS Rogues and for Healers Priests do the work very good. But every class is useful at something in a dungeon. And yea. Scarlet Monastery is a lvl 35-45 dungeon. Dungeons usually start at lvl 13 for horde and 17 for alliance. 
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Instances_by_level
---
I also play WoW to relax and try not to spend too much time on it. Ofc you can enjoy it like this as well. Maybe finding the same group to play with everytime is not that probable. But you can find someone to do quests with almost everywhere. Guilds are also very helpful for finding dungeon groups.
---
Were the technologies for mobile internet even available at that time?
---
That says Tuesday morning for me
---
Trying to turn a dwarf into a sheep made your day?
---
This happens from time to time. They usually come back up in 15 or so. 
---
Calm down
---
no one cares. this happens everyday, get over it.
---
1) calm down
---
2) layering is going away, this is a temporary thing
---
Yep, it says all servers are down for me too.
---
I would love that, if you wouldn't mind!  
---
Is it all "real time"? I think that could be really useful for telling me how much mana is regening while i'm shifted, if it does!   
---
Thank you :)
---
After an hour forming a UBRS group, as we get to the fire elemental this 15 minute warning starts, we missed Rend by a few seconds...
---
How would I know my man
---
That was a different time listed though
---
Just got off the phone with Jeff Bezos, he says he doesnt know whats going on either
---
Pretty sure they mentioned Classic+ tho.
---
I'm all for keep the phases true to Classic but if there's new content coming after phase 6 then some QoL changes and class balance patches are negotiable.
---
Next one I see listed on the client is for tomorrow morning, nothing about today
---
where can I see the breakdowns?
---
What about the Yetis in the cave in North Hillsbrad?
---
it doesnt say anything about today on my client
---
Good. People practicing for years to reach 60 and knowing all the tips and tricks to do it and clear mc is totally fine. But exploiting instances and getting massive amounts of gold. No that should be perma ban. They knew what they were doing.
---
That was for 5 hours ago. Not for whatever is going on now
---
Yesterday I told lowbies to message me any bounties/gankers and I'd take care of them while I leveled mining in Arathi. It was pretty cool.
---
That's scheduled for tomorrow though, there was nothing about the one right now.
---
where do you see this? i see the sept 17th 7am PDT to 8am PDT
---
It's not. If you look at logs it doesn't actually apply any of the damage modifiers either. Fire Shield should deal 12 and only deals 9.

BG's are launching with cross-realm so that's not gonna be a thing
---
Thats tues/weds
---
The only thing I see in the server is for tomorrow and Wednesday
---
I haven't heard of anyone on Westfall yet. Almost positive Horde hasn't done it - I think we finally breached 40 level 60s over this weekend. From what I've heard on alliance they just have more numbers but still not a ton of 60s.
---
Yep. Every reset costs more gold.
---
As time passes with you not respeccing, the cost will slowly drop back down. It also has a cap, though I have no clue what it is.
---
Thats for tomorrow isnt it?
---
why would you delete and not just go to another server? all the power to you tho.
---
are you a cop?
---
15 minutes.
---
that was for this morning..
---
So this was a chest out in the world?
---
Hate to be the one to say it but, fastest clicker wins. Expecting people to play by some arbitrary rules or decency you made up in your mind is how you learn the lesson you learned.
---
Thats tomorrow. Today is the 16th.
---
That's for tuesday, September 17th, 7:00 AM - 8:00 AM (PDT)
---
Good to know, ty
---
????? he wrote and read at the same level as me... not as you im not making anything up you are and now ur bending it to fit your agenda to make this o=post about my grammer and not about blizz messing classic up please take your self some place with your lies and your slander on me and bring the conversation bback to blizzard and WoW classic thank you very much...... this guy i seeneded  a picture of him writededddddd and da boookies are published by someone else not him a dururududrudrurdudrudrudrudru

you forgot to surround yourself by 3-5 horde players spitting on your body
---
Whenever I see this cave, I have the sudden urge to hit my A, B, X, and Y buttons in a certain sequence in order to free a Banana Bird.
---
Literally got done with queue seconds before servers went offline. It's my fault, I'm sorry.
---
I would also like to know.
---
I've had this guild spam me a few times as well. Dude seems like a dick, glad I turned it down
---
Don't even need to do that.
---
You can just right click their name in the chat log. You just need the name specifically rather than the message.
---
The name goes in there when they send the channel invite.
---
Mine says tues + wed, nothing about monday
---
I'm on a high pop server, and I scan 700+ pages.
---
thanks, hopefully wont take too long
---
I thought it did, but I haven't really tried much since I turned it off. Based off what other people in here are saying I'm not so sure.
---
Zones are super concentrated now, I think WPVP is more fun once most of population is 60 and you can be more casual on an alt.
---
... i like how you think
---
Yeah I actually moved to Old Blanchy. Nice and quiet.
---
IIRC, they cleared up to a certain point then left to get get the UBRS fire res buff I think. And when they got back the raid appeared to have reset. He put in a ticket and the GM said to reclear it. I dont know if him and his crew did it more then that. But at that point what was the GM suppose to do? Tell them their or SOL and need to wait till next reset to get the bosses they had worked up to at that point?
---
I feel the same way that people who abused this should be punished and harshly. But if they only recleared it that one time I dont think there was any harm done as he reported the issue. If they abused it after that fact then yes they should get perma bans/or character deletions imo.
---
yeah because essence farming is still a secret in vanilla wow lmao
---
The data doesn't really account for the fact layering is used. 
---
As a whole, the server skews horde, but individual layers might be closer to neutral or even Alliance favored. 
---
I play on Skeram. It's never been much of a problem, but you can always switch layers if it really bothers you.
---
Well shiiiit gonna save this comment for later when I get home. Thanks my dude ü§ô
---
you might get a temp ban from the sub for witch hunting. even tho it's not your intention they can be fickle at times.
---
Happened right as I was logging in on one of my characters. I thought I broke something.
---
Cheap worthless effort to form forgettable experience with random numbered people.
---
Hi! I'm a new player and just got the game. Any realm recommendations? NAE pref
---
Also, what are some good professions to run as a Rogue?
---
You are missing the point. Getting corpse camped all the time is indicative of a huge population imbalance. We are swapping servers which means there will be even less alliance and exacerbates the problem until none are left.

This is a fantastic idea
---
I only came back to wow late last year (played from launch through the first 3-4 months of WotLK), and had never heard of the guy.  Some people were talking about him so I decided to check it out and....wtf?  How the fuck is this idiot popular?  Seriously, he looks like a guy I knew who got the crap kicked out of him on a regular basis in highschool for being a douche.
---
That was this morning. 0300
---
What does a realm restart entail?
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen above 10 pages on mine. How many items are 700 pages?
---
I'm fucked if that's the case.
---
Yeah, i think it just happened. Rolling restarts maybe?
---
Fun fact, if I was dead I wouldn‚Äôt have to go to work Tomorrow.
---
Exactly. People downvoting me don't understand.
---
Oh god your right about competing later I didn't even think of that. Yeah this is going to suck. It's also just putting me off as well it's pretty disgusting.
---
Servers are up.
---
It was posted in the launcher
---
Normally I roll on chests in dungeons as the norm courtesy, but as far as open world people either try to be as t me to chest if I pull the mobs around them or spam an invite for me to roll on it when I clearly saw it first. So at this point I really only roll in dungeons now
---
Hunter tanks rotgrip first, feigns at like 3 stack, then pops cooldowns and goes for broke on rotgrip.
---
It does this, 5-60 are whats counted.
---
Are you playing on a normal server or PVP?
---
They are resetting them I believe
---
Ah nvm, rolling restarts. My bad guys :D

"Gold is easy to farm if you know what you're doing."
---
Legit comment
---
 "Sorry we don't sell stuff low for people who can't understand the basics of the game."
---
Unnecessary comment
---
Just a note, sword spec becomes the best once you're level cap, at least from a PvP perspective (fury is obviously better for PvE).
---
But yes I agree for leveling up since your frequency of hits is lower the axe crit is gonna be statically better.
---
Veganism obviously
---
thanks for the heads up!
---
same chance as normal attack
---
I tried that much earlier in the 40s so I'll go check that out again (Getting a lot of recommendations for Feralas). Thanks!
---
you get to the boss you want kill it, then drop one player. now as a 4 man invite a new player to become a 5 man again which will now resets the boss kill it again, remove one player and re-invite first  and boss will spawn again loop repeat.
---
it worked on raids so you could spawn any boss as many times as you wanted making rare loot common, rare mounts easy,  recipe etc. it was a major exploit that i don't understand why was ever ignored in till was talked about more.
---
servers up
---
I dont think you will miss out on anything.  The game will be healthy a year for now.  People will make new characters, people will level alts to 60, ect. 
---
Lots of people will be around so you won't miss anything.  :)
---
why was it important to be on the same server?

I just recruited two people into my guild just as server shut down.
---
I cant upvote this reference enough
---
Do you want to be on a PvP server?
---
Alliance or Horde?
---
Professions don't really have innate bonuses for classes in Vanilla other than Engineering.
---
As a Rogue it's probably easiest to go Herbalism/Alchemy, as pots are very useful and you'll need to make some for your rogue quests anyways.
---
An alternative would be Skinning/Leatherworking, but that's relatively unpopular.

Bloodsworn | NA PvP | Horde | Herod | Dedicated Raiding
---
**About Us:**
---
Bloodsworn is a Horde guild on Herod. The core of our guild is a group of friends that have been playing MMO‚Äôs and various other games together since the early 2000‚Äôs. We‚Äôre looking for mature raiders that are willing to progress through all the content WoW Classic has to offer. Our primary focus will be on PvE/raiding, but if you‚Äôre mostly interested in PvP, there will be officers heavily involved in that as well.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Tuesday/Wednesday/Sunday - 8:30-11:30 EST (This is still being discussed)
---
We will be running dungeons, attunement chains, and any other quests to help everyone get pre-raid best in slot prior to raiding.
---
**Loot:**
---
We will be using a loot council system for raid gear that drops. In our opinion, loot council is the best way to gear a guild for progression through every raid tier. The loot council will contain the GM and all class officers. We will be using the following priority: Tanks -&gt; DPS/Heals. Please understand that you will not get gear every run; however, if you‚Äôre consistently raiding with the guild, you will be rewarded gear to help with our progression.
---
**Needs:** We have a solid core of 3 tanks and 5 healers. We're going to need DPS (Mages/Fury Warriors) and a few more healers to complete our core group. Current roster sits at around 60. Most members are between 30-45. We're recruiting organically, without the spam in trade chat.
---
**Contact:**
---
[https://discord.gg/tkXeudP](https://discord.gg/tkXeudP) \- There's a guild app in our discord. Post a message and we can talk or DM me on Reddit or Discord. Thanks.
---
servers are back up
---
So it is relatively easy to reduce incoming damage by 50% I would guess
---
1. Yes/No  in perfect optimal circumstances, Orc is like 2% better pve, and UD are a bit better PVP with their racial;  but you will almost never have a perfect lab test envrioment, play what you want and be happy.  (I'm also a troll rogue)
---
2. Doesn't really matter untill 60, focus on leveling and selling what drops, youll need the gold. Poisions are explained by your rogue trainer in game. 
---
3. meh, there are pve and pvp specs for a reason.  Sure you can still smack somebody with pve swords. but pvp provides the utility that aids in fighting a human controlled player.
---
server is back up
---
Agreed. Fk these people using that annoying addon.
---
Probably the exploit and appropriate measures to prevent it from happening again and how to take action against abusers.
---
So what is it for if not memes and goofs?
---
You want to discuss a game we know everything about?
---
I don't know what this means...
---
yikes
---
Heard he was garbage
---
I'm noticing that people aren't as good at PVPing anymore.  Yesterday a gnome warlock at least 20 levels higher ganked me (hunter), but not before I took him down to a quarter of his health.
---
From what I understand, Frost gives you the CC in order to solo level more effectively. Being able to stun people you are fighting allows you to kite and avoid damage.
---
Someone should've gone to his economics class more. Ok Jimmy what happens when you flood an economy with a shit ton of currency? Massive inflation good job! 
---
Jimmy: So we should throw the exploiters in jail right?! 
---
Yes but now that gold will not be leaving the economy except for whatever was still on the account. What does this mean?!
---
The economy is accelerated to a level of inflation it shouldn't have been able to reach for months. So now if you didn't abuse the bug everything has become relatively much  more expensive and you're fucked.
---
Tldr its not just BoEs that are affected by this. Let's use our noodles here.
---
Furor isn't really useful early on imho. You can kill several mobs before you need to heal. I would shift heal shift and loot to let my energy build back up (saving looting for last). 
---
Natures grasp would be useful on a pvp server for the escape sure, but if you play on a pve server like me, not needed. 
---
In my experience, you should just go straight feral, get you capstone at 40, and start branching out from there as mobs get tougher. Atm I wish i had gone furor at 40 as I spend a bit of time shifting to heal, although thats just a small improvement to farmin speed.
---
60/40 is fine, you‚Äôre still gonna get ganked.
---
Pve to pvp?
---
If only the goal of a videogame was to have fun instead of leveling as fast as possible.
---
/s.
---
It's perfectly fine to level as a fire mage. Go for it.
---
Looking at whirlwind quest, some people say that Axe is best for higher numbers. Some love the sword for fast attacks. Relatively fewer seem to like the mace
---
Sigh
---
Oh yeah. I do that everytime I see one.
---
I use an add-on called vanaskos. It notifies me if they are near me and shows my notes. You can also view a full list of players you add and there notes. I don't even play on a pvp server but it has been sooooooo helpful. I love helping others out and returning the favor to those that help me. Also, importantly, I do not want to help those that have screwed others or me over!
---
It affects us all. What they did messes up our game as well.
---
&gt; Any tool that assists or automates operations. 
---
While I fundamentally agree, watch out around mod users. They'll spill out the woodwork fervently defending their mods while claiming it "doesn't affect the game".
---
Hell! Yeah!  
---
Thanks much for your time &amp; reply.
---
Im a priest and[ i look like a rogue](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/608381540749279242/620131191508434944/unknown.png?width=454&amp;height=560)
---
Please explain what you think is disgusting about not doing something. I don't get it.
---
Huh. I‚Äôve always played a mage, and I try to save enemy players from death whenever I can. But I must admit it‚Äôs never occurred to me to poly them to increase their life as well. I‚Äôm going to remember that one.
---
Term of service arent laws dude.
---
Its back now
---
Lol sure buddy
---
As a mage that purposely didn‚Äôt go AOE spec because I enjoy shatter crits and play with a group of friends where I‚Äôm the only Mage, I also kind of hate other AOE Mages. I also dislike groups where they assume/expect you‚Äôre going to AOE everything for them and get angry when they find out I took frostbite, which is really bad for blizzard pulling. Sure, I can AOE down packs with Arcane Explosion and often do, but I‚Äôm also doing a lot of single target DPS. 
---
I find the entire experience of this combination smoother, more relaxing, and more fun because I can change things up. 
---
The whole mentality that Mages must go AOE, must run AOE groups, and must level as fast as humanly possible is absurd. I think this mentality leads to entitlement, boredom, and burnout. I hit 40 and got my mount last night and I‚Äôve been playing at a medium pace since launch. I‚Äôm having fun and have no plans to stop this pace until 60.
---
Do we even have real GMs in classic?  i haven't seen any yet.
---
OP probably just wants to go with the original one.
---
Justice.
---
Thats my point tho. The data is for the entire server, not layers. The server skews horde, but layers might not. If it's a huge problem, you can just hop layers to one that seems more neutral.
---
Servers as a whole aren't unplayable for certain factions. It's individual layers, and you simply need to get off the layer to solve the problem.
---
Someone‚Äôs mad they didn‚Äôt figure it out first lol. But on a real note, I don‚Äôt necessarily think they deserve a ban for a broken mechanic that blizzard put into the game. That is blizzard problem to deal with, and since the decided to add layering, they had to expect this. The issue got a lot of traction and didn‚Äôt receive much help from blizzard because they simply don‚Äôt care about it as much.
---
I played a 70 Tauren up to TBC.
---
If you want to do PvE end-game content, you're most likely going to have to go Resto unless you have connections or the situation you're in allows you to roll enhancement.
---
Damage charts wise yeah you're not going to excel pound for pound, only time you might is if you're fully decked in BiS gear and your damage competitors are woefully under geared.
---
Vanilla WoW really didn't like hybrid classes like Paladin/Shaman/Druids to play anything besides healing for PvE end game content. It was a real shitty time to play hybrid classes.
---
just put out an edit as soon as you replied
---
&gt; My thought is that the 5% extra swings from sword specialization is ideal because as well as getting 5% more swings, this would also result in 5% more crits due to the additional swings, is my math broken here?
---
Yes. Say you have a base crit rate of 10%. With axe spec, that is buffed to 15% crit. With sword spec, you get 5% more swings, or 1.05x as many swings at your crit rate of 10%. This equals out to a 10.5% crit rate as compared to base. This doesn't take into account the extra damage from non crit sword spec procs (essentially turning the swing that procs them into a crit), but in terms of activating things that proc based off crits such as deep wounds, axe spec is more effective. Conversely, sword spec does better at procing on-hit effects such as weapon enchants or abilities. 
---
TL;DR: It depends heavily on the build and gear around the spec, especially the weapon. Even if sword spec maths out to be the better *spec*, if you get the WW axe at 30, you're probably going to want axe spec.
---
Shows the tooltip
---
Warriors and Priests have to go there in Legion to get their artifact weapons. It's also where Tyr, one of the titan keepers, died fighting a minion of the Old Gods. It's where Tirisfal Glades got it's name (Ty'rs Fall).
---
Is this on a PVP realm? If you were surprised that you would be outnumbered on a PVP realm as Alliance, then you haven't been paying attention.
---
Nevertheless, this post reads like bullshit hyperbolic whining from a teen who got ganked one too many times.
---
Yeah, I can infinitely heal the tanks guys. Using the 5 second rule I can literally run this whole dungeon never drinking and always in combat. However, when 3 of you decide to split aggro and take hits with 2 of you being squishes, I'm going to deplete fast.
---
I did this way back when. I assumed everybody got a share. When corrected I offered to return the cheese or whatever was in there.
---
Lol imagine thinking this was someone being serious.
---
Thank you for translating.

---
Looks like rogues only still.
---
ssssshhhh sssssssshhhhhhhhhhh ssssshhhh youll bring the twitchies
---
Are they? My understanding is that they drop over time if left alone.
---
Sounds like a bug.  When you party it 100% puts you in the same layer.  I've parties hundreds of times, even with multiple people.  Always in the same layer.  
---
Make sure you aren't on different "realms".
---
You don't really need a main character unless you are in an end game raiding guild, because they will only want to gear up one of your toons. For pvp and dungeon play, you can have lots of 60s. In vanilla, my first guild just did dungeons and we loved the people who had multiple 60s and could bring whatever we needed.
---
For pvp, hunters and rogues dominate the bgs, and are so different I think you'll have fun playing both.
---
That's okay by me. I don't make the rules.
---
Mine says "Don't DAZE me bro!"
---
Which is why you figure it out yourself, or ask community members in the game before you resort to "cheating."
---
Based on the name and lots of experience being in a battle group with Ragnaros... Me thinks he no habla the english
---
The only fix blizzard can do is removing gold from these accounts or banning the accounts which still have the majority of gold on them.
---
Once in circulation the damage is essentially done.
---
The Ravager is a good weapon to supplement AoE for hunters though ...

Seems to be slightly more axes but still enough swords
---
You know what would happen if people rolles greed on epic BoEs? Im a druid and i want warden staff really badly. You know what i would do? Get my first warden staff and then never use it in dungeons because it makes no difference if i have it or not in dungeons and on the small chance that it drops again i would make hundreds of gold of profit. Now you can argue that im just an asshole but i guarantee you a lot of people would do that. You see stuff like that in retail too for example. Guilds usually sell Raid BoEs so what a lot of people do is not loot anything so if any BoE drops for them they will just get it per mail without anyone knowing, send it to an alt and sell it themselves.
---
I hope you get the help you need. The world is not out to get you. We are not all part of some corporate scheme to make fun of you. There is no grand conspiracy to keep you down. I wish you luck. Please seek help.

Pro tip, if someone is looting a chest before they've rolled you can open a trade window with them to stop their chest opening
---
True, but it‚Äôs still enjoyable.
---
Yeah it might be because the specs are different, so you're able to use the role flag a bit easier.
---
I use WA for my cooldowns as well right now for druid, pretty easy to set up.
---
But hope the bars help, you can customize as you see fit. I have the numbers on the bars to help me as I am going feral for raids should be a fun time. Gotta get used to power shifting once again which is going to be a blast.
---
If you paid attention you'd know blizzard was warned a million different times. This sub had at least 5 front page posts about it a day. There were videos made, and many in the beta reported the issues of how exploitable it was
---
Blizzard chose to pretend it wasn't a problem. When you tell someone they're going to step on a knife and they stick their nose up at you and then step on the knife, it's hard to not chuckle and say "told ya so mother fuckers"
---
That‚Äôs the Siamese. White Kitten is only sold byca wandering vendor in Stormwind.
---
You really don't know what you're talking about
---
Perma ban isn't harsh. There was literally no way to do it on accident and the people doing it were specifically and knowingly cheating the game.
---
Would be no different than if they had some kind of hack.
---
Learning to tank at a workable level isn't difficult - the dungeons level up with you,  so just practice as you level and run as many as you can. 
---
What does get complicated is learning some of the more complex dungeons and encounters that require more coordination - in which case I'd recommend doing a quick read up on some of the dungeons before starting,  since you'll be expected to lead in part. 
---
And get used to marking targets ;)
---
not exactly, since it's a graph of level and not of time played

He‚Äôs definitely not ‚Äúhigh profile‚Äù but I would like to know the context of the clip. Is he showing it to show how it works and can be abused or is he actually abusing it? If he‚Äôs actually abusing it I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll get the same punishment as everyone else.
---
Exploiting broken mechanics that blizzard released isn‚Äôt cheating. Exploiting and then not reporting the exploit you found is a slight issue, but still not cheating. Cheating would be like back in the day people that had speed hacks, or could fly before flying cane out etc. those are cheats. This is not.
---
Yeah, additionally if you both start at the same time, you get the quest drops from all the mobs once the other person has finished (assuming they are considerate and stick around). Two tagging is better than one.
---
Yes! You absolutely want to be using some ret skills as a tank since all of your threat comes from dealing holy damage. I like to use retribution aura when dealing with trash and large groups of mobs
---
That's recruiting done right.

Found Hazeride's daughter lol
---
Lol okay, how is a cross-realm fractured community with no coherency or permanence a result of "hurt feelings".
---
You have to explain how hurt feelings somehow lead to the aspect of retail that you're referring to. How was the cross-realm LFG system which killed the community be a result of hurt feelings from ninja'd loot? How did GM's enforcing verbal agreements lead to instant travel shard hopping? That's a massive disconnect of events. You saying "but reeeeeetail" doesn't mean anything.

Also with the honor system there won‚Äôt be high levels ganking low levels as frequently. Due to the fact you will lose HKs for dishonorable kills

We plan to someday be 60, sorry we had any hope of participating in the endgame when we got there.
---
Chill dude.
---
and what else would you expect to see here? we got wowhead for that shit, and we've been playing it forever anyways lol.
---
&gt;TBH I'd say if you're already 60 and pushing raid content you're likely the type of person who would jump at the chance to exploit something like this.
---
"Pushing the raid content" right now means doing a piss easy raid and thats it. Risking a ban for something like that is just retarded.
---
They'll all be transferred to the Classic equivalent of Moonglade Goldshire Inn and they can't leave.
---
Ah, thought they were the same thing since the Siamese is basically white
---
I asked for the glasses, dude.
---
They shouldn't try to make retail like classic, they got a healthy game for who ever plays that. Instead they should take the opportunity they now have to have 2 different mmos with different game design. They should by now understand you cant please everyone. So there should be absolutely no reason for them to try and please the community that thier current games isn't target towards
---
/spit
---
Perhaps... This?
---
as the hunter, just make a group yourself, and bring casters and a druid tank.
---
Alternatively bind just pet attack to something
---
Yep and that‚Äôs why I rarely watch wow streams I‚Äôd rather play it myself legitimately.
---
Just follow a 1-60 guide at your own pace a hour or 3 a night if you're SUPER concerned about leveling fast lol. You'll probably be 60 in 3/4 months or so
---
Lmaooo bro another reason to roll horde.   Human voice legit sounds Buzz Lightyear.   Gonna gank you infinity and beyond nerds even harder

Cold Snap means an extra reset on Nova. As well as Cone of Cold. You can't   
---
"walk over, win" if you can't walk or if you're limping at -60% movement speed while the mage dumps Frostbolt and Fireblast into you. 
---
If you can't kill a mage prior to burning your first intercept there is no realistic scenario that you'd be able to finish them off before dying since now they can kite to their leisure and blink will always be up for them to deal with your next intercept. 
---
I feel like you're strangely taking it personally that, all else equal, mage &gt; warrior in a 1v1 duel most of the time. Warriors can't be the best at everything lol.
---
You care enough to make this whiny ass post
---
go To ReTAIL!
---
Worth it.
---
Idk how I feel about this. I don‚Äôt think devs should be banning people unless they‚Äôre using an exploit, hack, or other things against the rules. Is ninja looting against TOS?
---
ok so next time dont do it XDDDD this guyyy there isn't a conspiracy just shyt stupid ppl who are elitists man ur duumb af but thank you for admitting ur a piece of !@$!
---
\\o/ can't spell like me i dont care if ur write u dont get platform to speak on ........ ya real nice guys i want to take advice from xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Okay I did not know that. Thanks.
---
Like most, I can't speak to vanilla Naxx, but if you're an experienced healer there have been (and still are) several points in retail WoW's history where healing has been more difficult than Classic. 
---
5-mans in particular are simple, enough so that it's common to be run as off-spec. There are notable exceptions, such as Emperor or the Hakkar event, but for the most part difficulty just means you run out of mana. If you prepare with potions and runes, you'll be rewarded.
---
I don't think you need the rep, but you'd be able to farm to exalted with a faction and farm 1kg before you'll be able to hit rank 11.
---
Agree with this. The ratio is only going to get worse as frustrated ally move off server.
---
It's not even that it's unbalanced though. It's just notoriously heavily contested zones on a PvP server. I've been leveling through the same zones on Horde (Badlands and STV) on the same server as OP for the last 2-3 days and I can't go an hour without being jumped by Alliance at least once.
---
Either deal with it or reroll on a PvE server. That's just how it is.
---

---
Well, I gotta say it. I've been playing a mage in  WoW on and off since 2005, and I have never aoe farmed, why? 2 reasons fire mage is more fun and it's dumb, since all you're doing is pissing off the people around you, so when you need help with an elite quest or protection from the opposite faction, you're not going to get it. Then there's the time factor, yes you killed 5 mobs at once, but I've finished the quest since I found a partner and we didn't have to make multiple corpse runs. Need money?  Play the AH or whatever. Even this mage thinks you're being stupid.
---
So is Bethesda. How you can even deny they aren't a shit ass company is beyond me. They can't even make a SEMI-polished game
---
Ah man my ignore list is already full
---
Alt-right Hitler*
---
because those things were already asked for 15 years ago, and received. They don't need to do it again, they're giving us the game we wanted and was already tweaked along the way.
---
Don't need a guild at the moment. I just hate getting spammed this several times a day.
---
Useful when tanking to drag mobs to/from an area when your dps is slow to move.
---
Write them back and say, "Hey, I'm interested in the guild, can you gkick me?"
---
No, sorry no idea.
---
I was at work, and the frequency of you comments far outweigh mine, but if you wanna try again feel free lol
---
Love that first one. Gonna have to test it out. Hate  using auto shot then the mob approaches me and I'm sitting there like an idiot cause I gotta click my melee now lol.
---
Yes why would the mods want to remove an obvious witch hunting
---
There are some of us who see mobile gaming and ruining the industry.
---
Actually was doing Scholo and were at minibosses before Gandling, as if that should make a difference. Didn't realize asking for a simple head's up is unreasonable.
---
This is exactly the type of original content Classic needs.
---
They're locked a small pen. They only have access to the W and S keys and no mouse turning.
---
There is a vendor just outside of the pen that sells snowballs.
---
Logging out takes 5 minutes.
---
They can fuck off to a single player game. This is an MMO. I have absolutely no expectations to anyone that doesn't have my guild tag.
---
Racism still exists in it though it's more politics than racism now, also homophobia (at least on my server) has been replaced with transphobia.
---
Just Ctrl+Left click the minimap icon and you don't have to reload
---
They could still run away in Wrath.
---
Why would socialists support Trump?  That doesn't make any sense.
---
Damn it, OP. As your future guild leader, I order you to purge this server.
---
I did 28-58 as AoE solo &amp; group instance as mage. Did not do a single quest in that time frame other than a couple in ZF &amp; MC attunement. They are absolutely not inefficient in a group. If you‚Äôre pulling so few mobs that your tank and healer can actually handle it, then you are not pulling enough mobs. Frame of reference would be SM Cath full clears take ~14min., ZF zombie runs take ~18min., etc.  You can‚Äôt go much faster than that without risking instance lock.
---
I say sissy when I don't want to say the "P-word" around my mom.

Welcome to Hunter. Having to micro manage a pet on top of your normal stuff takes some getting used to. Most of the "huntard" stuff comes from having little to no control over the janky pathing and AI of your pet. Warlocks will say its not that hard, but the fact is that their pets have way fewer things to worry about and don't seem to skip around the whole world on their own as often.
---
My biggest piece of advice is to keep your pet on passive at all times. Bind a key for "pet attack". Manually tell your pet to attack things. Manually tell it to switch targets. Manually tell it to come back to you if you need it to pull the mobs back when it has agro.
---
Yes this is kind of annoying at first, but its really easy. Having full and quick control of your pet is essential to avoid the stereotype. Don't send your pet to attack everything either. If you're in a dungeon and you're attacking a mob with another pack just behind it slightly out of agro range, keep your pet at your side. Otherwise when it gets to the target it will run behind the target and likely put it into agro range of the extra pack of mobs. If you see a patrol coming, hit the passive button to make your pet come back if you're worried about it being in agro range.
---
It will all become second nature, but it's part of what makes hunter so fun imo. Switching my pet between targets in PvP without interrupting my kiting and damage on another target just to get an intimidation stun off is one of my favorite examples of this. So yeah, just get used to controlling your pets every move manually.
---
And also remember to dismiss it before jumping down ledges if there's not a path for it to take. This has gotten way better than it was in original Vanilla, but it's still far from perfect. Do it just in case, lol.
---
Damn... I should go play the lottery then because I got all those swords on my first run of each dungeon on my warrior.
---
they were doing this for about 3 days and very few people were doing this. You are heavily overestimating the impact haha
---
so sad hides his reply score then down votes myine guess what did i down vote urs nope vcuz mi not the one with out a life ahahahahahahahhahahahahahahaha
---
No. You weren't. You just misunderstood what people what people were referring to.
---
Dungeons aren't played at end-game. Period.
---
Currently, most players aren't at 60, so terms refer mostly to levelling. But in vanilla, a lot of players were raiding. So most statements were used in reference to raiding.
---
No sweat dude. Next time, just blame the hunter
---
that kind of assumes dw fury it seems, with no mention of 2h fury and slamming. 
---
nor arms, although i think arms was a limited thing simply because of the debuff limit. 
---
i know that by the end / pserver this is true more so than others, but yeah.
---
although it seems the stats stuff for dw is the same at least.
---
ahh someone outside has to reset, so you still need an alt to lasher farm :( thanks for the response though!
---
Too bad it was nerfed... used to be the best turn 2 for warriors.

You're straight up lying?  From you link, Anathema is 63% alliance, Arcanite Reaper 53%, Benediction 52%, Faerlina 52%, and Netherwind 53%.

Haha. I knew I would get this comment. I know. But I wanted more stuff (other than broken tooth). And it was long debated BEFORE we knew that ... and I still knew I wanted piggyboi. :P
---
I checked just now and my blood pact adds 39 not 38 stam
---
I think they didn't say anything against layer hopping outside. My guild mates do it a lot.
---
Gran Jam√≥n actually
---
It is indeed. Not dense at all, you got it.
---
They can just reset the trash and farm it
---
It auto hides it, are you really that confused?
---
They can only control the market to lower the price though.  Having 2000 stacks of thick leather doesnt mean you can make more gold per stack, it just means you have more opportunity to undercut the competition.  But if the market is already at saturation without your 2000 thick leather, the benefit comes entirely from having more to sell rather than something about the amount that gives you more power in the market.
---
Horde are filth.
---
Alliance are scum.
---
Messaged you!
---
This thread is so useful, in for later.
---
Enjoy your perma-ban, bud. This kind of exploitation is unacceptable. 
---
How is this fair to those of us that have to wait until we‚Äôre on land to make campfires?
---
Also, there is no "flood", it was a fairly small number of exploiters from the looks of it.  It will barely register a blip on the radar of the server-wide economy.
---
at work ya right u know ur in momies basement fat ass
---
I played it on Xbox and it let me
---
Can't find it now, someone posted it onto Reddit. I believe it was of their realm personally, rather than the overall of all realms -- but it's very likely the other realms follow a similar path, given how early days it is right now. 
---
Iirc, the big bulk of the playerbase sits between 20-45 in level.
---
1 month plus deleted items.  I dig it.  Way to go blizzard.
---
Most people are still leveling. You rushed to 60 early, complaining about lack of groups is pointless. Level an alt.
---
Or a leveling guild that plans to transition to raiding later. Guild I'm in has 400+ members and multiple dungeon groups being run through the level ranges. It's OC's decision to guild up with his irl friends that is the limiter. Make your own chat channel with your friends, that's likely the biggest reason y'all are guilded right now
---
WW axe being guaranteed is really it's major benefit and is good well into your 40s if you have shitty luck with drops or rolls in dungeons. 
---
It's worth the time to farm up. Especially if you can get it before lvl 35 or 36 with some help.
---
Some of them are sarcastic
---
There are a lot of 25-45 blues that require potions for crafting. Check the AH, these ones are always selling for higher prices. I needed elixir of defense to make my toughened gloves, and had to find an alc to sell me some.
---
Hearthstone is currently in a mad rush to fix an issue than has been in the game for over half a year.
---
Diablo 3 had SO MANY PROBLEMS AT LAUNCH
---
I don't know enough about overwatch so I won't comment on something I'm informed on
---
HotS was a massive shit show, so much so they pulled the pro-scene right in the middle of it and is notorious to this very day for having bugs that have been in the game for years...
---
and then there's WoW. BFA was a shitshow. They were warned about layering abuse since it's announcement and chose to tell us to fuck off and accept it
---
so yea about that QC
---
So ya'll hate hearthstone and underlords too or?
---
But, I mean... You still *almost* lost.
---
" I can't go an hour without being jumped by Alliance"
---
If I could go 10 minutes without getting a Horde train run on me then the game would be playable... getting ganked every hour would be amazing
---
Ooorrrr, the game designers could *not* cater to the 1-2% of players who rushed to 60, and you could instead accept that you are way ahead of the pack and either level an alt or find some farming to do while you wait for groups.
---
Or I guess you can just come and complain here. That is always an option.
---
I doubt many people will get any kind of ban and layering has been present since day 1.
---
Dude we had a blast too, trade chat was going insane!!
---
Nice! Thanks for the heads up. I‚Äôll keep an eye out once I get there.
---
no u set it do auto hide u fuck wit i guess ur confused and forget setting it to that u dipe shyt .... anyways get a life fatty
---
I'm aware, but that one is a pain in the ass for some if not most of the keybinds to press alt.
---
i've been playing on a server that is locked 8-10 hours out of the day. 
---
you don't mine copper ore all the way to level 60. i don't know why you would disregard thorium, mithril, or the gems you get out of thorium
---
leather will sell in the AH for more than the vendor price. if it is selling for vendor price, congrats. you can print gold with a vendor shuffle by crafting stuff with a leatherworker. there are plenty of leatherworkers spamming trade looking for free levels.
---
even if you are lazy and just vendor everything, skinning/mining will easily pay for skills early on.  once you make it to around level 35 you start to make plenty of gold from quest rewards.
---
once you get to level 35 you can pick up lwing or tailoring and be lazy as shit and sell mooncloth/cured rugged leather every 4 days and vendor shuffle for yourself.
---
if someone makes it to level 60 and they don't have gold to train spells, they aren't trying at all.  it isn't even any effort to afford training on the way to 60 unless you are completely disregarding professions.
---
Fuck off.
---
I got this on my first kill. I couldn‚Äôt fucking believe it because I also vividly remember this quest from 15 years ago and needing to kill what felt like hundreds.
---
Yes, this is true even with the ridiculous amount of warriors (and mages) on our server we still always seem to have a very hard time finding tanks...lol if you are prot or willing to tank then you are fighting the good fight still.
---
Its like a wow boomer post
---
Show me how to change it
---
I mean, even if you do manage to make it, it's still a bad idea to go that way because you miss out on the Ghost Walker Post quests, which you're supposed to get before visiting Shadowprey.
---
He‚Äôs using bartender, I can see the icon on his map
---
I did. It's been awhile
---
Agreed, but that 2000 is going to be depleted in fairly short order, and then you have no advantage over any other Thick Leather farmer.  Its a temporary advantage.
---
Can we stop using the word ban, which is very unlikely to see in WoW? Use words like suspend and gkick instead.
---
Imagine people getting their xp reverted too. Would be hilarious.
---
From quests but not from mobs.
---
Ah fuck off dude, you  a 12 yo girl or something?
---
Okay thanks!!
---
mhmmmm as my karma goes uppppp LUL get a life kid
---
Probably to discourage people from killing her for the loot when someone is on the quest? Or rather to discourage people from killing her BECAUSE someone is on the quest to grief them. I don't know. Maybe just a reward for those who have finished the quest.
---
Create a group
---
many warriors tank with a 2h while lvling soooooooo
---
SHAME
---
You still haven't had a single relevant response this whole time. You going to explain how my first comment is inaccurate, wrong, or circlejerky?
---
Your argumentation is completely flawed and generally, that‚Äôs not how punishment works. If I only get banned for a month, guess what, I‚Äôll do it again because i have nothing to fear. I could exploit the shit out of a bug and put me ahead of the community (farm and play-time wise) and get the ban. In the meantime I could reroll another char and basically switch everytime a char gets a ban of say 2-4 weeks. That doesn‚Äôt work they hand out perma band or even HWID bans.
---
That makes no sense - tanking IS your off role, dps is your main role. If I'm a dps warrior and get into a group as a dps warrior but after 15 min of looking for a tank and not finding one the group asks me if I could tank (because it's a lot easier to find dps than a tank), I would agree, but I would roll on dps gear because that IS my main role.
---
Anyone who plays differently than me is playing wrong!
---
I have heard that even way back in the day this quest bugged out after the server had been online for a while.  Best bet is to try it after a server reboot and see if you have luck then
---
The fact it's a proc means nothing. The fact of the matter is a sword swing that doesn't crit is the same as an axe swing that is upgraded to a crit, but sword swings can also crit, and also proc off hamstring, maybe even rend. 
---
I played back in the day and distinctly remember the theorycrafters recommending sword spec as being the mathematically superior choice by far.  I even got laughed at by a few players because I was an axe guy back then.
---
Wanted, dead or spotted. :D Cool.
---
If I level a Shaman to 60, would I be able to play resto on raids and get gear that I'd also be able to use for speccing as ele for PvP? That's been my idea with going Shaman but if that wouldn't really work out I might go Warlock instead so that gearing up in raids = gearing up for PvP.
---
good, i hope they catch all of them!
---
I miss that game a lot.
---
I think a system like this could definitely be implemented in a fun way to incentivise world PvP in the long run and could evolve into something awesome. I can also envision a way to add PvE aspects to it.
---
Damnit, Roy.
---
Stay classy, my man
---
Finally! Keep it going Blizzard!
---
I hope they're suspending but I'll wait for more confirmation. I imagine there'd be more than one post if bans started going out after 15+ minutes and its super easy to fake an email.
---

Ashkandi fish market is fucked, stacks of 20 stonescale eels are going for less than vendor price.... I dont understand that one at all.... I think last I checked was like 11s 37c?
---
For *most* spells, downranking only starts breaking even with the max rank spell at around +200 healing. Less than that and it's actually bad to downrank.
---
That doesn't work in Vanilla. There aren't enough quests to do that. I think all the quests get you as far as revered then the rest is rune-cloth.
---
And what do you do when after the first kill and loop type is locked in and you're running with 4 guildys and a pug, and the Pug starts needing on every roll and you can't change it now.
---
And that is why the loot system is how it is. Yes it could be different but someone's always going to find a way to screw around with it. The way it is now is the best middle ground.
---
"seethe down"?
---
Hope it works out for you and I honestly think you can get another class to 55 and still be head of the curve if your at where your at now.

---
Back in the day, wowhead/thottbot were enough to get me through. I had a lot more time to figure things out. Now I feel that since I've had the "real" experience before I can justify for myself to use Questie and the like to help me. I've actually discovered things I may not have known about or forgot about. Such as additional places to farm mobs for certain quests, especially in STV.
---
Free action potion, skull of impending doom, kick the poly after that, grenade stun, spider belt out of Frost Nova, swap to shield, shield bash the poly morph, intercept to close the gap again, tidal charm, get polymorphed, die anyways.
---
You would have access to the majority of ele gear. Lokamir/claw are bis for both, mail shoulders in mc are only useful for shaman, same with nac.
---
I get the joke hahaha. But you never know if someones being sarcastic or not. I upvoted to try and even ya out if possible. No sweat man
---
again I'm confused why you're talking about endgame when I specifically specify while leveling but beyond that no you continue to be wrong.  I'm embarrassed for you and blocking you now. some people are just too stupid to be reasoned with.
---
Invited a guy to kill the elite ogres in STV while leveling with someone, while waiting for the named one to spawn a chest appeared, I didn't even notice it, the random we invited did.
---
He saw it and asked to roll, he won it anyway and got the random junk inside.
---
Always pays to be nice to strangers, or maybe that's just how us Alliance players see it.
---
You should have a good number of quests left between Ashenvale, Southern Barrens, Stonetalon, and Hillsbrad Foothills.  
---
I'd do them and then head to Thousand Needles at 28.

It goes against what he said in the past and he's not particularly remorseful. Not that I really believe remorse would actually change the reddit outrage at this point anyway.
---
This is great!
---
Thanks for the earnest reply. I expected nothing but downvotes. 
---
And it's kind of sad. I want the classic experience, but every time I play some other small thing makes me think 'no wonder they got rid of/changed/added this thing'.

I'd really like a community-focused MMO without all of the needlessly grindy and patience-testing portions.

Same. Someone said dragon on top of the AH but I thought they were taking the piss

is that an off-hand letter opener?

Giving up on them for licensing a mobile game isn‚Äôt enough. Giving up on them for ruining retail wow, having influence from activision to push store items that should be included in my sub, making a card game where I need to invest hundred of dollars to be competitive, and telling me I don‚Äôt know what I want with vanilla wow and having that statement shoved in their faces, now that is stuff to give up on a company for.

Classic is awesome, but let‚Äôs not forget the downward trend they‚Äôve been on.

Only thing of this list I would like are emotes.

Runs are very guild centric at the moment since 60s are fresh. I haven't gotten been in a group yet at 60 that wasn't a guild group. Find a populated guild with plenty of 60s. Should be one on your server.
---
Oh yeah no worries. We know it‚Äôs really toxic in here.

We‚Äôre both enjoying it for sure.

Oh I started reading and once I read about the suspension I didn‚Äôt finish the rest üòÖ

Even in those situations I'd just say "Hey we are a group of a healer and tank, happy to shoot you all an invite!" That was you can retain leadership and protect yourself from the ninjas.
---
If people don't loot every corpse sometimes your quest item gets stuck in the corpse when you have to loot it. Has led to some really unnecessarily extended quests for me.
---
I wonder if in the cases you mentioned the offender was dealt with so they decided to give the subscriber paying customer a break.
---
Yes please. Love seeing really obscure ingame stuff.
---
The Arms Warrior also gets their sword there... It was stuck inside an old god or some shit like that.
---
If you're dps, start the group, it's way faster. Lfm

Drain tanking is the most efficient. There is a google doc of dives drain tanking and he goes into quite a bit of detail and there are several videos discussing it.  From personal experience I was doing the traditional VW build and affliction. It was fine and I never had any mana or health issues but was slow just due to VW taking forever to get aggro for me to finally dps something down even with 3/3 improved VW. And also his attacks are about as good as hitting someone with spaghetti. I looked into the drain tanking build and was fully convinced of its superiority. So much faster for leveling as I don‚Äôt have to wait on the blueberry and I can pump out as much damage as I want with succubus and still end a fight with stable hp and mana. I‚Äôm level 35. Mana management as gets better when you get dark lacy at 40. But right now I noticed a big pick up in leveling speed. Down side is I can‚Äôt stack up 4 minions anymore and juggle but I can get away with 2 sometimes 3 at a time. And with how many people are out right now you pretty much fighting to tag mobs. And for PvP, succubus is awesome. I know people always recommend having VW out for that phat shield but if a rogue opens up on you, that shield isn‚Äôt going to help as much, at least that‚Äôs my opinion. I like being able to use suc to charm them and it can be done multiple times. Really unless it‚Äôs an undead and you are at low health, you get a charm off on them once they are pretty much dead as you can constantly fear and dot. Tons of fun.

---
Is there some sort of resource that will give some sort of quest reward temporary "BiS" list while leveling? For example the Westfall quest chain to bring VanCleef's head gives awesome blues that you won't replace for awhile so that would be a temporary BiS

You can train fist weapons, one-handed maces, and two-handed maces. It's worth mentioning that the stats on a weapon are much more important than the damage when you're a druid, since your animal forms don't use your weapon damage (they scale with your attack power).
---
^ this guy had his bad meme removed
---
Which class are you?
---
Warriors/Paladins can wear up to plate upon reaching level 40. (So they can wear plate, mail, leather and cloth) Restircted to mail and less before this.
---
Hunters and shamans can wear up to mail upon reaching level 40. Restricted to leather and below before this level.
---
Druids are restricted to leather and cloth along with rogues.
---
Mages/priests/warlocks are cloth only.
---
Normally main spec goes first, so for a spell power ring you would want as elemental, you will need to wait till all the mages and locks pass, then you compete for it against all the other shaman.
---
Is this title written in English?
---
This is my stop keybind, puts you in ready form, can cancel casts if they would be wasted, and if shift is held also warstomps as well.
---
`#showtooltip War Stomp(Racial)`

---
`/stopcasting`

`/cast [modifier:shift] War Stomp(Racial)`

It sucks but they literally tell you that they can and will stop or change transfers at any time.
---
Hey What's wrong with the trashbringer guild?
---
I've talked to Raziya a few times, good dude. He started using the Ravager on Kronos (where it was bugged because you could drop traps, use grenades etc while spinning) and continued on Light's hope. 
---
He only picked it up originally because he was rolling with a Druid tank and no Warrior/Pally needed in his group. The point is as Hunters, we should not be needing on stat less melee weapons over primarily melee classes. It's a completely different story if the melee in your group already have it, then by all means take it as you can find use in it for aoe rather than someone just greeding and vendoring it. 
---
Now if the melle weapon does have a primary stat for us such as Agility, crit or flat out AP then you can definitely need on with no justification required.
---
I know what you mean. I only had to yeet 1 person from my group so far, but already got like 10 on Ignore that will never get off it again.
---
Hunters should be banned for needing on these weapons. It‚Äôs clearly a warrior weapon. I think that Hunters should only be able to use polearm melee weapons.
---
I always /train
---
Nope
---
So, i'm out of the loop, what exactly is the patch and bans for, it's not for the raid dungeon thing right? Thought they patched that days ago. Is it for the aoe dungeon farming? Because i still see folks looking for that in LFG, do they just don't know about the bans then?
---
Reported, go back to your hole.
---
This is r/classic.

Blocked, rage if you want.

Depends highly on which class you're fighting against and what spec you're playing.

Are we going to get PvP mounts in one of the later phases? I remember my undead level 60 PvP twink in TBC had a wolf mount.

Ive been looking for one too.... I started to build my own rudimentary one but its very tedious
---
You forgot that the mage was int / phed immediately after the block nova. Thats half his health gone if generous.
---
Once he hits cs, hes hamstrung, about a gcd from death, and has a warrior on top of him. So he novad again, and the warrior phs again.
---
If the mage IBs, hell eat lethal damage when it ends. If he flickers IB, hell be phed again and wont be a safe distance when nova 2 ends.
---
Mage is in a very, very bad scenario here.
---
You can go to RFK at 30 for sure. There's a wide range of levels in that dungeon, so it's a little weird. There's trash that's mid 20's, but I think the final boss is lvl 35 so it may be a bit difficult. That said, as a shammy DPS I've been running it since lvl 28. Just gotta make sure most of the rest of the group is high enough :&gt;

It's just that it's never been an issue before now as far as I'm aware. Like it used to know to prioritize the living target over a loot pile. Also, I've always moved away to some extent, but it seems to always choose the corpse if it's within looting range.
---
Is there somewhere that lists what races can use what? I'm having trouble finding a resource. I remember tauren not being able to use raptors until tbc so curious how classic works
---
I meant using the master loot function to ninjaloot as a raid/party leader was not the intended function of master loot. I'm not saying there are not intended uses for master loot. Just that the way these people are using it is an exploit and they should be punished for using an exploit.
---
You seem to be underestimating how many hours a person can play in a month.
---
This is literally exactly what I have been doing with my newborn, works out pretty damn well!
---
I rolled a tank too so I know what tanking is like.  The repair costs are offset by the ability to insta spam dungeons constantly and you by default have the most leverage in the dungeon due to you leaving causing a problem for the group.  These are just excuses because you want to be greedy.  Instead of rationalizing it, just accept it, like the dicks who want to run reserved runs.

It wasn't instantaneous for me. I resubbed and immediately started playing and recieved the "starter account" messages when trying to trade. It was corrected within 24 hours.
---
Shaman is one of my favorite classes.  On retail I played different specs throughout the expansions.  Main'd Resto in WotLK, Enchance in Cata, Resto in MoP, Resto/Ele in Legion.
---
Does work rather well actually, there's quite a few PVE items which are itemized weirdly. Most notably, items such as the Aurastone Hammer (damage/healing 1h mace), Deep Earth Shoulderpads (nature only damage), and a few of the tier 1 pieces have spell damage/healing on it instead of raw healing.
---
When P3 comes around and we have access to BWL loot having access to Lok'amir il Romathis (84 spell damage!), itemization gets a lot easier.
---
If you enjoy playing shaman, play the hybrid. One of the best shamans I ever played with was resto for 5 days a week, and was ele on off-raid days for pvp with me. The best was when we had access to ZG trinkets and he was literally 1-shotting people in BWL/ZG gear.
---
They've circumvented it somehow because everyone in my guild has that option selected and we still get the channel invites.
---
Excellent idea.  I've already come across so many speed hackers.. and they move waaaayyyy faster than they could back in the day.  I can't even target them to report.  Luckily I think Blizzard has tools to audidetect movement in that manner.
---
But then again I'm sure if they can speedhack they can teleport through some walls.
---
I like how others get banned but not Esfand
---
At the end of the day if theres 6k people per layer in comparison to 6k people per server in vanilla, wouldnt there still be the same amount of resources per capita?
---
Making a health stone requires a soul shard.  So it requires casting a specific spell spell on an experience granting mob that gives xp.  It takes bag space to store those shards and they have other uses.  
---
Agree with you though that it is all about the timing.  Doing a dungeon run or boss, worth it otherwise probably not.
---
Also why passing out the waterbreathing buff can save lives!  Remember that warlocks.  You may be in the middle of the Shimmering Flats but that Warrior or Mage might be near a body of water in 10 minutes and you could save them a horrible death!
---
Both easily avoidable

When I tried out ClassicCodex it was missing a lot of quest data and it hasn't been updated in a month.
---
&gt;Currently there is no proper diminishing returns for a higher level (10+ levels) player grouping with lowbies and running dungeons
---
Yes there is. I ran SM Lib as a level 46 and two low levels got way less experience when I joined vs. when I didn't.
---
It's for farming dungeons by abusing the sharding system that blizzard added for classic. Aoe farming is just a part of the game. That's not an exploit like the sharding abuse is.
---
I've yet to see someone post proof of Asmongold doing this exploit
---
Don't let these initial numbers fool you. 
---
Rogues are fine
---
Warlocks are fine 
---
Mages are fine 
---
If you want initial success roll either a warrior or druid. Warriors dps does fine, tank is the best tank spec. Druid tank is underrated and honestly fun to level, healing is fine, balance is eh, and kitty actually has a comeback now that people know how to play it (thanks nostralius)

Don't let youtube influence your decisions.

The solution back in the day was guilds. They were necessary, unlike now.  Find dependable &amp; competent players, add them to your friends list, get in the habit of running with them, form a guild.

Pugging end game 5-mans is rolling the dice &amp; a very easy way to waste 2 hours of your time.
---
I think the organizers try to shoot for every two weeks on a Sunday, 9pm server time, people just start meeting up at 8:30 or a bit earlier to get some extra RP in.
---
And that's why people were banned for doing exactly this back in Vanilla yea? WPVP doesnt mean using exploits to avoid the game mechanics of neutral town guards. 
---
You wanna WPVP in a neutral town there are ways to without exploiting.
---
I hope you get the help you so desperately need.
---
There's a lotta stuff in Vanilla that's zero sum. If you kill that quest NPC, I'll have to sit here for like 5 minutes or so hoping for the next one. If you grab that resource node, I can't get it. 
---
Those are the times that I pvp. Randomly ganking someone on the road feels kinda dumb, but I'll gladly muster a fight over resources.
---
And then find out where he works and get him fired!
---
I've never exploited layering, but this is 100% Blizzard's fault for implementing a shitty system that the community flagged as ripe for all different kinds of abuse well before Classic even launched, yet Blizzard did nothing about it. Seriously, it's well documented for months leading up to launch, and Blizzard only took action after seeing streamers exploit on the beta. zzz.
---
Nope. At level 45 having done every possible quest (have some orange and red to do) I'm 2.5k into revered.
---
Man why you get so mad over nothing? How old are you? All I said was you were wrong because you said in a blanket statement that building that is wrong. You are just a very angry child no sense in trying to talk to ya. Have a good one.
---
Just be honest and tell the truth. Tell them that you're looking for a more active guild, and that whilst you enjoy their company, you're looking for more in a guild. The people you chat with will still be your in-game friends if you and they want to, so don't be scared for that. Leaving a nice guild is never fun, but ultimately the game is about **you** having fun, not staying to please others.
---
The only one crying here is you though lol

Exactly!

Back in Vanilla we had to take proof images with instant cameras and mail it to the guy, so we could collect our bounty

Quick question for anyone reading this. Is classic wow available if you had it already? Or do you have to repurchase it?
---
you can't patch out player behavior.
---
master looter is used legitimately for various reasons so straight removing it isn't a great solution. the problem isn't people using it, it's people trying to sneakily switch to it before bosses without people noticing.
---
I've never had any tank, so far, complain about not being topped off.
---
Should that day ever come, my response will be:  "Have you died yet?  No?, Then don't worry about it, I got you!"
---
In SC's case they were corrupted by Balnazzar
---
People are raiding specific bosses in dungeons by using layering.  Instead of having to reclear the dungeon, the boss will just response in front of them. 
---
People are doing using layers to repopulate raids and doing entire raids multiple times a week or certain bosses several times a night. 
---
There are reports of a guild where everyone has BiS gear already and insane amounts of gold.

Is there a way to stop tracking specific quests? Quests like Frostmaw just litter the map

Alright bro, thanks for your help!

That‚Äôs me right now in Classic, I also am sticking with the hunter
---
I know it was determined not to be possible by 40.  What about 60?

Hopefully esfand gets hit

---
Pretty sure pvp mounts are only from rank 11, which is fairly high. That's phase two I believe.
---
One thing I can recommend is if you haven‚Äôt already find yourself macros that force you into their required stances. For example:
---
 #showtooltip berserker rage
---
/cast berserker stance
---
/cast berserker rage
---
That may help relieve some mental stress to switch to appropriate stances and let you focus on performing whatever skills you want.
---
Shamans are middle of the pack or slightly below average levelers. That doesnt mean they aren't fun though, some highlights are that wind fury procs with a 2H and hits super hard, flame frost and earth shocks are all insanely good for open world pvp, and you'll be instant invited to heal dungeon cleave groups (horde seem to prefer melee cleave and alliance mage/warlock).
---
Comment available in Layer 3:B
---
I‚Äôm happy with this level of punishment. I still want to know how in the hell this exploit wasn‚Äôt identified in any internal testing. Seems to me if you challenged internal testers to beat the layering system it wouldn‚Äôt take them very long to try this exact method.
---
Yikes, that devilsaur set is gonna take ages to make! Still, a goal‚Äôs a goal
---
Bang on. I'm halfway through feralas at 45 having done the exact same thing as you, and I'm at 2.5/21k.
---
For the Brits here, I'm guessing that is the passenger seat in an American truck. Not the driver seat in a British truck. &lt;yikes&gt;
---
&gt; I see high profile streamers using it to their advantage
---
How do you guys upvote this. There's no VOD of any streamer doing this. Reddit is just a userbase of cattle.
---
As others have pointed out the pack right now, is still around level 30. (Run census on your server, you'll see the spike in population are 30-40 range)
---
And depending on what class you are, you can start a group.
---
Alternatively, make friends with people who are level 60. When you are looking to form a group, hit up your friends, they might know people also looking for that dungeon if they are not available.
---
We're still trying to forget BfA, thank-you-very-much.

There is no official place for server population statistics.  Only enlightened guesses at best.

If it helps, I died twice on the way anyway. Maybe he thought that was sufficient.

Loving modern israel and being a nazi are not mutually exclusive anymore, Netanyahu himself could be considered anti-semitic.

It‚Äôs better for a warrior to sunder instead of HS until you get WW at 36. So every warrior out there that is worth their salt will be sundering. You can argue slam is a slight improvement at 32 but sunder Arne will offer more consistent results.
---
BfA is bad, and always will be. Retail, however, can be saved.
---
there's absolutely nothing wrong with leveling as fire. aoe grinding is lame and it's comparable single target. It's also fine as end game pvp and pve. Play how you want to, most people just regurgitate what guides or streamers tell them
---
Lol! I get that, Mind Flay can get boring I suppose. I've killed a couple bobs and already doing MUCH better than when I was Disc. Maybe I can actually hit my guild's lvl deadline/competition! xD

I'm sure Reforged is going to be great
---
So then do you I think there's a correlation to the removal of the death penalty and the increase in shootings in the US?
---
Just saying. That's quite a decrease in consequence for bad behaviour.
---
I mean I owe in Canada if I evade paying my taxes I go to jail. But here's the catch if I can't afford to pay my taxes cuz I'm too poor then going to jail is actually a boon because now I have food and shelter and everything I need to survive along with education among many other amenities that some people who are poor can't even afford.
---
It's my best interest to just not pay my taxes and get placed in jail then to be homeless. 
---
Just so you know I absolutely agree with your statement, I'm just using it to make a bigger point in the world. I'm genuinely curious if you agree with these statements or if you believe the people behaving themselves only because there are consequences for bad behaviour is only a phenomenon that appears online and not in the real world.
---
No, but they can carry certain off-hand items.
---
You‚Äôre doing gods work son
---
There needs to be a slap on the wrist as well, a temporary ban is going to best deterrent to the hardcore players.
---
&gt; Personally, I disagree. That's the spirit of PvP, unfortunately. Fact is, as a horde player, it does nothing but benefit me for you to leave the server. Means I don't get ganked, I don't have to compete with alliance for mobs/bosses, I don't have to have faction war outside of SM, etc. That's a lot of the reason why I try to kill as many alliance as I humanly can.
---
Why even roll on a pvp server if your goal is to make it that you only find other horde in the world? How is that the nature of world pvp?
---
You do fit the alliance sterotype for the typical horde ganker though. Just out to kill and grief alliance and not after fun pvp bouts.
---
that is surely bait
---
What's your professions?
---
If you have skinning and cooking, you can go STV and grind high level tigers. Skin them and loot tiger meat. Then vendor the skins and create [Jungle Stew](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12231/recipe-jungle-stew) and vendor it.
---
The Jungle Stew turns around 1 silver worth of mats into 3 silver worth of vendoring.
---
Otherwise just vendor everything, be aware though that some greens just will not sell. So sometimes it's worth just vendoring it. Wands with agi/str? Yeah sell that shit
---
Light and Salvation are always the most important buffs.
---
I really like Salvation even as a healer. Why give that poor tank a heart attack each time the mage focuses the wrong target? Salvation him, problem solved. If he wants Wisdom or a Rogue wants Might, have them show that they can act like reasonable DDs. 
---
Later in the progression pretty much any DD wants salvation first simply because otherwise they would wait half the fight for the tank to get aggro.
---
Light is similar for heal paladins. It gives a massive flat bonus to all major paladin heals. I still have regular arguments with tanks that they rather want might. Trust me, I change it to might or kings if I see healing you is not an issue. But at the start you'll get light until I see that you bought and use shieldblock/disarm etc.
---
Other fun options including declawing over eager hunter pets and evening out groups. That 60 dps player in Maurodon will draw aggro vs. a lvl 50 tank if he isn't sleeping. Salvation will make this a lot more even.
---
She didn‚Äôt change her face tho only her boobs if I remember right
---
Lol, someone's salty
---
Thanks for taking the time to share your opinion without hostility! 
---
Cool! And I think that is so creative of you, I personally struggle with that kind of commitment. I prefer the list! But that's just me.
---
This will likely never be implemented, and so i am just curious to hear more opinions on it like yours!
---
Thank you internet stranger!
---
Guys, this is a meme. It was the HUMOR flair. Yes, shocking I know.
---
Don't take it seriously. I know Blizzard said "less likely". It's just a joke!
---
Spoof HWID, Reset modem,  done.
---
The two are so interlinked for me, I love them both!
---
If you're playing solo classic isn't the game for you
---
Moonglow is great for mana efficiency when you are literally doing nothing but spamming healing touches.
---
You go swiftmend early, for burst healing in dungeons as people's health bars are going to be very spikey, and encounters don't last too long. So being mana efficient isn't as important as staying alive.
---
Swiftmend is also pretty trash in raids, as A: having the spell power to make hots worth it is late BWL/AQ time frame B: hots DO NOT STACK (so 3 druids in raid, only 1 can have a hot running on someone at that time), and C: the mana costs are bonkers.
---
I think just the fact that you have plausible deniability means that you‚Äôll be fine. And after all, you didn‚Äôt benefit from it. 
---
It‚Äôs similar to the raid xp bug in a way. They couldn‚Äôt go banning people left right and center for that because it‚Äôs conceivable that people were abusing that bug without even realising it. 
---
But the guys exploiting this layer bug don‚Äôt have a leg to stand on. It‚Äôs not something you can claim to have done accidentally. Just cheating, pure and simple.
---
Probably being that on PvE servers, Allies outnumber Horde but a good margin, but on PvP servers the reverse is true.
---
There is no way to even PvP server ratios without giving some sort of benefit to rolling alliance.
---
Hahah, not sure I've got the artistic chops for a sexy Whitemane!   Thanks though :)

dude i know streamers have a bad rep around here but if you watch the clip they clearly had no idea what was going on and full cleared after they thought there was an early reset.

they even said they were gonna keep track of what drops in case it is an extra run so the items can get deleted, they were there to just finish up Rag.
---
You aren‚Äôt? You sure about that? People pug in retail and get heroic raids done that are way harder than MC...you don‚Äôt think once there are more 60‚Äôs you won‚Äôt be able to get a group and demolish MC? People are doing MC now with no fire resist gear...shit ain‚Äôt hard let‚Äôs just be real about it. The hardest thing will be getting 40 people together but I‚Äôm already being whispered to join PUGs so they‚Äôre happening.
---
I had always thought this was fake until I created a second account and ran some hacks.

Turns out it's real and they put you there because they don't have a graceful way to combat the hacks in a decent time frame.

Good. We were already kicking people out of our guild for using this, glad to see action is being taken.

That was how I found out about WoW. 12 year old me just got scammed for everything I owned in Runescape and I was watching G4 to cope with the pain.
---
&gt;what we know is true
---
I don't know if you and I just disagree with what a rumor is... but no, we do _not_ know it has been in development. Hell, at one point in time it was "rumored" that Obama was born in Kenya. Rumors are not truth.
---
Heretic!  
---
BURN HIM!
---
I don't mind giving people food and water but sometimes I get whispers or people asking the cringiest way ever.
---
That's mostly cause people didn't know how to play them. Most didn't till halfway  thru linch king
---
imo the way the game looks has a big impact on giving it the "classic" feel
---
I hate this girls smug look.
---
I'm on east coast and play on Smolderweb. It's been great so far, with no noticeable lag.
---
You said "Some of the Jews"
---
Since nobody responded to you, Scimitar actually has mechanical switches for the thumb buttons. Tho I tell the same thing with iCUE. It's crap, and my scimitars sensor went haywire about in 2ish years of almost daily usage, when my nagas sensor lasted for 1.5yrs tops.
---
You posted the same incorrect thing three times...
---
You forgot to mention the undead mages sending a frostbolt up my ass mid looting
---
I'd consider you getting 60 now still really fast. there will be a lot more people there in a month.
---
Thanks, I will certainly try!
---
Same here, I'm genuinely more annoyed at Blizzard than people exploiting this. I don't understand why people are just letting Blizz off the hook when they repeatedly warned this sort of thing would happen.
---
&gt; Quite often this will mean you have to travel and find the next thing to kill after healing so you'll get to 80-100 energy by the time you reach next mob anyway.
---
Can't tell you how often this is NOT the case, and how much time Furor has saved me soloing after picking it up. If I had to do it over, I'd grab Furor before Omen of Clarity.
---
you get what you deserve, collaborater.
---
Google it?
---
It's going to  be a while before there's enough wealth for people to start getting vanity items. If you are planning to stick around for the long haul I would just bank it for later.
---
Thanks, it's done with a watercolour brush in PS :)
---
Now that's just being an ass.
---
Close to 50/50?
---
what happens if you cheat on drunder? or is it basically a wild west server?
---
If they find an exploit to get them out of the jail THEN you perma their ass.
---
I think I saw a couple posts on wowhead about important gear choices at various level ranges
---
Wish I could have screenshotted it. When I was in IF I could do little else than walk around about 10,000 to 15,000. My raiding MS was always 800 to 1000, which is why I was the outta combat rezzer.
---
Grats!
---
I never played after Cata if that counts! Please m'lord. Spare my special days. I'll shine yer boots fer a copper!!
---
Thanks!   I'd love to do that, might take me a few years though &gt;&lt;
---
Nope. That's way different.
---
Well by the way factions are already balanced, it would seem logical that the faction that is most likely to dwindle will be the smaller faction, which will only make it worse for those who stay.
---
Your two comments gained more karma than 1 correct post would!!
---
I'm leveling a paladin and it feels like I could be doing so much more with my life....
---
And then the mage puts his baby rattle down to type /laugh at your corpse.

Plz get help.

Happy Opposite Day!
---
The guy wrote

&gt;Given the people vanilla exactly the way it was and was asked for
---
and this is simply impossible.
---
&gt;just release servers with the pop caps original servers had
---
Yeah, because that will surely prevent people from all wanting on the same server.
---
1000 years could be temporary. It's relatively. In video game, temporary is normally a couple of weeks at most.  
---
I expect this to last months.

Haha differences aside have fun friend

....They did report it though. Josh/Lore even came into Esfand's twitch channel and told them they could continue
---
[Here's the logs as proof](https://overrustlelogs.net/stalk?channel=esfandtv&amp;nick=devolore)
---
You'll have to kill a lot more than 1 in 10.

Might still be available to you in the shop!

pack it up. the game is ruined, everyone. back to retail.

Thanks, would definitely be a massive undertaking but I'm kinda keen!

Layering  being what it is..how was this exploit not forseen by Blizz
---
2nd for me, third fro my buddy
---
Find a guild and make friends.
---
why? it seemed clearly unintentional to me and he even kept track of the items that dropped.
---
they were there to finish up rag, if they didn't do the full clear they would have been screwed out of a week of rag drops so i get them wanting to clear it.
---
Turns out you shouldn't play 6 hours a day for three weeks straight
---
It's also worth pointing out it was a pretty fun experience, pulling half the dungeon and aoeing them down all at once in monster pulls was awesome.  
---
If anything I'm sad it was nerfed and won't be seen again, it was an awesome experience
---
Ah thanks so much, that's really nice of you to say.
---
Just /reload in chat every hour or so just to fix quest markers still there and fix completed quest markers not showing
---
&lt;Poopdick&gt; is recruiting all levels with a focus on raids, dungeons, wpvp, battlegrounds, leveling, and community. We are a mature (18+) guild looking to fill our raid team!

"Jump down turn around pick a bale of copper." It's right there in the song.
---
You are seriously surprised about that after rushing to 60?
---
Thank you so much
---
I'm no fan of streamers, but I watched this one last night and this statement is a gross misrepresentation of what happened.
---
They did it unintentionally, were seriously apprehensive about it, stalled for ages deliberating, reported it, tried to contact multiple people at Blizzard, eventually got the go ahead from TWO Blizzard employees and documented EVERYTHING.
---
I usually pay for water when Im asking a stranger. 1g for 2 stacks. I Think that‚Äôs reasonable

I have the same mouse. God it took time to get used to but oh my god. 24 buttons on the side that you can assign to actions bars. Beautiful.

For those wondering, Logitech G600. Works very well. Worth it. Don't buy the razer one, it's the same just overpriced.

Hate on Asmon on this sub is insane
---
If your server has a queue, you should still be able to transfer for free.

Felhunter spell lock polymorph + devour magic to dispel if didn't spell lock in time.

At this point whatever you subscribed for, is what your paying for.

I don't play retail, I play classic, which means I'm subbing for classic.
---
To me, it is exactly equivalent to the junk mail that clogs up my mails and the telemarketers that clog up my phone line. It's not the end of the world, but it is annoying and worthy of my disdain.
---
You want to advertise your guild? There are places to do that. Don't tug on my sleeve.
---
They should also be branded with a permanent buff. Like a big ‚ÄúC‚Äù floating over their head or something, similar to how they used to brand pirates.
---
Glider, while a cheat I dont condone, was really good at what it did. Stupid fully featured.
---
I use pen and paper, then add colour in photoshop.   Thanks!
---
No thanks. Achievements set artificial parameters saying whether or not you've accomplished some task. It devalues the intrinsic accomplishment you've made.
---
Make your own list of things you've done if this is what you desire. 90% of player interaction and personal fun in Classic is making up your own stuff and dictating the game by yourself out of necessity because the game doesn't hold your hand. Achievements for the sake of seeing what you've done is hand-holding.
---
I didn't spend 90g on 16 slot bags because it would ping an achievement saying I did so, I did it because full 16 slot inventory made me feel good. Same thing with riding mounts, same thing with dinging 60.
---
Achieve things because it makes you happy, not because you need some bs system telling you that you did a good job.
---
I sympathize. I did that years ago, window popped up, was told to "roll", so I hit the dice.  
---
On a chest note- was running Deadmines, had just done Smite and I see "player rolls XX 1-100"- took me a sec to realize it was the warlock being polite and rolling for Smite's chest...
---
If you have an active retail sub you can play classic at no additional charge. In the launcher there‚Äôs a drop down to choose which version you want to play
---
/use !Auto Shot
---
When I originally wrote it I put two weeks initially.
---
Don't call your brother a skinner that's rude
---
No it specifically says otherwise I even quoted it in the original comment.
---
"Should a raid commence under a specific looting system (i.e. Group Loot), and the Raid Leader later swap to a different looting method mid-raid (i.e. Master Looter), this is a direct change to the looting expectations set beforehand. A Raid Leader taking such actions would be considered to have breached the prior arrangement, and any items unfairly distributed in such a situation would constitute a scam case."
---
I don't disagree with you. Without enough evidence of how much the exploit was abused (we only know of some of the players), we can only guess.  
---
However, I'm looking at the worst case scenario, because if they were organised enough to do this, they'd go the most profitable route.
---
Wow has always hated streamers, all the way back to reckful being banned you can see forum posts celebrating it.
---
For classic wow it‚Äôs because someone clipped sodapoppin a large wow streamer out of context saying how it‚Äôs hard to stream classic because you can get ganked and there could be some system if everyone was trustworthy where you could blacklist actual streamsnipers that go out of their way to watch streams and grief streamers (not casual gankers that kill him as a regular wpvp player would) so that people wouldn‚Äôt group with them.
---
It got spun on this subreddit as an entitled streamer thinking he owns the whole server and thinking he has enough power to blacklist someone from playing in groups. In reality he was just spitballing hypothetical shit and said it was a dumb idea because you don‚Äôt know who is casually ganking like a normal play and who is watching stream to streamsnipe with an unfair advantage.
---
That's literally the singular core point of a bounty system.
---
Alright thanks. I‚Äôll give that a shot tonight when I get home! Hopefully the horde aren‚Äôt too gank happy tonight
---
Yeah, I deleted it because people were missing the point and hating on all mages/aoe farmers, and many were getting pissed at me because they thought I was hating on all of them, which wasn't my intention. I was talking about 4-5 specific people I encountered, and 
---
 was curious to see if others had similar experiences, not hating  the entire population of a class. There are many AoE farmers who are completely fine - in fact, the vast majority probably are.
---
You know this was possible in original classic right?
---
As a warrior tank, I will tell you right now that the warrior they swapped you out for would have the same problems. Warriors don't have magic tanking buttons that make stupid DPS smart!
---
It sounds like you've got your priorities in order (keep the healer safe first, then the clothies, then the melee, if necessary). So just keep on keeping on.
---
Listen - you have hundreds of thousands of people going at something they are going to find bugs that slipped past hundreds of testers. Testers aren't going to stumble on this because they aren't going to have one person drop from the group. They are going to go in together and finish together because it is, quite literally, their job. I'm not surprised by this at all.
---
What legit scares the fuck outta me is last night a guildie was all, "Hey can anyone invite me to their group? I ran out of dungeon resets and I wanna try something." I was all, "Sure." And while hes doing whatever he's doing he goes, "I'm gonna log on my alt and /w you when I do can you reset the dungeon." I didn't even think twice and told him okay. Soon as he comes back on his main I start asking him what hes doing and he gets all cryptic and doesn't really answer. Big part of me thinks he was doing some shit like this. God I hope I don't get banned for helping his dumb ass.
---
Fear is the mind killer
---
Really? Ive encountered the Horde a few times and mages just freeze me and then 2 shot me.
---
Rogues just appear out of nowhere. 
---
And hunters kite me around,
---
The only class i can seem to evenly match with is warrior.
---
Maybe i just need practice
---
Yes, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Only keep the ‚Äúfun, simple‚Äù achievements. Not the ‚ÄúBeat this raid on top difficulty 10 times‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have the best gear‚Äù type ones.
---
In vanilla they'd sell for around 700-1000g. But even if anyone had barely any gold right now, cosmetic pets are always a tough sell. They can be on the AH for a month or a year sometimes.
---
Love this area, glad you made good use of it.
---
This is a classic wow piper perri
---
If they were new and honestly did a mistake wouldn‚Äôt they just roll and trade the item back to the winner? If not I see no reason not to blacklist em. How can u defend something that clearly can‚Äôt be a mistake..
---
also would like to know
---
People who duped items and exploited were banned since day 1 of launch in 2004. I don't see how this is any different than other hacks other than "lol layering". They deserve a simple account ban if they benefit from exploits
---
After getting my mount last night, I rode around and rounded up a bunch of murlocs. After having a nice little assortment, I was lucky enough (as I was hoping) to have it proc right away, then proceed to mow down a dozen or do murlocs. It was fantastic.
---
Note that you don't need to stop pet attack if you just want a shard, only if you want the mana regen from improved drain soul to proc
---
Question... you can sell pets???
---
you must be on a low pop server. my chat is filled with high end dungeon groups on stalagg
---
Engineering is BIS for PVP. Beyond that the toys are lackluster, beyond bombs for massive AOE pulls in BWL/AQ.

Yea once you stop caring how fast you hit 60 it becomes a lot easier to handle the idea of a reroll, but yea I wasn't thrilled with the idea at first.

Is that question? I dont have the GPS arrow on mine.

Good

Fuck RP realms!  They said Uncatchable wasnt RP enough for a resto druid in TBC.  BITCH I ran around pillars throwing HoTs on myself.  That name was the MOST RP NAME I could have.
---
Yes that is a summoning in the background to save us.
---
I rarely downvote a post. I think i've now downvoted a grand total of maybe 30 comments on reddit, and i've been on reddit a good 3 years now. (nevermind what my cake day says). You sir, are my 31st downvote! Congratulations! 
---
Congratulations on being so weirdly conservative with upvotes and announcing in a way that literally none cares.
---
That's just like using a fan to press buttons so you're not logged out. It doesn't matter if you're automating using software or hardware. Automating the game in any way is forbidden. Multiboxing is a little bit different, but you could make the argument that it's also automating your characters and therefore similar to botting.
---
Word yeah you'll fly. Keep all your old gear for a healing set, cause the shadow set ain't got SHIT for stats
---
Do you think this is the first time it's been asked? It been asked for 15 years... At some point you gotta take the hint..
---
Dungeons are raids now?
---
Again, I actually don't know what you were expecting. ANYBODY who has played WoW in the past on a PvP server knows that corpse camping and ganking are par for the course. That's true universally, completely regardless of the xpac you played on. I remember being killed hundreds of times trying to get through the dark portal in BC. That's just how it goes, it's the nature of the game.
---
If you don't like that, then instanced PvP is probably more your speed. Nothing wrong with that, but if you want fair fights that is where you are going to find them. Fair is the antithesis of WPvP, and Blizzard will never change that. I haven't played retail in years, but I am willing to bet that is probably still the case to this day.
---
North-western part of swamp of sorrows there is a cave and hills on the side. it's a fairly easy ride with little to no difficult jumps. Funny because I did the exact same.
---
Omfg blizzard , OMFG
---
Is that legit what happens if you get the right angle with shadow wands? Guessing it doesn't apply to others?
---
Too*
---
The extra loot got deleted, so they didn't benefit from the bug.
---
It will ruin the experience, if you want those features feel free to enjoy them in retail.
---
Never said discord either. Said subreddit. And if the people on the subreddit are so quick to blacklist/ban off of one post then Im doing the (accused) ninja in the post a favor to avoid people who are so judgmental. 
---
Ok guy?
---
Yep! A lot of the more complex macros are lua

That's a green my dude

What class would Link be in WoW?
---
Nah, requires deposit on creation.  If you don't have the money you can't make the bounty.
---
Really surprised somebody responded nearly a month later - Thank you sir
---
That would be cool. Remote areas of the world have a vendor that sells an idea only they sell. And it‚Äôs either BoE or you can only buy one, that way people can‚Äôt just sell them on the auction house.
---
He's answering a question in his chat on what layering in dungeons is. He's one of the most informative WoW Classic streamers there is. He also farmed Gnomer before and after that clip normally. He also showed what layering outside of an dungeon looks like to explain it to his viewers that asked.
---
You don't understand anything. You misrepresent everything I say and add your own fantasy context each and every post. You are a bigot, by definition. I've given up on helping you. Hope your life works out, but you could have been so much more.
---
&gt;  spirit and strength (and largely stamina) are pretty useless as a hunter.
---
He was in Deadmines. That means that spirit and stamina will be useful for the next 40 levels. Agree that they're not great at 60 though.
---
I don't know the full story, but i was led to believe in their clips of it they are confused on voice as to what is happening. Maybe it was unintentional but once they saw it happened they switched to exploiting it?
---
We did this and the other guild just kept layer hopping. Super infuriating.
---
i saw a rend farm group lfm with reed, trustrike, dal's and carapace all on reserve.  thats literally every piece of gear in the run you retail cockroaches lol
---
IIRC, when you reset an instance it respawned everything with the same loot table, so you can't really farm bis loot to gear yourself that way. You just get the same drops over and over.
---
"large scale conflict that feels meaningful" I'm sorry what? A) you get no PvP rewards in the game right now, b) BGs aren't in game yet (are they even going to be cross realm?) c) there's zero conflict if it's 5 horde vs 1 alliance, it's steamrolling. No amount of skill or cooldown management will let you take on 5 enemy players at once and walk away. How is any of this meaningful? If you just enjoy griefing people, just say so. But don't pretend that it's alliance QQing about world PvP. I have no problem getting attacked out in the open, even by 3 other players. But when I can't even switch zones to level because there are literally 50 horde players in every contested zone on the server &amp; I'm forced to grind instances so I don't get corpse camped - that's not world PvP, thats making it so the other faction can barely play the game.
---
Is esfand banned ?
---
This would just hurt the rest of the guild he had no part in any of it. Thus causing more victims
---
I guess that's just to prevent people from bothering customer service.
---
I subscribed on a second account while in queue on the first day for Faerlina and my second account got access instantly.  Also, WoW Classic can't be accessed with a starter account and can't ever have restrictions because of that.
---
Then do you need on everything? Cause it‚Äôs all worth gold?
---
i.e. Hunters are hard, contrary to popular belief cause bag space?
---
What if I just used it myself and got to feel the satisfaction of having a rare pet and the dread of giving up half a mount?
---
No, you are fine. Changing layers itself is not really an exploit, but doing it rapidly or while in dungeons is.
---
Lmao, you bootlickers are hilarous.
---
BC and Wrath set up a lot of system's that IMO were super harmful to the game long term, but since they were relatively new their effects hadn't corroded the game yet.
---
Flying, achievements, heirlooms, dungeon finder.
---
Flying KILLED the world aspect. Outlands got a bit of a pass as many of the zones were designed around flying. But the world-feel is definitely tarnished compared to Vanilla.
---
Achievements ended up being pre-requisites and an anxiety fueled nightmare. I've never felt worse in WoW than feeling inadequate because I didn't have my Gladiator/2700 3s achievements, and when I finally got them it didn't make up for the years of feeling lesser because I didn't have them. Not to mention how hard it is to get invited to something with good players without the proper certification via achievements.
---
Heirlooms devalued the leveling process.
---
And then I shouldn't even have to explain how shitty dungeon finder is.
---
It's basically just a normal pvp server with more community events and seeing the occasional rp in towns or waiting for the boat. You don't have to RP at all as long as you're respectful of others.
---
Yes congratulations thats the point...
---
Straight up said the same thing and took an identifier screen shot to my buddies on discord last night haha
---
Asmon didn't exploit and neither did esfand.  Take your anti streamer bs somewhere else
---
I feel dazed already.
---
Yea, we know
---
Assuming it‚Äôs the layering exploit you‚Äôre asking about. Players could abuse layering to reset the dungeon boss and farm it repeatedly without farming trash. 
---
It only works/worked in dungeons, not raids. Handy for farming rare recipes, items and pre-raid bis.
---
As a warrior tank I can attest to that.  So many dps have no idea about threat I guess.  They feel if they don't start aoe the moment you pull it's the end of the world or something.  As a warrior, I need a second or two to get things going and hold the mobs.  I charge in hit berserker so I build that rage from getting hit so I can slam, sunder, revenge around the group.  Right away is just a demo and maybe a battle shout so if dps starts right away most of those mobs get pulled off wasting berserker where I needed to get hit by them all to have the rage to sunder or do anything outside of a single taunt to pull one back then lose it again because hey,  I still don't have rage because I'm chasing every god damn mob that got pulled off me.  There are multiple dps I try to explain this concept to just to give me a few seconds.  They might give me time in the next pull and i hold everything no problem and it's smooth then the very next pull it's back to a shit show.  So yeah, definitely dps out there i definitely won't tank for anymore.  Lots of idiots running around at the moment.
---
The game isn't new.
---
Layering is, however, and there are clearly issues that they still need to work through.
---
Fiver says you were abusing this exploit, are now shitting bricks about potentially getting a suspension, and are now clutching at straws trying to find any sort of justification for it.
---
&gt; If your claim was true, then you'd be able to take a group of 5 DPS, with average gear for that level/dungeon, and clear those dungeons faster than Tank/Healer group without using any consumables (because you claim it's more efficient, and burning through consumables isn't efficient).
---
It is true, it's how I've caught up to all my friends this weekend by grinding with DPS heavy groups. We plow.
---
so that would be a way to increase my holy nova I guess
---
Good!
---
Haha nice. Thanks for this
---
So long you sad fucks.
---
Blind guild invites are the second most annoying invites for me.
---
The most annoying are the recent uptick in chat channel invites whose titles are advertisements for gold-seller websites.
---
Blacksmith hammer can‚Äôt break
---
Pet peeve
---
My reason is unique. Way back when AV was first released the only thing gnome mages would do is bounce around casting arcane explosion, which actually was pretty damn effective. I called them popcorn mages. They were always gnomes too and you could never click on the little suckers.
---
You dont happen to be on Zandalar Tribe EU do you?
---
This was a thing.  They wanted to know that if they were leading a group where everyone knew wtf they were doing, thus ‚Äúlink achieve‚Äù that you‚Äôve completed the raid before.
---
I've done way worse stuff than this and am still playing. Take away items take away gold and give em a month suspension that's fair.
---
Last time I went there I killed a bear that a hunter was taming
---
I think it'd be a bit foolish to take anything pre WC3 seriously.
---
It‚Äôs crazy to think someone looked at this post and thought ‚ÄúHe left his kid on fire!?!?
---
I don‚Äôt even have a kid.
---
Seriously.
---
I'm staying guildless until 60 because I want to find a guild with a raid schedule that works for me. No, I don't want to join your casual meme guild, especially not if it's a guild that cold-whispers random people and invites anyone.
---
Oh, just sell whatever is in your bags.  FYI - gray items are vendor trash for you to sell, white can be useful, but I sell most of them like teeth, claws, etc. green items are "uncommon" and generally sell better on the AH, but you're not guaranteed so use your judgement if you want to sell them to the vendor or not.
---
Whatever you think about Achievements or Guild buffs or emotes not changing the world, it's just wrong. They change how people interact and how the game and its chat behave. They are unneeded clutter that change the culture around the game. It's gonna be a no from me, dog.
---
Your a harry wizard
---
tru
---
Why is this an image and not text?
---
No problem! It really does make a big difference in aesthetics
---
Grob Mobbbbbb
---
Proof that this is real, OP?  Got any?
---
Yeah, I didnt use it, but I find it hard to blame people for not knowing this was a bug. After all we only had wonky memories and faulty private servers to compare to.
---
But we're not moving while feigning, we're moving before we feign.
---
The situations you are describing are fundamentally different than a multiboxing/kvm setup. When scripting/botting/using a mechanical pressing device, you set up your system, and then it sends keypresses to the game with minimal further input from you.
---
In a multiboxing setup, any keypress that reaches a game client was directly pressed by you.
---
Oh tamhat brings me back. There was one map I caverns of time that was a swamp land and mob waves would spawn from different parts.

Everyone would just hop from one to the next but I had to swim through the swamp water.

Hi, /u/Guardbro
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d57ogq/batwing_mantle_and_channelers_staff_on_a_hunter/). 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not the point. Also how come some people are allowed to talk about ‚ÄúClassic +‚Äù and get all kinds of support. But if I just spitball a few ideas I get shunned? Classic/Vanilla is amazing, but you can‚Äôt deny that there are a few things that even then needed fixing, things they implemented later that did improve that area. 
---
If you notice I‚Äôm not suggesting they increase drop rates, or add f-ing LFG. I just would like to play an Arcane Mage or a Balance Druid without it inherently being crap. The fact that these specs were so poorly performing when the game was released is an issue. I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt fix it. I‚Äôm not asking for top damage in a raid. I just want to be feasibly able to level at least a fraction more than they are able to now.
---
I have to imagine Highway Patrol would have some choice words for you if they saw you with a video game up on a monitor while driving.
---
You also don‚Äôt need pre raid bis gear to do Ony/MC.

possibly. i'll wait for $20 though.

What addon are you using for the text on the side of your character?

Absolutely this!

The onerous and time-consuming nature of Classic Wow is, by design, meant to encourage socialization, mutual-dependability, and engagement with the broader world. 
---
The limitations of flight paths and the lack of flying mounts means that the world feels *lived in*. High level characters may very well traverse through low-level zones just to get somewhere. Ships and Zeppelins require the player to remain tabbed in, but not actually doing anything, in a confined space with other players; the perfect space for spontaneous social interaction. 
---
Professions require more materials from other professions, and even limitations like the lack of enchanting vellum necessitates actual face-to-face (in-game, of course) interaction. 
---
Guilds exist exclusively to facilitate social interaction. There are no guild-exclusive mechanics; no bonus xp, rezzes, income, etc. There doesn't need to be. Whereas in modern WoW where everything is done automatically or independently, there NEEDS to be mechanical incentives to force people into guilds. 
---
Retail has trended more and more to emphasizing gameplay and mechanical acuity above all else; if the GAME is found in the GAMEPLAY, then anything which distracts from that is a "quality-of-life" flaw which must be excised. Thus, many differing raid tiers, auto-group finders, flying mounts everywhere at very high speeds, cheap and extensive teleportation, etc. 
---
It's a completely different way of approaching game design.
---
This is why I am re-rolling on a pvp server. I had my doubts when my friends wanted to play on a pve server. We made it to Hillsbrad to quest the other day and every single person is just going about their business. I don't need it to be a gank fest but some war in my Warcraft would be nice. Glad you had fun!
---
Expansions. Legion visits that area for some class legendary weapons.
---
That's actually the whole point. I report them so children don't have to see homophobic and racist names in a video game.
---
It really baffles me that people find this hard to understand.  
---
Would you want your children being exposed to that kind of filth?
---
Just leave the other set in your bank. Especially once you get to 30s and 40s some of the major hubs you'll be in have a bank (e.g. Gadgetzan), so it's pretty convenient to just swap the sets out when needed
---
Underlords is actually a good game tho
---
And it's free
---
Classic is about utility, not dps. Wa4lock will always do less than rogues or mages for example. You have a summon though. If you are alliance, that summon will get you scarlet monestary groups for sure. You can also off tank with voidy if needed,  and your dots are an advantage when fighting mobs 3+ lvls higher than you.
---
Even people who aren't ninjas BECOME ninjas when they see those dollar signs. Everyone needing as a standard prevents anyone from ninjaing it, whoever wins it did so fair and square
---
Nice job missing the point. Transmog is in retail. There will never be and should never be transmog in Classic. Back in the days, level 60 gear's look counted. 
---
If you want everything handed to you and quality of life and things like that, there is retail for that. Now hope it clarifies.
---
esfand did nothing wrong.
---
yeah but we need to wait for more information, im pretty sure some people got longers bans.  
---
Good to know they deleted the items
---
Do you also enjoy using soulstone on yourself... Like.... every... other... warlock....?
---
I rolled a rogue alt and really really enjoyed it at first.
---
Then I started seeing dodge - parry - block so much (even with weapon skills up) and only sap to handle multiple mobs and I dunno now.
---
Does this get better or worse with levels?
---
Did you just click the mount buff icon to dismount?
---
Your daughter makes the world a better place.
---
I have all my achievements lined up in a document.
---
complete T1, complete t2, complete t3, Sulfuras, BiS meme spec (Seal of Reckoning) armour,  complete MC, complete BWL, complete ZG, complete AQ20, complete AQ40, Complete Naxx, Paladin epic mount, titanic leggings recipe, Lionheart helm recipe.  It goes on, but these are the main ones.
---
Damn. How bad do you have to abuse layering to get a year suspension?
---
Sometimes, heroes don‚Äôt wear..
---
It's all fair game except for weapons imo. If a great hunter bow drops but a rogue wants it as a stat stick, it should go to the hunter. Vice versa for melee weapons.
---
In the case of that ring I think it's questionable if a rogue rolls on it solely for the +2 agi, even if he has no ring. But anyone who can make use of the majority stat (int) has a fair claim, and a hunter uses both stats!
---
Im pretty sure some people got more than 1 month, we are going to see some spicy posts here and in the forum hahaha
---
Im a wow playing truck driver and you are seeing the wow part not the truck driving part. I dont even try to game on the road because i work so many hours there is no point trying to play when i still need to shower and get to sleep.
---
Cant wait to see Soda, Nick, Fyz, Svenoss &amp; Aether banned then... oh wait
---
Just charge an absurd amount if busy.
---
Wow, that's votta be the first gaming trucker I've ever witnessed in the 2 years I've worked in a semi shop... every trucker I see is gross and uninteresting. Your cab actually looks clean and I would love to see what your truck looks like! All of our drivers are incapable of being neat and clean. It's horrifying.
---
Even though I sort of agree, it's pretty unrealistic to expect them to catch every possible exploit of a new system they developed just for Classic. Stumbling into this exploit once is understandable, but damn right you should be thoroughly punished for repeatedly doing it.
---
Well technically it is an item that summons the pet, and unless that item has been used it can still be sold
---
Damn can‚Äôt believe i missed this yesterday!!!
---
No you just seem to be the type of snowflake to message a GM because you got corpse camped. This is no different. The time you take to deal with a GM, taking screenshots, uploading them, etc, you could‚Äôve ran another instance
---
Abusers in a WoW Discord I'm in are losing it. So funny seeing people who obviously did it saying "wow that's unfair, it should be like a 24hr ban and they should keep items but I totally didn't do it I swear" haha
---
No thank you, the game is perfect as it is.
---
Whay is that monitor arm attached to? :0
---
Hi, there's an update (v1.0.0) which fixes the "no player..." bug :)
---
Oh yeah. This is the guy who showed up to our big 5+ raid group PVP last Saturday and was *appalled* that we didn't allow his guild into our coalition after meeting and watching him deploy his mostly lvl 30-35 "army" into a swarm of guards and wipe themselves. The rest of us stood outside of their radius and waited for em to die, then moved on like they weren't even there.
---
Same with earthfury! New servers gotta love one another
---
Practice and higher level abilities I'd say
---
a lot of healers go enchanting, nothing unusual about that. 
---
unless you mean enhance, which ench is not short for
---
Thank you, I see everyone talking about them and it seems to make the rotations that much easier, like macro the auto attack to sinister strike so I don‚Äôt have to have the auto attack bound to anything :D happy days. Thank you!!
---
It‚Äôs 50/50 on both...
---
Yeah I was about to say my complaint is I have a hard time making an alt because everyone is 60. It's harder to find groups for anything that isn't BRD, etc.
---
 Your ticket has received the following response:  
---
*Greetings,*  
---
*Thank you for contacting us today.*  
---
*I understand you're concerned about the functionality of the Infernal summon, mainly that it was changed from how it was back around vanilla times vs how it is currently in Wow classic.*  
---
*Contacting a dev isn't something you can really do via this channel, the best way to reach them is honestly twitter, they often keep an eye on things there and in the forums, but I cannot promise they will be able to reply, still, give it a shot and hope for the best. I did however look into the bug report we submitted and good news, it is actually getting eyes on it as I send this, they've done some testing and should hopefully update the not a bug list with some info.*  
---
*Now regarding the Infernal itself, I dug into it and here is what I found. Going back to Wowpedia, they do a good job of tracking patch changes:* [*https://wow.gamepedia.com/Inferno\_(warlock\_ability)*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Inferno_(warlock_ability)) *there is a call-out for 1.5.0 where it does mention that after the enslave runs out, it will target the summoner, this is intended behaviour.*  
---
*The aura you're looking for is "Demonic Immolation" you can actually go here for the info:* [*https://wow.gamepedia.com/Immolation*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Immolation) *So they do have the aura, but it is activated on damage taken. Since on breaking enslave it targets the warlock, in theory if you attack it, and it pulses it can hit and aggro guards and others.*  
---
*Here is an example I found online of this,* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWGKVPQ2LZ8*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWGKVPQ2LZ8) *actually found it in a similar thread to yours:* [*https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/warlock-inferno-infernal-not-working-as-intended/288062*](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/warlock-inferno-infernal-not-working-as-intended/288062) *. However that video essentially confirms how it is intended to work, minus one small caveat I will explain further down.*  
---
*Actually, I believe the behaviour also matches what you see in the video you shared from what appears to be a private server. Though I am not sure how accurate it is since after all private servers weren't fully accurate either. But note at the end when the night elf is tanking it, the aoe only hits folks who aggroed by helping the nelf or attacking the Infernal.*  
---
*Now back to the video I shared, notice the Infernal only aggroes the guards (because of the aoe pulse), pvp players (green name not blue) and players who attack it or in some way generate threat with it (healing the warlock). It ignores players who ignore it, and then eventually returns to the summoned spot and moves around a bit and then eventually leaves after about 5 to 10 secs with no target. This is why the warlock in the video soulstones himself, revives and then doesn't attack the Infernal again, to avoid being killed. It's combat behaviour is accurate to Vanilla, it only attacks pvp targets, guards, pvp flagged players, and like any creature it attacks anything that generates threat on it, either by attacking it, or healing something that threatened it.*  
---
*Turns out that is the only different right now in Wow Classic, and the caveat I mentioned, is when it runs out of hostile targets to attack, it doesn't run back to its spawn then patrol around then despawn. It runs back but then just stands still at the spawn location then despawns, same duration as before too, 5 to 10 seconds. That is the only difference now versus back in actual vanilla wow, and it is being looked into to see if we can make him walk around a bit again. Reading over that post I found the video in the player Jespari seems to realize this as well and tries to explain it to everyone.*  
---
*Hopefully this clarifies the situation and how it seems to be working as intended minus the patrolling.*  
---
*Thank you for contacting us about this and let me know if you need a hand with anything else. \^\_\^v*

To explain:  
---
The first macro will Auto-Swap your MH and OH -- If you're LEVELING as a combat rogue this will help you with a Sword/Dagger loadout, allowing you to hit the macro to swap your Dagger to MH (For Ambush), as well as pickpocket the target.  
---
And the 2nd and 3rd Macros are just QoL macros for applying poisons.  
---
Also, a good macro just for running and leveling (That I had for a while bound to my scroll wheel) would be.  
---
(On alt scroll up)  
---
\#showtooltip Meteor Shard  
---
/equipslot 16 Meteor Shard
---
/equipslot 17 Outlaw Sabre  
---
and   
---
\#showtooltip Outlaw Sabre  
---
/equipslot 16 Outlaw Sabre
---
/equipslot 17 Meteor Shard  
---
Those two are just basic weapon swap macros, but you could also just have the first listed macro in the pic on your bars, it wouldn't ambush or pickpocket obviously but still doubles as a weapon swap
---
It would be cool but popular streamers would just get hunter 24/7
---
Which server are you on? I see it all the time on Incendius.
---
K, thx
---
You're right, there's no multiple rejuvs as the highest rank will overwrite
---
Yeah, they're wrong. You save so much time casting damage spells that would otherwise be spent stealthing around and trying to split up mobs without body pulling adds. You just have to have nimble fingers on the hotkeys for it to work, so maybe the average person who needs a guide to tell them how to play is better off without shifting.
---
I don't know why, but i thought that SF was a dot, when i  learned it for the first time. "Oh, million second cast dot, that should be huuuge, lets test it at bg" so i joined warsong and was trying to land it, but either i was dead, or the target moved too far away, or any other reason, but i can't land it for a long time. And then i saw him. Some little gnome running in circles in the middle. I did some hiding in bushes (didn't know about nameplates) and started casting. Gnome was involved in fight with someone else and lost a bit of his hp. Cast bar almost full. Heart is beating like a madman.  FUCKING HUGE BALL OF FIRE rushing to that poor fella and BOOM 600 smth damage, gnome is dead, i'm shocked.
---
Damn, that was nice
---
Up to 11 hours driving + non driving stuff on top of that.
---
So paladins are easy cause they can heal and rogues are easy cause rotation. Every class is easy for one reason or another. You're talking about the skill floor. It's pretty widely known among the mmo community that pet classes have the strongest mechanic for soloing. Nothing makes life easier than a pet. Not even having heals or an easy rotation.
---
So do you hire lot lizards to level you as you work?
---
That my friend is an achievement within itself! Glory to you
---
lips
---
I am ok with this.
---
Goddamn dude you talk so much but say so little.
---
Korell?
---
#IJustWantedToReplyWithAHashtag
---
Tanking
---
No dungeon is impossible to heal on any healer.  Some classes make it easier yes. But they are all very possible and easy. The main difference between the two is meters and utility. 
---
Meters-wise  Priests reign supreme until the Pally gets geared.
---
Utility-wise Druids and Shamens have the most active raid utility of all healers. So this breaks the monotony of healing up a little bit.  (Bres, Innervate, Totems etc.)
---
!RemindMe 3 days
---
everytime i read "i cant believe blizz lets ppl get away with this...sickening!" i cant help but think youre a child
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs not true. Just by leaving a dungeon and resetting it, you get an entirely different loot table. I would assume the same mechanics are in effect for layering to a ‚Äúnew‚Äù dungeon
---
I picked resto shaman for classic, because Ive never healed in WoW before. Im having a blast! Im lvl 43 now and so far leveling/questing has been very easy. The spirit wolf was a nice stepping stone towards the mount. Shaman has many more nice utility skills that come in handy from time to time, like water breathing and water walking.
---
But resto shines in dungeons, with all the totems and great heals. Most people talk about wind fury totem. But I had a great time today in razorfen downs with a group consisting of a bear tank, 2 warlocks and a mage. No windfury, instead I got to use my strength and agility totems. Also the disease and poison cure totems. Its just fun to have so much utility and to be creative with all those totems.
---
The Shaman quests are falvorful as you unlock each elemental totem every few levels. The wind totem was a bit of a let down though, I wish it had a longer quest like the others.
---
Especially after lvl 40 Shamans are very flexible in their equip, as they can basically wear any armor and they can use a wide variety of weapons. For a while I used dagger and shield. Currently I have a hammer and shield for questing, and hammer and off-hand staff for dungeons.
---
I give Shaman 9/10. I dont regret rolling resto Shaman at all. I think its the best thing I coulve chosen.
---
This was my spot for a while, but what really worked was the wind mill by the beach. Lots of spawns only saw 2 ally in the time it took.
---
What?
---
Was trying to figure where I heard this! Cancer for cure is one of my favorite albums
---
I just accept the invite and megaspam guild chat until I get kicked
---
Buddy, I‚Äôm level 23 if I was cheating I wouldn‚Äôt be that low. I‚Äôm just not stupid and can realize the difference. Lmao you look like a fool
---
When I was writing it , it became really weird with how it was writing and it was hard to tell where macros stopped and where I started the next one
---
&gt; Yes but that is leveling and in phase 2 my guild is done leveling. We are just going to be in safe areas in town and only leave for the world as a raid to farm honor
---
I'm sure you can imagine that most people don't want to be confined to cities with their only world interaction being in PvP squads.
---
I mean yeah, if you ignore everything I said then I bet there is pretty little substance in it
---
Greeting Roy, we‚Äôve got some bad news
---
Ur welcome
---
You should build a group man dungeons easy.
---
That one really got me back in the day because Neeru said something like "talk to me again soon".  So I figured in a few levels I might get another quest from him so I better hold on to this insignia that makes him think I'm his boy.
---
Zandalar Tribe EU?
---
stop saying perma ban because people will just recreate an account and add a subcription and start again 10min later. That's how permanent it would be.
---
This exactly. It's not "cheating" because they pay...but so do all the other exploiters?
---
And you can't say they don't affect the game, because they can operate more perfectly than any random group of people could. 
---
But Blizzard had a chance to shut it down but all they saw was $$$
---
Dude what's your problem?
---
The guy made a post asking why #nochanges is a thing and I responded with an example of things I'd personally like in Vanilla but others such as yourself wouldn't hence why #nochanges is the way it was decided to go. 
---
Then you come in here trying to flex and insinuate I need "things handed to me" grow up dude.
---
What do you mean with a little off? Is it just people that have their own horses or the ones that just likes them and ride sometimes haha.
---
Lol, so much salt
---
Priests are definitely better healers, but that's because a priest isn't a hybrid class in the same way druids are. 
---
Druids trade healing throughput for utility, but they're still capable. You'll definitely find people preferring a priest at all levels though.
---
Inefficiently. You would get something like 20% of or total spellpower as extra base dmg
---
If its 5g on your server its probably not worth farming but since the price has dropped a lot of people might not farm it anymore and thus the price rises. If a gold farm is worth it or not depends on your server economy, feel free to check out any of the other guides on the site, some of them might be better on your server :)
---
I think you can still be banned but if you just keep doing what you were drundered for then there's not a whole lot else they're going to bother doing. At that point they don't really care about the experience of the players on that server.
---
Sometimes back peddling is easier.
---
Which I do when I'm only playing with the mouse and ignoring the keyboard entirely.
---
Not that I would in pvp tho.
---
I don't subscribe to this mindset. Good loot can speed up the leveling process and help you win fights you wouldn't have with your old shit. The game does not start at 60, it starts at level 1.
---
Really? I've dealt with so many worse gaming communities, Classic has been so refreshing to me it's gave me faith in online gaming again. Or are you talking about reddit specifically?
---
Could be 1 month if you did it a handful of times, more if you brought other people into it?
---
You're talking about botters, people who BOT were who they were talking about in that post a long time ago back in like WoD. That was when they started the 6-month initial ban for people because people who botted would just make a brand new account and keep botting to catch back up. For the majority of non bot-farm accounts a 6-month ban made them stop botting forever. They were not talking about massive exploiters.
---
Yes, thanks for the details. Same boat as I was in.
---
That usually gets a fuck off from me followed by a /ignore.
---
The dream! Drive safe 07!
---
I tested this at home and I'm able to reliably drop traps mid fight.
---
There's a little bit of nuance to the timing of your call pet command and using feign death. If you're using a macro to do both at once it won't work as often. 
---
Hunter is a hard class to play and a lot of people expect to be able to pull off th see tricks without practicing them or by just mashing a macro they got from Reddit.
---
Pedal to the metal.
---
Account sharing/Rating boosting in Arena. He's talked about this on his stream a few times. He and his team would get really high rating in arenas, but then to keep their mmr they basically couldn't play on those characters until the next season. So they sold boosts to random people in the downtime. Someone would pay them ~$100 and give them their account info, Reckful and his teammates would then log into those accounts and play arena until they got something like 2000 rating (Enough for the title), which was piss easy for Reckful.
---
Thats some setup!
---
The difference is this is a video game. I'm not working 40 hours a week, it's just a fun thing to do for a couple hours after work each day. But if you're actually racing for world first or whatever then more power to you, not my place to prescribe how you enjoy the game. I just don't personally get it
---
From what I‚Äôve seen, yes. 
---
I was pretty fortunate as well. Got everything from Armory in 7 runs including the tabard. Really happy.
---
I'd be happy with them just deleting all their gear/items off those bosses for the week + a week ban.  
---
Think people asking for month+ long bans are going a little far.
---
Looks like a Cascadia, I drive one too.
---
What are some must-have Classic questing addons? This is the first time I've heard of Questie.
---
I dont know the mage. I want to know who the tank is.
---
Not to mention kiting more powerful enemies
---
Ok. 
---
Here‚Äôs the thing. 
---
As an individual I can do one of two things. 
---
Option 1 believe your speculation without evidence and cave, randomly letting Blizzards bullshit off the hook by pretending they never said they would remove layers. 
---
Option 2 hold Blizzard to their past statements and pressure them into supporting what they said and living up to their promises. 
---
Guess which option works better for 95% of players. 
---
Why anyone would move the goalpost for Blizzard to make the game worse is entirely beyond the notions of logic or comprehension.
---
Don't use "you." Use %t instead. That way you only get one angry whisper and a bunch of other people asking how you did it.
---
20 and 40 can't enter brd
---
Wait have they really acknowledged this for classic? I play a hunter and it‚Äôs nice that they at least know it‚Äôs a problem.
---
Well considering he didn't do anything I don't imagine he'll be banned. I love how you immediately assume he did though.
---
Lol agreed.
---
&gt; it doesn't stack with other melee crit buffs.
---
you mean fury warrior rampage in wotlk+?
---
&gt; there's always other druids that have it.
---
what other druids? Still by far the least played class and most go heal.
---
Wanted to farm the scarlet tabbard in armory 
---
First run I got both the tabbard and one these to drop off the trash 
---
Best upgrades ever
---
Show me where on the dummy the multiboxer shaman hit your character. Its no different from 5 separate players attacking you as a group.
---
Ahh ok thank you very much!
---
Yeah I rerolled off stalagg alliance after a week. The queue times and faction imbalance just isn't worth it dude.
---
Because he didn't
---
Hope so. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to reset MC raid and get away with it.
---
This is obvious. It's just a joke because of the whole issue going around friend
---
It‚Äôs also obviously exploitative to layer hop to farm rich thorium or black lotus, but that hasn‚Äôt been hotfixed, and no one has been banned.
---
Layers should never have gone live this way.
---
Head and shoulders have 35% drop rate. Legs and Ravager have 15% drop rate.
---
If blizzard doesn't literally delete all of these accounts and any gold or items that have been traded etc from them.... GG classic wow.
---
They should have logs. They can reimburse any legit player who bought items from these accounts, they can delete the bank accounts, gold, etc, for all of these players and their guilds, etc.
---
This needs to happen and it needs to be done yesterday.
---
That would certainly draw my aggro and make me want to attack the paladin..
---
Leveling guides / speedrunning guides are still worth it if you care. Questie helps a LOT but it is still easy to throw away many hours with unnecessary running and inefficient quests.
---
Yea I tried this as well unfortunately no fix yet
---
Good loot helps speed up those 10 levels and will help you in world pvp.
---
It wouldnt be reddit if there wasn't someone from EU complaining about something...
---
Thinking of migrating from Arugal to Yojamba. There are still queues for Arugal which has me worried about the queues during each of the new phases. I've heard that yojamba is really horde dominated (not sure about arugal, but am guessing horde dominated too), which is a bit discouraging as I'm horde as well. Any insight or advice would be much appreciated.
---
Thank you very much ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
"this girl" bruh
---
Revenge from the guy who was overseeing the patches early this morning.
---
You say you're pissed, is that at Blizzard for doing the right thing or yourself for doing the wrong thing?
---
It's died down a lot since the big streamers announced what server they were playing on. Prior to that, streamer hate was at an all-time high.
---
Their culture doesn't allow them to show graphics or symbols of death
---
I needed princess loot and had the quest done, no one else was on the quest. Guess who was the only one to die? No one else could click on her to loot but she was sparkling for me. My loooooot. We had to clear respawns and by then her body deepened. Nooooo.
---
Soooo many raiding guilds disappeared over night in that first wave.
---
Yet it took them like... 8 years to finally take down Bossland.
---
Because a simple line of text can easily be missed especially if they= guy wants to spam a lot of chat to hide it or if you have a very talkative guild and are also in General
---
I hope this is real, if so 
---
LMAOOOOOOO GET FUCKED
---
You‚Äôd have to make another account. But either way, maybe comparing insider trading with exploiting WoW was a bad analogy, thoughts?
---
Toxic, really? This has been a fantastic release experience for me, other than the queues.
---
Or do you mean the reddit wow community?
---
Oh damn. No, I never knew anything about that. Thanks for taking the time to reply too. I really thought I was being wooooshed for a second.
---
Have you quested  in westfall yet?
---
Oh yea that was one of the first things I tried so it‚Äôs definitely using my 1050. I‚Äôll check out aida
---
Yeah I did 1 lock 3 mage 1 priest. Was super awesome and fast. Requires a little communication in rotating novas, but it‚Äôs rewarding as hell when you all execute and the mobs fall. We had such a fun time we did more runs than expected. Fucking triune and mograines might dropped every time lol
---
Dude I got at least 10 unsolicited whispers this weekend. I'm sure it works for them, but I have no desire to be in a guild that just spams invites to any one with a pulse.
---
I just friended like one Tank and Healer while leveling and now get to run with them all the time, helps that I am lock and that lets them advertise the group having summons.
---
Exploit smarter
---
So pvp is not trivial then?..
---
It really is. But if  diablo 3 wasn't just a reskin of a Chinese game it wouldn't of hurt so bad though lol.
---
you forgot
---
/rollneed
---
Yeah I doubt that. You‚Äôre not going to use a much less damage weapon in level 60 raids just for the 9 second auto damage aoe attack proc. It‚Äôs a novelty. BiS raid weapon for the proc? Not even close.
---
I created a couple of vanity guilds so my friend and I could adventure in peace without having to deal with whispers and random invites.
---
I don‚Äôt wanna hurt your feelings here but you don‚Äôt need help from higher levels. Guildies or friends are a thing.
---
relax bro it's only phase one
---
not like blizzard can be blamed for shit code
---
Like honestly who cares. Move on.
---
The only actual rule on RP servers is the name requirements are more strict.
---
While there are RPers on the server, unless you join a dedicated RP group you won't see it too much aside from world community events and stuff, and for the most part it feels like a regular PvP server. Though IMO a bit more mature and laid back since it's not stuffed with streamer kiddies.
---
turn off layering lol
---
If your pet gets hit while retreating it will flag you as in combat for a moment.
---
Black friday is coming up. Be on the lookout for a decent laptop, you could easily find one more than capable of running wow for a few hundred.
---
Beggars can be choosers huhm
---
You can just make a new account you can‚Äôt make a new life. What an absolutely ridiculous analogy.
---
I'd really love to transfer (Grobb feels like most people just picked it for a lower queue time during the first week, not because they actually like RP servers), but I'm still worried about the server health in like 4-6 months. I'd hate to transfer and then the server be a ghost town half a year later.
---
I think about this pretty much every day at this point lol. I'd really like to swap but I don't want to regret it later.
---
It's incredible for open pvp though, but yeah it's more of a luxury than anything else
---
&gt;The boss exploit was not widely known until recently. 
---
FTFY.
---
I just got off a Skype call with Kanye West and we both agreedthat was hilarious.
---
The punishment isn't just the time lost, but all of the gold and gear earned lost as well.  Gold and gear that will be far hard to gain again without the exploit.  Perma-banning accounts that exploited dungeon layering like this is absolutely the correct call.  Otherwise you are giving them a slap on the wrist and a mountain of ill-gotten gear and gold.
---
Id venture to say agreeance across the board brother!
---
If you are using a felhunter instead of a succubus then you aren't seducing and most likely aren't getting off a soulfire.
---
Oh dang! Hope everything's alright - though it sounds planned? But really what Im also hearing you say is   
---
\&gt; "I'm going to be stuck playing Classic in bed for a month".  
---
I've never used one of those keyboards, but seems ideal for you situation, actually!
---
Blizz for adding layering to classic in the first place , they ruined the game ofc hardcore players will exploit .
---
Yes! I tried Glider to see what the hype was about from the community. Even in the most rudimentary setup was fairly decent. Being new to that sort of thing, I was surprised at how intuitive it was. I think you could pay to unlock auto-vendoring and other features or something like that? Man, that's a throw back.
---
the raid xp thing was glaringly obvious to anyone who played vanilla though and they let that one thru
---
\&gt; Leveling as the heal spec isn't that bad for the hybrid classes. The one thats REALLY booty is holy priest.
---
Holy paladin
---
Master loot doesn't exist anymore in retail. Its all personal loot now so no, no one can see an item that dropped for ''you''. And even before BfA when master loot still existed, many guilds raided with personal loot anyway because more stuff dropped with personal loot than with master loot.
---
Find high level humanoids and farm.
---
Reddit community here in classicwow specifically. In game, I've encountered no abusers of exploits, most people are friendly, everyone buffs each other and saves you if you get low, even opposite faction helps me out sometimes. Hell, I play boomkin and no one has complained yet in a group. Coming here though to find out information and talk about the game is a completely different feel.
---
Which is exactly what an exploit is: you are _exploiting_ a bug.
---
Where is evidence?
---
People don't just become vegan because It's trendy. If someone is trying it out because it's trendy, they won't last. It's a lot of hard work and dedication, especially if you genuinely enjoy food that comes from animals and are friends/famioy with non vegans.
---
They banned people back in vanilla for exploiting way less than this.  
---
Yes they will.
---
I get this logic for not rolling on melee weapons as a hunter. Until its the BIS hunter weapon, then of course im rolling on it because i wont replace it for a long time
---
That quest you're talking about has a small item on the ground that you interact with to turn it in iirc
---
Wait so you got banned for screwing over other people out of loot and you're suprised?
---
Most quests are just lead in to areas you should be grinding for XP.  You dont really need to do alllllllll the quests.   I've skipped entire zones, and lots of one off quests along the way.
---
Assuming I'm understanding him correctly, he is basically right.  I don't even know what specific items were being primarily farmed (some kind of robe? A pattern/formula or two?) so I'll just use generic terms for this scenario.
---
Say some Shitbag is exploiting layers to farm Pattern A, which has an 8% drop rate off Final Boss 1 and creates some chest that's BiS till AQ.  With so few players at level 60 right now, only 20 of Pattern A enters the server per day, causing its price to be 500g.  But since Shitbag is exploiting, he's getting another 20 per day just by himself, doubling the supply entering the server.  Now Pattern A drops in price to 250g because there are twice as many of them as their should be.  Shitbag posts up his latest 20 Patter As on the auction house and logs off for the night.  Nolife Joe is totally unaware of all of this, and has been farming gold peacefully and legally for the past week.  He's happy to see that his cool new pattern is only 250g, and buys Shitbag's 85th Pattern A drop without hesitation.  Now Nolife Joe has his recipe, and Shitbag is up to 12.5k gold.
---
Today, Blizzard finally comes in and bans Shitbag A for 30 days, removing all of his gear and all 12.5k gold.  They also ban 50 other Shitbags.  The supply of Pattern A dries up overnight, and it shoots up back up to 500g where it belongs.  But what about Nolife Joe, who goes his for 250g?  That's not fair.  But what do you do about it?  Probably nothing.  That's the "residual" impact here.  
---
Luckily, in my opinion that's probably not a huge deal.  Only a tiny fraction of players are anywhere even close to the point where they could've participated in either side of that transaction.  3 months from now we'll have 50x the amount of level 60s that we do today.  So hopefully that residual impact will not have a lasting effect on anything.
---
Not to mention it means lower development costs for Blizzard. They don't have to spend time on new art or fixing spells or anything that would impact the game. They just have to keep things up and running, which is far cheaper.
---
"I'm a Warlock, I already have 12 dead bag slots..."
---
Now how will he manage his stock portfolio.
---
Is being a 'ninja looter' against Blizz' ToS. I didn't know they could ban you for that. I wouldn't want to play with ninja looters but seems silly to ban them
---
What's to be annoyed about exactly? It just makes the AH easier to use..
---
PUG Groups are just always hit or miss...  Used the LFG channel the other day to find a group that was doing an SM run so I start off from Southshore heading up there as a Level 39 Warrior to DPS.  A minute or two into me going up there I get kicked from the full group.
---
I whisper with ?? and the party leader says "Oh - I forgot I was told I couldn't invite anyone wearing mail" to which I replied "Ummm... are they aware in one level I start wearing Plate anyways so I don't need/want the mail or could they have asked?"... only thing back was "Sorry, that just what I was told".  Just thankful I hadn't spent more time getting to the meetup.
---
\*sigh\*
---
Poly
---
Does Esfand get to keep loot?
---
I've found in certain areas i will feel like i'm "out of quests" and have to find some way to make up the xp to get caught up again. I had experience in actual classic up to 30, but 30-40 was kind of a struggle even with trying to use the guide. I don't really need an exact guide of which quests to do when, but just having a reference of when i should be jumping zone to zone, and making sure i'm somewhat on the right rack would be nice.
---
Yes and that mostly works. This post was one of our first attempt to find a solid group. That‚Äôs great advice thank you.
---
Except that's not the case. On Herod the balance is much better when you factor out inactives.
---
On Atiesh we're like 90% alliance according to the survey data on friday and now it's like 60/40 so its entirely possible  most people haven't uploaded the data yet
---
&gt;Hotfix it, remove the ill gotten gains where necessary and move on.
---
You're just promoting cheating at that point. You're saying "If you find a bug, exploit it as much as possible. Best case scenario you don't get caught, worst case scenario you only lose what you gained through cheating". There needs to be a deterrent as well. Permabanning a less than one month old account is a very good way to both send a message and not go overboard with the punishment in my opinion.
---
Anything that is a shadow bolt has that animation
---
On my rogue, I always have this:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /fart
---
    /cast Vanish
---
I‚Äôd hope not.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, and technically it's an upgrade to what they are using but...
---
If you poll everyone who browses here on whether taking a 2 handed with str and agil, from the mouth of a war who really does need that....results will show the hunter is a dick.
---
If I get far enough it seems to drop.  I never wand or auto attack.  PvE I have that experience where it doesnt drop combat but in pvp I've noticed it does.
---
Because you're a good lock. I think they need to have a test before you can run dungeons.
---
Is he abusing it or is he just demonstrating how it works though?
---
It's DPS is practically equal, but a faster attack speed = better spell pushback in PvP.
---
Fuck Chinese censorship. That garbage has reached our entertainment.
---
I also prefer fullscreen, but I have many use cases where I prefer a small windowed version of the game (like 800x600 resolution)
---
eg: It's a quick session that I want to check the AH. Or if I expect to be in my servers queue for a bit. Or if I just want to kinda multi task things but not fully focus on wow.
---
I will definitely hold on to it, I used it
---
On the hordes side :p
---
mOO!
---
is there a way i can check the hours i put in on my previous level? i forgot to check right before i lvl up
---
No ban no loot seems like a fair compromise
---
How will you keep your gold?  You would have to get a low level character to the neutral AH or have someone on the opposite faction you could trust, which does not seem likely.
---
I don't think they permaban anyone for their first offense, unless it's like something really, REALLY bad.
---
If you legitimately think they can't track this then I don't know what to tell you. Every item will have a unique ID and they'll be able to trace transactions of gold based on these IDs. If you're actively trying to launder the gold then they're more likely to put effort into tracing it and punishing all parties involved.
---
Pissing off a small portion of players isn't there concern. Sending a message about what happens to people who exploit is.
---
1 month seems a bit light in the grand scheme of things, these guys have gotten thousands of gold as well as BiS loot, how do you remove all the loot and gold that they had poured into the economy? You can't Some of the items they obtained aren't in their possession anymore its permanently affected the game, how much so? I'm not sure.
---
I would have hoped for 2-3 month long bans because of how phases are planned. I guess 1 month of not being able to raid MC/ony is bad for them but ultimately they'll be able to catch up in time for pvp for Phase 2 and it'll feel like a slap on the wrist to them probably.
---
This does set a good precedent to not exploit if you've found a bug though, which I'm happy for.
---
Glad to hear its a common occurrence!

If I knowingly exploited, I wouldn't be mad that I was banned. I'd just be expecting it.
---
Never a wrong way to play WoW bro. I have a 39 lock, 13 warrior, 12 rogue, and 10 shaman. As long as you‚Äôre having fun is what matters my man
---
US servers got restarted a few hours ago as well, give it about 20 minutes
---
I think the best would be ban for 2 week, just two weeks, AND rolling their characters to lvl 1 :D So they have to level again and lose all the shit they had and compete with people that already have 60 etc.

---
Sensible response tbh
---
If we've had people exploiting MC to chain clears and they're not permanently banned it will be a massive miscarriage of justice.
---
Blizzard really doesn't give a shit tbh.
---
In one of my previous comments on this sub I used a fish bot from vanilla to the end of wotlk(when I quit WoW). I would fish bot for 7-8 hours straight while I slept or went to college classes and in TBC I used a xyz geometric/teleport hack to farm baron rivendare's mount.
---
Never even got a warning on my account and I could play retail or classic wow right now but both are pretty shit on their on merits so I'll pass.
---
I am 37 and only missing the chest piece.  That said, I'm only wearing 2 pieces.  It actually not a good set.  Like at all.  
---
That said.
---
I fucking love this set.
---
I‚Äôm surprised this is an issue for a Druid. Imo druids are definitely the worst five man healer and I hate doing a dungeon with them and no warlock. Unless I know everyone doesn‚Äôt suck.
---
I really doubt more than a handful of them will go out. They would have to manually check the Accounts and thats not going to happen. 
---
They will pick a handful of the Guilds that really exploited it hard, but 99% will go unharmed.
---
And you can still exploit layering to get a huge amount of gold.
---
bump
---
Nice!
---
Shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.
---
Currently level 43 on Yojamba, I've only ever been in 1 queue, but that was during the first week of Classic. Iirc the ratio is 60/40 to Horde. Doesn't seem to be as hardcore as Arugal.
---
IDK as I wasn't part of that guild but one had an anti-semitic name and they were generally just spamming and being borderline but not explicit
---
Watch some drakedog videos. In pvp 7/7/37 is amazing.
---
Now this is the true life on the road. ROck on brother
---
Very insightful. This shit happened in vanilla all the time. I thought this sub wanted the vanilla experience?
---
Nice no screenshot feature on that pc :D
---
Yo man sorry I didn't accept your invite to the satyrs quest, was waiting for a dungeon invite
---
Did you even read the fucking post? It mentions that they asked GMs what to do and they said it was OK to clear it
---
Hope they remove all loot and rollback their entire account from the day they started doing it. + Ban depending on the severity, 500g = 30days, 1000g = 60, 2000+=perma ban.
---
This, plus tranquility is a beautiful thing to recover a raid from sloppy mistakes.
---
I am struggling with your keybinds
---
They got the ok to clear it as it was unintentional so I wouldn't see why not.
---
The books do have some gorgeous maps, but I just like how you clearly have your own style and think you'd do well putting your own touch on them! Just some food for thought, and keep up the great work.
---
What if the item is something like the recipe for Truefaith Vestments and the buyer has already crafted the item? Do you also remove the crafted item? Because getting a "refund" for a recipe like that after you crafted the item would be a jackpot.
---
Whats the name of that chat addon?
---
I was invited after playing with someone for a bit. Great group of people so far so glad I found a decent guild.
---
That‚Äôs more than the game has been out so far. It‚Äôs seems small but that enough to set these people way way back.
---
Was waiting for this to be posted but honestly this was the best way for time to fly til I go home. Lmao
---
I think everyone has a default layer he is on. You just join your Party leaders when grouping up. So you naturally ran into the people of your layer.
---
The big difference is really that people can catch up on levels but not on overfarmed raids
---
I wonder if people realize how obnoxious they sound when they start a comment off with "Wrong"
---
Never had this add-on before but looks interesting
---
nah, thats not the thing, you just reset the dungeon for him transporting him to the entrance. this was abusing layer glitch to clear MC several times etc
---
Gravediggers. Not to be confused with The Gravediggers. 
---
Apparently.
---
Uh no, this is about people who were layering 5man dungeons, specifically endbosses in strat etc, to repeatedly kill those bosses. Mechanically its pretty much the same as resetting for the trash.  
---
They werent layering raids, since those have a unique id that your char is bound to.
---
You threatened to dispute the charge with your credit card company?  Any proof of that or are you talking out of your ass?
---
It‚Äôs actually the healer Paladin that called dibs on the ring - he too could use both stats while leveling, but imo agi benefits hunter more than pally. That ring is probably best suited for hunters, Druids, and shamans (who wouldn‚Äôt come to Westfall for it anyway)
---
Yes......
---
nah, just a dick move
---
You the 50 warrior?
---
URRRGH 20 minutes why is life so hard
---
Unless he opens trade with you, and then opens the chest before you figure out what happened.
---
As a pally from vanilla if you don‚Äôt like it now your not going to Re roll only takes around 20h to lvl 20 less if you know quest and can grind fast.
---
Of course they will, they got a go-ahead from Blizzard after reporting it. 
---
It's also interesting that they point out it's unrelated to the exploit and has existed since 2004 since I got downvoted for pointing out that killing a raid boss locks you to a raid ID whereas instances are layered. "The same Raid ID exists in multiple layers" yeah right, seems reasonable.
---
What's a good level range for that?
---
There is an button for this on the lower left side on your character screen
---
Doesn't count as ninjaing
---
Read the comments , the tears are delicious
---
Why was Gehennas (EU) just shut down? Can't find a reason anywhere.
---
That's the way the cookie crumbles. Need if it's an upgrade and you will actually equip it. That said, as a druid tank, sometimes I will pass on upgrades if I think it would be a bigger upgrade for the healer. Like a staff with stamina and spirit, for example. You could also just ask "mind if I need?" and see what people say.
---
To put it harshly, yeah it sucks to suck
---
It's a dick move but not punishable.
---
Indeed!
---
I am :D
---
That is not what they wrote. The account is marked for investigation and a result of (being marked for) this investigation is that the account is suspended.

Is this still going on? I just hit 30 and i went to both IF &amp; SW and don't see the questgiver =/

Those recipe are for bop item (that are bis to at least bwl)... That's why people buy them with a high price.

All you have to do is ask the rules when you join. As far as I know if no rules are stated the leader is free to do as he pleases.

All good, dude! and yeah, it was random, this homie just didn't have a mount lol.

Probably not, I mean its not even a month in.

If I aim at mostly dungeon, even at 60, what class would you recommend.

I was thinking druid as the solo leveling+dungeon seem nice but maybe they suck compare to a warrior or even a paladin.

---
You can check out zygor's , I personally use joanna's guide. www.joannasworld.com
---
Ah, a fellow Pograiner I see.
---
I'm sure this won't be abused at all. better ninja looters free of consequences than 1 dude brigades when innocent
---
Also people approaching level 40 are hoarding their gold. So few of the world drop epics are actually meant for end game, and the lower level items are deemed "not worth it" when you could get something similar elsewhere if you just wait a bit.
---
A current day console could run it (And that hardware is like 6-7 years old) so you will be fine
---
Huh?
---
All will be punished.
---
I have already done that guess I didn't use the right wording in the main text post
---
It was announced in game multiple times before it went down
---
yeah :(
---
I'd love to have an add-on to make my maps all in your drawing style. I love it!
---
If they get even only 20 recipes like this, they just have to sell them for half the price and any 60 will spend all their gold on it because it's worth it.
---
Not many crybabies here except for a dude claiming to be pissed because he got banned
---

---
I feel like this could potentially result in a bad scenario. When mana is extremely tight I wouldn't want to accidentally be spending my reserves on hunters mark when I could really use (any other skill you need). Then there is target switching, and that gets even worse with pvp.
---
Perhaps just adding a ctrl modifier to your pet attack button that does this would be a better set up. Or the reverse using your suggestion, and then the ctrl modifier is just a normal pet attack for that rare scenario.
---
Not true. The people who would receive this guild dit not participate in the act. They merely received gold.
---
Slap on the wrist via 1month suspension and removal of items.
---
IMO should have been at least 2 months so they would be behind during Ph.2 launch. But this is just short enough that they'll be given time to farm gear to be prepared to pvp and just long enough to be considered a worthy ban sentence.
---
Imagine waiting in ques cause you think the other server will be dead. Think most of the chill people headed here cause of it
---
FUCKING APOR √ñVERALLT

Yes I do that but if I logout of the game and log back in everything resets to its original position
---
Yes there are. There are a lot. 
---
Just go to source forge and filter by top.

Chaotic Good
---
How long for?
---
Then I guess dont play. Good luck either way
---
Needs more Goblin Sapper Charges.
---
It's almost like Blizzard didn't spam the chat 90 times.
---
Thats what happens when you ha e all the information. Its drastically changed games from adventures into games of reaching max efficiency. This has never really piqued my interest and its something i dont truly understand, turning every game you play into a a spreadsheet
---
Happens like every night, no reason to be worried. Just a little earlier tonight.
---
Yes, no action is taken on Esfand.
---
STV wasn't as bad as some other areas. I found Tanaris and Hillsbrad to be worse, people were actually chilling in STV most of the time.
---
With the raids in 5 mans, layering exploits in the world and now layering exploits in dungeons and raids. Pretty much ruined vanilla.
---
Was there a reason?
---
A couple of people in my guild got gifted a wand when they were first starting and they told everyone in the guild how cool the guy was. Even if they don‚Äôt say it, I‚Äôm sure those people remember you fondly, my friends all remember their benefactors with a big smile even now!
---
Thanks man, just before the server restart too! Very happy right now.
---
There is.
---
Too long
---
are you giving the game a proper shut down when you log out, or alt-f4ing? i know when i don't close the game normally it doesn't save any settings i've changed. perhaps make sure you log out to character screen before exiting? doubt it's the issue but figure I'd throw it out there just in case.
---
Proly second attempt to fix the exploit, as 2 hours ago it was still working on EU.
---
You're a real blast you know? You're hilariously negative, and can't counter anything directly. You're determined to be a miser.
---
Anyway, have a good day!
---
You already found the answer but I‚Äôll throw it in here.
---
Wild leather quests are available to all LW not just Tribal. They are only required for Tribal tho.
---
Yes once you complete a specialization quest (for lw) you can‚Äôt change unless you drop the whole skill and redo it.
---
Same, it's a cool little dinosaur area but also kinda weird too. I think I skipped this area entirely after my first character.
---
Time to sleep.
---
1. Blizzard has been hammering constantly that the Light and the Void don't have an sentience - they are just forces. Like, this primal energy that comes in two flavors - happiness-indulcing Holy and sadness-making Shadow. There are beings and deities aligned to those powers, but they don't hold dominion over it all.
---
2. To draw from those two primal forces, you just need a strong will or faith to make it manifest. This is why the Scarlet Crusade can do their Holy magic - they are virtuous. They believe that they are doing something good. Same explanation for Tauren Paladins (faith in An'she), Zandalari Paladins (faith in Rezan / the Queen), Mag'har Orc Priests (faith in the Ancestors, stars and elements), etc.
---
3. I don't think they intended it since Classic WoW, but it fits the narrative of Classic and avoid retcons to have lore about the Light / the Void built like we currently know.
---
Didn‚Äôt mean to rotate my camera, press Alt+Z then Print Screen. How clumsy!
---
I just want to know what drug he does to look the way he does.
---
That's not a normal behavior. It should be saved. Do you have any unit frames improvement addons?
---
It stays where I put mine. Best just delete and uninstall.
---
im too good üòéüòéüòé
---
Did Esfand actually do this exploit?
---
It's a part of the world that literally is an island with a large house on it. GM characters had to be logged in to emulate whispers for the chat system API at one point, so that is where they resided, invisible. In some circumstances, the invisibility flag wasn't applied and you could see a character logged in there via /who or teleport hacking over. 
---
It was never used for any other purpose on live servers.
---
I don't believe there is a way to just swap with one line, although for me I only have a sword and a dagger.  So if my macro does swap sword from MH to OH it'll auto swap the dagger thats already in my OH to my MH.  It becomes more difficult when you have multiple weapon sets to equip.
---
You can use conditionals like [stealth] [nostealth] also.
---
Was it not tomorrow?
---
I'd love to see your parse, because I haven't seen anything like that. Were both pets in the same family? Same level? Were abilities used? What were the hunters talents? What enemies were you parsing against?
---
It's at the top?
---
Happened yesterday around 4 am too, anyone know approx how long it will be?
---
What addon is for ah prices?
---
Yes, he said he got to keep the items (as of writing).

Screenshot it and put it on your realm discord.  That's about the most you can do.
---
Also, based your description of their behavior there's probably a 90% chance their name was worth reporting for being inappropriate.
---
This could actually be OPs problem
---
Time to go to darkshore
---
levelling *is* the game in classic.
---
in retail, the 'game' is all the endgame content, and thus people generally recommend rushing to 120.
---
Current day console? coz a toaster has more power than one of those.
---
Unfortunately blizzard isnt like bungee, where you can exploit early, exploit often.  I wont defend using the exploit, but I will say they are incredibly inconsistent with how they determine punishments, and have. Even since 04.
---
It's down to remove dungeon reset exploiters from the game :D So long, fuckers!
---
I was mad when they removed the spooky skull from the Shadowbolt animation in retail. Hell, there was a while when warlocks didn't even use shadowbolt as any spec.
---
Not ninja but douch√© move. what I do with these type of people is write down name, put on ignore list and post in guild list for guildwide blacklist on all future endeavors (permanent).
---
Get in dude we're going to find outland!
---
I didn't realize that when you join a guild you get notified everytime someone joins! I still don't know how to leave... Oh well
---
It's a Haswell era laptop, so the Intel HD graphics should run wow on low.
---
On my old main I found that insignia in my bank sometime during Burning Crusade and I still felt slightly anxious about deleting it.
---
Sorry just logged on haven't been on today, should I just delete the post
---
Don‚Äôt think they were pretending it was an accidental pic, you have time to line up a screenshot if you are stuck using a wand because you didn‚Äôt bring drinks.
---
The hunter playstyle is a ton of fun, especially if you download an autoshot timer. That said, druid really picks up once you get car form and can put those 2 points into feline swiftness. And druids can do things hunters can't, like heal and stealth. Every other class seems somehow less by comparison.
---
Theyre back online
---
I never claimed they couldn't track the gold or items. That's why you split the gold between multiple parties and get random people involved, they can track all of it but it becomes impossible to determinate who should be punished.
---
If you had 10 people and knew that 7 of them were criminals but 3 were innocent without any idea what was going on would you punish all 10?
---
Thanks for the help
---
No. Let me put everything back and log out correctly like the gentleman above mentioned
---
I've been 100% on board with #TeamNoChanges but my friend and I were talking about how fun it was to pull out your smartphone (this was cool enough in itself) and just start showing off your gear to your friends. The whole auction house aspect of it just took it to another level in terms of usefulness.
---
Wow, a reasonable approach to gearing. Where am I?
---
Now i wanna reroll to a warlock
---
don't worry about it, we're all new some time.
---
It was launched during WotLK, so I don‚Äôt think they are going to bring that back any time soon. However, it is possible to stream your desktop to your smartphone (with mouse control) and thus access the AH from your phone. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.
---
I could definitely see that happening, good to know thank you :D
---
Misdirect on them? I‚Äôm not sure what the rogue one is but I‚Äôm not even sure they‚Äôre in game right now or function as they do on retail.
---
What are you 12? If people want different ways of LFG besides spamming chat let them. You're definitely an asshole
---
That would be too harsh
---
Layers are a technology Blizzard is using for classic in order to allow more players to play on a single realm. Basically multiple instances of the world exist at the same time for each server and people are divided among these layers to reduce server load. Players can change the layer they are on by being invited to party by a player on another layer.
---
People discovered that if you left party while in a dungeon, under certain circumstances you could be transferred to a different layer while inside the dungeon. In doing so the bosses would respawn, so people started exploiting this bug to continuously kill specific bosses for rare items without having to reset and reclear the entire dungeon. People are saying this worked for raids too, and was being exploited to circumvent the weekly lookout on raids to get extra loot (I have not seen any proof of this claim however.)
---
U cant be playing holy leveling by questing, if ur new to the game it will prob take u months, go spam dungeons or reroll.
---
‚ÄúI could play retail or classic wow right now but both are pretty shit on their on merits(classic mainly because I did all the content in the game 14 years ago) so I'll pass.‚Äù
---
This statement here though,  I mean it‚Äôs fine you don‚Äôt want anything to do with the game but why are you here on a classic wow sub just to shit on it?  Why do you frequent wow subs in general if you hate the game ?
---
I'm pretty sure that you're right, and given the text on the trinket, I doubt that this works while shielded. That said, /u/fusibs, PW:S only realistically lasts for 2-4 seconds every 15 seconds, so the trinket is probably still useful as a tank.
---
Also, the undead priest racial Touch of Weakness _does_ fire off on an attacker even if you're shielded, but the spell text says "The next melee attack against the caster ...", which suggests that it works even if the attack misses/is dodged/etc.
---
You certainly did not have to do that to achieve that goal
---
Which server has actual talking guilds? I miss that in the regular, thought Classic might be better
---
Are you honestly proud of this?
---
Gratz
---
Does he know da wae?
---
It‚Äôs not about them. Scumbags are gonna scumbag. It‚Äôs about setting an example for anyone else who might think it‚Äôs fun to hop on the next exploit that someone tells them about. People should be fearful of anything that looks like an exploit and report it and stay away from it rather than cashing in on it.
---
People really should not be surprised if at 60 all groups are void of tanks.
---
It isnt even that bad from the side of actual tank mechanics, its just that every fucking dps feels the need to spam their shit from the get got.
---
I wanted to play prot warrior at 60, I¬¥m 59 currently and tanked multiple Brds and Lbrs runs.
---
Its the same shit every single run, mages blasting their AoE combo instantly, shadow priests yoloing mind blast either instant or to a completely wrong target, hunters starting with multishot.
---
Running after mobs trying to desperately keep aggro because the dps players in my group dont give a half a fuck makes me not want to play a tank and I¬¥m sure many others will come to this conclusion.
---
TL;DR Current behaviour exhibited by dps players will drive many tanks to just not fucking bother at all and there will be a lot of crying about not enough tanks.
---
I renewed my game time yesterday and let everything update.  Will be playing tonight :)
---
Well with enough kicks and stuns I imagine that it wouldn't be too hard to bring down a 55+ as a group of 40s.  Anything 5v1 is rough especially as a clothie.
---
The group that attacked me was a rogue, priest and hunter.  Priest actually died to a white melee crit, the rogue was two shot and the hunter ran off and died to a bleed after getting smacked with the sweeping strikes off the rogue's incoming damage.
---
I actually do the same to avoid drama, but if its bis then im going to need
---
No I woukd be happy with queues. Blizzard and your drooling cavalcade of autists thought to "fix" a problem that no one saw as a problem. This is just another "You think you want it but..." Like who the fuck looks at their customers in ANY business and says THAT. Now they have to do double the work On the back side just to keep up with the new and actual problem of abuse. Queue times are nothing compared to the irreparable damage done from abuse.
---
But why even type this out I am sure you are a retail bab that exploits classic.
---
Retail: Am I a joke to you?
---
Proud. No.
---
It's a harsh truth.
---
Sue me
---
Oh yes... I know exactly what type of girls you are referring to haha. I went to an equestrian college with 98% girls and most of them were exactly like this. (Everyone besides like 1 person, my only friend at the whole school lol) Everyone had expensive shit, their parents bought them horses really young, bullied freshmen and talked shit about other people for not having this or that. Or just judging them at all. I quit that school my second year, I like all animals but the people.. I stayed as far away from all of them as I could. They care more about themselves, their horse and money more than anything else. It was awful..
---
Been searching for the same one since 2006.
---
I have another picture on here where I released the beard with my comrades, don't tell nukebeard (An orc I saw) he'll hit us
---
Yep
---
Fun fact: If everyone in the group has completed the quest chain the princess is going to be replaced by a different darkiron NPC (I think highpriestess of thaurissan or something), she drops the same loot but looks completely different.
---
That's cool XD I love this!
---
Now THIS is pod racing!
---
The best ways to generate threat is to pop your 2 HoTs right before pulling (and of course to have thorns up). The damage you take will generate threat by your healing, and each hit they land on you generates threat from thorns. Best to let this go on for a few seconds before DPS start attacking. As soon as you build some rage, and after demoralizing roar, throw out as many swipes as you can. None of this works if a priest bubbles you before the encounter so talk to your priest about that. Save growl for healer aggro, as mentioned in other comments, melee DPS can handle aggro from 1 mob. I would save the mass taunt for real sticky situations.
---
Had the same thing happen to me, the response I got was "deal with it".... Well no name changes, maybe he can server transfer but, his name is mud to me, hard to lose a bad reputation on a server
---
Haven't really seen anywhere that hasn't been active honestly
---
What level instances are you tanking, because at 52+ the healer can fix your dpses fuck up and it just keeps staying a shit show.
---
Actually im younger.
---
Queue's gone you can come back now boys
---
What about the gold??? Hello????
---
This 100%
---
Arent DHKs only for npcs? I think you just dont get honor for lowbies
---
I have CTRL+mwheel on camera zoom.
---
Find a healer.
---
Seriously, you absolutely must make a healer friend to have a good time in pvp. 
---
Warrior is arguably the very worst solo pvp class in the game, but this is balanced by it being (when geared), one of the absolute _strongest_ pvp classes when paired with a healer.
---
Also, iirc, Berserker Rage also prevents you from being disoriented, which is super useful against rogues who can gouge you.
---
So 1 boss farm without a lock out or clearing again? I wasn‚Äôt sure what layering did
---
&gt; True
---
GODS WE WERE YOUNG THEN
---
Holy nova farming is usually done with int stacking. Rather than increasing the damage if your holy novas, you increase the amount of holy novas before you‚Äôre oom. I don‚Äôt know how well this works now, but when dire maul releases, priests can aoe farm lashers inside the instance.
---
What about the one that forget to remove the fries from the bag?
---
Kill all Alliance on sight
---
Just here to keep updated on the progress on this. Would be the perfect add-on/enhancement
---
Alliance does the same thing.
---
are you sure you‚Äôre not talking about the us
---
Sigh. I'm some cases. You don't think EVER that people need for a tiny upgrade, denying another person a huge upgrade?
---
A warrior needing a bow in deadmines doesn't need it. The hunter did. The hunter needing a 2handed in deadmines because his is grey quality, vs the warrior who is using one 6 levels his junior, didn't need it. This is the topic here. This thread is about the hunter meme. They can need on almost anything, denying almost everyone else chances at gear. 
---
I'm gonna move on from this :)
---
Because we are talking about world PvP and the game as a whole. Not every conversation is limited to MC raids. Most people don‚Äôt even do MC raids. This post is literally about people out questing in zones getting killed by an opposing player.
---
Addons have been a feature since the very beginning, and many popular add-ons have been updated / modified to work (or in many cases, work again) with classic.
---
To name just a few:
---
* Bagnon
---
* Advanced Interface Options
---
* Dominos (bar/buttons)
---
* Classic Aura Durations
---
How what? Lvling is easy when you remember your ood leveling paths from nilla
---
Yep. I mean you can log things yourself... I don't know if you raided in Retail, but this latest client that Classic is based on, has an "Advanced combat logging". You can basically see exactly, every action made by a person, every movement, everything. Here's an example of a raid log:
---
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/tVdWq4KMDQLrYH7z#fight=11&amp;view=replay
---
It's fair to assume that Blizzard has bit better tracking tools than stuff like this what players came up with.
---
How was he even getting hot and heavy?... if anyone, that‚Äôs you right now in these comments.  0_O
---
They aren't going to ban people who randomly receive the gold, just delete the gold/any items purchased with that gold.
---
If you receive 1k gold in the mail and have no idea where it came from, but buy stuff with it, then you can't really be mad when that stuff gets taken away - it's not a punishment.
---
We gotta eat somehow
---
hello there
---
You know STV wasn't the worst this go round.  Hillsbrad was a shitshow, especially that yeti cave.
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty rare more likely because most people aren‚Äôt antisocial scum bags, not necessarily for fear of the consequences, but maybe I‚Äôm giving people too much credit.
---
People exploiting shit to run MC multiple times, and I'm still level 28 spending like 4 hours a day fishing.
---
especially in retail tbh.
---
Keep swapping between Redridge, Duskwood, and Wetlands. At 21 you still have things to do in Westfall or Loch Modan. As a warrior you should get used to questing and grinding mobs lower than your level. You minimize misses which devastate your damage output, so you should be doing things with mobs \~3-5 levels below you.
---
Definitely leatrix map addon
---
Even me clearing it at 90 or some shit thought it was a bit much.
---
I genuinely have trouble telling apart the newbies from the trolls.
---
Your warrior has become aware of the true nature of reality, he's The One.
---
I‚Äôm so dead
---
Seconding FiveSecondRule.
---
Remember that you can type `/fsr unlock` and `/fsr lock` to move it around.
---
They wanted to be the very best, like no one ever was. To hack them was their main quest, to claim loot was their cause.

---
LOL!
---
Just because WoW is the most popular MMO of all time doesn't mean it's any good right now.  It's currently the best MMO out right now but that doesn't mean it's good. 
---
It should be included in the game that my sub pays for... that's pretty self explanatory are you dense.  The outcry about store mounts has been an issue for a while and the mounts attached to subscriptions.  When you pay money monthly as well as buying the game at face value,  nothing should be held behind a store purchase that's just a total joke.  
---
Hearthstone is only popular because it's the easiest to understand and is easily accessible. You actually do need to pay hundreds of dollars to make competitive decks.  All these get legend with starter cards stuff isn't for the current form of the game and is an outdated idea.  
---
I'm also not circle jerking, these are all valid points that you don't agree with which are fine but there are plenty that do.
---
The worst part is that keeping aggro requires less threat than getting it back and then when you have to put special care to a mob because a shadow priest just couldnt hold their Mb, now everything is running loose and playing a tank just sucks balls.
---
Exploiting is when you take advantage of a known bug.    
---
There is no real advantage to leveling in 10 man raids, it was fast, but not faster than 5 man raids.    
---
It was easy, that's why players liked it.  
---
The 10 man raid farming isn't very different than the ZF GY farm going on right now.
---
he was right you are fucking annoying
---
I blame Blizzard much more than the exploiters. This was easily foreseeable and is merely an extension of the general permissible abuse of layering for xp and econ purposes.
---
As the latter was soft tweaked, it's really impermissible for blizzard to not forsee this being used in dungeons.
---
This gave Roy further shock.
---
is it not 48?
---
I like both games :)
---
No u.
---
Good, fuck those idiots and their attempt to ruin game for everyone.
---
As an FYI, you can add alliance players as battlenet friends.
---
I've done that a time or two when I ran into alliance questing and we quested side by side, even helping each other on hard portions.
---
How doesn't it affect the economy when someone can camp out a boss that offers certain recipes, weapons, armor, or whatever else in a dungeon.  
---
I'm not sure you're even aware of what this issue is in reference to: [Layering Exploit](https://www.twitch.tv/skarmtank/clip/CorrectNeighborlyAnteaterAliens)  
---
Layering in the overall world isn't a serious issue, layering in dungeons/raids absolutely is.
---
Shame
---
@op can you provide some detail as to much you abused this exploit and maybe to what extend?
---
üí™ü§òüèºüçæ
---
Why? Is it the guards being too hard to kill with classic abilities or a lack of escapes for Rogues that existed in BC+ due to Cloak of Shadows?
---
Hey my friend got banned for 1 month, can he do anything to revert this?
---
No one cares about your opinion, let other people play how they want
---
Gnomore gnomes!
---
This is more than a minor bug, and is a result of the biggest new feature. What are q and a doing if not trying to break layering?
---
Reset limits?  You mean clearing trash?  Scarm was just farming crowd pummeler over and over with it.
---
Get the remote app, that problem dissapears with ease and before you get home you are already at the character selection screen ready to connect to a real, populated Azeroth.
---
yes but that's kinda what i'm saying, random people must have found this in beta and people spending time looking for exploits definitely have.
---
Sincerely bummed that wall walking was fixed. I get it though, exploitable.
---
A Mage losing to a Warrior is like Scissors losing to Paper.
---
It almost is really. Lately at least on stalagg it seems there are two layers max
---
[User admitted this is a troll post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d57rdq/got_banned_for_a_month_ama/f0kaa23/) so this post has been removed.
---
This is Gehennas EU
---
I agree with your observation 
---
I normally would have the server favorited and as you stated then select the characters on the server
---
Shucks, as I think of it I will delete the pre select characters on the other servers and see if it makes a difference for myself and will share update
---
Unless someone chimes in
---
I use miks scrolling battle text and just disable everything bar outgoing heals ect then just move it to somewhere you like on your ui and change the visuals if you so choose :)
---
Was invited to a group for RFC yesterday and just needed a tank. I thought for sure we were gonna sit there for an hour. All of a sudden our priest finds a LVL 19 warrior tank and we all wept
---
What was your alternative to layering. Honestly so far layering seems to have been pretty smooth. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but layering has caused very little problems and alleviated server stress significantly allowing us to all play
---
Hi, /u/Zarnor
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d58u4c/real_question_what_are_layering_exploits/). 
---
This a million time. What makes classic so unique is the social aspect and not the "grind this mob that has a 3% quest item drop rate oh and I need 10 of the items" quests.
---
Lets just say Gnomeregan was a good thing‚Ä¶
---
But doesn't that mean you have leveled in all three starting areas for your faction now?
---
Yeah... the world layering problem is already done the damage, so there‚Äôs nothing we can do.  So be it.  But repeatedly spawning raid bosses is clearly not ok.
---
Exactly... get a guild make some friends and you can easily get the WW axe.
---
You can grind. It's quite relaxing really.
---
Same exact thing happened here with my guild on Whitemane. We finally reached the consensus to move to Arcanite Reaper while I was at work today. I come home to get ready for the switch, and the option is gone?? There was no warning or anything, and now our guild is fucked down the middle. I was hoping Classic might be a step in the right direction for blizz, but it seems like the same shit is carrying over. Really hoping this gets resolved so I don't have to cancel my sub.
---
That's why I'm building a balanced setup until I can get geared. Only had to respec once because I chose the wrong talent by accident and I'm doing fine
---
A debuff that makes them hostile to everyone regardless of PvP servers or flagging. Unable to initiate these fights themselves ofc.
---
Optimal is after gear at 60, but its your character, do what you want
---
Well dungeon spamming isn't an exploit its a part of the game and I wasn't sure if people knew that or not seemed like people were getting mad at farming dungeons or somethin
---
 /Leave 2. Problem solved. 
---
But if you can‚Äôt handle sicial interaction, you shouldn‚Äôt play a MMO. It‚Äôs designed to be played together.
---
Glad they deleted, what I'm hoping is that they also tracked down any trades that were done and deleted those items as well.
---
We need layers on the full servers unless you have a better idea.
---
8 characters! How do you have the time?
---
Druids are far better at leveling over warrior (solo or otherwise)
---
As for 5-mans and endgame, druids are great in 5-mans, and great as offtanks, they are a bit worse off as maintanks. While they can, without block and being below crit cap makes it a bit more intense.
---
For sure, go druid, druids are far better than paladin tanks endgame. Paladins are stuck in the 5-man tank role for good. They CANNOT raid boss tank in any capacity as they are lacking a taunt, and enough threat generation.
---
didn't work
---
I don't know lol I am decision anxiety.
---
Don't act like you're the one open to "DISCUSSION" when you're also the one who told him to GTFO because he dares to like a feature that's not in classic. Especially when he admits it shouldn't be in the game.
---
were you thinling of posting their reactions on reddit when you gave out the wands?
---
Questie
---
Don't see that possible since the devs are against dungeon finder, which probably uses the same string needed for this
---
Pretty sure thats a nope
---
floating healing numbers aren't in classic. best bet is to use a combat text mod.
---
You scarmtank did it on his stream.  Pretty high profile guy if you ask me.
---
No I‚Äôm not talking about queues. I‚Äôm talking 15000 people queues and when you get in the zones are so over crowded that 300 people are competeting for the same 8 mobs. It would have taken you a legit day to get to level five. It would have been an absolute disaster
---
For wands I would just go off dmg per se and and stats
---
Doubt it, I've never read up on honor buddy. I know glider had waypoint grinding originally, cause I remember reporting people in felwood &amp; un'goro.
---
Google is failing me hard, though. I'm guessing the wayback machine won't have anything either.
---
We all know that recruiting people randomly on a whim makes for the best guilds with the tightest groups and the fastest raid clears.
---
Right, and what percentage of those who abused it received this long a ban? And how many didn't at all?
---
I'm surprised to see a 30 day honestly, I'd imagine this person was pretty egregious with it :o
---
Supply is inflated via layering exploit, demand stays the same, over-supply drives market price of exploited goods down.  
---
This is the effect of the exploit.    
---
Saying this will have little impact is incorrect as we don't know the scale of the exploit.  
---
Saying the impact will be for a short time is false as we don't know the scale of the exploit.
---
omg this is a exploit u should b banned smh
---
Wall walking was patched in 1.9.
---
Wall jumping was a thing for a long time after, and is noticeably absent due to 1.13 being based on the legion client.
---
The guy who was killed had been stealing skins for over two hours. He wasn‚Äôt making any attempt to do his own killing, just griefing Leshraque and I expect griefing others as well.
---
Confirm. Hillsbrad is nasty and I‚Äôve found badlands occasionally wild. Stv has been pretty good still
---
my third comment? no. lol also how is bitching about people leaving mythic dungeons not valid? dont queue up if you're gonna leave.  dont be a moron kid.
---
ElvUI or TukUI. Either will give you this effect if set up correctly.
---
There is legitimately a guild called &lt;BUTTHOLES AND WEINERS&gt; on Blaumeux Alliance.
---
&gt;  Take out points from my improved aspect of the hawk 
---
Always keep 5/5 Imp AOTH. It's one of the best talents in the tree.
---
So getting a free reset and a extra week of loot was just a bonus? Could of left the loot if u had integrity...... u knew exactly what u were doing.
---
Incredible.
---
LOL +1
---
That‚Äôs so petty lmao
---
this is unfortunately very true. at least the man got his croc skin...
---
Since wow is free to level 20, do you even need to own the game to play classic or do you just need a new subscription?
---
What kind of hotspot do you use? Off of your phone or a separate device. Been looking for something to use at work.
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25179-ServerFriendsOnly.html
---
Thanks fellow priest!
---
Ya i do realize that but that still doesnt take away form the fact that BfA isn't good and they ruined what they did with Legion.
---
Ah sorry I misunderstood the gist of your post then. However I disagree that only a small number knew it - this will heavily affect the economy. Most of the people held back items from AH to not make it obvious something was wrong, if you take a look now there's tons and tons of high end recipes for very little money.
---
Like others said, it's not really the same as the common ninja move reaction to taking drops from bosses and such or master looting them suddenly at the end to a buddy.  It's just a dick move in general.  Like watching that mage about to pyro a mob to pull and then a warrior runs up from behind, charges and tags it.  Dick moves but not ninjas.
---
Well you are easy to mess with
---
So, think about it this way.  If you're one of the people who will do anything to get ahead, are you still going to want to play when you're a month behind?
---
Hell yea man, thanks a ton
---
As long as you get that skin, you win!
---
It's better than nothing, but really?? At that level??
---
 I think every person has once made a group of macros just like this to annoy randoms :D
---
Sorry to hear it, it really does take a lot of the fun out of classic. Best thing we can do is try to make some noise about it I guess.
---
Why exactly would this piss anyone off? Sorry, anyone who doesn't have a stick up their butt, an IQ of 70 or an incredible feeling of entitlement?  
---
You're aware that hunters use mana in this version of the game right?
---
Could make an add on that did this - so long as everyone has the add on.
---
ELI5?
---
Checking in. Thought the ah would slow down by now but nope profit margins are brutal
---
Could definitely be worse, but hopefully there will be some sort of fix in the future. Definitely don't feel like rerolling at this point lol
---
Innervate is used twice on long fights. Use it the second that the mana won‚Äôt be wasted and you get a second use.
---
Ah, gotcha. I'm at 3 days, 10 hours rn. I only played WoW for the 2 week trial back in like 2007, so I forgot everything. I didn't even know about addons until a few days ago, that's cut my quest times down quite a bit. I guess if I remembered classic WoW and was good at it I could level up significantly faster.
---
Ok never mind then
---
Zandalar Tribe (EU RPPVP)
---
After the reset today i was getting empty loot windows from non-pool fishing. I tried Tanaris coast, Feralas inner and costal, and Hinterlands inner and costal. It still skills you up though. The pools finished only dropped stranglekelp and mithril bound boxes.
---
Next time it happens open trade with them, it will cancel his action.
---
If those work in combat, you've solved my problem. I would even message someone over at Wowhead to see if those could be added to the rogue guide. The thing with the double press is because of that GCD. It was put in place to keep rogues from swapping to a sword in the instant they cast ambush. I'm sure you can imagine the damage difference there lol. Thanks a lot man.

i don't get why people act like wow streamers don't get banned or suspended. haven't they heard of swifty, athene, reckful? they don't give content creators any sort of special privilege and never have. the reason the big top streamers don't get banned is because quite simply... their entire livelihood is based off of playing world of warcraft so they don't do things that would put them at risk of being banned.

Well aren't you a peach.
---
Best course of action would be a complete item forfeit and no ban; not even a single minute!
---
Not even a single minute say you?
---
Yes, exactly! Just let them continue to play... but stealth nerf all the chars on the account to do 20% less damage and healing permanently but don‚Äôt even announce it! NOW THAT WOULD BE EPIC!

Blizzard "We fuck up, you pay the price!"

That‚Äôll do? More like my everyday ms...

Is it possible to create a macro that toggles between pet follow and pet stay? I don't think castsequence can accomplish that, but I'm curious if there's another way to do it.

How are people able to exploit layers in instances? I was trying to kill a guy for a quest in Badlands and kept getting ganked by an alliance 60. A friend invited me to a group and it changed my layer. Does that count as exploiting?
---
Not really when it lets you farm rares, bypass mob spawn rates and get rare nodes. It's only different because it's generally less people doing it at a time. Still a crap system and why I've been against the fact layering hasn't had a significant CD associated with it from the get go.  
---
You're still abusing an in game system to save yourself time, it's just a few minutes instead of a day/a week. Still crap.

As a new healer I'm interested in hearing more about these mouseover macros

I'm saying I have a love/hate relationship with addons in WoW. If they were always option I would have no qualms, however over time Blizz started implementing certain features of addons into the games making it so there was no way to avoid them.

/moo from a fellow Tauren fren :D
---
It is your third post not comment. Do I need to screen shot it for you?
---
So I have a version of the all in one melee macro but it isn't working properly. Everything but mongoose bite is working. Anyone know why mongoose isn't (and yes I wait for when it says I've dodged, still not casting)
