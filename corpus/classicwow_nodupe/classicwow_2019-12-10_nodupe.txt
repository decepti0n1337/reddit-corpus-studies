I’m sorry too. Sorry no one liked your pour painting, that is

---
---
Did you maybe read over the first line?
---

---
&gt;we’re making a change to disallow calling C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage **with the CHANNEL ChatType**
---
Bolded emphasis mine.  Why would you assume official channels are safe from the CHANNEL chat type?
---
Just res and fight. Kill one or two before you go down again. Isn’t that the point of wpvp? If it’s a whole crew, then call on your friends to assist. This is supposed to be a group game.
---
Me and my guild would do it for free. I know another guild that would also switch. I think it can help
---
/thread
---
I agree with this completely. Rend is shit for tanking. Even for dps, it's only good if the mob is alive for the whole duration assuming you purchased max rank. 
---
I would like to add that after switching to defensive stance, I prefer to switch to 1h+shield. The whirlwind should be done with a 2H for max damage (threat). Once in def stance w/ 1h+shield, revenge is first priority followed by sunder armor while revenge is on CD.
---
&gt; That's what MMOs are about, not grinding dungeons.
---
MMOs are about everything social related. If a group of friends want to grind dungeons, they're doing what an MMO is about, If they wanna play pretend and one is RPing as a bartender at a bar location with active chit chat of 'whats going on in the world' all as if we were NPCs, that's what MMOs are about.
---
..As is cruising around like a warband of orkz lookin for a fite.
---
They are better honor, so it's going to go a long way.
---
Yeah i think plenty of horde wouldn’t mind changing to Alliance to help solve the issue. I wouldn’t either but i’m attached to progression with my current guild.
---
Same. Definitely helps that I’m on balanced server tho, but I love flying to Tanaris and wondering if I’ll be able to repair before I get nuked by alliance inside the city (I’m lvl 51 holy priest), love turning fights in our favor even after death with spirit of redemption, love trying to juke alliance omw to instance even if I don’t succeed. The world actually feels alive and dangerous and it’s just awesome for me.
---
I will try East, I have to hope it is easier to enter than blackrock mountain. I also could use Satyr's Bow for the 1% hit. They may even offer to let me do the mining
---
Keyring is nice but breaking spy is the real news here
---
[removed]
---
I think it affects the honor spy addon.
---
I’d go alliance if they’d give us dwarf shaman.
---
The old "I got a suspicion". This change won't do anything to Spy.
---
I guess it just makes pve an objectively easier difficulty level
---
Its 100% Pss lol
---
Helenius you fucking r word xDDDdddDDdddd
---
Yep, I have a job and no time to spend corpse running. Will happily but a transfer for me and my pals when those became available.
---
spy shouldn't be affected much, maybe sharing KOS lists.
---
honorspy should be dead, different addon tracks honor.
---
sounds logical, except that raid leaders might not like you speccing into arms for dps unless they are pretty casual.
---
People will quit or re-roll.  The end result is the same as a paid transfer.
---
Yeah definitely my mistake for not checking. I thought this fell into the whole “no changes” thing. They certainly haven’t put effort into anything else to support this game.
---
I hear that Flamelash is great (too soon?)
---
as said, Blizzard has control and therefor they need to crack the whip and enforce balance, rather than let players have choice.
---
enforced 50/50 ratio to the point of changing player-character races on the spot and deny access to opposite faction capitals, like an invisible wall or instant-death zone.
---
Its t1 indeed
---
No way... a freakin boomkin?! I'll gladly submit against such a rare beauty

You owe everyone in your country money for subsidizing your education with their tax dollars. And if your parents paid for a private education, you might want to get them a fruit basket or something as an apology for the profound waste of resources.
---
Almost every psychologist is on the same page: the evolutionary edge that humans have is our ability to recognize and predict patterns, our ability to cooperate/work as a team, and our ability to hypothesize — that is, to imagine scenarios and invent tools to address them. This is not long-term thinking, since most of those skills help you pretty immediately: you imagine building a fire to keep you warm through the freezing night TODAY, because you won't survive tomorrow. You develop a farm because your tribe has run out of berries to gather and has hunted the moose in your area to near extinction, and you don't really consider any of the consequences of your farm because you're getting hungry.
---
 These are not examples of long-term planning, because again, almost every psychologist is unanimous in saying that our ability to plan in a contextually long term (meaning, in context of decisions affecting a certain timeframe, humans will put more emphasis toward solving short-term problems in spite of long-term consequences) is very poor, and what is often held up as an example of " great long-term planning" by anthropologists (not psychologists) is in-fact just an extrapolation of short-term fight or flight thinking.

I took Blackstone off when I got Accuria and run BoA/ETR on my mitigation set
---
Do I look like I know what the hell a snapchat is, im just trying to get a picture of a god dang warrior here.
---
Bug/Lag?
---
I had a clip from me in old vanilla of a bug where I was stuck on my horse and able to enter combat and was fighting from horse back. Movement speed was my normal run speed though. A friend filmed it and we told guildies mounted combat was coming in TBC and here was the proof on me beta testing it.
---
Its not even updated to reflect the transfers yet. Since it takes raidlogs into consideration, its probably best to wait 2 weeks to see the impact. But i do think its not as big as 70/30 but i wouldnt be surprised if it ends up becoming 60/40 or 55/44.
---
but you said Nesingwary in the title?
---
&gt; The point was that your rhetoric is so dismissive of Horde's feelings or thoughts. Saying "is so infantile" shows that you see Horde players as infantile.
---
I don’t think someone’s infantile because they chose the red flag instead of the blue flag, I think someone’s infantile if their main point of justifying their actions is that they, apparently, are entirely incapable of free will. You’d certainly think this was the case when reading their “reasonings”, as they all seem to have one thing in common, and that is refusing to accept responsibility for their actions. Are *all* Horde players camping Ironforge (and other cities)? No, absolutely not, the vast majority are just playing the game like the rest of us and thus don’t have to take responsibility for the actions of their faction-mates. Are an oppressive amount of Horde players camping Ironforge (and other cities)? Yes, and it’s these people who are making the excuses, not your average Horde player. 
---
When I refer to the “but Blizzard made me do it through incentives!” excuse as “infantile”, I’m absolutely *not* calling every Hordie to ever exist infantile. I am simply doing as is clear, criticising the excuse. Yes, the problem *is* partially on Blizzard because of how the system is designed, but it’s difficult for them to fix it as the “no changes” crowd would go absolutely wild. In this way, it falls down to basic decency, the decency to not farm honour from lvl 40s and camp FMs. The whole “but I’m just playing the game and getting my rewards” argument is entirely valid, and entirely pathetic. 
---
Another Horde player in this thread jokingly commented “Victory!.. what now?” which I find to be very apt. I mean, congratulations on ‘owning the Ally scrubs’ with ~~superior numbers for gank squads and camping~~ objectively better players who are just amazing at PvP, but when they start to leave, you can’t just point your finger at Blizzard. I’m not blaming the Horde, I’m blaming the no-lifers that exist on both sides, but are especially oppressive on the Horde. It isn’t “darn Alliance whining” whenever an Ally meme highlighting in-game problems is posted, to write it off as such is *actual* dismissal.
---
Kidney stones.
---
I'll have you know I speak fluent moron, thank you very much.
---
No, I definitely agree with you on the fact that wpvp right now is a garbage-fire.
---
Human Rogue on Shazzrah here, only hit lvl 40 today and tbh I'm really struggling with the fact I should spend my gold on a mount or just give up on either playing a Rogue or playing the game at all.
---
I'm not in a guild and can barely find a group to do dungeons because they only want Mages for the AoE farming/grinding. If I do find a group, reaching the dungeon is itself is a pain in the ass because of the Horde ganking me (and the others) on sight.
---
Also, I think once the BG's are here later today, Horde will have huge queues in comparison to the Alliance, but I think they will absolutely dominate and be victorious most of the time because not only their better PvP racials, but because they will be having far superior gear.
---
I bet Alliance can forget the AQ openings as well.
---
:(
---
He is talking specifically about  streamers who use their communities to carry them. He didn't said that all streamers use their communities to carry them.
---
This would require faction balance to actually be the problem people have.
---
They claim it's faction balance, but all it is is a flawed honor system for world-pvp.
---
Last night my raid nearly wiped on golemagg, but me and 9 other survivors beat him from 20% by kiting his adds and smart cooldown use. It felt amazing, it was awesome, but it didn't even come close to the feeling of winning an on the spot raid v raid battle. Hell, it wasn't even as fun as the run to MC - us and another ally raid plowing through the brm campers then doubling back as they respawned.
---
If I got ganked every second I wouldn't want to miss those experiences. But I guess you're having more fun logging in once a week to do MC and maybe pick a couple of herbs.
---
His lion just glaring at him
---
I think the boomer role is reversed here, friend. Given Snapchat is the newer technology than screen recording software.
---
But, okay. Gottem I guess?
---
This will probably make People quit the game kn the extremely unbalanced servers, and then you have the same situation as if they were allowed to transfer to wherever they want, but just fewer total players.
---
The 90-10 servers are for me fucked beyond recovery.
---
The 60-40 ish servers can still be fixed by de reading numbers of logged in players or introduce layering again
---
Create a problem and sell the solution
---
Never used snapchat but what is the difference between using snapchat or just any messenger app where you can send videos, gifs, photos etc.
---
cool post subscribed. I also like the color red the most
---
You allies crybabies destroyed Flamelash, once a great balanced server.
---
Have you seen BFA? Or Legion? or Wod? And you still think they aren't total morons?
---
So, blizzard allowed transfers contributing to the problem by emptying the servers for alliance instead of allowing transfers to balance the server more, how is that not blizzards fault?
---
This doesn't break Spy in the slightest.
---
Game would probably turn out better if we're being real here (Obviously not saying they should do it, that'd be dumb). Seems as though the WPVP on PVE servers is where people are having the most fun.
---
Bad idea. Just reroll.
---
We are getting the nerfed version of AV from the end of WoW. Most AV's there lasted under an hour. 
---
With a pre made knowing what they are doing and up against pugs then yeah maybe 10 min is a bit short but 20-30 min for a win isn't unreasonable.
---
“This patch includes client support for paid character transfer which may become active at a later date”
---
Know what we never hear about? Flamelash.
---
Honestly a mystery what goes down on PVP servers.
---
No.
---
I’ve got a key for that
---
RP PVP ZT is alliance dominated 55%, not much right? Pretty balanced I'd say. We still get crushed on the horde side. It's completely disorganized and we just get fucked. There's a few times when we can do shit like when we destroyed aliance all night for azuregos but BRM is a shitshow all day tons of horde corpse running. It's even worse when you know we'd probably get in easily if we just ressed all at once and went in. All that to say, balance isn't all the matter :(
---
Evasion mount?
---
They need to do free transfers and faction changes to low pop realms.  And maybe even a double XP bonus to 60.  It's the only way you will get people to move to low pop alliance.
---
Is optimal spec even required for dungeon dps? A bigger concern is that tanking level 60 5-man content would be harder as fury than arms. So with fury, you might be stuck as a pure dps role everywhere and inferior at pvp to arms.
---
Still a huge assumption both factions are making about queues. I will be downvoted for this comment
---
Fainkdeath is a big memer, I doubt that was meant to be legit roll on the crown, he waited so long to roll too no way it was serious. On the off chance it was well he did wait for fucking ever to roll and asmon just gave it to the highest roller, can't really call that a ninja either way. Guy made a meme video about it ffs, I think he was just trying to clown McConnel in the first place. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpPFrchLb8s
---
I told ya, the stuff about talking shit then wanting to quit/transfer was true. Those are good reasons to criticize asmon instead of the made up shit and the overblown shit. Like people giving him gold, who gives a fuck? It's not effecting anyone else's gameplay why care? Also the original list said he relies on his viewers giving stuff which ya people give him a lot of stuff but he made it sound like asmon depends on his stream for gold/gear which isn't accurate. They just give him stuff and he says "ok, thank you".
---
Also I wouldn't call his "shameless raids" ninja looting, everyone knows that asmon will take everything he can use in those raids. It's basically just a run where everything he could use is reserved and people join of their own free will.
---
I think its a bug indeed, on my screen i was actually already dismounted. But my partymember Asselity saw me on my mount constantly, even in combat lol! Went all the way up to molten spire and back to south entrance on my mount before taking the screen. 
---
Haha mounted combat in TBC, that wouldve been a blast KEKW
---
It's not that it exists, it's that the batch is just too large. Two mages polymorphing each other is hilarious if it's an occasional rare thing. If it's routine, it's annoying. 
---
Currently, batch sizes are so large that, say, Omen of Clarity procs are getting eaten by the ability that procced them, rather than being used by your next attack. This is definitely weird, and affects how classes play.
---
Humor is even in the description
---
Awesome. Next up Grand marshal/high warlord? :p
---
Freaking Awesome work
---
No, you don't get it! We need updates on flamelash every hour on the hour!
---
You can just use the combat log for the exact same thing....
---
It's defined by the  amount of honor you gain relative to your faction.  Not some predefined number of honor.  Your rank points are defined each week.  Every week counts as incredibly important to your ranked standing.  I don't get where you think skipping a week of pvp ISNT detrimental to your pvp rank.
---
It doesn't seem like you understand that WPvP right now is giving the same rank points as bgs will next week.  It's relative mate it's not some reach X points system.
---
try being alliance priest vs 40%+ Undead enemies
---
Thats because it is an exploit and one should get banned for doing it :-)
---
He was recording it for his friends on Snapchat, not for you current year neckbeard
---
Mate one of his guildies did this so everyone must've done it.
---
&gt; overtuned bosses and 1.2 itemization
---
But not 1.2 talents. It's too big to underestimate.
---
I'm sure at least mid-tier guilds would have troubles in MC with 1.2 everything.
---
pretty much. rolling on a PvE server as alliance was my best decision wrt classic. had no issues leveling up, aside from some crowded zones, but it was nice and enjoyable. and if i ever wanted to wpvp, i can just flag and people will still attack me. there are still frequent raids on capital cities, so lots of potential there. we've even done organized wpvp with the horde on our server. plus, we still have competitive world environments around world bosses and such. i'm leveling my second and third characters now after getting my druid pretty close to bis (missing a few pieces of minor upgrades) and i'm having a great time. can't wait for p3 and BWL :D
---
Lol? You must not play a rogue or look at your screen often when fighting druids/rogues. This item is completely gamechanging and still busted a.f. its my #1 biggest issue with classic
---
It just can't come soon enough.
---
That would be you who is in the for the rude awakening. 1.12 av is super easy and fast
---
So is Battle Chicken bugged or not? Is it supposed to stand still and not follow you like other Battle Pets
---
Is this the "pvp on pvp servers" that I hear everyone talk about?
---
I mean yea it’s a both sides thing
---
That was also 2 people out trying to get kills. Not a full 40 man raid ganking redridge.
---
Finally some quality classic wow content.
---
Can’t wait to absolutely decimate the pvp players who have had no competition
---
are you trolling? Or are you just trying to spread the wrong info? Cause that person is right
---
A way your body gets rid of liquid waste
---
I mean... BGs are being added to the game tomorrow.
---
Honestly, raid logging gives me time to play other stuff and even now, BGs, not like i can do much as a resto shaman anyways. And i don't feel like swapping specs every time i want to run something/log in for raid or want to go clap someone's ass cheeks.
---
Had a rogue leave as soon as he got his T1 helm for Garr, like a month after classic release. The only time I've ever seen that happen, so yeah it's rare.
---
oh we didn't just stand still in one place, we controlled a large area and this was our good bye spot :)
---
Warriors compete for the threat best they can. We often got our fury tank recovering her.
---
Nuke in p2. Go crazy.
---
Full T2 bloodfang
---
You do need the faction specific riding for each rank 11 mount right now
---
Classic is a completely different beast than Vanilla. But thanks for admitting you don't play Classic so you don't know what you're talking about.
---
The only reason to pve in classic is to get fat lewts to dunk on homies in wsg with so i sure hope they do. Be a real waste of a perfectly good hand of rag.
---
I mean... banned is a bit harsh. I’m a fan of all the weird buggy stuff that goes on like this in classic. All of it. It just doesn’t seem like this is an intended feature
---
For a reason that game should be playable with all that stoopid world pvp and avg server pop x3 of classic?
---
Wonder why blizz stick with only 1 shard per zone
---
We dont sell loot in our raids, Any proof on this or we take your word for it?
---
Yikes 😂👌👌👌
---
Or make it only from dominant faction to lesser faction. It may not fix big faction imbalances like 30/70s but it would help for those that are close like the 40/60s or 45/55.
---
But you still recorded it on your phone in potato quality even with all that preperation
---
Or the meme is accurate. 
---
The player base told Blizzard to not change anything to the game. To do as little meddling as is possible. 
---
Layering had a ***HUGE*** backlash in this community and others but it was necessary for the game to actually launch successfully. So Blizzard took that as a sign to leave things as they are. 
---
Blizzard does have ways to fix these issues that you're having and it's been in the retail version of the game for quite a long time...but...
---
well ok, then there is some time between us. I got my rank11 before the bc patch hits. And at this point I didnt need any exalted faction to ride the raptor. Thats my experience.
---
Not gonna lie, Krampus Crew would be a pretty good guild name.
---
Gankin ya
---
Fun for me so why no fun for you?
---
yeah too bad us rogues wont be able to one bang people with barman shanker prior to attack power normalization :(
---
Every raid should have at least one mage that has iceblock because of winterchill, probably even more than 1 so you can stack up the debuff quicker because the fights last so short and the debuff has twice the chance to miss.
---
The majority should be arcane frost as you said though since invuln potions aren't that expensive to drop threat.
---
They can say it's cheating till they are blue in the face, doesn't mean jack shit if they don't do anything about it.
---
&gt;This patch includes client support for the Paid Character Transfer service, which may be enabled at a future date.
---
And now the disabled free transfers make sense, called it.
---
How do you get your text to do the end bit? PC only?
---
I put a more in depth explanation in the description of the video: When Sword Spec/Thrash Blade/Hand of Justice proc they make it so your next auto attack will generate an additional attack. When you use Gouge/Feint/Sap or the macro in the video you never do an auto attack, so the charge never gets consumed. You can stack these charges up to 5 times and when you right click someone it will use them all at once.
---
No it was late technology. But they absolutely came in vanilla.
---
Was such a godsend on my imbalanced, low pop server (even though it was still "medium" pop it was still really low that you couldn't really do BGs)
---
Dominos is great
---
  /pvp and you can’t die in your own city. Also roll on PvE server...
---
It was announced as "the week of December 10th"
---
Indeed you do, have fun alone haha
---
And if it wants to work with nearby non-grouped players, it can use the new Yell function!
---
Uhh blizzard has historically sued a lot of private servers for their money, why would they be thanking them?  I guarantee most people playing classic now haven’t played private servers in ten years if at all.  Blizzard only has pressure from stockholders to make more money, and that’s where their bottom line will always lie.
---
Think of how many DKs she got from Teldrassil.  No wonder she lost her Warchief rank.  Girl is bitter af.
---
Looks like weapon procs which generate an additional swing are not immediately used up when combat is exited as soon as the swing goes off. Thus they are being 'stored', incorrectly.
---
&gt; Are all Horde players camping Ironforge (and other cities)? No
---
Then attack Hordies on a player to player basis. It still sounds like you are suggesting that it has something to do with people who choose to play Horde or something...
---
Look. BGs are coming out... what... tomorrow? This argument is moot when they come out if you ask me. I think people who didn't play beginning phase wow when it first came out aren't the same people who are playing now. People who are bloodthirsty for PvP will mostly be satiated in the coming weeks. Will it be completely resolved? No. But I think the mass amount of ganking going on is due to boredom from really thirsty PvP players. 
---
&gt; I’m absolutely not calling every Hordie to ever exist infantile
---
Your rhetoric sure suggests that you think that. Maybe you don't actually feel that way, but your wording is very antagonizing towards the players themselves. I agree that people can take personal responsibility... but I still don't get how that is the fault of the Horde in general. Maybe more shitty people play horde, but doesn't mean Horde turn them into shitty people. I chose Horde because I wanted to play Tauren... not because I wanted to gank lowbies.
---
My guess is that BG availability will mellow out a lot of problems people are seeing now, but the super unbalanced servers might still be fucked.
---
Sweet I’ll try this when I get home! Thank you.
---
People like you seem to have a overly glorified sense of some sort of "pure" realm community. I don't even really understand what the reason would be. Having played vanilla before and after cross realm bgs was initially introduced I can honestly say it did absolutely no damage to it at all. 
---
Bgs are such a small part of what the world actually is and it always felt like something outside of it, that is not where your community is formed or broken.
---
They can atleast do this with the lower pop realms.
---
Gives me something to do while I wait in Kargath for 2 hours before raid. Then I just fly to burning steppes and walk in the back door with no resistance. 
---
Best of both worlds.
---
TRU i forgot about that proc shadowfoot stabber ftw can probably get away with shanker in bgs tho
---
People camp the spirit rezzers in a lot of higher level zones, horde and ally.
---
So wait, you're blaming flamelash horde for the state of the server?
---
Just sit in IF with pvp off and watch the horde scream in agony as they pre all over wanting to kill you
---
&gt; data is synced across "RAID", "BATTLEGROUND" and "GUILD" channels, so when you play on BGs you transmit and receive data from your teammates. And all the time you exchange your data with your guildmates.
---
doubt it
---
What I get from this is basically any weapon, talent or spell that has a chance to proc an extra attack/swing can be stored (up to 5 extra attacks) and be released all at once, just like paladin's Reckoning.  
---
So basically what you can do is load up extra attacks (using Thrash Blade for example) by proccing them from abilities that stops your auto attack (i.e. doesn't do white damage) such as Gouge.
---
I help horde kill mobs when they’re about to die. I’m a paladin.
---
Problem is that people stop playing too, so if horde had long Qs at first and transferred off, then players leaving the game could still induce imbalances between factions now 2 months later.
---
Par isn’t bad if you suck at golf.
---
My guild needs a Priest to go Power Infusion / Shadow Weaving.
---
 * Can I heal 5-man level 60 dungeons with no talent points in Holy?
---
 * Or should I be a DPS instead of a Healer in 5-man dungeons with this build?
---
 * Any suggestions on talents for someone who wants to be able to do 5-mans and maybe PvP alongside raiding? Here's what I'm thinking: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/501212130505051--50105211005
---
Don’t listen to them this was legitimately some great info bro thanks
---
And he can always emote back at the other faction if he ever get a black lotus picked in front of him! Neat!
---
Roll Flamelash, anything is possible!
---
The fact is the if people are going to abandon the server they will abandon the server.
---
Limiting paid transfer won't save the affected servers it will just change the reason it dies. People will leave by other means its too late to try and fix the imbalances unfortunately.
---
Short of something massive like merging servers.
---
Stop
---
Why would they allow the small faction to change. Imo if they do it for balancing the smaller faction should not be allowed to leave
---
If you have multiple raid teams then yes but if you only have 1 or 2, no. There is no reason for a GM to ONLY know what is going on by the raid leaders.
---
There is literally no excuse to rely on bias information as your sole source.
---
go Cb prep with hemo and you can just use your sword
---
They've tried that. Horde largely do not seem interested in transferring to a server where they are the hunted.
---
Not directly.  Turning in 3 tokens gives XP.  Also AV has several quests associated with the bg, those all give XP.
---
All this drama about all this PvP nonsense and I'm just sitting here in my PvE server having a blast.
---
I'm saying it killed faction balance on servers even more.  There's a reason servers were so overwhelmingly destroyed through bc that blizzard had to break alliance racials in wotlk.  Paid transfers are a contributor to that
---
You posted this shit copy paste 12 times. Repeating it doesn't make you any less wrong.
---
I dont get it.  You know you cant grief inside capitals right?  They are uncontested zones so no pvp even on pvp servers...  He isnt griefing anyone by being at ironforge he is just visiting the wasteland.
---
More like "we all knew paid transfers would be added at some point even before launch"
---
Does this have any uses besides the occasional meme kill? I would imagine that it would take a long time to store up charges with the low proc rate of these items.
---
He's speaking the language of the monkeys.
---
That...is a lot of space. But I guess if they add more keys to it, they're prepared? Interesting.
---
Please. Who is actually PvPing everyday that wants server only queues? Nty. I don't want to ****ing wait 30+ minutes for WSG. Cross realm BGs were in Vanilla.
---
Frapple please stop charging me every time I land at LHC....lol.  Thank you.
---
To be fair, camping Ironforge in Flamelash is dumb and some people still do it.
---
Use a ^ before each word. No spaces. The more ^ the smaller it gets!
---
It's true that the difficulty of vanilla was overstated by many, but it is true to an extent even in 1.12.
---
The leveling experience is far more brutal than retail. 
---
Dungeons are a bit more brutal because tanking and healing aren't as brain dead.
---
MC is easy, but it was never the hardest raid anyways. Everyone saying "omg 1.12 easy patcchhhh" is gonna get a bit of a wakeup call when AQ40 and Naxx drop.
---
lol if bg's gave exp, twinks wouldn't exist
---
Correct. All PvE servers do is make PvP voluntary. You can still flag yourself manually and stand in the middle of the Barrens waiting for some action if you really want.
---
The elemental invasion fire mobs are gonna have the low ele fire drop rate anyway. There probably won't be a big dip in price, as the majority of fire will still be coming from the Circle of West Binding
---
It's just depressing that people bother doing this shit, it's basically admitting you can't PvP and need to trade honor to get any reasonable amount of points.
---
You dirty, rotten, no-good...ah fuck it take yer upvote.
---
Not really. Shuffle around class abilities to reduce homogeneity, tweak experience gain to make leveling harder and spread quests around the atlas so you're not jumping from zone to zone in such a linear and predetermined way. That would already be an enormous step in the right direction.
---
Because it's absolutely horrible. You will not carry the flag and even if you do just switch gear and same for AV. Arms is still by far superior.
---
It probably won't stop them, but it might inconvenience a few. I'm generally okay with that as well as the honorspy issues. Seems like a win all round.

I use it to post in /world which is a user created channel.

And your comment was oh so subjective, "they are not missing out on anything" "They are getting the overall better experience". I gave you examples of things PvE players are missing out on, no subjectivity needed.
---
I can't find many comments from PvE'rs in this thread that aren't fully belittling and spiteful, if you're attacking people for no reason expect a little pushback.
---
&gt;Dude, if you were having as much fun as you say you were having, you wouldn't feel the need to comment this.
---
What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I'm not having an orgasm every team fight, I can tab out to reply to a dumb reddit reply every now and again. And how about why so many PvE'rs feel the need to make threads like this about how much better PvE is? Could it be they're so bored out of their skulls they have nothing else to do? Weird!
---
how dare horde players do the thing the whole phase of the game was designed to encourage
---
Yeah, that one might be a problem.
---
Getting worse unfortunately, horde have it pretty rough. But it's not unfixable yet. Maybe open horde transfers later to really make it good
---
It needs to be nuked.
---
Fuck getting raped eeevery twwooo secondsss
---
It is not difficult to do for any player wanting to do it.
---
Look into fishing.  Let's use The Barrens as an example. Raise your skill to 50+, grab some lures, and hit the Barrens coast line starting at Ratchet working south past Northwatch to the edge of Dustwallow Marsh.  From the Dustwallow Marsh / Northwatch border down to Theramore Island the skill required is 150+.  Further south in Tanaris the skill required is 225+.
---
Only fish the hotspots unless you are raising skill or actually enjoy fishing in game..  The hotspots come as circles labeled "oily blackmouth", "firefin snpper", "stonescale eel" and various types of "wreckage".  
---
You will catch the named fish, or rum, or stranglekelp, or a trunk.  The trunks can have small change, bolts of linen / wool / silk / mageweave / runecloth, leathers ranging from light to rugged, armor, and or weapons.
---
Fishing in Tanaris for an hour can yield between 10g and 20g in saleable loot and you can do it at level 20 with lures.  I have a level 26 druid that has paid for 4 bank slots so far, and has all runecloth bags.  I have a warlock that by level 40 had paid for all bank slots, had runecloth bags in all of them, and all bags on his person were mooncloth (~25g each on my server) and had paid for his racial mount to go with his class mount by level 42.  He had ~30g left at that point.  (Currently he is approaching 60 and has most of his epic mount cash stacked.
---
I would be less than forthright if I did not mention clearly that most people find fishing horribly boring and give it up quickly.

Note that I mention that there were several guilds, Venture were just the worst one by far.

The Horde on Flamelash DEFINITELY got pissed off mainly towards Venture and the other guilds that acted like proper twats.

Secondly, stop trying to turn this into some sort of fucking pity seeking post when it was a chronological account of WHY these things happened.

No there isn't

PvP to PvE transfers were in Vanilla.

I dinged 51 in Searing Gorge as i was getting ganked by horde. Once i dinged he stopped attacking me and congratulated me. He was gonna let me go but i moonfired him and then he changed his mind :(
---
People are awfully salty about WPVP Rn. 
---
What did you think a pvp server is? Obviously there’s going to be pvp. And no it’s not always going to be fair. This isn’t even a new problem, faction balance has been lopsided for a decade+. 
---
People pretending they didn’t know what they signed up for are cracking me up lmao.
---
Yeah the pve'ers that rolled on pvp servers sure do love bitching about it
---
Dwarf: You are already dead.
---
Alright, that got a laugh out of me.
---
Would have missed the epic camera flick into the surprise motherfucker level gank
---
Highly doubt they would do that. They aren’t that dumb.
---
I mean, it is a pretty big brain move to spam "G o to R e t a i l" and then cry about no victims left to gank. Even on my server, which ain't Flamelash bad, that spam is endemic.
---
What?
---
His stream being heavy on him killing Asmon is not "harassing Asmon"
---
Killing a big name player of the opposite faction is not "harassment" it's literally "Pvp on a PvP server". If his videos were him just spamming asmon or making fun of asmon with personal attacks that would be harassment. 
---
It happened in Vanilla too, we had a notorious horde player on our server who spent a long time ganking lowbies in redridge to the point that later on if people saw him around the world they'd spread word of where he was and he'd get camped for his actions. It's the same thing with Asmon, acted like arrogant talking about how he is going to run the server and put a target on his back.
---
TIL
---
Alone in IF today. "Onyxia head on bid". The BiS heal ring from Domo was sold for 300g in the raid I was in.  
---
I can give you a name, but I believe you know who it is.
---
Again, I  don't wanna tell you how to run your guild AT ALL, I'm just saying I find it scummy to do, no matter if you're a top guild or not. 
---
And it's the reason I personally don't wanna run with you anymore, no matter how good you are.
---
Edit: Its no longer on bid. But the bag was also a part of that poll for a while
---
Oh it’s not just horde. I’m horde on a SLIGHTLY higher alliance realm, and oh my fucking god the camping. It’s been one of if not the most toxic experience of my entire life. I played vanilla and never saw this level of toxicity. It’s unreal.
---
No they really aren't though
---
&gt; I haven't seen anything even remotely resembling some kind of best practice or strategy for leveling.
---
Check out the guidelime addon with the top guide plugins, basically autopilot for efficient questing. Cuts down on travel time significantly and only does the rewarding quests and chains. 
---
Questing with it I got a level every four hours or so all the way up to 60, not counting the low levels which were much faster. Or week one &amp; two of P2 which was a nightmare gank wise.
---
I figured stuff like that would happen. People know classic so they are done with everything much quicker so they get bored and PvP was much more fun back then.
---
Oh no he is in ironforge unable to attack anyone that doesnt first attack him! Whatever shall we do!  Griefing in capitals isnt a thing...  Im so triggered by this thread.
---
#nochanges
---
I still hope for (in German for example) only member from my country realms in my group and every other European server in the enemy team.
---
I’d recommend r/rule34 if you need a hentai sub
---
As far as painting subs, I can’t help ya. I think all the legit ones require talent so I’m not sure pour painting (which can literally be done by anyone) would make the cut
---
Blizzard could at the very least publish relevant population on each server. That would help people choose where to roll/transfer
---
Then continue being miserable by playing a game you don't want to play or quit.
---
This argument makes zero sense. There are TBC pservers. Go have fun. You don't like a game that told you EXACTLY what it was trying to be all along. So stop being miserable.
---
Not a pun
---
BGs are going to help. A lot. 99% of people are out there killing you because you are worth honor. BGs make world pvp honor gain a joke. 
---
IF horde queue times are long, which is possible even with cross-server, the sweaties will still be doing wpvp between queues. But most people won't bother.
---
Step 1: Stop breaking census addons.
---
I'll check windows crash log but it seems so odd to be that since its wow that is crashing, and not any other part of my pc or windows itself. Thanks again for the tip!
---
I remember that one. There was no guarantee that you’d all join the same match though.
---
For example, if you used the addon for queue all 40 of you, and 10 people were already in the queue,  only 30 of your group would get the queue pop. The last 10 would be left waiting for the next AV to pop.
---
&gt; The fact is the if people are going to abandon the server they will abandon the server.
---
If they were going to abandon the servers, phase 2 should have already driven them away.
---
faster kill times. When the MT doesnt get knocked back the melee dps can stay in for longer &amp; get better use from cooldowns I believe
---
This made LOL and I had to explain why to my wife. Very funny.
---
To be fair layering sucked ass. Had a lvl 60 warlock layer on me use soul stone and run away when the server was down to two layers. Layering was cool for the first month I’m glad it’s gone with most people hitting 60 in that time frame with at least one character.
---
Ah yes. Because people totally didn't use money on a character they could grow attached to, have guildies, friends, or just flat out don't like the aesthetics or lore of the other faction.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Oh Also what about Shamans and Palladins? Do they get a class change too? Cause at that point you may as well give out a 60 boost for opposite faction of your main.
---
Some people raid for fun, but don't want to carry dead weight. It's not binary.
---
Actually in Classic paid transfers are like a black mark, because that means you wore out your welcome on your old server and are now trying to escape your reputation. If money was the only object then they wouldn’t have let Phase 2 continue for as long as they have, because I’m sure it has cost them a fortune in cancelled subs.
---
Yeah I don't know man, I guess we have the same information and that's your take on things. I definitely stand by everything I said, but on top of that I think the one thing I dislike about Asmongold (and again, I consume his content and contribute to his paycheck so I don't really have a right to bitch that much) is that he boasted "the classic experience" for months. "Classic is going to be the BFA killer", "can't wait for the classic experience", "best game ever created", all that stuff. And I also understand that this is half the fault of him being the most famous streamer in WoW history as far as I know... But he didn't even come \*close\* to the classic experience. He was powerleveled, fed thousands of gold, funneled items and carried through dungeons. When he WPvPs he has 10 pocket healers and has an army behind him wherever he goes doing whatever he wants. Then \*after\* all that, he tells his fanbase (which honestly is probably 30% of classicwow at this point, whether or not people want to admit they watch him, a lot still do) that there's no content, the game is dying and he is perpetuating the very problem that the game is having and making things more divisive.
---
The way I see it is that a lot of players were hyped about classic because of him, which is amazing and the more players the better. But he's also setting the standard that ninja looting is acceptable, toxicity is ok (with some exceptions, like the Advertise thing, but like I said I think that was mildly scripted), and that the game is boring. Of course it's fucking boring for him! He hasn't had to earn \*anything\*. Maybe a stretch, but I also think it's akin to a spoiled child being given everything and then getting bored with his toys. In my opinion classic is all about the struggle, the grind and the hard earned chance at getting upgrades. After his very first MC run (in which he literally ninja'd an item and gave it to McConnell), all of the good feeling he could have gotten from gearing his own character and earning the gold for his mounts and enchants and levels and rep and honor... it's all being handed to him.
---
I don't know man. I'll continue to watch because he's an entertainer and even though it's cringey and I dont' agree with it, it is entertaining. But other than the parsing thing, I think that everything that guy said is 100% true.
---
EDIT: I'm not sure the video you posted was anything significant... it's a clipped together video, combining his words to make it sound like he's sorry? Which he clearly isn't or he wouldn't continue to do things like this. If you watch his MC raids he will roll out like... 2 maybe 3 items from each boss then silently just take the other ones and bank them. Have you seen his bank? It's filled with dozens of items that he just... wanted. Even though other people in the raid needed them and worked hard for them.
---
Official channels (General, Trade, LFG, LocalDefense, WorldDefense) were already disallowed from having addon messages on them. (Hence why HonorSpy had to make players join a custom channel)

And if they are for to reroll another server it doesnt make anything better. Nothing would change compared to a server transfer

~~They said you'll battle against other players from your region, which only rules out inter-region battlegroups. They haven't ruled out having multiple battlegroups per region afaik.~~

---
Yes. Absolutely. I work at Intel. I know how much things cost in this industry. Lol. 
---
but go ahead and get emotional
---
Never seen a rogue at the IF inn on my server. I guess my server isnt that bad after all
---
Hate to break it to you but the game's already peaked and steadily on its way downward. Now that the nostalgia fix has worn off people realize the endgame is too underwhelming to hold a modern audience. ~80% of my guild already raid logged before phase 2 even hit and the game started hemorrhaging players. How many people will want to keep paying $15 every month just to log on once a week? 
---
WoW is immersive and nostalgic enough that it'll always have a select group playing so if you go on one of the full servers (Herod / Faerlina) it probably won't die at least until Naxx is out. It'll never be a "dead game" in that sense, but wishing for it to stay anywhere near this popular is an exercise in futility because the faction balance problem will never go away now that people know Horde have better racials and a way easier time leveling
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
i'm just here waiting for the first post with horde 30min queue time
---
This photo should be titled "World PvE" because that's what it is.  The only reason alliance have to be there are if they're trying to gank solo horde on their way to BRM. Horde guilds just aren't dumb so they travel together to limit said ganking.
---
_Those dirty, deceitful alliance, always camping Kargath Pass to try to farm honor kills. Totally ruins the horde dungeon run. Nobody knows what it's like to just be walking to catch up to your raid on a slow mount and getting GANKED by a mean outnumbering group of alliance bullies. Gee golly, I sure wish Blizzard would do something about this toxic honor ganking in Kargath pass._
---
Reckon Oceana will split out of NA?

Probably just how it was back then as well. As far as I know keyrings were always just seen as "extends to however far is needed to hold all your keys", since nobody ever reached the limit.

Ideally you want your offhand to be 1.5speed or faster and have it do 300dmg a hit. In execute phase you get the rage to execute every time gcd is up, thus being able to just spam it.

Same on Whitemane.
---
What if, and hear me out... We merged the two realms? Let those groups of people have each other, lock it down, and quarantine it?
---
Spain got only 1 realm right? So they will have to play without a battle group?
---
"  they would go to the opposite faction "
---
You literally CAN'T. PvP servers make it so no opposite factions can be made on that server. Ontop of that your asking people who have dedicated time, money, and possibly have friends and guildies on there to transfer out, not play, or force other people to not play by remote desktoping in.
---
Right, and they represent the masses, and the argument is that the masses are idiots. 
---
Only when the ruling elite is in power is everything stable and proper. 
---
And in fact, according to the story, the elites being in power is literally the natural law of the world - the circle of life. 
---
The Lions are justified in their murder of lesser creatures because it's literally the law of the universe that they are in charge and get to kill the other animals whenever they want because, eventually, Lions die. Or something. 
---
It's a highly conservative movie.

Thank you for telling me that! If you can find out what it is, I’d be very grateful.
---
&gt; More like "we all knew paid transfers would be added at some point even before launch"
---
They existed back in vanilla. IIRC, after you used it you couldn't transfer for another 6 months after.
---
Same lol

You went into classic knowing exactly what it was going to be. This is the silliest rant I've ever seen. You can't go to a grocery store and buy oranges, then complain to managment because you don't like oranges as much as the others who are buying/ eating them. Maybe do some research on a he before you buy it and you won't run I to these issues. You've had 15 years to learn the facts, and make a decision.
---
You should maybe look on the alliance boats, if you count these players as well we might be back to 50/50
---
wow i didnt realize there were so many giant pussies on classic
---
Yeah I understand how resisting is helpful but that wasn’t quite my question. My question is about the FR cap. Everything I read says tanks should cap out at 315 because there is no benefit above that. One person in game suggested that going up to 350 provides additional benefit. So the question is whether or not going above 315 actually does anything or if there is a hard cap at 315.
---
I appreciate you taking the time to answer!

Can't they fear ward multiple people though? So it takes one dwarf priest in a BG to fear ward an entire team

Faction imbalance never was a design flaw from a manager's perspective.

"City invasions" in the sense of "my entire experience is being denied right now" do not exist.

Do raiding groups make their way into the cities sometimes and snag some kills? Yes. Do raids stick around in the city, murdering all the civilians so nobody can access the bank, auction house, reagent vendors, for a long period of time? No.

You literally **cannot** be griefed in a main city.

I tried reminding people of this, even citing the whole phase 2 early release"date"

There’s always time.

the toxic players are the ones relentlessly camping all over the world, not the ones getting paid transfers because they cant enjoy the game

Why don't Alliance make a group, xp to max level killing boars in Elwynn Forest and then try to kill this guy with a magic sword given by Blizzard ?

I'm Horde on a 54% Alliance server and it feels like we're crushing them most of the time, but as you mention I think we're better organized than the Alliance. So faction balance isn't everything.

Ah, fair enough was getting the servers mixed up.
---
I would have already quit the game on a PvE server.

On a PvE realm, I have been levelling flagged for PvP on all characters. I have had some really fun, fair experiences, with little to no ganking or corpse camping.

And please provide screenshots for everything you say cause anyone can make a comment about anything in the world without proof.
---
I see what he messed up, he went to sleep
---
Idk what how good can you sell it means. If you mean how much can you sell it for it’s gunna depend on the particular twink item you are selling, what class uses that item and how popular that class is for twinkling, as well as how many are floating around in circulation your particular server. No one is going to be able to give you an exact answer.
---
From the description: Zoning or switching weapons makes you lose your stored procs. 
---
You can do it with a 2h Sword Spec as Warrior if you want though.
---
getting a hardiness "proc" in a fight you are currently losing, can turn it into a win. In addition it only more easily outshines the active racials you mentioned (stoneform, escape artist, will of the forsaken) because it doesn't get put on CD after one use. It applies to any and all stuns from any number of sources. 
---
Infact one of the few situations where stoneform and escape artist are better are in a 1v1 duel situation, as that is where they are far and away the strongest. 
---
see now that makes sense, of course you are an orc. You don't ever really see the effects of hardiness, but you see the effects of alliance racials. It's classic confirmation bias based on your perspective. They hit a button and escape your bleed/hamstring. You hit 0 buttons and have a chance to just ignore their CC. Because theirs is active and you see it happen, you feel it's stronger. You just never see all the times hardiness has won you an engagement, or saved/prolonged your life.
---
But you’re horde, this must be photo shopped. I thought only alliance get ganked around here

* on pve server you can't do shit - if they are a better at tagging mobs then you are fucked

i'll stick to pvp
---
They could make it so that its a full faction switch on all your characters for the realm. I agree thats its not a clean solution but it certainly cant continue like. The faction balance will only get worse with paid transfers. Id rather people come up with a solution than just call it quits because this WILL still be a problem once AQ is out.
---
You beat me to it bro. Can we split his stuff?

That and the queue would come back. A lot of people transferred to lower pop realms to avoid the queue.

..With PvP for the sake of PvP, it really doesn't matter about the world, it could be a flat ground with  chokepoints here and there and it doesn't change anything.

But, I think we're just basically agreeing without wanting to seem like we are. MMOs are about social aspect.

No you won't, because I'll be in WSG.
---
I'd say a good estimate of AP contribution vs. weapon damage is *roughly* 50%. Depends on your gear.
---
A 17% boost to AP is *roughly* an 8.5% increase across the board. +5 weapon skill will on an otherwise statless rogue increase white damage by 18.2%. White damage is ~50% of a Rogue's damage. That +5 weapon skill will be responsible for ~9% increase in total.

Not as clear-cut as you might think, especially considering that the soft cap for weapon skill is +8 and you will likely have + weapon skill from other items, the bonus from +5 weapon skill can ONLY be as high as 9%.
---
Sunk cost fallacy. No, there is no way to transfer your current characters out. Honestly, just log into a pve server you like and give it a try. You don't have to delete or destroy any previous character to do this. Try it out, and level to 5, and consider your options. You won't regret it.
---
Will BGs have premade only queues? God I fucking hope so.
---
Oh yeah because Intel make a bunch of MMOs....
---
Infrastructure costs and converting code/getting the back end running would have taken an investment.
---
But they would have had to invest next to nothing in design and content creation and writers and producers. Basically the whole developing a game part....
---
What does Plato think about the difference between personal and personnel?
---
The only place they can go in the game is their starting zones and capital, and even then, only after waiting for the flag timer. A lvl 55 guard is a non-entity compared to a raid of 60s, and even then, guard spawns don't occur randomly, they're triggered by standing on civilians. 
---
'if you know people are killing everyone in the city don't hearth in', where should they hearth to?
---
I'd say they should set their hearth to another server.
---
oh boy lol, I wonder if this will be fixed or not. It is kinda situational and needs enough setup that you couldn't just keep doing it over and over in a BG.
---
Perhaps it's not relevant, but why do they need Power Infusion?  
---
31/0/20 suits you to be dps rather than healing, but you're going to be pretty bad without Shadow Form (and priests weren't great dps with it...).
---
Which brings me back to the question: why does your raid need a gimped slot so that one person can get a DPS boost?
---
There will always be a market for twink gear, because people who twink have alt-itis just as bad as anybody, and they’ll want to build a small army of twinks so they can play whichever class they feel like at the moment.
---
Let’s just say I started playing back in TBC and even a full expansion after battlegrounds were introduced there was still a huge market for twink gear.
---
In my opinion the price will go up in the future, because right now everybody is stockpiling it in anticipation of the BG release and the sudden demand that goes with it, but there will always be new people coming into the fold who will need to gear up too.
---
I’d rather just leave my sub inactive, I don’t have the energy to start fresh again
---
Yeah but most people don't know how to play, despite how easy it is.
---
“Thicc apes give large blumpkin to gmaster raw.”
---
Thicc was their GM back in 05 and the GM of their rival guild raw was who the drama surrounded.
---
Bg started to give exp at some point and it was atleast before cata. You can turn off the gain though.
---
PR speak ftw
---
Imagine missing out on the most exciting part of the game due to 3 weeks of hell.
---
Also works for those annoying Rogues that will sap you and wait rather than kill right away.
---
Either they know you can log out in 20 seconds and won’t bother being annoying or you’ll log (no log animation while sapped) and they’ll lose attention quickly. 
---
You’d think that they would know that I’m likely to log back in about 10 seconds later and wait but hasn’t been the case yet.
---
Still an annoying process but at least they’re not getting honor
---
...so you want the danger of being flagged... but you don't want the danger of flagging yourself up for fear that it might be dangerous?..... I don't get it.
---
I'm seeing great at-level worldwide pvp happening on our pve server, all the time, after about level 30.
---
Ah I see, my bad.
---
I enjoy seeing flame lash refugees crying tho
---
You can have his 12 copper ores if I can have his stack and a half of wool cloth.
---
And what realms should they merge, exactly?
---
There is no such thing as Ironforge corpse camping. Those posts are just lies. 
---
The rest of your post is just a strawman.
---
Yeah, wouldn't be surprised if people flood to servers like Grobbulus. It's certainly on the top of my list of servers to transfer my alt to.
---
Kazzak is easier for ally to get to, just like azur is easier for horde to get to. Kinda depends on how many summoners you have there, and sheer number of people logged out.
---
Let's see the effect BGs have before predicting future problems. People weren't quitting in droves before the honor system, the reason imbalanced servers went from "annoying" to "unplayable" was all the people out farming honor, 95% of which will now just be in BGs (5% of the sweatier ones will still try to wpvp between queues).
---
At this point, that is the fix.
---
There is no way to solve imbalance now. All they can do is try to retain subs.
---
&gt;Because to me that random pvp IS the game.
---
I think a lot of people went PvP with the premise of "the chance for random PvP makes leveling in contested zones interesting, plus at 60 I could partake in some of the hotzones! (Morgan's vigil, Hillsbrad, Booty Bay)
---
Nobody expected to be killed over and over to the point where a party of enemy players is waiting for their res timer to be up so they can kill you once again.
---
Honestly rather theyd be free, the thing is you want raiding guilds to swap. If you can get that, thats 40+ people for each guild you can get and its easier to convince people to do so when its free.
---
Sounds like a low pop server, in which case I'm sure its not so bad.
---
A balanced high pop pve server would in all probability never down Kazzak.
---
A) vanilla also had a period of time with the honor system and no BG's.
---
B) it really doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what will happen if there's an honor system with no BG's in place.
---
So no I don't think the experience of people on private servers was at all relevant to people knowing how much of a cluster phase 2 would be on pvp servers.
---
Where is this from lol
---
Exactly, they inject themselves into a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with them
---
We killed rag last night with 32, it’s ntb atm, but can see Low numbers being a bit of a prick in the coming phases
---
I thought CC was capped at 15 seconds?
---
But EVERYONE does it and they always have. /s
---
Ok... but can I get those silverleaf? I need to make some pots.
---
"A level 55 gaurd"  youve never raided a city have you.  Try dozens.  And you kill one it respawns.
---
No I got the joke it's not funny to me, just sad, sorry.
---
IMO for dungeons Death Wish and Flurry are at least equal to if not better than a 30 rage Sweeping Strikes every 30 seconds.
---
Literally none of those are hard fixes.
---
Its not about fear or anything like that ..... thats purely your own speculation and "pride" that you arent "afraid" to roll on PvP servers.
---
The reality is that classic is not vanilla... the community is different, back in  the real vanilla on PvP servers people didnt mindlessly   gank others and cause Flamelash-situations (im sure its not the only server  as  weve seen)... it never happened.
---
In this modern age, people are  far more toxic and competitive... and this faction supremacy-thing is far stronger so all  the kids who think they  are good are  ganking everyone to "make a point". And then whine about not getting honor because they dont know what diminishing returns are.
---
I leveled my warrior in Darksorrow PvP in the real vanilla and i have  no memories of death-squads of anykind.
---
Your reasoning in bringing private servers into the discussion is pointless as they  are extremely niche servers... almost noone plays on private servers anyway and those who do know  exactly what they want. The peak on some of the most popular pservers in the past years have been what... 10k players? per server TOTAL. And now in classic we have millions playing... 10k is nothing compared to a million, let alone multiple... atleast at launch we had many millions (as blizzard reported) but now we have less but still far  far more than any pservers have ever had.
---
So the community is different between  real vanilla and classic but also between  pservers and classic. Pservers are nothing compared to classic, and ive played on many so im not even trying to paint them better than they actually are.
---
PS. on my pve server right now we have hillsbrad PvP every single day in the evenings, its up to you if you wanna join or not... both  sides have 20+ players  there  fighting to rank up. Some are  even rank 8 atm as far as ive seen.
---
Never 4 head
---
well who the fuck isnt? I guess all successful streamers are dipshits yet you spend so much time talking about them. jesus what a loser.
---
Flamelash alliance: *leaves the instant horde gets the upper hand at anything*
---
Flamelash alliance: why would the horde kill this server
---
Farm elemental fire.... that’s all I’ll say. It will get you there quick. But also for future reference. Don’t waste money on professions while leveling, unless that’s just what you like to do. Vendor everything you pick up and go back out to fill your bags!
---
Yes it did.
---
I love all the people who have literally questioned their decision to roll pve until a week or so ago. Now a couple months of stress over their decision has been validated and they feel liberated. Lol.
---
I got it at 45 lmao
---
Is it bug?
---
very reasonable video
---
therefor reddit will downvote
---
Some people myself included are still raid logging in the hope that bgs will fix it.
---
I don't believe they will but I hope they do.
---
This was made for him and his friends. He posted it here because it turned out funny. Get over yourself
---
You’re* 
---
I mean, I showed i can press buttons just fine when I want, I also enjoy playing arms and my guild doesn’t force a respec, so I get to play how I want, have fun doing it and not worry about my actual numbers. I didn’t tout a great magmadar parse, and I didn’t ask what your numbers were on any of your parses, dude told me to sack up and post my orange rag parse and i did.
---
There is legit no content before phase 2 once you have prebis apart from farming gold for phase 2. And then phase 2 didn't have shit unless you cared to start your ranking grind. Arguably the worst part about classic wow until we hit BG's and bwl and so forth
---
I really don't understand. When organising raids for the guild, why would you need a custom channel? From my understanding the only benefit is that the custom channel would allow non-guild members to sign up. That functionality isn't entirely useless, but certainly it wouldn't suddenly make the addon be considered useless/broken.
---
There is a pretty solid amount of alliance on stalagg. I don’t think you have played the game in the past week if you think otherwise.  Obviously there is an imbalance but if you think it is worse than something like Skeram, you clearly haven’t been paying attention
---
Yeah why wouldn't they? It was OP for leveling melee lvl 50+ back in the day too. Although probably well deserved since melee leveling is much slower overall compared to other classes.
---
It was a little harder to get prior to the AV revamp where you had to kill Korrak instead. There was never a point it wasn't in the game. Wouldn't make sense to take it out.
---
At peak hours right now, there are 6 alliance in orgrimar
---
Please. The honor farming in vanilla during this period didnt hold a candle to what was experienced in both Classic and private servers  
---
Sure it might be easy to predict , but actual first hand experience does lend credibility to a prediction, whether you think it or not.
---
Erm it’s pretty easy to duo farm dm:e with warrior pally too.  You can just los the sacrifice on 2nd boss - sure grounding totem is easier but it’s not required at all.  Third boss is easy cheese.
---
I’ve farmed this instance duo with a warrior friend about 100 or more times since it came out.
---
hahahahahhaahaha
---
&gt;he says, having never developed a game of this scale
---
&gt;you'd get laughed at.
---
Sweet summer child, I played U.O. There isn't a situation in WoW where someone can take literally everything you own in game from you. I've been there, done that, and had it happen to me. I understand the thrill of "open world PvP" but honestly, if someone 10-20 levels over you sits on your corpse till you log or play another character, that person is an asshole. And I prefer to only play with assholes that can't ruin my gaming experience more than taking loot I want. 
---
&gt;If you don't like that part of the game, and it feels like harassment or grief to you, maybe you should play something else.
---
Also, GTFO of here with that BS, "If you don't like it quit" is the mantra of childish edgelords.
---
People may not have anticipated how bad it was going to be.  
---
People may have simply gotten busy.
---
People may have just logged off until BG's, then heard about the exodus and logged in to find that everyone they knew left.
---
There's a myriad of reasons people didn't leave.  The false dichotomy you're making is precisely where you assume to understand the customers intentions with what it is that they want, and you seem to think that by thwarting that, everything is going to be hunky-fucking-dory.
---
Kek
---
That's against the rules, at least it was in vanilla.
---
I guess I can see how they might just see it as a means to get gear and don't care if it is pvp or not. 
---
There is this rogue on my server who is on almost all day and just sits in Kargath, kills an afk person, dies, and repeat. How could that person look at their rank and have any kind of pride or think that they are 'good' at pvp?  
---
  
---
The honor system is crap and the truth of it is that most of the high ranking players you are seeing now gained that rank in the most efficient / least honorable way possible. (This is how it was the first time around too. I got a decent rank and I'm absolutely terrible at this game. However, I was able to get in with a pvp guild and we would farm pugs all day long.)
---
That's fuckin great, that dwarf BETTER acknowledge that ding and be cool. Anyone who ganks after that is a total piece of shit.
---
&gt; He's not advocating for it to remain in the game, he's explaining why there's no way for Blizzard to remove it.
---
Coming back around for my victory lap.
---
&gt;  With [the release of World of Warcraft Classic 1.13.3 9](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-1-13-3-patch-notes/384542), we’re making a change to disallow calling C\_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage with the CHANNEL ChatType. This will prevent addons from communicating over custom, player-created chat channels. 
---
This breaks Spy/Honorspy which uses p2p communication, on top of the chatrange nerf in the patch. He was talking out of his ass, just as I said. I'll take your apology in however you wish.
---
Dun, dun!
---
Lol you’re so triggered, this was fun
---
I can provide a screenshot, and I can provide a name. I would much rather send it to you privately since I don't think I should just call the name out here.
---
Gbid? As in the guild gets the gold? If so, then no.
---
If this "on bid" then yea. Domo was on bid (adverticed). I joined it because I just wanted to get some gear, but I wasn't expecting that kind of gold (mainly my own fault).
---
The raids I'm talking about are PUG runs. But that ring for example started on 350, "that's a bit much, 300 instead".
---
If that's the way people wanna run, then sure. You live and you learn. Also the reason some people stop running with this person.
---
No matter how we look at if it's still selling items, even if we knew it was gonna be on bid. It doesn't matter if it was advertised, and in the long run, that's all I said.
---
K lol
---
YOROKOBU!
---
Shadow Weaving would boost the damage for every warlock in the raid, it's pretty common for a priest to switch to this build to be a utility healer basically.  Increases clear times in raids significantly.
---
Ehh, maybe a 3% chance
---
Actually you can. resto shaman is still one  of the most useful healers in pvp. (you dont even have to respec)
---
You can drop windfury totem and all the melee in your group will go to town... windfury makes them near overpowered!
---
Tag along with a warrior or two and youll make a huge difference in any BG.  You just need to stay further back then them... also if you get yourself full Mail armor you will have alot more armor than any other horde-healer in the game which makes you survive better against rogues and warriors. (shield also gives significant boost to this)
---
Trust me itll be fun... just dont imagine killing anyone, be the support your team needs. Purge is op  and windfury is incredible, for your teammates.
---
Get full t3, build a reputation for being a good player both factions respect
---
Except faction balance doesn’t matter for shit in pve servers
---
 
---
This breaks Spy. That dude was talking out of his ass and y'all bought it hook line and sinker. I'll take your apology in however you wish.
---
Nope, Asselity is wearing t1 fellheart gear from MC.
---
Actually guildmate that was in my party got HOJ ninja'ed from him after establishing he'd get it in the beginning. The guy got a temp.
---
pvp is half the game, pve is the other half.  there's a per-realm community aspect to each of them.
---
after the short leveling cycle, the pve community is typically split into a bunch of guilds that meet once or twice a week to raid.  they use the world to run to dungeons and raids.
---
the pvp community uses the world as their dungeon, this is where we are right now in classic.  
---
after adding battlegrounds the pvp community leaves the world and lives in battlegrounds.  
---
after adding crossrealm there is no pvp community.
---
Oh, in that case im not quite sure. It could be that its a diminishing on any fire resist over 315 (soft cap), so extra helps but maybe just isnt worth as much as the initial 315
---
Thanks a lot for this part. Too bad I'm still Arms, and I'm not really excited of respeccing (into Prot at least) any time soon.
---
I’ll never roll on a pvp server again.
---
In the grand scheme it’s basically useless in the scale people were doing it at. Like teams of 5 each taking turns killing each other. But then again the majority of the world PvP farmers who were trying to get rank 14 via world PvP even after blizzard said they’re releasing bg’s in 2 weeks are sort of the special ed kids of wow PvP grinding anyway. So of course they would go the extra mile to special town and violate tos for extremely limited benefit.
---
That's the joke.
---
Nice. The introspective ability of an overweight guy blaming the existence of cake.
---
I agree. I’ve mostly played PvE servers, and PvE players are more about raiding and leveling alts, with occasional PvP during “Warsong Gulch Weekend” or whatever, when honor was doubled and to break up the boredom.
---
All I know is I’ll be joining in the fun, so you can count on me being in the queues.
---
Ive been wanting to see a Boomkin tank myself.
---
&gt; The real issue is trying to find realism in a cartoon...
---
Are you implying a full length, million-dollar feature film can’t reflect on real-world societal issues just because it’s animated?
---
&gt; The world just doesn't understand the genius of BossyBlastBismallah. Tell em now, and tell em again later. It is important.
---
This breaks Spy. He was talking out of his ass, just as I said, crazy isn't it? I'll take your apology in however you wish.
---
Omae wa mo shinderu
---
Skeleton keys
---
Yeah, thats kind of the plan, even with the somewhat limited range, i've got the tier 1 set bonus that adds a bit of range to them too. 
---
But more in a WPVP sense where you're more likely to be roaming and i just can't really see random healer running around being fun.
---
I'm fucking hyped for AV tomorrow though, and the other one too, i guess, but AV has always been i don't know, magical? I love that BG.
---
Winterspring Frostsaber and Tier 3 for my Gnome Warrior. I need to hit 60 first though.
---
I dunno, i just ran onto the ramp from burning steppes into BRM but never dismounted on my buddies screen. I did dismount on my screen tho
---
lol
---
If you're close to 40 and need mount money or want an easy farm in general just go for elemental earth. They aren't usually on lock down but maybe on the higher pop servers. It's generally better than farming ele fires since ele earth can be farmed in multiple zones mid 30s. My server they go for 1.5-2g each and they will only get more expensive as we get closer to AQ
---
Nani?????
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/atiesh/teh
---
Your best parse average is 65.3. Your best garr is a green parse. This does not show that you can press buttons well. Your rag parse is 7.1 cast/min on MS. Thats not good. It is similar to your poor perf on other bosses. You didnt play better on Rag.
---
It ends up a purple parse only cause many many guilds struggle with aggro on rag and melee cant go all out. 
---
This just says your tanks know how to do rag. 
---
And that you dont know how to dps.
---
Lmao
---
Wow all those people saying this addon was LITRUHHLY IMPOSSIBLE to disable who downvoted me to kingdom come when I said they definitely would...turned out to be totally full of shit armchair script kiddies. Crazy, a bunch of people on r/classicwow with severe Dunning Kreuger.
---
Good change, and good catch.
---
Yes, let people on some servers need to wait hours for BG queues if they have a huge imbalance so Sorgenflex here can kill the same player over and over.
---
Everyone on the server using honorspy*
---
filthy orcses
---
If this was an alliance post, they would be calling PvP unfair and would rage quit.😭🤣 
---
"I want to speak to the PvP manager!"
---
yeah okay buddy
---
That’s awesome! What server did you roll on?
---
*Negative.*
---
hahahaha this is fucking amazing
---
I just think it’s funny how many people actually thought WPvP in classic was going to be fun... the r14 is horrible and rewards people being able to farm the opposing faction for 12-16 hours a day. Most people can’t do this. There aren’t really objectives besides kill people in classic. This is why so many games since classic have done it way better, but the fun part of classic was the scale and feel of the world while leveling, especially on servers that were fairly even populations. 
---
I just log on to play a game all my friends are playing, kill rag and then call it a week.
---
Is this a world pvp shitshow like azuregos and kazzak?  And is there phat lewt?  I guess that's the same question, but...
---
100% incorrect, read above on priority or a quick google will give u the method
---
*narrator: and then they raped him.*
---
I feel I was very calm and articulate in my reasoning.  I apologize if it came off as a rant.
---
It was, glad I got the last laugh and last word in so you can just go back to dressing up your bois ☺️
---
&gt;Doing so has several benefits. It puts all raids on an equal playing field during those initial resets, which means a more accurate measurement of a guild's skill and preparation for the content. 
---
I don't play WoW to measure my dick against other guilds I'll never see.
---
If people are willing to put the time and effort to get buffs/flasks/elixirs, they should be able to use them for BWL, the same as any other instance.
---
Of wrath boes came after first rag kill
---
I dunno man, alliance has always bitchslapped me for the past 15 years in PvP. But I AM pretty awful haha
---
Limitless.
---
It worked! Thanks again.
---
No that is actually tier 3 lol. Look, https://www.wowhead.com/transmog-set=666/plagueheart-raiment. Look at the gloves, robe, shoulders. That is unmistakably tier 3 and tier has always had a unique model so there are no lookalikes (at least pre-BC which BC did have lookalikes, albeit different colors).
---
If this is actually from Classic then you're probably using a morpher (which do exist for classic).
---
Just because most people have not played private servers, does not mean that private servers were not the reason we have classic.. the two are not mutually exclusive concepts.. I'm not sure how closely you've followed private servers for the last few years, but I have intently for many years.. you seem ignorant of just how important the private server communities were to getting classic WoW. Just Nostalrius alone was a big enough push to make Classic a reality.  
---
And yes, Blizzard has sued the people who run them, but I don't recall much monetary compensation for them.. just that the servers were to be shutdown. Honestly, you do not seem to understand how they work on an economical scale. Have you ever played them? I have for many years. They function heavily on "donations," and private server corruption concerning them being P2W and collusion was a big problem, particular with the people running the servers. They made plenty of money, I assure you of that.   
---
Blizzard has pressure from stockholders to make more money... obviously. And Classic WoW was proven to be something that will make them MORE money, and Classic WoW was birthed thanks to Private Servers and their communities.
---
This idea is terrible... It punishes people for no reason and is more likely to make people quit than it is to actually fix the problem. Batch transfers with signups would've been a better solution. I don't know why so many people keep acting like this idea makes any sense.
---
I have no issue with the flasks/elixirs/etc.  I am speaking specifically of world buffs.
---
It is what it is brother.
---
I'm not sure. Another person just commented that rarespawns do not respawn when the server resets. Must of been because of lack of people on at that time and luck then.
---
I don't think you did haha, why respond to a joke about pavlovian conditioning/group think with "sounds pavlovian to me" (when that was obviously the point).
---
It went over your head then you tried to cover that up when called out ... THATS the sad part. XD
---
I think Rend might be just craycray
---
GG Blizz
---
Now that you've killed honorspy, how about you give us a webpage with the rankings of each server? Shouldn't be that hard with all the free sub money you are getting.
---
&gt; The key button in your micro menu now opens your Keyring, an additional bag for keys only, that scales up to hold 32 keys.
---
IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING GUYS
---
&gt; The lua API has been modified to prevent some addons from using communications channels in ways that are contrary to the spirit of the game.
---
Are they talking about Spy?
---
It's the lesser of the two evils in that genre...
---
Half full matches sound incredible..
---
The only source that will ever be accurate is one directly from Blizzard, which will never happen. There are drastically more people playing without that addon than there are with it.
---
I run in pugs weekly on an alt and you see the same names very frequently. People known to do that/people who are known for other bad reasons get their names around and are turned away.
---
Servers are larger than vanilla, but it's easy to get a reputation.
---
No different than the 10 ally camping me in winter spring every day tryna quest
---
I have no idea where you got your info from but going off of warcraft log data kurinaxx is 44.7/55.3 A:H over the past 2 weeks which is going to be fairly representative as long as both factions are just as likely to log their raids. Its one of the more balanced realms for sure but still has roughly 24% more horde than alliance
---
Friends don't get friends into wow.
---
You're role is a bit different as this build, more of a support than an actual healer -  initially to start the fight you'll be using R1 Mindflay to get Shadow Weaving up to 5 stacks and the refreshing it every 13seconds or so.  In between you'll typically be dispelling, raid healing or using PWS on DPS.  You wont be MT healing with this build but it still heavily benefits the raid as a whole.
---
Now, I agree it could be argued "why wouldnt you just go full Shadow" but I think this has to do more with itemization.  If you go Shadow, the majority of the MC gear won't benefit you and it could cause issues if you are taking upgrades from actual healers so you can go back to Holy/Disc when harder content drops. 
---
This build is basically just to improve clear times for content you already out gear.
---
Oh yeah without those 5 mage multiboxers I totally would make it into DM alive and not killed 10 times on the way in.
---
Im confused about gim saying woot
---
&gt;It's inaccurate until it isn't.
---
It'll be a reputable source when every single account has that addon installed.
---
I hope nobody thinks this is serious
---
even if they wanted to apes are on eu servers and fearlina is na
---
Item rack
---
Do you think they will allow PVP to PVE server transfers?
---
A dozen guards is soloable with imp blizzard, again - they spawn via triggers. Answer my other question.
---
Another way to make them not gain honour is relogging. Start logging out while at your corpse. At 1 sec accept ressurection. Log back in, you are now an honourless target, mount up or heal while making your way. Helps at places like Lights Hope.
---
&gt; the most efficient way to play be boring people will bore themselves and quit.
---
It's not the most efficient. Large group farming is ass for honor.
---
Hey look, Blue Post confirmed that all NA realms will be together. Not even doing BattleGroups...

Ah wait yeah you're right smh. He's using a morpher indeed haha. Its not my screen, im the rogue. I see Asselity in t1 gear on my screen. Sorry, its late and all.
---
How much of a dps difference does +24 AP make on fury warrior?
---
it is, lots of moongaurd transplants though so there is some weird ones out there but overall very chill
---
Let's all be honest...  It's not blizzards fault for the actions of the players.  Faction imbalance existed in vanilla too.  Yes there were less players on the server but not so much that it would stop this outcome.  But people weren't as toxic then.  
---
The problem is players have changed...  In retail there are SO many things to do each day that you don't need to camp cities.  The players that came back to classic are expecting more content to keep them busy.  More dailies, more BG's, more instances, more everything...  But when vanilla dropped you didn't have people leveling to 60 in less than a week.  You didn't have raids on farm in 2-3 weeks of attempts.  
---
The player base has evolved beyond what classic can provide to them.  For people like myself  who quit 10+ years ago, have fond memories of vanilla and enjoying leveling at my snail pace classic is great.  If you're looking for retail level of entertainment, go play retail.  Don't ruin classic because you're bored.  Don't rush the content coming out.  If you want all the things that vanilla had before BC came out, then come back in a few months.
---
Just so you guys know, I'm not confused about the meaning of said word, I'm confused about the rarity of it being yelled by Rend!
---
and having "pre-bis" doesn't fix that. In fact if you're a bad bad and pull agro on Ony and Flame Breath half your raid, pre-bis gear is actually harmful because you're doing more dps than you can handle.
---
Fair enough.
---
Try solo farming Scarlet monestary cathedral. Skip right to the cathedral, clear the whole thing 2-3 mobs at a time and bosses, pick the goldthorn if your an herbalist and reset. Easy 25-40g an hour.

---
Healcomm is soo good, hopefully it won't be affected.
---
Yes if they stayed dead.  What part of they instantly respawn do you not get?  Entire servers would get together to raid stormwind or ogrimmar and STILL fail.
---
On my level 31 Warrior I had nearly 100g for awhile until I made alts and got bags and repaired gear. What was my secret? It's simple! I was someone's reset bitch, they paid me to reset their dungeon whenever they needed it. Also I used to dance on top of mailboxes for money - surprisingly I made around 5g doing that. I'd just do it while eating irl or just got bored of the monotonous grind aka dying all the time.
---
Uhhh, Atiesh is very high pop. But admittedly the Alliance have the advantage as far as competitive guilds go.
---
350 FR effectively makes you a level 70 vs fire spells. Bosses are effectively level 63, so you would be using the spell-hit and resist formula with a 7 level advantage.
---
But, just like weapon skill, there is a sharp diminishing return once you're on-level.
---
Thank fucking god. Will it include PVP&gt;PVE?
---
*Laughs in rogue*
---
It woulda been epic if you fought back and used the level up to reset your health for an advantage.
---
Theres normally 5-10 people camping it anyway, what's the difference?
---
City gaurds work different than oitpost gaurds.  The game spawns gaurds that are only there if its being attacked. And they respawn as soon as they die.
---

&gt; Horde camping battlemasters would be the dumbest thing they could possibly do
---
You underestimate the capabilities of late 20 year olds with crippling depression that have never held a job and see an average of 20 minutes of sunlight a year.
---
The horde's behaviour was never about pvping or gaining honour. It was about taking out their awful mental issues on something. That something happened to be the other faction in WoW.
---
I think it came across wrong. There's no resentment to the guild at all, I understand why they made the decision. When I joined, I was just hoping for a more open-minded approach to class composition. But no bad blood, they're a good crowd.
---
Need name of trinket swapping addon pls
---
Players : All rolled majority horde across all servers.
---
Idiots : Blizzard should keep 50/50 balance.
---
So, literally close down all horde new characters? (When the game was a week old )
---
That's dumb.
---
You don't know how city guard work and are making up the method that you'd like them to. I farm Cairne for honor, the mechanics you're describing is a fantasy, since you don't know how they work you think 'they must respawn as soon as they die, the game must spawn them if there's enemy faction in the city', that's not the case.
---
This.  I love how people say pve and then get it in their head that people that play on pve realms dont like pvp or are afraid of pvp.
---
Theres plenty of pvp on pve realms,  its just not toxic shit heads ganking people not interested in pvp at that moment.
---
Idk man I sleep, work about 8 hours a day, have a 6 year old and a girlfriend and still have time to play on a pretty regular basis. We do mini vacations and have side hobbies, camp, and other stuff as well. Don’t really do the gym though. Beyond that I have time to play. Some nights maybe not as much sleep as others but I get what I need typically.
---
No it isn't.
---
You say it has nothing to do with min-maxing, yet you used thrash blade, one of the strongest weapons available prior to raiding (and one that many people in vanilla threw away in favor of higher level greens because information on how the proc functioned and why it made the weapon so good was not widely available and tons of people thought higher level and bigger stats = always better)
---
The reality is that your understanding of what items are good, what stats are important for you, what talents are worthwhile, and what skills to use are leagues better than what people understood back in 2005.
---
Also, I want to bring to your attention hypnotic blade.
---
[Hypnotic blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7714/hypnotic-blade) was one of (many) items that received major itemization changes later in vanilla's lifespan.
---
When it was buffed, it became better than the overwhelming majority of pre-raid weapons in the game for caster DPS.
---
It's a random level 34 dagger that anyone level 45+ can just go grab right now by themselves in 15~30 minutes tops and it's on-par with weapons from [scholo](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13964/witchblade) and [dire maul](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18396/mind-carver).
---
Now pepper that kind of power creep in across the entire game, from dungeon drops, to quest rewards, so on and so forth.
---
Simply put, a hastily and lazily cobbled together fresh 58~60 is at the very least on-par with characters that people spent months gearing up back in 1.2~1.6----and most fresh 60s in classic are far, far, far better geared and built than their equivalents in 2004~2005
---
Tbh, I hope Blizzard just leaves them all there.  Don't offer them server transfers and let them keep their toxicity on their dead server.
---
Alliance and Horde are same at the end

So exciting!!! So many extra bank and inventory spots available!

It's also so shitty that you know exactly when your class is getting buffed and nerfed, and you simply have to subject yourself to that.

That would require us to know what the hell is up with Skeram, mate, and how would we?
---
To try to answer: It was THE PvP realm, the one everyone wanted to roll on before launch, but many people switched to other servers right around the launch due to the ridiculous queues. So in short, a huuuge PvP realm that is now dying as well.

lol reread the paragraph and please respond with something other than "go play retail" as a response.  The paragraph was very clear in saying "classic is great! but it's classic and not the original game at launch for a reason due to issues that are seeded in 2019."  Blizz even tried to add such changes to tackle 2019 issues (huge pops with layering, 1.12 itemization to craft a flatter 2019 experience with minimal staff due to unprecedented circumstances of having 2 dev teams working on two different aspects of the same product they come from, battle-net integration so streamers/friends can better link up, updated engine for sexier 2019 graphics, etc.)
---
Hate to say it, but we never received vanilla from blizz.  We got 2019 classic and that is a pure 2019 product running a core set of the game set in 2004.  They just didn't take it a step further and they can without killing the original intent.
---
There's all that today and people are still dog shit at the game, 15 years ago I guarantee most people had no idea what they were doing and more importantly, they didn't particularly care. Gaming has changed in the last decade.
---
2H fury is decent enough in more casual environments, especially on horde. DW seems to pull quite noticeably ahead in single target fights once you approach a more buff heavy state.
---
So ideally your decision should depend on whether your guild uses a lot of world buffs and consumes and focuses on farming raid ready gear.
---
Zandalar Tribe. Alliance favored.
---
I mean, that's how it used to be even way back in the day. People wouldn't take you to a raid or even look at your guild application unless you were "full blues" at least.
---
Every other animal died or left the pride lands under scar. Maybe there is a reason that the hyenas were marginalized.
---
Then you are misunderstanding how those addons work. HonorSpy is the most affected by this (at least in its current version), but this won't break the addon by any means, just makes it harder to sync data.
---
Who cares if they get rewarded? It’s $25 for me to transfer my character to a server that I’ll enjoy more.
---
Besides the fact you don't understand the mechanics, your original point is that they shouldn't hearth to their capital if they know horde are there. Where should they hearth to?
---
Just like Napollian wanted.
---
Yes it is.
---
Yea they were in later in vanilla... you don't want to wait to queue because to you the aspect of server communities that existed in old mmos isn't a priority... you'd rather just stare at a little honor bar go up a little every week.
---
Oh that is an excellent idea. I will test with chain lightning. It should work the same way IMO. I'll come back once I get some testing done.
---
Orgrimmar is constantly camped on my server too, Bloodsail Buccaneers
---
apes is a guild formed on private servers mate there is no history.
---
Never a hunter because gearing melee dps first is 10x better than gearing a hunter first lolol. Accept the facts from your hunter bias
---
Did they try that though, I would've switched ASAP.. Im sure other ones in the same boat as me would too.. I wanted to go ally but all my irl friends wanted to go horde, now none are playing would've switch to ally np.
---
This is so true, made me spit my coffee.

This really sounds like kids giving each other the Dutch Rudder.
---
You would think with all the complaints about unbalanced servers there would be more people open to ideas that might address them.  Not that I am saying this should happen during classic, more of an if it makes it to a classic+ expansion would it be worth considering.
---
I don't intend this to be used anytime you get killed when you're not ready, just make my pointless corpse runs just as pointless for the people making it happen. Plus like I said it really doesn't add much time at all if you already have a rez timer, and aren't the only one doing it.
---
It’s either that or quit. So yes, I’m happy.

Classic wow was birthed thanks to money and more money and more money that blizzard didn’t have to make new content for.  Nice try though.

And as it turns out, I was right and you were wrong. Blizzard is mixing all servers in each region.

This is something that bugs me about Steam reviews. When you are browsing the shop, only the 'overall' reviews are displayed... you don't get to see the recent reviews until you go to the game's store page. So when people are browsing for games, they get hit with that mixed or bad score, and don't see how the majority of the recent reviews are positive.
---
Some games have terrible launches, and their scores reflect that, but when you have games that receive updates, the reviews can very quickly become outdated and irrelevant. Recent reviews are more valuable than overall reviews, but the overall review is the one that is most prominently displayed. It's frustrating.
---
Well known example would be No Man's Sky. Overall mixed reviews from its disastrous launch, with 55% of reviews being positive. But the RECENT reviews in the last 30 days (4k of them) are a whopping 95% positive. There's clearly a difference there.
---
If it's anything like Vanilla... yes, yes I do expect to one shot people quite regularly as well as be able to manage a few others with no issue. As great as that is, there is also something to be said for battling another really good twink and going round after round after round where the outcomes are back and forth. Old BGs are absolutely the only reason I played and when they started making all the changes and ruined them, I quit playing.
---
Edit: If it's anything like the old days there will be plenty of fodder.
---
This was hilarious!!! Congrats OP. Thanks for sharing.
---
This is so true. It’s insanely easy to camp menethil and the boats. There’s horde in IF and theramore. Obviously it’s cool for a rogue fantasy to sneak around but they can attack you with literally 4 guards on them and still make it out alive. If they get caught they should be out in jail for 10mins tbh
---
Such a small fraction of the vanilla playerbase played content when it was difficult, the rest were usually months late to the party and at least partially carried.  
---
Anyone that thinks vanilla was pretty easy should find classic to be a huge giant joke, and that's the problem, why do people want a huge giant joke?  The desire for huge giant jokes is supposed to be left in LFR in retail.
---
Would love to hear what your solution is. I’m not sitting in a damn faction queue when I only have a few hours per day to play. And I have no interest in rolling an alt.
---
I (29 rogue) was questing last night with a 29 mage by the yeti in alterac (the cave in hillsbrad was camped by alliance). A 32 war and 32 pally came on us. We engaged and killed the pally before dying to the warrior. When we got back,  the warrior was logging out and the pally had not rezzed. He logged on a 60 rogue and camped us for like an hour while the pally worked on his quest. We just corpse ran into him and kept him busy not questing by harassing the pally. He finally got back on his warrior and we killed them both again coming back into hillsbrad. Then they both logged on 60 rogues to camp us.
---
I'm like, come on. You're already higher level than us, what a bunch of nancys lol.
---
As a priest I’d leave immediately if you told me I’d be healing a pet...
---
Idk why “if you don’t like it, quit” is any more childish than “this thing I don’t like should change because I don’t like it”
---
&gt;if someone 10-20 levels over you sits on your corpse till you log they’re an asshole
---
I agree, but assholes are everywhere. You can’t change them, so you have to change the system. How do you completely prevent high levels from camping low levels without fundamentally changing the system? 
---
I don’t think anyone is saying “corpse camping is peak pvp” but it is difficult to get rid of corpse camping without getting rid of overworld pvp itself. 
---
One solution could be that killing honorless targets doesn’t trigger Rez cool down on that person. But then you have infinitely rezzing level 1s griefing Kazzak.
---
Faction imbalance is the real issue here.
---
And freedom ain’t free. It has a cost. That cost is sometimes getting ganked or camped.
---
So you're basically an animal that'll do anything as long as it's allowed an incentivized right? Even if it ruins the experience of others. As to your point, you know damn well no one envisioned that it would be this bad, and that blizzard would be stupid enough to increase population caps across the board making every zone much more dense, which favors whoever outnumbers the other. I played on a pvp server as horde when alliance dramatically outnumbered us, it was nowhere near this bad even though the imbalance percentage was similar to whats going on now in the other direction  
---
But hey, keep being an obtuse jerk that gets his kicks from camping lvl 50 people trying to complete a quests so you can lick up an honor point or two off the floor.
---
So they mismanage their servers and then they're gonna offer a transfer for 20 bucks?  Doesn't anyone else think that this is a really dirty move?  I'm surprised people are cheering paid transfers on.  
---
The sub fee is already overpriced and there is basically zero support towards fixing current issues other than the poorly executed server killing free transfers.  If they had any sense of ethics they would comp everyone 1 month or give free unrestricted transfers while instituting faction balancing and population constraints until things get sorted out properly.
---
I really can't stomach giving this company money anymore.
---
Except increased server cap changed a whole fucking lot. Instead of ~2k concurrent players on both factions combined at peak like vanilla we have ~10k players. This means instead of ~500 max level players in each faction you got ~2500 max level players taking up the exact same space as vanilla which means a lot more camping and a lot less chance for players to spread out.
---
It is 100% a big difference and if you say its not then you are just trolling.
---
\#500%popincreaseisaprettybigfuckingchange

I have tried looking everywhere online and can’t find a single mention of 350 FR being beneficial. I’d love to be able to point to something.
---
Hall of fame classic wow post right here man
---
It's like you're not even reading my comments. The game was fine before the massive influx of players making the server unbalanced. How is this a hard concept? If I need to "work around" something that changed almost overnight changing my experience from enjoyable to unplayable then how is it a failure on my part? I've done my fair share of corpserunning before the transfers, but now it's all I can do. There is no "getting good", there is just a massive imbalance that wasn't there last week. 
---
It's not something I could have predicted when selecting a server, or if I am wrong would you please inform me how could I have known that the server is going to become a shitshow? What could I have done to prevent the shift in balance? How can I have back my experience of putting together a dungeon group and going to the dungeon without 30 minutes of corpse running, or not getting corpsecamped _inside_ a goblin town? If you suggest putting together a raid to get to a dungeon, it's still not the experience I had just a few days prior transfers becoming unavailable (and is a trash solution, since it can take even longer than just corpserunning).
---
Perhaps I should have made a priest on flamelash horde and preached how they are going to ruin my server by farming honor any way they can? It's absolutely mad to justify a company making decisions leading to an unenjoyable experience just because "15 year old rpg".
---
Please keep in mind I'm not suggesting changes to the honor system or how the game itself works, since your replies seem to assume I want to change the whole game, instead of providing faction sensitive transfers, faction queues, etc. I just want a balanced experience with the game as it is, which was something that I had but now I don't.
---
&gt; On our server, Deviant Delight
---
Sounds like PvP happened on a PvP server
---
ok now do this in brd
---
The number directly translates to about if damage you will block when you do block an attack. You gain block from strength (warrior is 20str to 1 block) plus if you have gear with block value. Warrior tier 1 3 piece bonus is 30 block value. Shield slam also scales with block value. Meaning block is both defensive and offensive stat for warrior tanks.
---
And marketing
---
*winces in dad-joke-pain*
---
Im excite about the bank space but same thing right
---
You don’t need a tank for any dungeon before Uldaman
---
That decline from 14 days to 7 days looks really bad too, soon alliance is dead on that server.
---
Yep
---
Does that include Scepter and Mallet tho?
---
Beautiful.
---
I summoned an in combat mage last night. Group said he could just accept the summon after combat drops. So I sent the summon, he was iceblocked, it used my shard, and he appeared. Even had dots on him. Idk how it worked exactly. This was a pvp fight he was in.
---
&gt; Potentially other addons? Not sure how KTM/recount etc. communicates
---
PARTY and RAID. 
---
Seriously like 99% of addons use those 2, there's a good chance you'll never get hurt by this unless you're using addons designed to accomplish something not really intended to be done. This will only affects mainly HonorSpy but also some others that achieve some unintended effects like Greenwall.
---
&gt; The player base may have told them not to change anything, but Blizzard made one massive change: upping the player limit per server by a huge amount. 
---
I see this argument often, but it's largely irrelevant. 
---
You'd have the same % of players on these servers with the same issues. 15,000 players on a server is not that much different than 10,000 players, as an example. So 60% of 15,000 people is 9,000. 60% of 10,000 people is 6,000.
---
60% of 2,000 is 1,200. 
---
60% of 1,000 is 600. 
---
That's still a fuck ton of people no matter how you slice it. 
---
Remember, you have to pretty much hit almost all the leveling zones when going from 50-60 and there would have been enough players to shut down several zones regardless of player cap. 
---
The problem is that Classic is a known game with all its secrets and mysteries unveiled. So players are better equipped both in knowledge and in actual gear (since they know where to get it) than players were in Vanilla. 
---
Players are also better coordinated and ideas and strategies can spread 100000x faster than in Vanilla. This forum is the perfect example of this where people find exploits or funny things about the game and then share it. Vanilla never had that. 
---
The problem is that the player base asked for a 15 year old game and wanted no changes or modern upgrades to it. Vanilla had ***a lot*** of problems with it that were fixed in subsequent iterations of the game. 
---
The community didn't want any changes and Blizzard agreed to those wishes. This is the result.
---
Not the OP but I used to bind w and had a generally similar setup. I used a and d to strafe, pressed left and right mouse buttons simultaneously to move forward, and bound a mouse key to auto run. Using the L/R mouse buttons for non strafe movements is good practice since it lets you turn more quickly, and binding auto run will save your hands. 
---
The one disadvantage to this setup is that it makes looking behind you while running away a little more difficult, since you’d need to toggle auto run to do so, but jumping and turning around midair lets you avoid that issue most of the time. For classic I tried rebounding w to move forward. I don’t think it’s been useful once.
---
they adding WSG and AV but not AB?
---
Ah shi.. probably not
---
Probably somewhere around .2 - .3 % I'd guess, so if you're doing 500dps that would be 10dps.
---
You could merge a low pop Horde dominated server with Heartseeker and there would be no queue.
---
10/10 edit.
---
That's kind of silly considering the server doesn't let the client know if a kill is DR'd.
---
Ever since I started playing during the end of tbc Ive always really wanted to clear Blackwing Lair at lvl. I know it's not super ambitious but I've always had a fascination with the raid. AQ 40 full clear is my stretch goal.

They were about 1/3 through the campaign.

Block value is the amount of damage attacks are reduced by when you block (modified by your strength).
---
Block rating is your % chance to block.

I had heard a tale of someone doing similar back in the day, but in addition to always slow-walking their character also couldn't jump, something to do with a wooden leg.  This became a problem during Naxxramas, as there is apparently a segment you can only get through by jumping.  The player refused to do so and never finished the dungeon.
---
No source on this, just overheard one day.
---
I could be wrong but i believe you have to be friendly or higher for guards to defend you against enemy players.
---
Blame blizz, bot the players.
---
That's why it's only an estimate.
---
Yes. Most of this doom and gloom is wrong and this change won't hurt almost any of these addons but Greenwall absolutely does use custom channels so users of that addon are SOL
---
&gt; blizzard isn't even doing the bare minimum
---
Bots are banned in waves, they're not banned instantly.
---
Bots not being banned instantly =/= "zomg blizz is doing nothing reeeee"
---
Its just people. Even on Horde dominated servers you have groups of alliance rolling through ganking everyone trying to level and farm, and when the horde join together they just rotate to another zone until it dies down again. I get the 'us against them' is fun on some primal level, but its just people being people.
---
14ap=1dps.
---
So about 2 damage per second as a ballpark.
---
You can get a raid signup sheet on discord via a discord bot called raid-helper.  
---

I love how they stop attacking after realising what they have done
---
This is...the greatest video I've ever seen. First the slow 360 shot where the enemy appears right behind you (and in proper RP fashion with the walking too). Then the usual fucking rogue appearing out of nowhere. Finally, the ding and sudden pause of attack for the congrats emote.
---
I mean, I'll use a basic example. If we show that animals respond to reinforcers, and then also show humans also reinforcers, then that would suggest animal behavior is similiar enough to humans to be worth studying.
---
While one within subject study wouldnt show generalizability, hundreds showing consistent results would, and reach a point where we can say reinforcement applies to all people. There are entire journals dedicated to what is effectively the use of reinforcement, along with some other behavioral concepts to change behavior.
---
Play shadow. My main was an spriest in vanilla and regularly had players straight up just run away from me.
---
Keyring hype
---
Just got out of BRD tanking as Priest, but that video is unfortunately postponed until later this week. Still, the math for Pet Tanking should hold up until level 60, at which point geared individuals will eventually overtake the Pet in threat generation.
---
Probably.  Pays an extra fifteen bucks so he can /who people to hunt them down.
---
You do realize that "banning bots in wave" in mmos is extremely damaging right? these worlds are ongoing , not resetting matches like other genres, a bot allowed to just keep doing its thing and enough of them doing that creates large ripple effects onto the server... on top of telling the botters that they can get their money's worth because their bots are going to get at least a few weeks of free farm in before being caught.
---
So nice try, but blizzard isn't doing enough to keep the game even half-decent right now.
---
That's Phase 4.
---
Heartseeker with a small to moderate pop Horde dominated server could work.
---
To a hunter?!! Does the proc even work for ranged?
---
Think it’s safe to say this guy rolled on a PvP server and regrets it
---
I wouldn't know under what context tbh.
---
&gt; we get pretty much exactly accurate calculation anyway
---
I would disagree. Current threat calculations are often off by several percent.

That wasnt my original point... My original point was you cant be camped.  Even if you hearth in flagged if you die you just wait 5 min before resurrecting. Voila no flag anymore and they cant kill you.  The problem isnt being able to get around your capital.  Its you cant quest if its so unbalanced.  All things that happen outside of your capital.
---
If i must answer as a mage i never had my stone set to a city because teleport is a thing so always had it by a dungeon i was farming or something.  Do that and just fly home.
---
Because it is something that shouldn’t even be needed on your side.
---
Ymmv, but the lag hasn't been that bad for our guild unless Horde contested the kill.
---
This is what the way it was in Vanilla, preparing for the chance there would be more keys (like in BC). This limit isn't there for Classic+, it's just #nochanges.
---
idk i’m just trolling i have no idea
---
Yea if it were up to me I would have rolled that way... had to play on same server as friends tho
---
&gt; RP players on non-RP servers make the world go 'round.
---
ZT is a RP server. RP PVP, but still RP.
---
Server restart
---
Almost no one finished Naxxaramas, so that isn't saying much.
---
its because of npcs im pretty sure
---
Wow. I legit loled like a complete giggly bitch
---
Yeah I'm casual as fuck and know a fair bit about parts of the game that I've never even experienced like raiding thanks to YouTube/Reddit. This level of online info/entertainment/discussion just simply did not exist back on vanilla. We're living in a different world now.
---
It's cool just hit up logical fallacies they really help when you try and make sound point online.
---
Crossrealm is the reason I'm worried actually, they say it's confirmed for bgs so we would get placed with all the overpopulated horde servers unless I'm mistaken which I hope I am lol
---
I remember someone bragging way back that you could kill her before she flew with enough dps.
---
Truly. In beta and the first few months of vanilla I played a Pally to level 20ish and then all my irl friends started playing and wanted to play horde.  I’m finally getting to play that Pally again after 15 years.
---
Non-optimal =/= dead weight. It's not binary.
---
I’ll just downvote both.
---
I want everyone to be flagged. That way, I can both jump and be jumped at any time. I don’t personally want a button I can press to flag/unflag myself. My only PvP will then be (1) the rare situation when someone walks by me flagged because they want to fight or (2) flagging myself with the expectation someone will get the drop on me and I maybe get back in time to have a real fight. I’d like something more dynamic. I trust you can understand the difference!
---
I don’t want to wait til level 30 and I’m willing to bet it wouldn’t be quite what I’m interested in. Pre-Phase 2, the constant wPvP was great and wouldn’t end when someone decided to unflag.
---
There's an insane trinket for druid PvP in blacksmithing. I remember getting it on my druid in vanilla. I've forgotten the name of it but it gives you 15sec fear immunity. Very very useful
---
Also, I’ll be generous, but it’s hard for me to think you’re not being willfully obtuse. Do you not feel like there’s any reasonable difference between PvP and PvE servers? Are you just saying that PvE servers tend to have better PvP because you don’t get the catastrophe we’re in?
---
If you come to Horde on Incendius server I'll give you a free starting package. Some bags and golds wich will be very helpful to start.
---
On the 10th of december most of the pvp madness will be over.  Also, you won't be in real danger until lvl 35+ so don't worry about it.
---
no FPs
---
you had your HS set to a contested zone? guess where you'd be
---
1.0 and 3.0 speed weapons don't exist though. And I prefer slower to match my offhand speed (gives an extra Flurry charge if your weapons swing at the exact same time) which benefits me throughout the entire fight, not just during Execute.
---
I don't have any numbers to back it up. It would be pretty difficult to model accurately so it's just a judgement call on my part. All else being equal, I'd take a slow weapon with the same speed as my offhand over a slightly faster offhand.
---
He barely commented on it on the next stream. Yeah it's been annoying that they complain so much about the PVP for sure. To answer you a lot of people in this subreddit take a stance favoring what Advertise was doing.
---
Most guilds left **after** they announced when they would close the transfer windows, most people were waiting to see how the server was after BGs were released. But since blizzard closed the transfer windows before BGs came out, everybody had to make make the decision to stay or leave.
---
Help how so?
---
A lot of retailers on this sub don't actually understand #NoChanges. 
---
When Classic was announced, there was little faith Blizzard would actually make an authentic Vanilla experience. #NoChanges was born as almost an exaggeration to communicate to Blizz to make an actual Classic WoW, not Classic WoW: Retail mode. Slowly, more and more information was released, and Classic actually started to look like it would be Classic.  
---
\#NoChanges became a meme at that point. Everybody knows #SomeChanges is good, like having progressive itemization, 8 debuff slots, etc. That's why pservers were great, they had been through so many iterations and realized you actually need some changes.
---
That's why these threads are so dumb. It's just a circlejerk, almost everyone agrees #SomeChanges is ok, even the pserver players that invented #NoChanges.
---
Her flying isn’t even p3 though that’s p2
---
Oh look more camping. Jesus that's all this game is lately.  
---
Let people vent.
---
I feel bad for you for having to go through life being this ignorant. You're truly playing on Hard Mode.
---
Re roll here, since no one trusts blizz to help us.
---
300 IQ move is to have an extended Classic maintenance, then give everyone with a character over level 10 a few days of credit. 
---
Would convince some retail players to level up to 10 in Classic.
---
You've just combined together my favorite gif I've seen in weeks with a dilemma I have when I play warrior. This, this is what r/classicwow is supposed to be.
---
Oh I read your original paragraph perfectly fine to begin with, I just saw no reason that "streamers/info, minmaxing, and *toxic behavior*" could be used to justify changing the game.  
---
Again, if you think Blizzard's current game development team creates content worth playing, good for you, go and enjoy the many modern games that they release. 
---
But what about players who haven't liked any of their content from the past decade? We should just get fucked or something? I don't understand.
---
Seriously, other than faction imbalance there is absolutely nothing wrong with the game. All it needs is players. Stop trying to change it. Just stop. It doesn't need anything else. People enjoy it the way it is. Go play TBC if you want a slightly updated game. Go play retail. Go play anything else, just leave this alone.
---
1. Notice faction imbalance
---
1. Enable free transfers, exacerbating the problem substantially
---
1. End free transfers
---
1. Sell transfers
---
300 IQ business right here.
---
I just need the ruined leather scraps. Leveling LW on a new alt.
---
It depends on how much you play. If you play about 18 hours a day, then you can go for it. Rank 14 is achievable and with it some really good equipment. If you are not, then only twinking can help you. Or of course, you can pay people for gold DKP runs through raids, seeing how you enjoy farming solo. However, you will need about 100-1000g per item that you get this way.
---
Oh fuck I just had to see one post about you playing a baseball video game to see I’m talking to someone without a personality too 😭 fuck man look in the mirror if you want to feel sorry please.
---
The way I interpreted it as regions meaning it'll be split between EU regions. All English together, German, French etc.
---
Wouldn't make much sense to queue Russian and English realms for example.
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
Ironforge is the only BG you need
---
Have you actually played on pvp servers?  Your post makes me think the answer is a firm no.
---
I would love to see the stats on how many times i was killed while running from place to place. Or the number of times i was killed by the same person twice in a row.  Comparing the numbers between p1 and p2 would be interesting.
---
Im rank 2, maybe going to rank 3 this week, mainly from killing people that try to jump me.
---
Absolutely. You just need to get creative. Rogues and warriors can easily solo caster mobs, pets can take hits, poly, sap, etc. it’s more fun this way hahah. Some people though would rather wait hours for a tank
---
I'm so lazy I don't have any keys yet...
---
Do you need your game to have a future to have fun in it?  There's your answer.
---
And you filmed it in portrait like a nub.

---
Our UI's are freakishly similar... Would you say?
---
I am not sure on that yet.
---
PvP servers get all the attention, but there are some heavily Alliance dominated PvE servers.
---
Bigglesworth is somewhere between 60/40 and 70/30, alliance generally do well though and have gotten all the recent kazzaks
---
&gt;Not just Alliance, they are about as useless on the horde side as well
---
Thanks for the laughs. Doesn't change the fact that an undead rogue can remove fear 7 (seven!) times within 10 minutes, while other rogues only 2 times. It's damn significant against a priest or a warlock.
---
I use e, q, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, SE, SQ, S1, S2, S3, S4, CE, CQ, C1, C2, C3, C4
---
Imo, variety is more beneficial in the long term. If people start seeing the same overgeared, unbeatable farm teams they'll just rage quit and requeue instead of playing to an inevitable loss.
---
Eeeh, I agree with you for the most part, though I personally wouldn't go quite that far. I'm actually in a somewhat unique position of leveling both an Alliance PVP (my buddies and I) and a Horde PVE (my wife and her friends) realm character at the same time. I also have a wealth of past experiences of leveling solo and duo on PVP servers as both Horde and Alliance, so I can definitely see both sides. 
---
On the one hand, almost all PVP interactions I've had -- recently and in the past -- have indeed been pretty uneven. A rogue ganks you while you're fishing. A couple of high-level assholes are camping the entrance to Astranaar or SM or whatever. You get steamrolled by a raid while farming murloc heads. And so on, and so on, always on your toes. By contrast, on the PVE realm, I can just smoke a bowl and go chill in some zone without a random gank harshing my buzz or upsetting my wife. 
---
On the other hand, the PVE experience feels pretty stale after a while. The things I actually remember from all my leveling experience in WoW are either really tough dungeon runs or cool PVP encounters. I still remember my first instance run and my first WPVP kill, 15 years later. I remember thinking I was hot shit on my mage until I tried to gank a feral druid in Hinterlands and got wrecked. And then I rolled a druid and mained it until Cataclysm. I remember getting my main when random assholes would gank my then-girlfriend and I, and ganking their asses right back. Just recently (before P2, admittedly), I remember joining a raid as a lvl 30 n00b and helping drive Horde away from Hillsbrad. Good times. 
---
At the same time playing on a PVE realm, it feels legitimately *weird* running down the main road in Ashenvale, seeing an Alliance toon and just... sort of... *not* interacting with them. It's like they don't exist. And yea sure, it helps get my questing in faster, but honestly I remember almost nothing from the 10-50 journey on my PVE character. It's all a grind without highs or lows.

I’m still having fun. I don’t really give a shit about streamers quitting though.
---
Sure, I guess you can say you’re technically a streamer, I don’t think you’re the kind of streamer he’s referring to. He’s talking about streamers with an actual following, with a few hundred to tens of thousands of viewers.
---
Every. Single.  Onyxia raid, one or more guildies forgets the necklace.
---
&gt;the Horde on Sulfuras have between 55 and 58% of the population
---
...That's not really "outnumbered" on the same level as some other servers, where one faction is 75-85% of the population.
---
I agree, exploit. It also kinda makes the game playable if you literally don't have time between being killed to hearth and go somewhere else.
---
Happy kake dae.
---
I think it's mainly people begrudgingly accepting the cost given the invested time already.
---
I mean $25 is like just over 2 hours at minimum wage here, and I'm willing to bet most people would be a HELL of a lot faster to trade 2 hours of wage to save their classic experience versus rerolling a new server and starting their 700 hours character over from scratch.
---
&gt;Is there a point of playing if there is no future?
---
If you have fun playing, then yeah. Absolutely.
---
&gt;Like will it stay in classic forever? 
---
All we know is that we will get new phased content every couple of months to bring WoW Classic in line with what it was just before TBC release.
---
This means we'll get instances like ZG/AQ/Naxx, events like Darkmoon Faire, and all the stuff from Classic that isn't currently in the game yet.
---
After that, it's completely up in the air. Some people believe that they will release TBC since the content is already there, other's believe that a "Classic +" is in store where Blizzard will develop new content for Classic.
---
&gt;As a new player, should I play retail or this?
---
My suggestion would be to try both, get a character to level 10 or whatever and see which one you enjoy more.
---
Classic is a lot 'slower', less optimized and way less balanced, but that's part of it's charm. Due to just about everything being automated in retail, you lose a lot of the player to player interaction that makes WoW a great game.
---
On the other hand, a lot of players do enjoy Retail due to the new content, massive changes and new content.
---
Finally, my protest may end. Never gonna be locked out now
---
More alliance to gehennas, thanks
---
Also gear, and classes.
---
I hope they fix the dhk from the strath item
---
my poorly balanced server never had transfers out, so i had no option.
---
I would disagree, as a tank I have a list of people who were either ninjas or straight up assholes. Plenty of times I have had the same people whisper to join group and I just ignore them. It's not really about punishing them but protecting me from the hassle. I dont have any issues forming groups.
---
Cross realm BGS.  That’s all I needed to know to unsubscribe.
---
I was arms, I happen to love dungeons and I can’t quest outside in open world anyway. For me it was a good investment
---
Can confirm, Grob is full of murdered people.
---
I would agree except I remembered how blizzards balance philosophy is by rotation and I hate that.
---
Besides that I think people are more satisfied like this, those that wanted to play the “best class” are doing it and they are safe in knowing it’s the best class. Those that wanted to play different classes for different reasons like they like it etc are doing it and don’t mind not being the “best class”.
---
Yeah me either, its just a strange vine from the community &amp; media right now, imo
---
people are not leaving because the game is not fun, *some* people are leaving because of the phase2 shitfest, which will be solved by the BG's that will be introduced tommorow, *some* people are leaving because faction imbalance, but the game is far from dying, all the next phases will have really good content, every phase = an additional raid, Arathi basin, AQ gates opening event, scourge invasion for Naxx, etc. 
---
Imo you should level up to 60 and give it a shot, MC can be easely done in greens if you know the mechanics, the real challenges will come from BWL  forward.
---
I think a another solution would be to give the losing faction 10% more Honor for kills. That way they will get more pvp active players.
---
That's like the bug that everyone saw you laying down. Casting, running, jumping, shooting bows...
---
Visual bugs are nothing new to wow, but they can be a trip to see. Lately I've seen a lot of people running full speed backwards.
---
&gt; Classic WoW has a problem, if it is a problem, in that there are #nochanges.
---
You've interpreted the phrase literally and completely misunderstood the point.
---
"No Changes" does not literally mean "the game should be frozen in time". It means the game should be as it was, *patch progression and all*.
---
So you just typed out this huge diatribe to say you agree with the people you're criticising. 
---
/golfclap
---
Sounds like a waste of time fighting someone for every mob, when you can just split them in half. Especially a waste of time if they are higher level and beat you over 50% of the time. If you are on a PvE server and you can tag mobs then they are fucked. Everything you said can just be slightly changed to give the advantage to the PvE player.
---
Like i said the problem isnt getting griefed inside ironforge.  The problem is not being able to leave.  2 different things.
---
it can’t be epic video if you film your monitor
---
I use grinding to work my way through Star Trek rewatches.
---
Pvp deaths dont cause gear to break tho lol.
---
I think everyone here is focusing on quest experience when they should put their attention on the other benefits of leveling in AV. If you kill the harpies you can get silver and cloth and experience, but at the same time you’re getting honor and reputation gains. I leveled a few characters from 51-60 in AV. You’ll have your epics by the time you get there. 
---
It’s going to take much longer than leveling outside AV, obviously.
---
This only effects the 10% of the player base that goes for world bosses lol.
---
Wouldn't bother me all that much. Longer queue times means more time to Deathroll.
---
How can you tell someone rolled on a PvP server? Because they are sad about it.
---
&gt;Are east coast and west coast considered different regions?
---
No, in any and all games Blizzard has ever made region is used to denote NA, EU, Asia, etc
---
That would be some sick emotes for whats app! 
---
Great work keep going :)
---
AQ was also in 1.12 so what's your point?
---
How many months has it been in classic since the last bot ban wave?
---
You’re not getting the point in the first place. The initial imbalance wasn’t Blizzard’s fault. This is a temp fix to allow Alliance to play without being city camped 24/7. Best case scenario, is that the transfers don’t completely wreck the balance, but it’s pure stupidity to insist Alliance stay on a 10:1 Horde to Alliance server.
---
*the orc defecates on the paved roads of Ironforge, relieved to be out of the shithole he calls home*
---
Because it is incorporating data from before the great exodus. It's not perfect, but for global averages its the best we have to go on, certainly better than anecdotes.
---
Honestly curious, what leads you to believe it has no future?  I’m thinking at least a year until every planned phase is rolled out, maybe a bit more or less, and I truly believe in my heart of hearts BC and Lich King are going to happen.  Once Naxx is out for a bit, say 6 months, and subs start falling off they’ll start dropping expansions.  So many Vanilla players believe WoW peaked with the first two expansions, they’re not going to leave that money on the table.
---
Realms will suffer whether or not this will be enabled because people will get away from the imbalanced servers. Giving people option to get away just prevents them quitting altogether.
---
No One is going to do that over and over. Maybe a few times otherwise people are going to queue then just go duel outside orgrimmar
---
I guess this means people are still afraid to be the  “Good guys”  because they think it’s more bad A and adult to be the bad guys. Over compensating for their insecurities of playing a video game. Like teenagers that insist on using a curse word in every sentence, because being a good person is “childish”. Grow up people, join the Alliance. It’s ok to play video games and be the good guys.
---
I've yet to see that but if you can link it that would be helpful.
---
Ha, that's me. Yea we tried to throw a quick pug together to finish one boss we hadn't cleared earlier in the week...it was Sunday. Their guild hasn't been black listed as far as I know, but of course I don't know what black listed actually is....  I've just been instructed not to personally invite them so I corrected my mistake and removed apparently the guy who made this post, which seems to have upset him greatly. My fault you couldn't get the Sulfuron kill this week, I'm sure you will get it on Tuesday for reset! Good luck in your future my dude.
---
&gt;How many more times am I going to see this same exact post?
---
Until bgs release, then it will be pls fix queue times, this is unacceptable, etc.
---
Good point.
---
They later "confirmed" on the EU Twitter that it was a global release on the 10th, which I booked off in exchange for 12 hour days the rest of the week lol.
---
Fucked myself over there.
---
You also go fury prot as an OT to have decent dps when you aren't tanking.
---
Send bren 2 pls xDDDD
---
I’m literally dead now. Lol!
---
11% is too much hit.  With 300 weapon skill anything more than 9% is not worth it.
---
Valor shoulders are solid.  Good Str, Agi, and Sta for survivability.
---
This guy gets it
---
I agree, not sure what you mean by I did not
---
You and me both
---
We also get AQ on 1.12
---
Anyone who follows a streamer like they’re a god is a fuckin moron to begin with and deserves all the stupid shit that may happen to them... 😂 morons
---
Who could change those racials? Blizzard could, they didn’t, thanks to?
---
huh? why would there be class changes? Classic is based off 1.12 which already includes all balancing that happened during vanilla's life cycle. 
---
It's a major reason why classic is so easy. All 1.12 class balance and itemization make the game much, much easier.
---
You can melee a flying Onyxia.

Keyboard, mouse, gaming chair, family dog etc

Just head to STV and walk around. Shake that ass a little, get the rogues interested.
---
At the same time, spirit res exists for a reason 
---
Also thank you
---
All the guilds leaving in the last few days.
---
Of course not, that's what Reddit's for.
---
Making a lot of assumptions there - I enjoy Classic, I just know I'd enjoy TBC/WotLK more and I'm not interested in dealing with the drama that comes with private servers
---
The no changes people are the scourge. The scarlet crusade should hunt them down like theyre supposed to be doing.
---
Got a warning &amp; rollback for doing this in bfa prepatch on retail. They added some system where you got bonus honor in a certain zone and after killing 10-15 people you were worth more honor. Raids of 40v40 were suiciding to eachother for extremely fast honor gains, many times faster than anything else in the game.
---
Wintrading in classic is probably not detectable without reports. It took 3 weeks for them to roll me back.
---
an apprentice flyer, perhaps?
---
What exactly is so difficult reading this?
---
&gt;I haven't seen anything to say either way if pvp and pve were together, but my comments still stay the same regardless.
---
I know reading is difficult for you but at least try a little.... ok champ?
---
Which guild are you from? Im also Ally fro Shazz and I believe that we have really strong alliance guilds. I would like to believe that we can fight back even with such numbers. I run around pretty often guerilla pvp-ing with my guild grp and we win more than we lose (but that's because we move alot and there's always another guild grp around to help in if things get out of hand). Hope it stays that way and maybe even get better.
---
This is a really good analogy for what happened here. A bunch of brainless farmers completely depleted the soil and are going hungry. They didnthis despite warnings that what they were doing was unsustainable. Now they're blaming everyone but themselves for their idiotic behaviour.
---
Bean
---
I'm reading that there's a resist percentage cap, but that excess resistance above that can reduce unresisted damage.
---
I may be completely wrong.  This is all very complicated.
---
That's what my binds look like. But I use the g600 mouse that has the num pad on the side under my thumb.
---
A lot of guilds now, even casual guilds, still have BWL in mind for their progression right now. It may turn out BWL is face rolling easy in which case some guilds who park themselves at that level can take all the meme specs they want but it may also be tough for casual guilds and then yeah they'll have wasted gear to a meme spec that is now holding the guild back. 
---
I can see both sides.
---
&gt; Also gear, and classes.
---
And graphics. 
---
BWL is now a MUD.
---
This particular NPC is a High Elf, though there are indeed Blood Elf NPCs/mobs in vanilla. In Azshara there is a quest to kill some Blood Elves for betraying the Horde.
---
It sure didn't for me, i was loving wpvp in vanilla and went at it avidly in tbc - until ofc, everyone started just flying away. What you seem to be describing seems... willful to say the least. You want it to be the case more than it in any way is m8. Sure BGs is the optimal way to farm honor, but the two are wildly different experiences and as an avid pvper, i genuinely want both.
---
You want me to apologize for pointing out that in the comment I was replying to, he was not advocating for it not to remain in the game? How pompous.
---
He might have been wrong about Blizzard's inability to remove it, if the patch does in fact completely break the addon, but I stand by my comment, even if he was wrong, he was still not advocating for it to remain in game, at least not in that specific comment.
---
&gt; This will prevent addons from communicating over custom, player-created chat channels.
---
That doesn't say addons won't be able to communicate via pre-existing channels like whispers.
---
I still question your reading comprehension.
---
Only allow transfering from servers where your faction is the majority to servers where your faction is a minority.
---
I'm the social officer so it's actually my job to do so :) but yeah pming other members in our guild is encouraged and usually will get you a better response. Also to reward people we award the first unneeded BoEs to tanks that I recommend to the Loot Council for helping members run dungeons. Usually we hand out 2 pieces, and it's a good incentive for people to be social. I'm lucky I'm in an awesome guild, YMMV
---
These world firsts arent relevant, this contents been on farm for over a decade. 
---
You want a even playing field in progression raiding for content released between 2004-2006. What a strange request.
---
I wonder if the BG’s will give ok exp to level in.
---
Realm only BGs? Lol
---
Honestly most games worth playing "have no future". Think of all of the great games you've played, and now consider how many you'll go back and play again for any considerable amount of time. Everything ends, enjoy the ride.
---
Baffles me that someone cares about the "sense of community" in BGs. 
---
You might not care about sitting an hour in queue because you only do one BG per day.
---
Horde dominant PvP server I'm on had alliance in starter zones too. Do people think a balanced server = zero ganking and zero raids in lowbie zones?
---
you mean spending valuable hours..enjoying the game?
---
Why? Just because I’m Horde doesn’t mean I like being ganked all the time. Sure it might happen to me a bit less than an alliance player, but I’ve had my fair share of death runs to BRM with what little time I have to play the game every night.
---
People are dicks on every server dude. Faction doesn’t really matter when it comes to being an asshole.
---
Blizz should have one massive battlegroup to make queues efficient, period. They made the right decision.
---
How is making sure Boomkin feels terrible the whole way through worth it just so the people like you that pick meta stuff can feel better? PvP is an absolute disaster, and the lack of content and faction balance, you will be lucky to keep 20% of the current population by the time Naxx comes out at this rate.

The bottom line is while Classic may appeal to the people who want it to be some kind of sick bastardized museum, the majority are getting bored or are already bored with the state of the game. Releasing only MC/Ony for 6 months will be detrimental to the health of the PvE player base, and PvP servers being the way they are now is killing off the PvP player base. I really wanted to enjoy classic but I just can't. The fact that people like you just parrot the same shit about not changing it because you want to play the overpowered class/spec and be number one all the way through Naxx. It won't mean anything when there are so many dead servers because the only thing worse than retail compared to Vanilla, is Vanilla with 0 changes in 2 years. My only hope is that they release BWL really really soon, and they announce WoW 2 or BC being the next thing, so I can just cut my losses and wait for what I actually want. Having content that has been studied this much and fully min-maxed is just not fun. The community has been absolutely terrible as well.
---
Back in real vanilla there was no cast queue and virtually nobody knew to use a /stopcasting macro to get around latency, so they would have 2x their latency in delay (and then some) between every single cast. This on top of being overall worse at the game.
---
There's your explanation, in case you were looking for one.
---
Exactly, I'd rather drink boring hot chocolate than battery acid.
---
I remember the servers being unplayable after some patches, ah, the good old days
---
Jesus christ you are actually a lost cause. What a waste of life.
---
if they are doing server transfers, and make it available to the side that is larger, problem solved. doink
---
&gt;warlocks didn't have deathcoil
---
What a fucking terrible loss that would've been......
---
Are you willing to farm the large amount of consumables needed for a ret paladin to pass the tanks on any given fight?
---
Because if you aren't then your asking them to flat out carry you and give you gear. 
---
That is why people don't like bringing Ret Paladins.
---
You realize this nword stuff can happen in any video game right? In your league of legends game someone can type the nword and gg. It can happen in literally any online video game with chat
---
Banning in waves is common practise.
---
If you just ban without watching to finding a way to flag the bot it just comes back, if you let them run and understand their script better you can create a system that will flag the account faster.
---
People will always bot and its better to nuke the bot then dump resources into manually monitoring 24/7.
---
Welcome to Horde players.
---
Zac
---
Risky af to run right by the ele earth farmers
---
I've seen especially toxic people camping graveyards, but yes. Often the best option if you need to get away from griefers.
---
clear BWL/AQ20/ZG again, then i'll probably call it a day.
---
Opposite of that actually. The 'twink meta' is the closest thing to arena in vanilla/classic. It all comes down to skill in twink v twink and its a lot more fun than you would think.
---
Watch it be like $50 ha
---
Gave way more fucks than you shoukd towards him lol
---
It is possible to get decent gear just by doing pvp and maybe dungeons. But for the optimal pvp set(and pve set for that matter) you need both pvp and pve gear.
---
You can.  Not optimal as you don’t have the hit and more difficult to gear (1 weapon vs 2). But do what you enjoy as leveling is a grind and sucks either way.  My friend prefers it as he just enjoys hitting stuff and he hates the misses and parries on a slow 2h.  He does optimize for minimal downtime with alchemy elixirs and first aid.
---
That is the most low effort bullshit story I've seen on this sub.
---
Ally on horde dominated pvp servers will transfer off if they get the chance, like what happened with Flamelash. I can promise you that is blizz opens paid transfers, a lot of alliance players will simply transfer to pve server.
---
Sure, but it would not necessarily be predictive since we don’t know how specific things will impact an individual. What is a reinforcer for another would be a punishment for someone else. So yes, hundreds of studies can show something but it doesn’t contain the complexity of human nature, nor for the fact that there is both a nature and nurture component.
---
Why don’t we all just wait 24 hours to see how long the queues are....? No one knows until we experience it
---
id try a little of both, i like retail better tbh
---
classic was great and was good in theory but its be theorycrafted and speedran etc for 10+ years on private servers
---
the game is essentially easy if you follow guides the only thing is its especially time consuming (which people call rewarding) when you get the slightest upgrade in anything
---
in retail the classes are more balanced and theres just more to do, and if you really want to talk about rewarding downing raid bosses with real mechanics and team work is where you will find it
---
in my opinion the super tryhard no lifers and streamers ruined classic
---
Looking at your comment, I sure seem like the salty one.
---
40 min queues for WSG implies there are like 3 times as many horde as alliance,  75/25 ratio. It's xrealm with every server in your region, so all the alliance majority PvE servers are in the same pool as the PvP servers. It won't be 40 minute queues.
---
dead orc = good orc
---
I was on a low-ally pop server in vanilla and the bg wait times could get insanely long, and when we finally did get in we would often not even get a full team.
---
So Im honestly kinda glad its xrealm.
---
They did gtfo on flamelash and now horde are complaining.
---
Congrats my felstriker friend!!!
---
How the shit? Whenever I try that on my hunter I get rogue dick up my asshole
---
I have 160 and at most 4k honor
---
&gt;Then the usual fucking rogue appearing out of nowhere.
---
Except that was a warrior, and now you lool foolish.
---
So this is curious, at some point in vanilla wow I believe they did an item rework and I believe they made it so the mounts bought after this point did not require faction specific training.
---
I was the laziest person ever on my gnome warrior and I remember I rode a War Horse and a Black War tiger and I can guarantee I never grinded to exalted with Darnassus on anything. I also know it was before the 75/150 riding skill thing because I remember being a little disappointed that I wouldn't be rewarded with 150 riding for having a pvp mount, as Blizzard decided it was too cheap, but those with AV mounts were awarded 150 riding skill.
---
But I can't for the life of me figure out which patch it was, I think it was 2006, but it was definitely before they made Honor a currency.
---
It's frustrating because I can see a lot of angry people in here, but both groups are correct on how vanilla was, but I don't think it was well documented in the patch notes.
---
Imagine 10 paladins going in with sappers.
---
Honestly, at this point I'm just hanging around in hopes that they go onto classic TBC. It may have introduced some of the seeds that lead to modern retail (start of homogenizing everything and spreading people out) but it was probably one of the more balanced versions of WoW. There were still some favorites but at least some of the "meme specs" were more fleshed out and viable. 
---
Classic + will never exist in a decent fashion as it'll be impossible to balance things around the current game. You can't just keep adding different tiers of gear and hope the game works with it. Plus, like it or not you can't just take additions from the player base. EVERY SINGLE "bad" thing about retail was at one point highly demanded by the players. Those things will slowly creep into classic + regardless if you want them or not because sooner or later the majority will out number you. 
---
That's getting a bit off topic though. For the topic at hand, I think they should have went with an earlier patch and worked their way off. I've seen a couple mentions of boss loot being shifted around in P3 because at the particular patch it is pseudo-representing, that occurred. Which doesn't make sense. 90% of the game is based on 1.12 but you're going to fake some things to keep them in line with the phase's "patch". Why not just start at an earlier version and work into it? At least that way MC would have been completed how it was originally meant to be.
---
Best bet would be to grind on some green mobs.  Not too many options for warr in general.
---
but why would you restrict your ability to choose later
---
Isn't that how it should be? At least that way people would have different high and low points vs people picking the classes that'll forever be the flavor of the month.
---

Seems staged. Like completely staged.
---
Pretty sure it's PvE for me if they open that up. Simply don't have enough time to play the game 6 hours a day anymore.
---
less arguing on the internet and more coming up for my next DnD wow related meme.
---
I played launch through top end TBC - Muru and have begun debating restarting my childhood addiction with WoW Classic but stuff like this worries me.
---
yet here you are, lol jesus dude get off reddit.
---
I will be forever amazed at how badly people struggle with spelling/pronouncing vurtne's name lol
---
That won't do much just like the last faction based transfers didn't do anything.
---
Problem is they don’t scale well as all the gear is healing oriented
---
Theres a quest in STV where you need to collect items from gorillas then activate a shrine and kill waves of them then a boss.
---
I had an undead rogue wait until just before the end of the quest to drop in and gank me. I went back 4 hours later and he did it again. Some people are just committed 100% to the pursuit of being a dick. 
---
Rerolled RPPVE and never looked back.
---
It's completely "possible" but it almost makes no sense. You'd literally have to be solo killing higher level players for the totality of your entire kills... Or be part of an Honor racket......... Just saying......
---
Ever glanced at a name and misread it, then willingly decided to continue calling them that? That's what.
---
dependso n the faction, blizzard made shit worse then it already is. paid transfer is going to make it even worse
---
&gt;as far as **private servers** this IS TRUE. If youre away from everyone you get full xp.
---
Considering what was done to them I can see an Alliance group agreeing to this then just keeping the mats. Sure it would mean they cant do AQ either but it would be a nice little F you to the horde.
---
Nobody is forcing you to play boomkin. If you chose to play a boomkin and didn't know they sucked, thats on you.
---
Yet there are still people out here playing boomkin, because they like it, not because its "good".
---
Re: the rest, seems like a personal problem. The community has been great for me, both factions. Both factions are thriving despite a population imbalance.
---
If you want changes, wait till after Naxx comes out. Otherwise you're spoiling the experience everyone else wanted. Nobody wants "your" version of Naxx except you.
---
I just did a quick summary of all logged players on ironforge.pro with the following criteria:
---
- Last two weeks
---
- USA Servers
---
- Total population by server
---
- Horde:Alliance ratio and by calculation,
---
- Total Horde:Alliance ratio across all US servers (incl. Oceanic) over last two weeks.
---
    Totals	Alliance	57451.893	43.93%
---
    	        Horde	73338.107	56.07%
---
		                130790
---
Hmm, looking at classic db there's 2 versions. One is 1.4, which is the one we have for whatever reason blizzard decided to revert to and where you need faction specific training. Then another is 1.12 where it requires only 75 riding
---
Fun, but we have strict guidelines for that now.
---
It's cute that anyone thinks the report button is anything more than a panacea. Nothing short of actual GM tickets ever has a result.
---
Was cool that they stopped killing you :D
---
If you PvP casually you can't rank for PvP gear so you won't have gear either way and will be at a disadvantage against those that rank or raid. It also depends on spec, not all classes / specs should rank for  PvP gear as the raid gear is better.
---
To avoid respec costs I am raiding on a Druid and PvPing casually on a shaman so I'm in the same boat.
---
You will find pugs clearing raids on weekends if you can spare a couple hours.
---
It would be like a week worth of work for a team of people. Wouldn't really be that bad. But I agree with you. They would never do it.
---
With arms you tank groups by 2h sweeping strikes/cleave/stance dance WW, only switching to your shield when you're fighting something that actually hurts.  If you run with a good enough healer you can do pretty much all 5man content this way, excepting maybe Dire Maul, especially North.  If your average pug healer isn't quite as good, then you're gonna be able to utilize the strength of arms less, and might want to jump into deep prot sooner.  Shield Slam is a huge threat generator, so if you are deep prot you'll want to be shield slamming as much as possible, so you're locked to sword and board, effectively.  I'd also recommend biasing toward going deep prot sooner just to get used to playing it if you're new to it.  The main advantage to staying arms is that if you're in a solid guild you'll keep better aoe threat and clear faster, plus you have much better solo ability and can do anything at all in pvp.  Deep Prot will hold up much better in an average or below average pug but sacrifice those other things.
---
Going from 300 to 305 weapon skill gives you 3% hit and a glancing blow damage reduction from 65% to 85%. (12% white damage dps boost)  Going from 305 to 310 is just 85% to 95% (2 to 3% boost)
---
With human and 5/5 swords(Respec?) It's always better to use swords unless you get an epic dagger and even then....
---
BG launched with server-only matchmaking, on considerably smaller servers, and on most servers that worked out just fine.
---
Don’t try to create your future in a game by having faith in its success or future failure. Everything comes to an end. ... also, classic if you want a challenge and group play. . . Retail if you want easy solo play for the majority of the game (until laaaaaate game) .... Basically, go with retail if you want the ion hazzyman candybar made for the general public, who wants instant self gratification and easy times.
---
i hope they do more content past naxx.  Honestly keep it in the spirit of classic and maybe have players vote on it or something
---
Why would you want to out of curiosity?
---
What minimal addon is that?
---
"just group up" - Player on the Faction that can make a group twice as big twice as fast
---
Sounds like he was just waiting for respawns
---
Yes, there's a limit. Other ones aren't going to show up until the other ones despawn.
---
Noggenfogger is about the same. Horde honor farmers have resorted to camping ironforge because there simply aren't alliance in the open world anymore. At any given time you'll find 20-30 hordes in either dun morogh or ironforge, especially in the wee morning hours. We had to go as a 20 man group just to get quints.
---
I still cast it as a formality, and just think "alright use your racial and let's get this over with".
---
Now that I have decent enough PvP gear though, I can usually survive long enough to get the second fear off.
---
..then if they're undead they can trinket out of it anyway. But hey.
---
The eye and the voidwalkers detect stealthed units I think. Atleast the voidwalkers. Learned that the hard way running with an invisibility potion.
---
I'm on a PvP server because that's where all of my friends went.... I would much rather be on PvE but my choice was PvP or play by myself.  Fortunately I'm horde on skeram so it's not a huge issue, but it can still take a few corpse runs to get into DM or BRM.
---
Found it ty

Redwood Tribes
---
&gt;Are you surprised?
---
What the fuck makes you think I'm surprised about that? 
---
\&gt; You can't just re-balance the racials and not touch anything else.    
---
Why not? 
---
\&gt; It becomes a very slippery slope then.  
---
Slippery slope is the go-to excuse for weak minded people who can't say yes now and no later.  You can always assess any change individually, or you can just sLiPpErY sLoPe your way out of it, similar to people claiming same sex marriage must automatically lead to dogs marrying furniture.
---
The main issue is that those people will get instant queues and disappear from the world, leaving only horde groups farming honor while they wait for their 40 min queues.
---
You're right. Some Slavic dude can set up a server in his basement that can handle it, and I can connect to it from halfway across the world with no issues for free. But yeah, we shouldn't hold blizzard to the same standards.
---
Are you even aware of all the changes that already made it past "#nochanges?
---
I doubt it.
---
Yea the t would. It leaves people with 3 options: wait in queue, transfer servers, or quit.
---
Yeah it is really tough to get a definitive answer. I think what we can effectively say is that the diminishing returns that kick in after 315 are to such a degree that it's going to preferable to have more stamina/hp, mitigation stats, or potentially even aggro building stats.
---
Close to 60 on my horde character i made after phase 2 hit. I suspect that will be my new main soon as I'm only raidlogging on my alliance 60 characters atm.
---
I already have made about 9k gold in twink gear because of the increase in prices

Shits good

&gt; Keyring
---
The real news.
---
&gt; I thought this fell into the whole “no changes” thing. 
---
This is "no changes." Cross-realm battlegrounds were in vanilla.
---
&gt; Blizzard isn't "detecting" botters
---
Let's repeat that because you didn't read it. PLAYERS detect the bots. Blizzard doesn't detect shit other than your monthly sub money. Who cares about banwaves if they bring in 5000g to the economy? I sure as fuck don't because the damage has already been done.
---
You have no idea what "logical fallacies" even are, you pulled the term "strawman" out of nowhere for instance, to describe something that if you had even a rudimentary understanding of logic, you'd realize is not a strawman.
---
Throwing words around like they're buzzwords does not help. Seek better education in the topic of logic and philosophy, you would greatly benefit.
---
Seems pretty clear to me; free transfers weaken a faction until a mass exodus occurs. The solution is not to "go easy" on the weaker faction, the solution is to not allow free transfers that further collapse a faction.
---
Flamelash?
---
All the more power to them, but the point of faction based queues is to keep the faction numbers balanced rather than letting the servers be imbalanced.
---
I'm horde and play on a reasonably unbalanced server in MY favour, and if I had have known that wPvP would be like this I would have never played on a PvP server.
---
Watching a bunch of sweaty nerds spam "gO BaCk To ReTaiL" every time they 40 v 1 somebody is so cringy

Stop camping IF

How did yoo wrote dis comment den, you lier!!11

I suspect Skeram US or Noggenfogger EU will be the next one to go. There's a few realm faction imbalances are worse than those, but not many.
---
This pretty much sums up every single issue to do with society RN
---
I would gladly pay 300g for the domo ring on my alt.
---
My bad I saw gnome and assumed rogue.
---
once the netherwalkers spawn its game over for a dagger rogue and i would assume a combat rogue as well. you can't stealth by them.
---
a rogue that's done it a handful of times doesnt have an excuse but they also aren't buying the ring
---
Big risks.
---
WotLK
---
They've made very small updates to the client which have incremented the build number (We're on build 32600 as I type this), but this will be the first time since the Beta that they've incremented the version number (1.13.2 to 1.13.3). So this represents a more substantive update than the micro-updates they've done in the past to the client.

This sounds like an exploit and not a 'trick'

Right, all these damn horde complaining that they are the victims because they griefed the server into unplayabilit. Why won’t anyone think of the bullies!
---
I feel relieved for Horde on Heartseeker and and any other Ally dominated realm but for Alliance in the minority on PvP servers I would worry about queue times. When battlegrounds end Horde will requeue and hearth right back in the zones to grind until the next one pops. Is that 20 minutes? 30? More?
---
The rogue leather is a perfect addition too.
---
&gt;I didn't personally see the GM ban the bot, therefor it didn't happen

Yikes.

Remember silk, mageweave and runecloth is cheaper than a single bandage of each type. If they're really AHing for vendor price, buy the whole thing and turn it into bandages.
---
I’d agree with that. Over 315 might make sense if you were trying to do something really specific backed up with hard data, but that seems to be in short supply.
---
&gt;All the US servers seem to

I wouldn't consider a 10% leaning towards one faction a "huge imbalance".

Depends. Are you a silly goose who plays full ret paladin?
---
Actually sounds like someone who has played each role extensively.  The only people I've noticed that think healing isn't the easiest shit ever have always played healers.
---
It definitely was for me.  You rarely have to make a decision which matters as a healer.  Just heal whoever needs healing and watch your positioning.
---
It is objectively the easiest role in any wow context from dungeons and raids to questing and BGs.
---
 CensusPlusClassic is beyond bad. Look at noggenfogger, server is almost as imbalanced on [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) as shazzraz yet cencus shows that it's 70% alliance. And given the fact that alliance keep getting camped in ironforge 24/7, ironforge one seems accurate. At 5 am there's 21 hordes in ironforge. There's 23 alliance there in comparison.
---
What's the add-on?
---
WoW doesn't even have a TOS. Don't just trust something you heard somewhere.
---
Aloha!  I was in the same boat as you.  My recommendation is to begin with:

---
That being said, there are a few things I have grown to disagree with on there, but it is an incredibly valuable starting point.
---
His guide was super helpful as well... [https://xpoff.com/threads/classic-20-29-guide-and-discussion.81681/](https://xpoff.com/threads/classic-20-29-guide-and-discussion.81681/)   
---
Beyond that I highly recommend [xpoff.com](https://xpoff.com).  Don't be afraid to post on there, people reply a lot.  Like a lot of communities, it is common that (1) the most toxic are the loudest, and (2) a lot of people post things that are wrong.  However, there is a lot of great information on there once you ignore the noise.
---
Hey brotha! Great content. Really big fan of everything. Telling them to stand where, pathing, etc. great job! 
---
Personally - I’ve watched several other people, said meh. Yours was enjoyable though. If you ever make one for how you do ZF &amp; above I’d love to watch it. (I know you commented on this, I just enjoyed it a lot and haven’t seen others with pathing as good as yours :D). Anyway! Gj
---
In both Retail and Classic.  I agree.
---
oh yes. I keep ony neck with mat at all times. Also scarlet, shadowforge, city, and cescent key. Also my seal of the dawn. I'm also 1 gem off UBRS key so that'll eventually be on me.
---
It all the horde on here tell me you have no choice but to camp boats and graveyards. You must have a will of iron!
---
Well partially just to see if you can do it, which from just getting DK's it doesn't look like you can, and partially just to make sure my mage is worth as little honor as possible.
---
It's almost like it's a choice between being efficient and being optimal.
---
Imagine having choice, instead of shit just being fucking given to you.
---
10 years. still #1 game by the numbers
---
Fuck the Horde.
---
those aren't real alliance btw they don't ever gank remember?
---
I've been saying that this is what they wanted really. They "won" wpvp. That's what you get when you form 120 man ganksquads and make it unable to play the game for hours or days on end for people. 
---
This is what people asked for. If you want fair and balanced wpvp servers, you wouldn't use ever single dirty trick in the book to get an advantage. You wouldn't form 200 man death squads and grief people all day. You cause this with your behavior. You just didn't realize this is what you asked for when you treat it as a giant honor processing plant. 
---
For the record, I'm on a pvp server. I don't dislike it. It can he really fun. But I knew this was coming. I farmed gold, raid mats, and hibernated except raids and dungeons and leveled an alt during the blitz. Now it's over and I think our server is unbalanced now when it was 50/50. I think this is a good example of why certain changes happen even though people speak against them.
---
Woah grats man, yet to see this sucker drop, it looks fucken amazing
---
Ahahah
---
My issue with flying is its just boring. Its just point in a straight line and wait X minutes.
---
We might as well get teleported to the dungeons at that point.
---
If you are going to you should only fight green mobs. Anything yellow or orange and you're going to miss a lot.
---
Haha thanks for the feedback there mate
---
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen in weeks lol.
---
How does this not have more updoots?
---
Stop saying this.  Do you bot?  Do you have first hand knowledge?  If not, please stop being a parrot.
---
For me, personally, I'd rather have Classic+ with pristine servers than #NoChanges forever
---
I'm not upset that WoW changed over time, I just hate what retail became.
---
If that's true, I am sure played IRL the same way he played in game
---
"You go and discover, I already know" while he stayed behind to buy some time
---
That's because the Alliance who are camping at Mojache aren't killing the Horde camping the road from  the boat to DM.
---
Depends on the battlegroups, ratios don't matter - server population does. Simple fact is horde has a majority on every single PVP server in Classic WoW both EU and US - which also happens to be the most populated server type and understandably the most active for PVP such as BG's. 
---
Also people throwing around the 53% alliance figure - look again at the level 60 stats. 53% horde globally at 60. My battlegroup (Oceanic) has 3 active alliance at 60 for every 4 horde. There's going to be queue time.
---
That's ElvUI's loot frame.
---
which ones? theres several i listed in a comment below.
---
very similar!
---
alliance i take it?

how do you know it's 6 weeks exactly? They only said early 2020 didn't they? That could potentially mean March if you consider any month within the first quarter to be "early".
---
i like that. suits a warrior.
---
pretty unique, reminds me of WC3!
---
shit take
---
not sure if links are allowed here, im gonna pm you.
---
Im pretty patient, though i believe ittl go up at bwl launch. The lesser guilds wont be able to cleae the content without titans, its either they start to consume or they disband. At lwast imo. I just got my warrior to 60 so im planning on using those groms for my flasks if they dont go up in price anyway.
---
Grob is a shit server. There are never any good rp events. Huge faction imbalance. Trust me you won't like it here.
---
You know whats fun?    
---
Doing Scholo, see the DDs add 2 more groups and 2 more later with running adds, having your MT in the group, beeing geared and living through it cause your tank holds aggro and you can't go oom anymore  healing 1 target.
---
pretty bold, i like having the cheat sheet when i need it. but looks real clean.
---
I do it this way too. It feels like this was the intended way to do it otherwise the developers wouldn't have your bars swap out.
---
You didn't know about the general scorn and contempt held for pve realm players?
---
You are what console gamers are to pc gamers. What soccer fans are to any number of contact football sport fans. The greens voting vegan cyclists of Azeroth.
---
It's always strange to me seeing so many players happy about the prospect of paying another $25 *per character* to Blizzard for problems Blizzard (mostly) created. I doubt they'll even control/manage paid transfers to ensure the game doesn't break further.
---
It's almost like you didn't even read the post. I didn't say "free daul-spec" I said make it an option that you can unlock whether it be by gold or a quest. Not everyone can grind 100g a week for pvp, some people have school and/or work.
---
Ah.  Yes.
---
It's horrible. It took me over an hour to get into BRD last night because I had to keep stopping to gank alliance. I couldn't go more than 10 steps without having to farm more honor.
---
15-20% of the total, but when compared faction to faction it’s 50% more players. We’ll make it easy: 10,000 total players. If it’s 60/40 then that’s 6000 horde and 4000 alliance. And 6000 is 150% of 4000.
---
Imbalances in the 60/40 range are actually significant, even though they don’t look bad on paper. I totally get why 65/35 and 70/30 servers just went to shit, because that’s more than double the players on the other side.
---
should have like 4 guys fighting over the lawnmower then it's accurate
---
Game has been out 3 months
---
WE'RE GOING HOME BOYS
---
Holy shit I love the last kingdom
---
Queue times are good for rankers. They get forced breaks that don't hurt their ranking. Unless it's long enough to make it worth to fly out and WPvP then it sucks
---
Nice info!
---
when the horde main says "durr just make your own groups if youre tired about being camped by groups"
---
Vanilla had cross-realm bgs brotha
---
But the balance is almost 50/50, didnt they have a big Halloween event thing?
---
Funny enough I was reading through his guide as I posted this. Thanks for the links! Will be very helpful.
---
Wow you really roasted me, le epic meme style!
---
Glad you're on my side lol
---
Sexy loot :)
---
Sure, it’s Itemrack
---
Explain please?
---
You're bringing utility,  figure out what buffs you  add to increase the raids dps, you can keep a judgement on the boss , you may have to hurt your own dps to buff the raid dps(like a lock not using dots and using curse of elements). And you might have to do boss fights differently- on rag you can't stand with the melee. But it won't take much dps to beat some people who pug mc
---
Thanks! I switched to this keybind set up years ago when I was tired pf clicking xD probably a better way to go. Mr penguin here answered it quite well actually!
---
Even if 10% of PvE players queue it helps PvP horde queue times. No assumptions required
---
I'm the exact opposite. I don't feel arms is bursty at all. But I also have never had a good 2 hander.
---
Yeah that can't really work though. A lot of these unbalanced servers are also highly populated. You shove 2 high populated servers together and we've created a bigger problem then we solved.
---
Im from EU and on NA East and its only 110 ping.
---
Lmao jesus.
---
It was less arguing, more laughing at how quickly he jumped to judge something he obviously misunderstood. That and his inability to admit his mistake. 
---
Loved the gif
---
Something similar happened to me this weekend. Questing at the trolls in STV on my hunter. Priest tries to gank me and I kill him. He log on his 60 lock and kills me. Not 5 mins later he ganks me on his preist and succeeds. I res, track him down, and kill him. So what does he do...gets on his lock and camps me. What a Nacy!
---
He didn’t say any foul p,ay was done, he just said he thought it was a scummy practice. Relax man.
---
Isnt vampire clan made up from the NA members of private server APES?
---
yeah kinda
---
Yeah, because none of us bear tanks had any clue to PvP and get our trinkets. Are you dense or something?
---
Judging by the botter forums, about 1 week.
---
Not my fault you picked the wrong faction. 
---
Believe me, I know alliance can be jerks, but there's more horde overall, statically speaking there's more horde jerks than alliance jerks. Facts hurt sometimes
---
It takes 5 minutes of non PvP action for it to flick off.  If you're on a PvE server, you can simply just never turn it on in the first place, but on PvP servers your PvP flag is ticked on whenever you enter a non-friendly territory, known as a contested zone.  So if you enter the Hillsbrad Foothills on a PvE server, you can remain unflagged.  On a PvP server, you are tagged; if you were to hearth to your capital, it would take 5 minutes for you to unflag.
---
You can wait while you're dead, but it's effectively a 5 minute timer on everything I would presume.
---
hnnnnnn i want one so bad T.T
---
They could give out free faction change?
---
Amazing lol thanks for making this
---
they look like they're wearing blood elf halloween masks.
---
Even currently my own server Arugal, which has DOUBLE the active level 60 population and nearly TRIPLE the overall 60 population had a worse ratio of horde/alliance as Flamelash and even now isn't far off hasn't had any kind of exodus of players or guilds. Flamelash players should just reroll horde if they want a easy win hugbox, leaving a server over imbalance is pathetic.
---
Yeah, tanking god for about 7 second then they go OOM and because a squishy bag of shit,  barely making it out of the trash pack alive, and then have to sit down for 30 seconds drink.
---
Technically it's dec 10 where blizzard is and they were probably just going off of that. Their internal time would still be dec 10 for the corporate main office.
---
It’s 32
---
This is great. Nice shout out to the Ally that laid off after the ding.
---
I mean if an elephant died recently...
---
I have been deleted by this mess a fair few times. It sucks and I’m sad you’ve shown everyone who watches how to do it. 
---
On the flip side tho, if enough people pull it off consistently then maybe it will get fixed.
---
nope
---
happy with all realms v all realms
---
stop whinging
---
I got a laugh. Also paladins aren't that bad but it's SUPREMELY fight dependent. There's no other tank better than paladin for picking onyxia back up in p3.
---
If your class can heal or tank. You should be prepared to do either. You shouldn't have to spec for either till 60 and not really then either
---
Ive been saying the horde on sulfuruas are terrible for a long time, horde dominated server where tue alliance rule the streets. Ypu should see the tanks ive had to roll with in 5 mans horde side. Made me want to quit the game, instead just raid log on my main and created a warrior.
---
LOL, sorry I hit a nerve. "I lost the argument so now I'm gonna bring up irrelevant stuff that has nothing to do with what we're talking about to try and prove a point". I'm about 4 peices away from full raid BiS, I'm aware of what it takes to gear and raid prep. If you like not having fun that's cool, but I personally would prefer some things not be so cumbersome that don't need to be. I like to enjoy the games I play and not need 100g a week to be able to pvp. The same reason that the honor system is shit and if you think otherwise you need help.
---
I reported with screen shots people trading hks on my server, blizzard has not done shit about it. Instead they muted me for a month for telling people in LFG about the wintraders, i posted in lfg about it 3 times over 8 hours. When i appealed the silence, the blizzard employee linked me the tos and told me to not reply again.
---
Stop wearing garbage like deathbone and full +defense gear. If you grab a flurry axe and use wisdom you won't go oom. Seriously, you might as well just wear lawbringer and judgement gear to tank, it'll do you better than garbage like deathbone.
---
The best healing talents are at the top of the tree
---
Grats OP!
---
Wrath babies might come back for lich king but the people who left at that time probably wont... I know I wont play it. I quit then why would I play it now?
---
PVE seems pretty healthy so far. Doubt our servers are gonna die anytime soon.
---
The shield is nice I guess. &gt;&gt;
---
&gt; If you tell any game devs to make changes in line with Vanilla with TBC as example of good rework, unless they are completely stupid, they can do it
---
Many developers tried to and have failed.
---
I hit redridge and hillsbrad on my 19's
---
Hey, thank you I really appreciate it!  I will think about possibly putting together a ZF one sometime this week/weekend,however I will just post it to youtube and not reddit. There are other pulls on the channel too, but I didn't wan't to upload each vid periodically with it's own post, so I just picked the one I assumed would be the most interesting considering how many people might have alts in the SM range. Thanks again for the kind words!
---
Must be an RP server.
---
yeah i don't think this will actually be a big deal at all. after BGs drop the world will become a much safer place. there will still be ganking of course but not in the insane numbers we've been seeing lately, more like from phase 1 i would think. The really annoying tryhards will be in BGs
---
I second your last sentence.
---
Yeah if I’m trying to get my money worth I’ll just play PoE and league. Both are free, both deliver new content often and both have devs that care a ton about their game. If all my friends were playing either of those games I wouldn’t have played WoW at all tbh.
---
Yea, it's a video game. But it's also a social thing. If you want to be in a good guild that has easy raids there are expectations. This isnt dota or league or even retail where you just jump in and out on a whim.
---
As a fellow priest, I would like to advise you that with a little creativity, Mind Control is one hell of a spell for world pvp. It's all about location, location, location. Yeah, in wide open field that Warrior will probably rip you apart, but in BRM you can drown him in lava.
---
You misspelled Peacebloom!
---
But you can do what he describes if you want to top the DPS charts while tanking.
---
*thinking* 25s?
---
RR, Duskwood, Ashenvale.
---
Barber shop plz. It won't ruin anyone's game, it's cosmetic!
---
Literally copy pasted the blue post, its 32
---
HoJ exists, took me about 25 runs to see. Almost lost it to a hunter who wanted it "for PvP". I would've uninstalled if I lost it to them.
---
Exactly, it's just a money sink. The difference is the things he listed don't stop you from enjoying different aspects of the game while trying to pvp as pve spec is just stupid, you will get stomped in any 1v1 just because you don't pay 100g a week.
---
There isn’t an easy way to check for him afaik. Luckily, since most melee dps want to travel to the unforgiven boss, it isn’t really out of the way.
---
&gt; but it's gonna kill honorspy too
---
Probably not because it can still sync over guild, party and with nearby randoms using the new say/yell "channels". It'll just be slightly slower to update.
---
Money sinks are important for removing gold from the economy and curbing inflation.  
---
If you want to pvp optimally and raid optimally shell out the gold. If not then find a spec that is passable for both, or just do BG's in your raid spec like most people do.
---
This is too good rofl
---
Are you that dumb or just trolling.. literally google wow tos
---
Eh, a few hours on the 60 and about 2 levels on the alt.
---
Man I have never seen a faction so completely ass raped even going back to the stress test in Oct 2004. Alliance were destroyed so hard it killed the server. Kek.
---
If the bracket one and two players who see each other every day multiple times anyway take the few minutes each morning to ensure that they all get the maximum honor off of each other before they go out and farm then it should end up being a significant amount, like 10% of your week
---
And no TOS shows up.
---
When you say your are clutching pearls it is a totally different mental image.
---
The reason this doesn't work is that it dispels, it does not make you immune. That means that you must drop form before the fear, wait for the fear to happen, then trinket out of it and resume form. This is a recipe for getting a dead night elf.
---
If you want to bg a lot, then definitely get to 48-49. If you just want to try it out, then not a big deal.
---
Because the “800+ dps” players are actually using the more than readily available information that tells the player what gear to get and what buttons to press and make the effort to spec true PVE talents while raiding. They also aren’t sloppy with enchants, consumables or fuck around with useless debuffs. Some even use the world buffs.  
---
All these things existed in the earlier versions of the game too and would still have meant the game would be beyond trivial. 
---
But you of course have plenty of people who in classic cba, don’t know or still think it is 2005 from talents to gearing. How people choose to play the game is ofc everyone’s own prerogative but it’s not like 1.12 talents give every class 400% more dps over night. Player decision and min-max is what gives a bigger boost than talents.
---
In OG vanilla more hunters than warrior/rogues had Dal rend’s. Rogues raided with CB+Prep talents. FR stacking was a thing for half of MC and there was zero understanding of mechanics.
---
GRATS HOMIE !!!
---
Depends on the class, some of it is fantastically worse than it's original incarnation
---
Compare the world tournament prize pool to dota 2's tho
---
Lore purposes, also you have to use the main entrance if no one in the group has the key.
---
That's why you use the backdoor
---
Currently me.
---
Just reply: Too bad, I fucked your mom. Who’s your daddy?
---
Lol.
---
how long is the maintenance?
---
Shoot I’m even willing to do a faction transfer to help out. I’d transfer my horde warlock to alliance but I sure as hell am not leveling to 60 again
---
Only 5 60's? Wow, that sounds a lot better balanced than 8x the amount of horde in ironforge than alliance are online.
---
&gt; Vanilla is not perfect, it’s vanilla.
---
And classic is not vanilla, get that through your head. They are not the same game and never will be.
---
&gt; Flying was extremely well received.
---
&gt; Dungeon finder was extremely well received.
---
&gt; Cross realm everything was extremely well received.
---
Literally none of that is true.
---
That's just not true lol. My friends in discord have also been complaining about it
---
Any reliable data about the procc chance of that thing?
---
Dual spec is a money sink, just not an infinite one. There can are plenty of those already built in to the game.
---
This is SO funny, it’s incredible the amount of alliance that used BG queues as this catch all “ENJOY YOUR KARMA FOR KILLING ALLIES ON PVP SERVERS HORDE LAWL.”  Oh not to mention “HEY THERES GOING TO BE A QUEUE FOR EVERY HORDE OUT THERE BECAUSE NUMBERS.”  Damn I can’t wait for all of those people to never admit they were wrong.
---
I run a 5 man hunter group and we use pets as tanks. Currently clearing RFK at 28.
---
Yep.  You have to Q at the actual entrance or at a capital city - and from memory you come out at the point where you Q'd.
---
How can you tell if someone rolled on a PVE server?  Don’t worry, they’ll tell you.
---
Holy shit, someone that actually has a brain in this thread
---
What about the *laughs in PVE server*???  That one was classic!
---
Honestly it made me giggle when I read it lmao
---
On my server (Fairbanks) the boom occurred right after they announced the release of the phase and they have consistently declined in price since then.
---
Doing nothing is better than destroying the game for everyone on the server though.
---
To me that's the most depressing thing about classic PvP I don't want to just grind for a rank it doesn't feel like PvP at all sigh maybe if I was 15 again and brainless
---
The tank shuold be building aggro while she's in the air. If they are a warrior tell them to pick up a few whelps and stand under her using the rage to smack her. Make sure people aren't killing his whelps and he'll be able to rebuild his threat. The fireball that hit him first wiped all threat he had and now he has to rebuild.
---
If it's a druid just tell them to do druid shit and she'll go back to him no problem(druids don't really need the whelps to build aggro again).
---
If it's a paladin, tell them to start spamming Blessing of Kings when she hits about 45% on the most populated class in your raid. She'll walk righ tup to him when she lands.
---
Upvoted for spelling “queue,” correctly. You are a rare treasure on the internet.
---
Those extra clicky keys tho
---
Living Alliance players? This is so fake.
---
Do you mean there are special dedicated raid and party data channels?
---
Or do you believe 99.9% of addons pollute the chat channels?
---
Mc
---
My bad, i thought i replied to a comment about faction specific queues
---
Has the H:A ratio changed since vanilla? Horde have always had higher queue times but I can't really remember ever having to wait 15 min except during off hours.
---
I said the flamelash horde deserve to suffer, you don't sound like horde so ??? But yes, if you had main on horde side it was your job to reign in the toxic edge lord transcendent ones. It might be impossible this go round what with populations being what they are, but it is still an essential duty for server health. It should now be the flamelash hordes mission to show the people that ruined PvP on their server the same mercy they had shown the alliance. Every horde raid focused guild on that server got screwed and they should be out for blood.
---
Dual spec is already in the game. It’s 50g.
---
Yeah man!
---
Skeram and Stalagg alliance have world boss kills, how many do heartseeker horde have?
---
That's true but I doubt there's a lack of casual guilds right now.
---
Be there for a gates opening,  scarab mount would be awesome,  I'd like to see naxx, clearing it might be hard unless my guild grows more. T2 and aq gear on my pally, rank 11 on all my toons, maybe higher on my lock. Grand marshal isn't even a thought. I couldn't keep up with no lifers when I had no life, now that I'm working/etc there's no chance. I'll buy the gear later in tbc
---
What did they say?
---
We are missing the real classic experience, if we roll on a pve server?
---
I regret nothing.
---
people getting mad on the internet. lol Classic.
---
Not surprised by the downvotes, the majority of this sub are private server players and the subreddit community is (luckily) not indicative of the wonderful ingame community.
---
&gt;     burning through the surplus.
---
That's kind of my point, that they won't be burning through their surplus if they have 20-30 flasks. I'm not going to flask after we have it on farm. Only people who actively "parse" trying to top warcraftlogs flask for content on farm.
---
It probably won't drop too much, but I suspect as with the DM release that some prices are higher now because people know they will be used in the next phase.
---
Black Pristine Diamonds went for 40g the day DM was announced, now they are back at 10-15g on my server. I suspect something similar will happen to flasks\black lotus.
---
Woooooosh
---
If paid transfers will be a thing, what are the odds of a race change option later on?
---
compare the spring / summer salary of individual players like huni's
---
https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/huni-reportedly-agrees-to-a-2-year-2-3-million-extension-with-dignitas
---
which is guaranteed money.
---
getting 2nd place in dota TI gets you $4mil which is split between 5 players so $800k per player for 1 year (again 2nd place...)
---
SWEETMOTHEROFGODPVEHEREICOME
---
Epic mount still costs gold, then consumables and enchants. Hold onto it
---
Never seen it, I need it so hard would sell my grandma for it
---
Ugh 😫
---
Never seen the sword, it’s so huge I would pay 1k euro for it :(((
---
My ign is Doosty and lots of people say Dootsy lol. Now I've got a dope alt name. :D
---
All twinks should have exp turned off. There is an npc that does it for you for a small fee.
---
where did you see 8 hour maintenance?
---
Apart from the previous suggestions on mouseover healing and addons and such, I haven't seen the most important tip: Communication. Don't be afraid to mention that certain situations might be too hard to heal. Especially when you've done dungeons multiple times you know what parts are particularly iffy or hard to keep people up.   
---
Also stay in contact with your tank, I usually whisper the tank that I'm fine with him pulling as long as I'm over 50% mana. In the beginning this sometimes caused confusion and irritation as it seems like I'm telling the tank how to play the game, however you'll notice you'll get smoother runs.
---
Usually when you have to keep up the whole group, something is not right. Either the tank isn't generating enough threat or the DPS are generating too much. Tell the DPS to watch his threat if you notice you can't keep the tank up because some DPS wants his damage meters to explode.
---
I have been playing wow since the release of classic and started healing about halfway through my first lvl 60 (Paladin). I think its amazing and I know I have made great improvements in my healing game. Sure, sometimes I have an off day and sometimes I still fuck up, but since I started communicating my issues on the run I feel like both my healing game and the general mood in the group have improved.
---
Nope just wanna get out of pvp all together, I dont even like gsnking people
---
Tell it to everyone suggesting faction based queues lol
---
that's just wrong.
---
honorspy GATHERS data via each player inspecting or mousing over others. it puts everything into a single database
---
the ENTIRE database is communicated to others, and from others to you, via guild or when you die in a BG. the database for every single player with the addon is the same, as long as they are in a guild or join BGs. 
---
it uses raid, BG and guild channels for this. 
---
it will still be just as accurate, except for those who don't log in at the end of the week to get the latest version synced to them. 
---
again, you never have to "sync with every player" since every player has the same database. just syncing to one will get you the latest info. if you don't log in the entire week and just join a BG on monday before reset, you will still get the entire database.
---
Yes, at least for leveling.  They have the same stat modifiers but bats can’t use claw.  So basically you are going screech + bite + dive + growl.  I think you can find some in RFD.  There is a cool rare white one too.
---
Look up raid helper for discord. You won’t be disappointed. The guy also wrote an accompanying addon to send out invites.
---
Gneiss
---
Isn’t it 12 keys?
---
What were they to do when besides increasing population cap to meet private server standards basically no other changes were supported that would have resulted in anything different? 
---
Not trying to be rude or anything, I've thought about it A LOT and can't come up with anything that would be deemed acceptable by the classic community that would actually help.
---
Then, because they "won the war" they also can't do battlegrounds.
---
If you're facing Ele shamans, they can guarantee 2 crits in a row every 3 minutes with Elemental Mastery, and their crits hit for 200% instead of 150%. You can save yourself from this by dispelling them if you see them glow blue/orange (usually immediately followed by starting up a Chain Lightning cast)
---
- Sincerely, a Resto Shaman
---
Hell, I do this with peoples names in real life, not just game names. Also character's names in other games and books. I might be an asshole though.
---
Roll Alliance and you get instant queues (or whatever is the less dominant faction).
---
The issue is that cross realm BGs are considered by many to be the start of the end of server communities
---
Interesting, thanks! Do you spam  farm sfk? What class are you? I tried it as a mage for a few lock outs but couldn't really figure out how to do optimally.
---
I want to say the only backup thing is a bold lie.  You can bet they still have Diablo 2 server backups, not characters, but server-side tools and stuff, from patches before WoW.
---
It is bugged. Still waiting for some other fixes as well like disgusting oozeling
---
GOTEEM
---
Great to hear!
---
I don’t remember finding anything useful at all in chests back in vanilla
---
that is fucking pure comedy gold
---
You're giving off that Grinch vibe my dude. Here have a candy cane made with love.
---
Amen
---
My original server never underwent a death spiral up until TBC and Belfs - an allies had enjoyed a slight pop advantage till then, as most realms.
---
People have more access to info than before and min max culture more dominant - the second people are under the impression that a side has a slight advantage it will cause a positive feedback loop, now.
---
This. Same reason my guild won't allow PvP specs in raids.
---
12 keys can be stored in it at level 60
---
I'm personally disappointed, because BG queue times are basically the only incentive in all of WoW to deliberately join the less populous faction on a given server.
---
The more numerous faction gets the advantage in WPvP, improving odds in gathering, mob farming, and questing, and has more potential players to group up with, making it faster to form dungeon/raid PUGs. The less numerous faction has... better BG queue times. Or at least, that's the way things work without cross realm.
---
Just from a game design perspective, this is the only mechanism that ever existed in Vanilla to help balance faction numbers within servers. But since it always disadvantages the dominant faction, it's guaranteed to disadvantage the majority of the playerbase, and thus will always be unpopular even if it's good for the overall health of the game.
---
At max level? No there aren't.  
---
After you've got your skills and professions and mount done, respecs are the only real gold sinks at max level. Dual spec would cause the economy to inflate like fucking crazy.
---
This is probably Heartseeker
---
No, I thought classic would be like vanilla.  Considering that's, ya know, the whole bloody point.
---
This is actually kind of false. Horde is the better faction when it comes to wPvP and duels. Alliance is the faction you go to to win organized BGs. 
---
Paladins are just too amazing for it. Dwarf and Dwarf priests are also pretty good
---
Nah I liked Advertise at first, he was funny and I thought he was just trying to make the game more interesting. Then he started to get twitch subs, and then he started blatantly lying to his audience to try to avoid getting banned and keep the asmon hate boners erect and gifting him subs. "not sniping btw" yeah ok bud.
---
I made this comment in response to someone else. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e7wr3n/asmongolds_guild_and_retail_wow_players_caught/fabqv70/?context=3
---
What you said about Advertise's discord is such a fucking lie dude I gotta say it again. They "invaded" a public server named Asmongankers, the fucking horror. 90% of advertise's content was either watching asmon vods or talking about asmon/esfand, of course he got banned it's blatantly against ToS. He's playing the victim to appeal to asmon haters it's very obvious I don't understand how people can't see past their asmon hate and understand that.
---
Agreed, will see how BGs cause my server to turn out. If they don't fix it, it's off to PVE for me.
---
You're drawing a considerable amount of conclusions over what I said without actually understanding what I said.  And given your last comment, either you've goldfish'd what I wrote earlier, or you've got something in your brain that is rendering you incapable of that eureka moment of understanding.
---
I get the "I have to be right, OR...  I have to have the last word" mentality, but that doesn't translate to a message board as well as it does casual conversations.  You're not inconveniencing people to agree with you, or to stop their conversation so they can go take a piss...  You're just extending it without purpose; because I can simply respond in a time and place of my convenience.

Maybe they had empathy and let him enjoy dinging 60
---
Dude, no. Multiple times they said THE 10th.
---
[Proof 1](https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU_EN/status/1202915804100079616)
---
[Proof 2](https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1202226067739742208)
---
Now I know mistakes can be made/timezones is hard, but with seeing this information presented to me weeks beforehand, yeah, I trusted Blizzard to release them on the 10th. Which they are. On NA.
---
&gt; A 32 war and 32 pally came on us
---
Keep going.
---
Hoping they reveal details for these within December. Probably taking my level 30 warr from Faerlina to Mankrik, or at least see if the streamers will move off and let the queues die down. Really want to get back into the game but I can't keep getting weighed down by both queues *and* death runs
---
I’ve always used my middle mouse button / pushing mouse wheel down. Then I’ve always used mouse wheel down for gouge and mouse wheel up either evi or bs depending on spec.
---
What addon is it ive seen warriors use that tells raid chat incase of resist taunt? Also when you use last stand it calculates how much hp you gain/lose from it and yells it out
---
60/40 is approaching double the players on 1 side over the other.
---
You reach 66:33 and that's 2 for every 1. That is significant.
---
The biggest downside is having to wait for people in dungeon to actually roll for a fuckin worthless pile of junk....
---
I've leveled to 60 in arms, prot, and now almost done with fury.
---
Prot isn't necessary for tanking, but it makes tanking easier. That said, your damage will suck, and soloing will suck. Don't level as prot, unless you really want to or plan on sticking almost exclusively to dungeons.
---
For Arms vs Fury, either is fine. Arms will be easier, but you can ignore the people who say you *must* go Arms or that leveling fury isn't "viable".
---
The reason arms is easier is largely because hit % is less important when 2handing rather than Dualwielding, which suits Arms rather than Fury. Arms also offers some good utility talents such as tactical mastery and sweeping strikes. There is also a great 2hander for a big quest reward for a class quest.
---
Ultimately do what you want- there's not a *wrong* way. If you want the smoothest path, I would stick with Arms.
---
HES BEEN MURDERED! GOD DAM YOU GROB!!
---
That wasn’t the point of your original comment though. If that’s what you’re saying now, what I said still stands. This fixed the game being literally unplayable for Alliance and has just disappointed griefing Horde no-lifers, as far as the one server goes. So far, it hasn’t caused the end-times on the servers they migrated to, but if it DOES get worse, they’ll have to create a new fix. I’m not sure what it would be, but making the game even playable vs. “boohoo I can’t farm honor in a 10v1 anymore” is still a win, and a temporary band-aid at worst.
---
Well then you're only halfway to your wrath pants limit!
---
I mean I do 300 to 400 dps as a tank so it's probably not fine to do 400 but alright
---
Actually, it's not the highest threat that can be generated per second. That'd be a class stacked GBOK pally.
---
Some actual substance, not just randomly spewed bollocks to fuel one side of a circle jerk.
---
some warriors done even want them 😭
---
That kind of "macho" attitude towards PvE realms feels so silly to me. Especially because going through STV with PvP enabled was pretty much the same.
---
They updated it several hours ago to correctly say only 12.
---
I agree that an “auto balance” mechanic would’ve been really nice, but you’re underestimating the difficulty in getting such a system right. Off the top of my head, if you are counting “horde characters” vs “alliance characters” and forcing balance based off that:
---
What happens when new people stop joining the server? What happens when people quit playing the game? Is a level one character equally weighted against a level sixty character? What if someone has multiple characters of different levels? Does a player with 10 horde characters count as +10 to the horde population, even though he/she can only be logged in to one of them at any given time? If not, which character counts? 
---
All of these questions are important because remember, the design goal is to avoid having players feel like they are significantly outnumbered. That’s hard to define. If players still feel outnumbered, it doesn’t matter how well your “auto balance” system managed to keep (# Horde Characters) = (# Alliance Characters). 
---
Blizzard probably realized that it it was too risky to try and make this system. If they screwed it up, it would be a PR nightmare way worse than how things are now.
---
Always stretch before any extended periods of repetitive actions.
---
Leaving stuff in a chest stops it from respawning. You're leaving the next guy with a fucking jug of Melon juice. Loot the crap as well and just destroy it, don't be that guy!
---
(X) Doubt.
---
Was in vanilla so why should it not be in classic..?
---
Grobb is garbage. Don't come here.
---
No impact. The majority of people will quit long before server transfer come online. Just think how long it took Blizzard to figure out something simple like the keyring.
---
all the funny shit is happening on Mograine... Fortune teller in IF, JokerD and now this. I'm proud of you guys!
---
Like 90% agree - that said, you can create a culture of “camping greys is scrub shit” to some extent. 
---
My guild will mock you constantly if you do and grey list you from premades coming up, etc...
---
Personally, I don’t attack warriors under 60 because I played one in vanilla for a while and know it’s a struggle/mages are just a hard counter, and playing one just feels cheap against them.
---
Just skipping an easy win once in a while can do a lot for the other person whose prob been ganked endlessly and just finished a corpse run.
---
I'm sure if they find a situation to people having the same name but they just need to merge some of the more dying realms. 
---
Seems like they're just trying to milk more money out of classic while they can till the new xpac.
---
Imagine classic with orc and undead nerfed.
---
Imagine classic with dual spec so we dont have to waste 100g on respec tax.
---
Literally 2 changes, nothing else.
---
And see the same guy at the top of the leaderboard.
---
100% when the WOTLK server comes out
---
Counting for "kills around you" doesnt occur. what does occur is inspecting people that you mouseover and check their honor tab (this is why users with HonorSpy can at random times hear the close window sound)
---
You need to find each other! Then create lvl1 chars on a pve Server, find yourselves a nice and quite lake and live happily ever after!
---
You should really check in with a physical therapist who knows his or her shit. As someone who have experienced massive issues with these things for 15 years due to being 202cm tall (6'7something) and have hyper mobility syndrome, I would not kid around with this stuff. Many wrist problems comes from the shoulders. Are you by any chance hunched a bit (like 3/4 of the population) when using your computer? ;)
---
I am using pedals for my feet for things like mouse presses (holding down a mouse button is easier if you use your foot as well making ARPGs a lot easier ot deal with).
---
You should also listen to Futtekiller123 suggesting to bind it to your mousewheel, unlock said wheel and let it spin spin spin.
---
If anything I've gotten more boe blues from chests out in the world than greens. Very very rarely do they contain a green.
---
Considering the fast amount of time invested into playing the game to rank highly it's goes into reverse.  
---
I pity people having the time to actually play 13weeks 18hours a day.
---
Yes, you can play 2-3 weeks 18 hours daily no sweat with 30days vacation a year and being a bachelor.
---
But as always in life there are nuances and somebody who can piss away 3months is either uber wealthy and can do whatever or he is in a place in life in which ranking in WoW is not the best idea in order to get back on track in one's life.
---
Enjoy working tomorrow, dumbass.
---
What happened before this?
---
I really don’t see going into bg’s as rank 8/9 significant st all. And it’ll be even less significant if they don’t have the ability to grind to beat the massive decay that starts hitting around rank 10-11. They will lose all their ranks or stall out and I imagine we’ll start to see “wow blizzard all my work for nothing!!! Fix!!!” Posts in a week. Just the other day a dude was posting about how he’s rank 7 been grinding 4-6 hours a day and achieving respectable brackets. Wants to know what his changes of hitting high ranks with that level of grinding is once bg’s are active.
---
So spend a few months leveling and gearing a naw char rather than just moving our old? Yea right.
---
It’s not. 
---
Servers were way, way smaller and faction imbalance wasn’t this bad till Belfs.
---
Blizzard making a change in creating megaservers + the positive feedback loop of much more informed people picking horde to not be out numbered/ to outnumber resulted in super un-vanilla circumstances and trends.
---
No need for thanks, just doing the public a service and saving them valuable time and resources. Remember #BoycottGrobullus
---
You are right. It isn't a fight on paper. Also add a healer to the equation and you might even win against a lot of others. Fritting for about 400 on an autostrike and instantly finish people off with execute. It's sick. Spam hamstring the moment you join the fight and get some overpower crits going.
---
Warrior is still big damage. Clothies be ware.
---
Most useful item I've gotten is a travellers backpack. Got it from my first chest while doing trib runs on my hunter.
---
45 runs so far and that's the only useful thing I've gotten from the chest spawns.
---
I wonder if you see the irony.
---
Never. Hope to see kids in wsg in your juicy free honor specs. If you cant make 100g a week you wont see naxx either.
---
Man, sharks like doubled in price when this happened in old rs
---
Random blues?? You can literaly see a combination of pre raid bis and tier 1.
---
wowclassicpopulation relies on users submitting data, so it really depends on the realm. 
---
I do scan multiple times per day on each faction on Faerlina so it's pretty accurate for that. But some realms have literally no data for one faction or the other.
---
65 35? I dunno
---
So?
---
Your 203 dps warrior didn't die at all, only your warlock and oyur hunter died. The 206 dps from your dead warlock is an 81 parse and the 210 dps from your worst mage is a 79 parse. Even your warriors 203 dps is a 72 parse. 
---
What contradicts what I said in any way? Just because in your raid 200 dps is pretty low, doesn't make it so everywhere, you can see right there, that all your players parsed above average or good even with "just" 200dps.
---
Didn’t get feared out there or something?
---
Fucking hell how difficult is it to keep to a self-made schedule.
---
It should start after reset yes, but it would be nice if they said so from the start. 
---
Had a nice day planned...
---
Can the ubrs key even be put in the keyring? It's technically not a key, it's a ring.
---
Using the mouse wheel with modifiers was a true game changer for me e.G. shift-wheel up
---
Serious question: I thought white supremacists took this meme?
---
I really don't keep up these days.
---
but wont ban anyone for it cus lost subsciptiona
---
welcome to blizztard everyone :D
---
And water is wet!
---
You are literally retarded if you don't understand what it means if the system incentivizes this
---
Where did you get 32 slots from?
---
thats the blizztard way of doing things :D
---
That's going to vary by server as the prices of mats will differ.
---
That would depend on your servers price for mats mate
---
That would make sense, on a new server opened today.. as for current servers, the only solution I see is server merge.
---
Just opening server transfers won’t balance things cause it’ll be up to players to decide, and players always decide to take the easy way
---
In general most enhance shaman will run windfury 100% of the time while raiding. The longer fights definitely do make it more useful like you described, but the other sad truth is that most enhance shaman aren’t going to be near the top of the dps charts, so they tend to shift focus towards supporting the raid (totem-twisting, emergency off-heals, etc) rather than minmaxing dps.

---
On the realm select only firemaw show full for a while.
---
Are you an Orc Rogue?
---
This isn't pvp... They're moving in such a massive group most likely to prevent them from losing their buffs to a alliance tryhard guild.
---
Your raid group on the other hand, is camping that path to look for solo players. They're being careful with their pve buffs, while you're looking to gang up on solos.
---
Is the hypothesis I land at, at least.
---
As a healer....Yes...this...happens....a....lot......
---
I mean he’s not wrong. It’s not uncommon for a rogue to just flat out ignore an orc and walk away because of how broken their racial is.
---
Gross, im UD master race.
---
Thanks for the feedback. My level 10 hunter has a bat. The mushroom vendor in UC sells mushrooms for 4c each and I bought 100 and mailed it to myself.
---
It doesn't matter how much honor you farm, if enough people don't get the minimum 15 HKs on your faction then you can't reach the top brackets. I think it's like ~334, or something very similar to that for r14.
---
Arms is super bursty, i have earthshaker and a plate threat set and you easily pull 500dps with:
---
Serker rage, charge, bloodrage, sweeping strikes, whirlwind then whirlwind/cleave/ms until everything is dead.
---
 Its extremely strong on packs of 3-5 in dungeons as a tank. Makes it almost braindead and most players will think you're better than you are
---
Quartz for a decent castbar, look into MoveAnything.
---
Hard to give other advice based on your post.
---
Yes it’s a minor oversight for honor grinders who thought they will need to grind honor in the night in wsg because it gives more than world pvp before honor calculation. Some people even said they postponed raiding or take out holiday from work.
---
It's really not that hard, just don't engage in such a way that relies on stuns. If you're really that worried then chug a free action potion.
---
Probably. The auction house has been missing two of the auctioneers for several days now.

Oh wow you are so cool and edgy.

Yes please! Come join us!

Or its an old screenshot.

I dont recall the timer but they will depawn after being opened. Might be 5mins?

Ok zoomer
---
Sharding/layering is wonderful. Classic Zealots who despise it can lick my chode.
---
We’re here for content, not for some masochistic painfest. If that’s what you want, go play EverQuest, assholes.
---
A lot of guilds would take a pre-bis/near-bis Ret Paladin as they can pull decent DPS in the right hands.
---
Are you putting in the appropriate amount of effort required to raid competitively as a [insert literally any class/spec here] or are you just another freshly dinged 60 with 2-3 items that are somewhere between quest reward and pre-bis?
---
The vast majority of Rets fall into a very predictable category.
---
&gt; Sure, maybe it took us an extra 15 seconds to defeat Rag, but who gives a shit about a few seconds here and there?
---
Is that your elevator pitch? That doesn't sound like the attitude of a baller Ret who comes to fuck up some bosses on raid night.
---
People were allowed to leave Flamelash because of queues (Though i only been in one once), and people left because that window was closing. After months. Coordinated, not sporadically.
---
Your source is a blury screenshot of a discord post you can’t even read? Lmfao. Give me a source please.
---
I'm a rogue too, our guild has had like 4-5 Vis'kags and a few brutality blades, but no perditions and 1 core hound tooth. We have 3 dagger rogues out of 6 which is pretty high compared to other guilds I think, fucking sucks.
---
STILL not as bad as Stalagg.
---
Wtf I dont want to play with russians. Or any other non english server.
---
When does this happen lol?
---
cvp, comsumables vs player
---
&gt; True, but that shouldn't mean we should intentionally make the game worse because "hurr durr qol"
---
Good thing it would only make it better then.
---
&gt; Literally all of that is true.
---
Nope.
---
Smells like honor trading to me.
---
Why should guilds invest in a class who needs the same gear as a class that does tripple the damage.
---
25% Alliance, 75% Horde.
---
You can have 3 items drop at once? :o
---
Yeh so what you are saying is ‘don’t try and kill an orc rogue or warrior’.
---
That is the point, so realms will balance itself.
---
It’s like wheres Waldo
---
They are gonna make so much money
---
I'm glad for it. Not a large Horde pop on my server so it'll be nice seeing other Hordies now.
---
Ground travel isn't that much different though.  I just auto run in as clean a path as I can and then minimize my screen
---
Random shit is random....
---
This is a huge help! Thank you
---
Fucked up spectacularly or acted exactly like every Horde player I’ve ever met from a PvP realm?
---
There’s a reason a whole lot of us play PvE realms, boys.
---
You won't lose all that. What you lose is 5% dagger crit, weapon expertise and AR. This is because seal gate build you go SF/Combat with the last point being blade flurry
---
I’d only I could carry that many quints and not have to run my ass to Hyderaxis every week
---
It bothers me that they aren’t all stacks of 5
---
This is a huge help. Thank you!
---
The fuck is DME? Acronyms are shit.
---
&gt;kill one or two 
---
Yeah... about that I'd like to see anyone do that with a double rogue gank squad
---
Quality shitpost.
---
That said, doubt they will crack down. That's 15 bucks per month per account they are losing :p
---
Ok boomer
---
First one I've seen actually worse than Stalagg, but not even because of the balance, the 300 players at 60 is gross.
---
dude, its not only disc/holy priest! beeing a fury war in leather and mail armor sucks too for pvp. So what if i have epic DW weapons if i cant swing them from more than 1-3 seconds... I die so fast to anything that touches me... and the respec costs of 50g, im feeling poor from just thinking bout it now  
---
I feel you :D
---
Can't someone donate runecloth so he can buy a wolf?
---
people doint really care. They murder anything all the time.  I keep getting killed by 60s as a lvl 29 in 1000k needles.
---
You wanted to get an epic video, you ended up with a even more epic one!
---
You just have to stop attack and let it cool down.  If slam connects it will auto start the attack and use the auto ready attack.  You can simplify the back to just stop attack and slam, and have your start attack on other abilities, in case slam doesn't connect or you have to move/cancel it.  It works similar to how reckoning works, with turning off the attack, as slam is treated as an "extra attack" rather than an instant.
---
As a besr tank xou can swap to cat and do power shiftings and style on her an use 5 combo ginishers to generate a good amount of threat
---
But wouldn’t you run past a lot of guards to get to that central area?
---
Unlikely
---
What is wrong with Sages guide? I ooey followed it and had no problems. Use guidelime if you dont have it for ingame addon.

-excerpt from my World of Worldcraft battle chest guide back in 2008 or so

Also, I tried to translate it as good as possible since I'm german and so is the guide😅
---
It was an imbalanced shit show for many people back then and it's an imbalanced shit show for many people now. Many people are also fine with it.
---
It would be closer to no changes than everything changed...
---
Nice story lol
---
I bet he tried to get authenticity to the movie, like an 80s vibe or some shit. :)
---
You enjoy ret paladins and don't care about others opinions.
---
Raid leaders enjoy not wasting raid spots and don't care about yours.
---
cant get corpsecamped when u corpsecamp urself
---
Damn I love how druids and paladins brag about generating most threat easy boss of p1, forgetting that later down the expansion only warriors would be able to survive pressure that bosses would do.
---
Horde need to man up or gtfo
---
Crop your picture
---
haha nice
---
You can do it.
---
Just when I thought all the retailers were gone...
---
Source?
---
Ofc they would not, levels don\`t matter. On the other hand, the alliance ran as soon as he dinged, scared shitless
---
This is probably gonna be an unpopular opinion... but I really dislike everything about potions in classic wow.
---
Health and mana are fine, but lips and faps are insane. I can kind of get behind something like engineering adding a higher ceiling to the skill of classic pvp at the cost of massive cooldowns, and risk of backfire, but potions like the ones mentioned above seem too good.
---
Also, how do you decide when to use them? Only when your premade runs into another premade? Is there really any point to spending a ton of gold on those potions if you’re not going for max rank with a full premade?
---
You act as if the majority faction will suffer. With BGs coming out they won't have any loss at all.
---
Actual crit cap is 55.
---
ready enough, i feel you
---
Lmao!!!
---
No, you dont get any exo in battlegrounds. In addition to that, faction balance of your server wont determine your queue time, since battelgrounds will be cross realm.
---
Funfact: These Golems have killed to most players out of all NPCs in this game.
---
Patch notes say they implemented the framework for a future update.
---
i don't think replacing one mage with one ret pala will make a fight 15 second longer
---
Why do you plan to go deep prot?
---
theres other ways besides stun lock to get a kill
---
Its in EU
---
I could have sworn hunter was 1st when i checked from work. But yeah, u are right. They are 2nd after rogue.  
---
So first rogue, then hunter, then warrior get the neck? Or does that argument only works when its huntets getting shafted for loot?
---
IIRC Kael'thas explicitly explains the renaming during the Night Elf campaign when Maiev, Tyrande and Malfurion arrive in Silverpine.
---
&gt; A fury warrior who can go use it for tanking when needed.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It’s a threat weapon, investing thousands of gold just to give it to a rogue is insanity.
---
I'd disagree even giving it to a warrior tank in the first place. A warrior tank in a good guild is in heaven with threat output, it's simply overkill. I'd allow anyone to roll on it. Personally, I'd give it to a rogue tank since it enables them to literally enter AQ and keep up with the threat from dps. But if you're in a casual guild (VERY casual guild), by all means it should go to the main warrior tank.
---
6-8 healers with 1.5-2s target casts can top off any 40ppl raid really fast. You need Shamans only if your Raid constantly standing in fire.
---
Gosh, that would be nice!
---
I never saw a single person go 'apeshit'?  I saw people killing the opposite faction for honour.   Due to the faction imbalance this meant one side was killed far more than others as there was/is always a fresh horde player/group arriving at the fight that had no DR on kills yet.  So Ali end up in a constant fight of ever changing horde.  That's on blizz not the player base- after all how can someone know if you've been camped for 3 hours already or not at all if they come across a red player?  
---
I'm also not sure a lot of the players were aware of the issue until it was too late.  As a horde on flamelash there  were Ali roaming EPL constantly in large grps, and rogs farming kills at kargath over 15 hours a day until a few days before the exodus.  It was clear horde was the server majority, but there was push back and in some places a lot of it.  Unless you were one of these hardcore Ali PvP players though I would imagine this was easily missed as an Ali player. 
---
Ultimately for me it's on blizz for their hands off approach and lack of foresight.  Too few servers, too high pops and heavy faction imbalances were bound to be problematic.  There was a fair bit of talk from people in my horde chars guild about wishing they had rolled Ali after P2 hype died and they realised how few Ali players there were.  Rly wish blizz had offered faction transfers instead of server moves.  That just focused the issue and spread it to other servers too.
---
Fanx man
---
Afaik jt will be Na, eu, etc regardless of tie zone or type of realm
---
CP Bear tanks are good and paladins wouldn’t be able to pull threat off of them in any realistic raid scenario, but the edge Paladins have in that fight is their ability to control their threat toward Onyxia from the ground. She’ll come to me when she lands. I don’t need to grab her.
---
1.000.000 needles? Wow, never been there!
---
Part of why I love it!
---
&gt; Anyone who is not a warrior is a fucking joke meme and your guild probably sucks if it didnt give its first 5 warrior tanks and DPS bindings.
---
funnily the opposite, if you need the threat from tfury there are massive problems with the guild. And the guild is most likely casual and not taking the content seriously.
---
yeah, you can merge the 2 super alliance-favored server with 2 super horde-favored server.
---
Then what will you do with the 8 super horde-favored server left ?
---
bacause thats what the bluepost says:
---
&gt;  « Battlegrounds are cross-realm, which means you’ll fight alongside  allies and against opponents from all of the realms **in your region.** » 
---
and the languages i mentiond are all its own regions
---
Twisting Nether was a medium popped horde dominant server, didn't see many people out in the world there. I played in it as alliance and pretty much never got ganked. So you comparing this to Twisting Nether baffles me tbh.
---
Doesn’t AV have a 50-59 and a 60 bracket?
---
Yeah visual bugs are old but gold. I mean who doesn't wanna see someone running on his mount in stealth or backwards/sideways indeed !
---
Legit question. What skill gap is there in playing a ret paladin? What does one need to do to play a ret paladin well vs one that plays a ret paladin badly.
---
Horde did 9/11
---
400 is compeltely fine. 400dps is even enough to kill Patchwerk before enrage, why is it suddenly not fine anymore, when everybody deals more dmg and dps is compeltely irrelevant in all fights, because it's so high anyway?
---
If you had brought 400dps in 2005 you would have been #1 dps in most raids and you can beat every single encounter in vanilla with the dps players averaging 400 dps.
---
If you're really desperate get 15 kills on your lvl 19 Alts, pump up the brackets.
---
Dual spec would make me actually start to dislike classic
---
Wouldn't addons using user-visible channels like yell or guild cause spam?
---
We gave it to a warrior who quit the week after he got it due to irl stuff...
---
So, horde on heartseeker fights back despite the "megaservers how could blizzard even do this" © and "drastic server imbalance how could blizzard even do this"© also? Okay.
---
Feed the hamsters powering the servers
---
hmm how can this work? connection from NA to EU can be difficult.
---
Hes the same rogue who was in the background when &lt;leftovers&gt; had a little bonfire, right?

&gt; Rogues. A good fury warrior is already pretty close to threat cap, the proc will easily push them over the edge. That said, I'd still give it to a fury warrior as they can OT with it effectively.
---
THIS, YES! so many people don't realise how much threat a good fury tank can deal. Having tfury is most of the time a huge noob/casual red flag. Tfury would funnily enough be VERY good on a rogue tank, enabling them to tank AQ reliably.
---
if i connect to EU from NA-WC, my ping is 200ish
---
lmao, imagine if every time you went to Orgrimmar you had to endure being killed over and over again for 5 minutes without fighting back so you could unflag JUST TO DO SHIT IN ORGRIMMAR WITHOUT BEING KILLED. Give me a break man, this shit's out of hand on imbalanced servers.
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
But there have to be at least some Elves that did not turn belves, such as those in Dalaran.
---
 What about the third Windrunner and her regiment?

I don't really remember, it's been so long.

How is destruction warlock performing currently in PvE content?
---
You did not mention spainish but that is a region as well. That one realm has medium population also that realm has like 25% alliance. So where they join? English realm? Why not german or french of russian? 
---
I believe wsg and ab will be your language only, except for spanish maybe. But 40v40 will be mixed. Maybe not in the first month, but after 6 months certainly.
---
... dire maul east?
---
Problem is abit more complex. Sure 1/40 in pvp spec is not an issue for killtimers, but Once you open up for that one guy half the raid or more might follow and suddenly your raid takes twice as long
---
Threatplates has an option for this as well.
---
So wrong, so so sooo wrong.
---
War Effort =/= scarab lord
---
The title/mount is the questline. Theres a 10 or 12 hour window that others can finish it after the first person bangs the gong.
---
He's clueless, spewing random tech shit thinking he's being smart. There is no "memory dump, cpu mumbo jumbo", the reason it lags is because of the server tech they use in the new version of classic WoW, each zone is on its one shard/layer, when you switch zones you have to load into that new layer.
---
What about when you are MCd instead of sheepd?
---
Migrated to ESO. Have no regrets.
---
If he's the only one farming herbs he gets all the Goldthorn and Khadgars Whisker too yknow
---
after the server maintenance. the battlemasters are already in the cities.
---
I think there could be if you play the swings. Basic supply and demand states that if you can a huge increase in supply with the same demand the price will go down. So possibly buying these essences when they are cheap because everyone is farming them for a week Ns waiting until the price returns to higher value.
---
For example, essence of air sell for 15g on my server during the air elemental week the prices could possibly see 4-7g per essence. Buying them and waiting 2-3 weeks and selling them for 100% profit.
---
So your entire argument relies on something being less likely?
---
Just say "I play Horde" so I know you're braindead and can avoid the conversation.
---
The proper term in this case is santorum.
---
cataclysm made the game completely unplayable and it only got worse (I tried every addon at least one patch)
---
classic could've been so nice if blizzard wheren't blizzard but now we get cramped up megaservers with 90:10 ratio and a handfull of changes no one asked for and they don't tell you about
---
Yall deserve it after the shit most of us HS ppl went through on Stalagg
---
I don't see why they didn't simply enable faction queues and free faction transfers to the same server.
---
sixtyupgrades is a great site to usecan build sets and see the stat difference
---
This specific guy has a horde character and an alliance character that he attempts to "trash talk" on. He sends these sorts of messages to anybody who kills him. And he doesn't shut the fuck up.
---
I can’t believe those evil horde players would attack you while innocently walking and minding your own business!  We noble and brave alliance folks would never do that!
---
Unless more people enter the pool and form premades and those premades are more efficient and gain more honor. It’s one thing to be a medium sized fish in a small pond of players farming world PvP kills for minuscule essentially guaranteed ranks. It’s another thing when all the people who held out for bg’s hop in the mix. 
---
I have no doubt some lower pop server people will probably have no issue assuming they got the 16-24 hours a day to grind. But higher pop server people that think they’re basically all but guaranteed simply because they have time and put in the time prior to bg release are in for a very rude awakening.
---
&gt; Survival is the best tree for PvP so it gets a pass. Ret is actually passable in PvE and PvP when played well too.
---
&gt; Deep Enhancement and any build with Moonkin Form are just sub-par in every aspect of the game. Raiding, PvP, PvE, soloing... there is always a better option.
---
Survival, melee survival in pve to be specific is calculated on pservers to be the highest dps achievable by a hunter. Also, when you say sub-par you have to say the amount of general dps most people think it's 300dps when it's actually 50-75dps.
---
Opposite
---
lvling a mage
---
Kinda sucks, eh?
---
Me and my friend still can't quest on HS without getting camped for hours in WPLS and we only get to play a couple of days a week
---
a lot of horde players on my server keep telling me they're gone as soon as paid trans comes - atm we can hold it against the alliance (70:30 ratio) and the horde is close to contesting world bosses
---
if paid trans comes soon, we will be flamelash reloaded
---
As a warlock your damage outside of a few measly dots is useless if you’re dead and trust me - people want you dead. So in PvP and in BGs stamina is probably the most important thing. Rogues and warriors will pick you out of the crowd regularly.
---
These posts are gold!
---
Leveling is a big part of vanilla to me. I enjoy it
---
as long as you have cooking and first aid, u can do whatever you want as warrior, it will be slow anyways
---
&gt; Is it even a thing? There's like 1 talent in survival that does anything for Melee dps. How do you even spec for melee?
---
After searching on [google](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1542) I found this hope it helps.
---
Ive had more fun in classic since Legion. Pros are that classic is more social engaged but its a little to slow gameplay. Somewere between classic and retail is perfect, retail is too much happening and classic may be to slow, also lack of end-game things to do in classic.
---
Just wipe your raid as soon as possible to clear their world buffs, ez.
---
I enjoy both equally
---
But the necklace doesn't count as a key to the keyring, so they will still forget it.
---
His eyes, Blizzard! The goggles do nothing
---
This has been established for nearly 15 years dude, look up the maths yourself if you're so keen to disagree with everyone who tries to help you.
---
Actually you had quite a few 60 ally rogues sniping healers and ranged so that's BS. I was there. Still, I killed you 3 times. For the horde!
---
Be a Paladin, go to LoH someone. Doesn't heal them, they die, LoH goes on hour cooldown, you're now out of mana. This shit never happened back in Vanilla, nice change blizzard.
---
This copypasta is older than OP.
---
Yeah 6 months ago
---
20 min isn't enough to go from a capital to a "griefing" activity while you tag. Remember you can't tag across the World
---
Yeah, Blizz communication terrible as usual.
---
First they confirm the 10th on the EU twitter, then on the evening of the 9th, they suddenly announce a patch.
---
So far, retail. There’s so little to do in classic. Perhaps BGs will be the thing we need
---
&gt; Why does the ultimate meme spec get no love, full melee survival hunter?
---
it's not meme i linked an interesting article under miedek's comment. that is worth a look at.
---
So you mostly never leave horde alone
---
you are assuming all pve server players are interested in BGs. They might run a few just to see what its like, then go back to their PVE content. Most won't even care about BGs, especially when they are not familiar with pvp and get stomped.
---
Not exactly accurate, at least if you count original Vanilla as well as Classic (and probably Classic alone too, though I don't have stats on that). While they are in the top 20 or so, which is impressive enough, there are plenty with higher kill counts, and even more will come with the release of Alterac Valley, notably the Horde generals and warmasters.
---
Haha, points for the analogy!
---
Can you turn in runecloth at level 40?  That is a loophole I wonder how he would react to.
---
My point still stands even if I misinterpreted the title. for every alliance dominated server there's ten more horde dominated server's and that's just a fact.
---
Fun fact : sudoku has got nothing to do with maths
---
Use B-tag next time, works for opposite faction.
---
Goldthorns are pretty decent tho
---
Theres not a single "random blue" there
---
Crit cap goes up with hit.
---
They don't. Because fauck-all that's why. You'd think this shit was the first thing they implemented in 2019, so many years later. But nooooo.   
---
Release phase 2 with no Bgs on servers with bad horde:alliance ratio. Blizztard annalists jerking the cables, "dooooh what can happen" dooooooh, drooling all the way to the bank.
---
Yes because I think game devs were told by executives and lead game designer to move the game into a 'single player experience' and it's not because they were thinking they were recreating Vanilla philosophy and failed.
---
I feel saying everybody are total morons is like stating that everybody who worked on the latest Star Wars trilogy are stupid without understanding that the problem comes from above when Disney decided to write the story on the fly instead of asking someone to write a cohesive storyline for the trilogy.

Your gatekeeping is off the charts mate. Guess you don't feel like a real man unless you're corpsed at least 4 times before you make it to BRD. Or let me guess, you're probably Horde right?
---
I joined this guild on a RP server shortly after I rerolled from a PVP server. I was pushing 40 and only had 60g. I had just joined the guild and the leader asked me what would it take for me to join the guild? ( Which I didn't really get because I had already joined.) So I jokingly said 40g for my mount :P. 
---
Sure enough that person logs out, gets on their main and mails me 40g. And he gifted me and another new member 2 lvl 39 epic items, me a nightblade as a warrior, and he gave the priest a purple robe. 
---
I was astounded. I legit was joking, but they hooked us up pretty well.  So I've been recruiting people to the guild as it is smaller, and I met this lvl 10 paladin who is new to wow. I showed her around and gave her some gold and invited her and her friend to the guild. 
---
I don't have much gold atm to give forward. But I can offer my tanking services to the guild :D there are alot of good people in this game.
---
Was looking forward to BGs after work today. But, ok, guess I still have some prep work.
---
It costs the reagent but you can spam the spell and get full threat even from toons that already have the buff. So when the adds drop the pally starts casting it on the seven hunters and supposedly your dps can can start AoEing right then. The mobs are latched to the paladin. I've never done it but the news was spreading just when Classic launched and I remember at one point Blizz confirmed this was working as intended.
---
Well I have a lot more than that for free time, but I spend it with my wife too. On wow lately.
---
Agreed, Shaz Alliance are powerful as fuck. Great competition!
---
&gt; You're drawing a considerable amount of conclusions
---
None greater than the claim that all those servers are empty now.
---
Except when you realise most 60s out there farming for honour are usually hella raid geared.
---
You sap and CS&gt;turn away and pray to god sap doesnt heartbeat break early before you can restealth if the stun fails. 
---
If its a war you either use the above trick ( depending on stance ) or  open with garrote and pray you get a crippling in the next 2 attacks or you just outright lose.
---
Dont bother with orc hunters and locks.
---
Here I think "not this meme again" and it actually turns out to be decent!
---
do you even realize this is like what we have in retail and it's exactly one of the things we DON'T want in classic?
---
"Always."
---
Considering how battlegroups weren't a thing till vanilla, that's not remotely true.
---
Mistakes? I didn't do this to stalagg. The other alliance leaving (caused by the behavior of the horde on stalagg) did this to me. I didn't choose an unbalanced server (not that we even HAD population statistics back then because the game wasn't out) it became unbalanced around me.
---
Why do you repost this shit? Your advice is essentially "reset your progress in the open world and go back where you started", you might as well never leave your inn lol.
---
Camping horde rogues
---
One Ring to rule them all....
---
But again it's not a question of replicating the game or starting from scratch but just make some balance tweaks.
---
Take for example Molten Core: the devs said it was rushed in one week and the boss are simplistic in term of design, you won't tell me that if you take a team of game designer who love Vanilla, that they can't recreate something in the same line.
---
Like you can't tell me that taking some ideas from TBC for class design and putting them in Classic would be that hard
---
I aggree lot of ppl Do , But They streamer , Just dont do it. Or get Twitch ban And WOW ban at least. #Duel for honor.  
---
Ridiculous your think view.   
---
Its EXACTLY like in real life : lot of ppl kill , and they always was... 
---
That not mean its allowed, And especialy when ppl are seen doing it.
---
it should be around 900 tps with 11 of the same class iirc
---
it can not. I was just saying I'll have it on me at all times.
---
Uh, yes? I don't recall mentioning AV anywhere in my short one-line comment, but thanks for pointing out the obvious. We're obviously not talking about AV here, we're talking about grinding to rank 11, which will be done predominantly in WSG rather than AV, because as you so eloquently pointed out, you can't enter AV as a group (and before the next smartass comment: you can fish AV but it's gonna be harder now with cross realm). 
---
You couldn't just not be a smartass and try to correct something that needed no correction.
---
good luck wearing those bloodfang pants :D HAHAHA
---
Damn... That sucks...
---
Uh what? They did come up with a solution? It's called cross realm and it's been in retail for years.
---
2 eyes in 10 kills, but no bindings. One Spinal Reaper, one Choker. I'd trade those eyes for bindings any time
---
Just replacee leather with plate, you will be fine to tank the adds.
---
Your name must be Agmond, because you just reached Agmond's End.
---
Incendius has Auctioneers everywhere! Now you don’t have to leave your mount to buy stuff.
---
The servers (at least pvp ones) will be more and more one-sided.
---
If you are not familiar with blizzard linguo different regions are Oceanic, kr, Cn, eu, na.
---
It might be hard to imagine but for low level people there are more then one zone to level in. While hillsbread might be full of rogues you can go to the barrens to level.
---
If they don't put some restrictions classic is gonna end up like retail with every server being either 90% alliance or 90% horde. There should have been restrictions already from the start to prevent this. I see why they didn't since it could hinder people to play with their guild or friends but now we have this mess instead.
---
MAY, they also said it wasn't going to happen
---
Faction queues;
---
You're the dominant faction, good luck being able to reliably log in on raid night because you're stuck in an infinite queue.
---
Limit character creation;  
---
Good luck playing with your friends because you joined late and they play horde but the server is a horde majority, just wait and hope it balances out or force them all to reroll.
---
How would this even work if paid char transfers become a thing anyway? Half your guild moves, changing the balance, leaving the other half now stranded because you were enough to tip it into the locked state for your faction.
---
Merging;
---
There's still like 30%+ more horde players on PvP realms than alliance, no matter how you merge them they will remain unbalanced, or you'll wind up making a few that are just deeply unbalanced as per now to balance out the rest.
---
The issue isn't simple when they have to stick to \#nochanges and these aren't actual solutions.
---
Duskwood graveyard area, mostly mid 20's players.
---
You need a total pool size (# of players that have at least 15 hk's on your faction) of 334 for the first bracket 1 slot to open up.  If less than 334 players are in your pool, it is impossible to get rank 14.  You need either 3 or 4 weeks of bracket 1 from reaching rank 13 to actually hit 14, and bracket 2 will derank you.
---
I know thats why I said they should've done it before it got this bad, to try to decrease the faction inbalance
---
You can get a rank3 to buy you a discounted mount then pay them back since the mounts are tradeable until used. Of course this requires trust
---
I'm pretty sure it's comparable to dw fury. 2100 arp is no joke
---
Is this called trolling? 
---
I can never tell.
---
As an Australian we never got better than about 180 ping the whole of vanilla
---
Will always be some stupid people. If tanks are so scarce for your particular run/reserves that you have to whisper random people, then you probably need to change the run or the reserved items. People will learn eventually. 
---
It's kind of a marketplace where tanks and healers typically are in demand and have the leverage.
---
If I have a hard time getting a healer for arena/anger then I toss in golem aswell and many people are happy to join for second wind. If a dps reserves a bunch of items you want, just don't go along. You are in demand, he is replaceable.
---
If you intend to need on dps items when tanking, just say so before the run and they can decide if they want to come along or not.
---
Mate we re 5 dagger rogues and 1 sword rogue. We all have both MC daggers except for 1 who only has CHT but the sword rogue is literally 6/8 T1 2/8 T2 and acuria/ony neck but has dal rends still xD
---
Wie ist aktuell das Verhältnis bzw. wieviele seids auf dem Server?
---
Outgear/out-RNG. Or use gadgets creatively. Or ofcourse just use tea x)
---
That's not correct. For gamers in the UK, that means WoW Classic will become unplayable from 3pm until 11pm, GMT. It’s a long wait, but it should end with the release of the new WoW Classic Battlegrounds. CEST 4pm until 12 pm.

It's pretty much common sense that anything that gives you ingame resources without actually playing is probably not allowed

But some people just have to be pedantic

Did you edit this ?

First of all why are you in this fb grp in the first place? What did you expect?!

---
What is the point of being that rude and spiteful? What are you trying to achieve? You won't be in classic forever and bears always had utility issues. There's a reason why dwarf priests were the go to.
---
Didn’t know that, thanks :) 
---
Getting downvoted for a simple question. Reddit is heaven.
---
&gt; How would dual spec make the game better?
---
More tanks, more healers, more people who can spec for their raid while also messing about with other specs for farming or PvP, essentially just giving the community more tools all at once?
---
And lets compare that to... hrm "but but character cheapening!".
---
&gt; You clearly weren't around when they were added then.
---
Sure was. Flying mounts were immediately critisised for killing off world PvP and in the world interaction. Cross realm was critisised for hurting server communities, dungeon finder was critisised for the mass of toxic behavior it brought and further damaging server community. 
---
You have no argument here other than "but but but no changes!" and that doesn't hold up sorry. The worst thing about classic is the idiotic "no changes" crowd.
---
The trick is to use a toothbrush and make small circles
---
Prick
---
Server-locked BGs would result in terrible queues for alliance and horde both.
---
Do I keep my thrash blade with no enchants on it or can I put something like fiery on it or something else for more dps?
---
Exactly.
---
Out of curiosity, how do you feel the effects of being a minority on a pve server?
---
When ya dig your own grave
---
At early levels, dps get away with having aggro - mobs don't deal much damage and healers are thus more potent as well. Later on, they get aggro, they die - so they will have to let you get aggro

---
So, how long does it take to grind AV to the epic off-hand?
---
What a fucking lame comparison. People make mistakes all the fucking time. 
---
If you take a holiday from work just so you can grind BG's on release, tough luck when it gets delayed. Cant really blame Blizzard for changing their decision, that happens all the time. The fact that you made plans means nothing
---
haha spot on.
---
I quit when cata came out. Havent played retail since. 
---
resubbed for Classic, and I'm working on my 3rd alt already. Main is a resto shammy I raid with, and I have a druid tank for 5-10 mans, which I enjoy playing too. Working on their gear is great fun, and knowing an expansion is not due (if at all), for a good few years, means I can take my time. 
---
Loving being back playing classic.
---
Retail has changed so much I don't even know how to play it.
---
Bro are you having a stroke?
---
I wouldn't phrase it as 'the beginning of the end' but I would also prefer realms only fighting their own players in the battlegrounds. Especially with the increase in population, wait times shouldn't be an issue.
---
This was changed in wrath I believe, and also affected node spawns like ore.  Most likely it's carried over from the legion client, they probably didn't bother with actively taking that mechanic away since its not really a negative mechanic in any way
---
Exactly this. BG que times were the only benefit alliance is getting and is now denied. To make it even worse - you will get matched with some pve keyboard turners to make sure you are getting stomped in av as well.
---
I reactivated my account for the stress tests and retail is unrecognizable. Haven’t played since car and it was cool to look at my old characters and gear but the rest of the game looks completely different even my gear is alien although it has the same names
---
I’m not getting how Horde have it worse than Alliance in this scenario. Horde can still quest and get world buffs, gather for raids without being camped and murdered all day. They’re missing out on world PVP with the migrations, but how they could even call what they had world PVP is a joke. The game isn’t destroyed for them, it was for Alliance. Migration was the short term answer, simple as that.
---
Except classic launch. And dire maul.
---
He meant huge like in the sense that it’s a BiS item and a huge upgrade.
---
HAHA GET REKT I DID THE SAME AND I THOUGHT ONLY I WAS THIS STUPID
---
Nah fam, cracked fraps, Drowning Pool and Breaking Benjamin courtesy of Limewire. For authenticity's sake.
---
If they want to leave let them leave nobody has an obligation to stay if they're not enjoying themselves and this is better than everyone quitting
---
Is the layout on the AH display ElvUi? Looks very smooth and nice
---
You can get that ram from AV aswell!
---
Nobody rolls a rogue on a PVP server for fair fights, alliance or horde.
---
We won't know for sure. I'm assuming you need to be at a battlemaster to queue up, and as long as the queues are kept under 5-10 minutes for the horde it would be impossible for them to honor kill in the world while doing BGs
---
That's working out great on retail where the exact same problem exists.
---
"Final" you will tweak. Don't worry! 😉
---
Just curious, do you have any actual ret numbers from endgame content?
---
Are you seriously complaining about joining a gold bid run then getting upset that the prices are not to your liking? Because that is friggin stupid.
---
Not much left to theorycraft in a 15 year old game.
---
I would like this because I would level alts on a pve server and then migrate to my main pvp server when they're 60 :P
---
I thought this post was Pro elementals. 
---
For too long have they been farmed for essence.
---
Like going from diablo 2 to 3
---
Maybe he went to get fresh baked bread
---
They could summon him to the top.
---
as I see it - yes the cross realm function is not really the most useful for smaller regions. 
---
BUT you can get to know active PVP'ers if you are one. If there is only 2-3 Servers in your Region it is almost like back then without cross realm.
---
You know who you are playing against :P
---
But anyway - I am in a large Region so why would I care
---
What's your dps like? Honest numbers, good fights, bad fights
---
Except if you want to respec regularly the ramp up means you need to go out and farm hundreds of gold per week just to do it. It also *completely* removes the option for more casual players who want to do some PvP or something on the weekend and raid a night or two per week.
---
Here's a crazy idea.. just add another gold sink that doesn't punish average players because of those who can farm for hours per week.
---
we don't do that here
---
If you didn’t scepter in, you can log out for 10 minutes and you will be at the entrance.
---
Sometimes I marvel how far we've come after chewbacca said: "hey Pepe I heard you pull yer pants down all the way to go pee" to a frog in a comic.
---
Give me one reason to not faction transfer horde as alliance players when there are cross real bgs full of keyboard turners from pvp realms?
---
Nerfs are irrelevant to the method. Ppl will not even want to kill the boss before towers are capped anyway because that would be lost honor.
---
pvp is the one thing paladins are good at lul
---
There are secrets not everyone is aware of introduced with spell batching etc

---
Thanks for the reply. Why is mace viable for paladin? And the damage proc is viable for any class that uses it?
---
Krogue-Faerlina alliance rogue, is a literal loser, watch out from that creepy fuck
---
Might as well, it will last you until 60 easily and gold is easy to come by after 40.
---
Cross server

Is people just pulling these 40-man raiding squads out of their asses? I get corpse camped relentlessly out in the world from time to time, but its always to 3-5 people squads. I've gotten rolled by a raid from time to time, but thats mostly when they either do the quest in EPL, or when they are on their way to a raid.
---
People do not group up in groups of 40 and head out to "farm" honor by killing stragglers, thats just a myth.
---
Gambling
---
Well, just bind a s d to something more useful instead - backpedaling with s is always a bad idea, except maybe if you are creeping down a mountain.
---
Using q e r t f g x 1-6 (nearly all with shift / Ctrl / alt modifiers) 9x numkeys on my mouse, some with shift modifiers. 
---
Can recommend the Bartender4 add-on for action bars for easy key binding, bar resizing/moving. 
---
Just make sure to have your most bread and butter skills close to your movement keys and work it into your muscle memory. After using most of the binds for 30+ levels you will get used to them - I've pulled the Alpha to 0 on all my bars to hide them and get better visibility.

Report them for language and it blocks them.
---
I still don’t get it. Would the information you receive be different if it were from a screenshot?
---
This seems perfectly normal to me. Just park your level 60 main in the area you are questing in. Low level gankers usually stop after you gank them back twice. They too want to level instead of corpse running.
---
Ashenvale and Hillsbrad Foothills?

This is like the "my family is dying"-meme :P
---
he even put flask in the middle of the list so we wouldn't notice ahahahahahaha
---
It didn't say that actually, I somehow in my sleepdeprived and caffeine less state typed vanilla instead of naxx. So it said "never was a thing till vanilla". 
---
The entire point is that the OP claiming it was always a thing is pulling it entirely out of his arse.
---
dude, MC was cleared in less than a week. you don't need your little PvE spec. Or is it the DPS meter which you feel you *need* to top?
---
Oh dear lord that is one of the most entitled responses I've ever seen. Everything you just said can be boiled down to "it doesn't bother me so it shouldn't be changed, quit if you don't like it".
---
You have fun mate, we're done talking. Just... god damn. That's sad.
---
There were queues already moron.
---
Useless for rogues
---
I can't really go back to retail now. Progress feels much more meaningful on classic, knowing that there won't be some expansion that invalidates all my progress, knowing that after I get my bis it's really bis. Actually needing a guild and the social interaction that comes with it to beat the raid content is nice. There's a lot of variety, some of my pre-bis I crafted, some stuff dropped, some stuff is from a quest even.
---
Retail has all this stuff I don't want to do, like island expeditions and warfronts. None of my gear is really that significant ever, nothing feels worth doing.
---
But perhaps worst of all, yesterday I actually logged in and made a char on retail just to try it again. Everywhere you look people are on the most rediculous, immersion-breakjng mounts, especially those heirloom mounts. The content is trivial all the way from level 1 until heroic raids; not my cup of tea.
---
that's what we did almost every single evening. keep in mind our point of view is limited. you needed to be on the right server, the right faction, in the right guild and also being online at the right time at the right place. furthermore it's about 15 years ago.
---
The “ride or die” mentality of these pvp communities so fucking weird m/disturbing to me
---
No, its scummy that they take advantage over the fact that not all guilds have a working roster yet, so a lot of people have to relay on other guilds PUG'ing. Since Karma has got the most members, they act like they can do what they want.  
---
Its not so bad anymore since now everyone pretty much have this on farm, but for the people who missed it with the guild and stuff like that.   
---
You could just not join them, but then you miss out on trying to get any gear. Karma has got enough members to have two raid groups (one of them that this person is in).  
---
"entitled as hell" is not the words I'd use. But hey, your opinion
---
I think the issue is that the rest of the guild don't want to carry someone who's doing tank level DPS while a holy paladin is one of the best healers in game. 
---
However, you should approach your guild and tell them about nightfall (phase 3 item).  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall) 
---
While you can have warriors swinging them, having someone dedicated on the task will be very helpful and could be a good reason to actually bring a ret paladin to BWL (along with extra auras and blessings).
---
What is your /played and what level are you?
---
LOTS
---
They wouldn't be valuable if they could be easily farmed. SFK is the easiest to farm and has a good variety of twink items. You could also try Uldaman but droprates on good stuff are lower afaik and demand on those items is lower (prices are still good but can take a while to sell).
---
Its using guild, not private channels. So no
---
Warrior Fight Club discord has been very useful.
---
It's filled with elitist pricks though, so beware.
---
Don't you dare asking a newb question. Read the FAQ before.
---
BUT you can talk about wiping in freaking Onyxia. Apparently that's OK for some reason.
---
I can't even timezone.

---
I hope character transfer will be 60 euro or more.
---
As a healer in MC I feel like I could afk half the raid and we’d be fine. 25 mans the healers feel a lot more useful
---
Lol fuck off you condescending asshole. bye bye! /wave
---
5 man tank gods my ass, druids are far better, they aint bad but i'd still say a cleaving 2h warrior &gt; paladin
---
Previously pwndepot before that!
---
Yup.
---
It actually annoys me more that we got it halfway than it does that it's inaccurate.
---
Personally I would've been satisfied with just having official servers for 1.12.1 with everything available immediately.
---
I would have also enjoyed a faithful recreation of the patchcycle, but I figure it'd probably take longer to recreate it (if they even have backups or documentation of each patch to begin with) than it took them to originally make it from scratch.
---
It's like, what we have is already enough to trivialize MC so it kinda defeats the point of locking so many of the later items until later on *especially* since so many of those drops were on-par with what we currently have and primarily existed to round out loot tables for each dungeon (like making UBRS less of a melee-fest and Strat Live less of a caster-fest) and give hybrids more options (like the spellpower plate you mentioned)
---
Honestly that sounds like a sore loser-mentality. Ony/Rag items will in no way hinder your progression anytime soon (due to any shortly upcoming content being easy) and it might as well have been a fury warrior quitting with a good item.
---
I totally agree with this post. To me it seems as if the initial meaning of #nochanges was meant to shut down any ideas of a few things considered violating the 'vanilla spirit' - such as the LFG function. What people neglect is that the play of the game is a function of how the rules are written and how people adapt to those rules, and a developer's role in a game in the modern age is to constantly tweak the rules to create interesting and vibrant gameplay. Games such as Warcraft 3 is still getting tweaked and it obviously increases the longevity of a game.   
---
The technical and social aspects of a multiplayer game intertwine and are affected by each other. The presumption that a game would be caught in a 'perfected' moment of time while not considering how the social part of a game has matured with theory crafting, internet communities and resources and general gaming attitude/culture, is stupid, and thus, a major cause of the issues with the game today. Developers should try working towards a 'vanilla experience', not only a 'vanilla ruleset'.
---
No it isnt. Its patch 1.12 aka the "World PvP objectives that nobody played for in Silithus and EPL"-patch.
---
TBC patch with the buy pvp gear was in 2.0.1. Stop spreading false info.
---
Back in vanilla (maybe BC) my PVE server was put in the same group as a Russian PVP server.  
---
Thankfully they were terrible at WoW, as other battlegroups were reporting non stop Russian premades making WSG a miserable experience.
---
Both BRE and Perdition blade are on a separate loot roll apparently, our first kill was BRE Perdition and Onslaught Girdle haha

You can only record snapchats vertically, the screen doesn't rotate.

Are you orc or human?

You're not alone soldier.
---
As an alliance not really.
---
HonorSpy is using guild channels, not private. If you've updated it the last weeks at least.
---
I too would advocate DME and some LBRS. Damage from some packs in W and N is quite insane. Scholo might be doable if you have a guild group that can help directing you with pulls and mechanics, and they will have to help out a lot with interrupts. If you know the pulls, utilize corner pulls and have good interrupts and decent heals it becomes a lot more manageable. It can be an absolute wipe fest with a clueless pug that doesn't help out with interrupts. Thank god I got Earth shock.
---
According to TRP devs, [it doesn't](https://twitter.com/Solanya_/status/1204153556821008385). The only feature that would get impacted is the map scan, but even then, they can change it so it uses the YELL channel, which will reduce its range, but keep it functional. Everything else will still work as usual.
---
To get 5p bonus you would have to use one of the very subpar pieces - chest (truefaith is too good), head (t2 is too good/Cassandra's), legs (t2 is too good), belt (t1 is absolute ass - because whipvine).
---
If you don't have one of the above you could go for 5set. But you also really should have truefaith, and you absolutely want 3p T2 bonus come BWL, so you would be dropping the 5p asap to get 3p T2 +truefaith.
---
This is such hyperbole it is absolutely insane. Did you even PVP alot after xrealm in vanilla? I did and there is still a huge premade community and premades and players make a name for themselves. 
---
You're exaggerating everything, the PVE community and PVP community mix alot, especially in classic.
---
In a perfect world not doing xrealm would work but it is not possible on 99% of the servers.
---
TBH I can't get away from the sense of you wanting some "pure" sense of community with no basis in reality.
---
Honestly , killing the other side off the server happened a lot in Asian p2w MMORPGs.
---
Usually it's not seperated by factions but by guilds, so normal players tend to join the strongest guild, usually with big whales in it.  They fight the minor guilds, get them out of the server. Many people left. Then the game company will keep opening new servers like a new land for people to occupy, and merge old servers so they don't die too quickly.
---
Well in wow, since wow is more PvE focused and with flying mounts wPvP was quite ignored in BC and WLK so it was quite ok back then when many reamls became Horde dominated.
---
Many vanilla private servers have their own strategies to keep the faction balancne, otherwise it impacts quite heaveliy on the gameplay.
---
Paladin blessings are far more powerful than shaman totems.  One paladin can bless every DPS with salvation, for example.  Shamans can buff four people.
---
I would rather have 20% less threat than windfury.  It might not matter now in faceroll MC, but it will certainly matter on Vael the Guildbreaker.
---
&gt; you condescending asshole
---
Ahahahaa.
---
&gt; Farming gold is fine, it's really not that hard.

&gt; The game doesn't need to be shaped and changed to be more convenient for casuals

Thankyou. Needed a good laugh.
---
Fiery isn’t very expensive so if you like it, go for it. You’ll be using thrash blade for awhile and 10g won’t set you back too far.
---
Lol good luck to those that try - they'll get griefed by other horde and quit like the alliance did.
---
Only for horde
---
Better solution that i have used.. 
---
Create a new Horde alt and level it to 20+ in The Barrens.
---
yeah seems so and yet people are begging to pay for this service, why throw $25 to move your character to another realm that will slowly slip into it's own imbalance anyway.
---
Hey that's me!
---
It gets tricky though, because planning to meet up and duel is a fun way to interact with the opposing faction, but it can also be perceived as win trading.
---
If I meet up with someone and we duel each other until we're not worth honor, is that really win trading?
---
I know we're talking about people who might be sitting at the graveyard, kill each other 5 times and leave, but from just looking at /who and discord, these things look the same.
---
Greeting from Earthshaker, where your dwarf is now zerging our realm. We are overfull prices of everything skyrocket.

theres so much more to this story than just LOL WE GET KILLED IN IF
---
Is the protruding feature on the mountain Nefarion's balcony?
---
Never.
---
to me one of the coolest things about classic is that ur spec trully matters. u choose what u think works for u and the penalty for not thinking about what spec u rly want is the much gold needed to change.
---
Oh god, don't get me started on UBRS loot. I was big mad when I saw they left out the turban and trinket.
---
And yeah, it's such an oddly sloppy middle ground too. I'm really curious how they'll go about handling certain things for phase 5 as well; things like, Hand of Justice moving from Angerforge to solely dropping from Emperor between patch 1.9-1.11. I mean if it's already 1.12 why is it even dropping from Angerforge? No idea on the thought process with that one.
---
With add-on skins
---
When was that? Because when I was there it was one of the top raiding servers in EU. There was I think one Alliance guild left in the top100 guilds on the server.
---
""
---
You sound like the kind of guy who unironically asks for a couple of hours game time on a reset day because the servers stay down for more than 5 minutes after the estimated time.
---
If you get flagged while in an uncontested zone you're still attackable by the other faction til the flag is gone
---
Most of the current servers concurrent online is roughly equal to vanilla full/high pop servers anyway.
---
To your third point;
---
I’ve run strat UD like 30 times, cleared MC at five times and plenty of partial runs. Still have not even seen the fucking baron cloak. Rocking valor shoulders over the ones from DMW. Have a blastershot launcher as my only piece of raid gear (which is only better because I’ve lost the roll on the UBRS ring like 6 times).
---
Rng is rng. Don’t fault them for their gear.
---
Are those stock ElvUI unit frames?
---
This. Sending the lads a snap is ez mode
---
Why are BC and Wrath weird because you think BC before 2.4 was the best hte game has ever been?
---
That is your opinion - nothing weird about that and probably objectively correct.
---
It had the best Features and not too many of them so you felt like everything was given to you.
---
You had the most Options of things to do without being overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things.
---
You had a lot of negatives IMO too but they are outweighed by the positives.
---
Still I prefer WOTLK over BC all day :P But that again is just due to personal preferences
---
&gt;l. I know that they don't like it but they can speak English if they want. They just decide to pretend that French is still a common language for what reason ever...  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Only problem will be Russians. I doubt that they even understand themselfs. They are just chaotic people. But hey... that's Alterac. :)
---
Or lets have it just like in was 12 years ago, battlegroup with 4 to 6 servers, same language.
---
whell what is bs to me is that when i hs a rogue can just kil me in my main citty but i cant attack a horde who is out in the open world walking about. thats some bs right there.
---
OP is an exceptional individual
---
Yes! Thank you :)
---
All those entitled People that want the game to be exactly to their preferences so they can enjoy it...
---
Go to retail honestly... That is exactly what retail has done. You can do something in whatever Situation you live in (16hrs a day or 20mins a day) without much effort or experience.
---
It is perfect for the People that constantly want changes because it has all already been changed - in retail...
---
Yeah, may as in, "if BGs don't stop people quitting then we'll open them up".
---
Just because you don't want to play on a PvP server doesnt mean people who do are tools.
---
I know it's crazy, but you can enjoy the game you want to while letting others do the same.
---
My PvP server is balanced and super fun most of the time. It can be frustrating at times but it makes the exciting times that much better. I think I would have quit the game if the majority of the enemy players in the open world weren't attackable.
---
Either way, you'll get to play with PvP server players now if you decide to do bgs.
---
As an alliance lock, fear is pretty situational and in a lot of PvP fights you have to make do without it. Engi net is a good substitute.
---
&gt;No, its scummy that they take advantage over the fact that not all guilds have a working roster yet, so a lot of people have to relay on other guilds PUG'ing
---
You don't have to rely on anything. You can form your own PUGs. You just didn't want to. You wanted the convenience of not having to organise anything.
---
Got some examples? I run my guilds Gsheets with atendance etc... and i'd like to compare :o
---
I'm pretty sure it is this unbalanced. Even the numbers we get, based on raid logs, don't show how much PvP is absolutely unbalanced faction wise.
---
Everybody has been rolling an orc or an UD to pvp mix-max. Those racials won't be that useful while waiting in queues, uh?
---
I'm waiting for these horde's tears. Fucking deserved.
---
They were really great dungeons
---
Redridge and Menethil.
---
That too.
---
Like, I'm glad I don't have to go that deep in to farm it BUT A LITTLE CONSISTENCY WOULD BE NICE
---
Best I can figure is that they probably pre-assembled different loot tables based on which era they're trying to emulate and when it comes time to release the new items (like tome of the lost and spellweaver's turban) they'll just push through *that* era's loot table and it'll include updated tables for each mob, including Angerforge's and Emperor's 1.12 tables
---
Ferals can survive almost every boss just fine.
---
Someone is mad at the mods...
---
Read the rules and it wouldn't be deleted? :D
---
That's what the kids do these days.
---
Gather purple lotus, go to scholo alchemy table, turn off the light, profit.
---
I'd 2nd this, or 59 fully kitted out so you can roll over people
---
At the end of the day i’m not going to act like I have a crystal ball - your guess is as good as mine.
---
I’m just thinking 500-1000 alliance to 3000 horde per server queuing into crossrealm is going to create waits for the excess Horde either way. Its not even close to a 1-1 queue ratio because most servers seem to be quite imbalanced
---
No way. Difference is we actually know *how to efficiently play games*. Yes, that includes gamed we have never played before.
---
You may say the resources were there back in the day too (and I agree, but to a **much** lesser extent), but the difference is that your average player knows about them *and uses them* now. I sure as hell didn't care for, or know of, minmaxing 16 years ago.
---
What time GMT do BGs go live
---
I do not understand russians...
---
Everytime I get in a BG against them in retail I get crushed. They are literally the best Players I have ever come across.
---
Ever since they beat me so hard I tried only PVPing when I am drunk and I actually improved a lot. I think there is something in the alcohol...
---
Does anyone have a copy of the meme or a link to the post where it's like 4 different pics saying world pvp on a pvp server and the last pic is some deformed person drooling it's the funniest thing I've seen
---
Yeah, it was no wonder you were confused. Redditing on the phone while in the process of dragging my carcass back to life seems to be a poor idea.   
---
Didn't see my mistake till after I responded to you, either.
---
Do you think the average 11-year old used them back in the day? Nope.
---
you think you do.....
---
Ye just make an alt, invite him to a party, make it a raid, when done with the instance log out, long in on ur alt, wait 2 minutes to get auto leader, reset instance and log back on ur main, u will be at the start of the instance, or if you scepter in you will be at the waterfall.
---
I actually have the same Problem.
---
Pretty much everytime I logout of the game (when it is instant logout - e.g. in an Inn - a Major City or on a griffon) my game crashes.
---
Haven't had any Problems when Login in tbh. But defenitely when I logout :/
---
Thanks man, will check it out later tonight.
---
I thought the bars in between you're unit frames were a weak auras.... but they're just action bars.
---
You need zero justification for PvP.
---
Isn't oeb just better because of weapon skilll for pve?
---
So what's the bis equivalent for an alli?
---
yeah or any x9 level with Mortal Strike.  
---
But any other twink will stomp you.
---
a Warrior's potential will unlock in their 60's with gear and a 2Hander.

Increase in population doesn't affect wait times, faction balance does.

If the balance is 70%-30%, be it 700/300 or 7000/3000, the wait times will be the same.

Jagex is powerless against 🦀
---
Do people use discord for 20 mans? idk how hard ZG and AQ20 are, but nobody needs them for UBRS. Probably because UBRS is only a real 'raid' for about 2 rooms and as many bosses. ZG just sounds like the sweet spot of content for me and I can't wait to do it but I don't know how much of a commitment it is.
---
It was a hunter pet I believe XD and you nailed it. The crystals were just so pretty

Yes you are right if we don't do anything RIGHT NOW all Server will be dead within 2-3 weeks. Something has to happen.

#Petition to save the remaining Servers from dying to faction imbalance. We can make a Change but we have to act now!!
---
#If we don't act now we have 2, maybe 3 weeks left before all Servers will have died.
---
#We will have 21 Servers with ONLY alliance on the and ~113 Servers with ONLY Horde. This will be the end confirmed (TM)
---
why is intel going back to 22nm
---
It can be so quick it's almost like a subliminal message, too
---
I think you're misinterpreting what that means. It means that 14 AP has the same value as increasing your weapon dps by one. It doesn't mean your overall DPS will increase by 1.
---
Well it's a better option for the individual players than the current status quo on imbalanced servers.
---
Would I be happy to have balanced servers all around? Hell yeah. But I sure as hell won't set myself on fire to make the other faction a tiny bit happier.
---
Why not wait for a Ravager?

I even gave up on clearing the xtra pack of trash in my dm:e solo runs for the dungeon chest since out of maybe 20 chests there was not one single usefull item

Latest results have varied 20\~25/80\~75. There are websites around we haven't checked lately though
---
Thats like a horror movie :D suddenly you look back and there he is :D
---
Hey man, 
---
A couple of excellent questions!
---
Any list you use for WoW Classic will need to be taken with a grain of salt, as the data we have as a foundation for most of our lists is, to a large extent, some-what lacking in quality/depth/relevance. We sadly do not have proper tools for evaluating stat weights as SimC Classic does not support healing/holy paladins as of yet. The foundation for my stat weights has been gathered from trawling through semi-ancient forums, private server references and in regard to pre-bis/pvp weights, using qualified estimates, naturally I cant be certain, which is why I put an emphasis on the option of using custom values in my sheet. 
---
In regard to trust, then I cant really decide that for you; personally I have trust in my own work as I know the level of work that has gone into it, and since the process of assigning value to items, is entirely transparent. 
---
Regarding your weights, then I would actually slowly begin moving towards the Standard values, a lot of pre-bis will be viable for quite a while still, and what you are really going to be working on, is gearing for BWL,so you want to focus on the items that has some longevity in them!
---
I am on the Alliance side and I approve this message.
---
Is the whole harpies in AV thing no longer a thing?
---
so between " barely playing the game" and "spending several hours grinding every week" there is nothing i guess.  
---
Also enlighten me with what proffesion you can spend 10 min a day including AH time and crafting time to get 100g each week. Guess if you have a recipe like Lionheart Helmet or something similar maybe you can get that 100g in 1h of each week or if you got the transmute that goes for 700g+. Otherwise gl getting 100g after spending your 70 minutes each week with a proffesion + AH.  
---
The price to respec is super high but its also a gold sink as other said. As one guy already stated: maybe if it would be something near 10-20g each respec then there would be more respecs overall and more gold would be out of the economy this way but #nochanges so we wont see it change  
---
On the other hand respeccing in Classic is a luxury and maybe it should stay that way as it was meant to be... i got mixed feelings about it (got a fury warr and i really cant pvp in that spec so it makes me salty sometimes)
---
So you have no idea how the fights work, yet you want a raid that should have rules that you like, or else they are scummy. Yeah, you sound entitled.
---
&gt;I find that scummy, it was a pure opinion, but your pride really kicked in with that one
---
I could say the same for you. My opinion is that you're entitled, and your pride really kicked in with that one.
---
Addons can still send their hidden addon messages to guilds. There is no reason to use a custom channel for a guild tool.
---
That doc has been pretty useful for me. For most of it you get a nice base point and can't say I saw anything too out of the norm. Fair bit is spot on for BiS. (Or what I can remember being the norm from almost 10 years ago. Not familiar with all classes and specs for twinks.)
---
And holy hell is there a lot of twink guides out there that are budget builds or recommend sub par items. Along with many that claim to be for classic but go on and have stuff that was from an expansion. 
---
Making a 39 hunter twink and I feel like most of the guides I've found are garbage on their own. Mainly was just wanting a gear list so I didn't have to look it all up on wow heads item search. But looking up everything on the item search is what needed done anyways. 
---
That said here's the link https://classic.wowhead.com/items
---
Just adjust parameters as needed. I usually go by an item level range, a single desired stat, slot type, and rarity.
---
What are the bug fixes?
---
Solid stones
---
Hey,
---
are your blessings no argument? At least on my server every group is in desperate need of paladins, be it as healer or ret. If I was raidleader I‘d see to it to have at least 2-3 paladins in a raid for max utility alone. If you haven‘t you should definitely go into Kings, that is something most holy paladins I‘ve encountered neglect for improved BoM. Extra bubbles for overaggroing melee are also nice to have.
---
Probs because it's not rendered with directx, it's opengl or something. Look at the char and the name plates
---
Wristguards of stability from MC are BiS, but it is a very, very small upgrade over Sadist.
---
TBC server is where u would find me most of the time. Classic+ would be cool too but making northrend &amp; Outland into level 60 content would be a dumb imo.
---
Got'em
---
Guys, this is a post about a half-naked dwarf reading fortunes in Classic Wow. You don't need to argue over politics here.
---
I’m having trouble finding a post that was on this sub about 5 weeks ago. It was a screenshot of a guy sending players food through the mail, with a note talking about head chef of stormwind being accused of collusion with the defias; and how mage food was subsequently tainted. Any help?
---
No, the messages are hidden. They're not regular chat messages. A lot of addons use them right now in raid/party and you'd never notice them.
---
No. This is not that kind of chat message.
---
That was my thought, I was horde back then on a medium pop server and it wasnt awful. You would think it would be doable to keep it server-only for realms that are better than say... 60/40? Or maybe if the average queue time exceeds 15 minutes move you to a region wide pool?
---
I think the second solution is likely way more technically challenging than I realise. Either way, good luck in the Bgs tomorrow, unless you're Horde...nothing personal but I need my honour ;)
---
Unless he was referring to the Horde side.
---
Selling stuff on the neutral AH to alliance players, with the shortage and all, you can comfortably double your price. If the need is there, it'll be still be sought after.
---
I’ve noticed this on this sub since before classicwow was even released: comments and threads being downvoted right off the bat. My theory is bots, because even the most wholesome comments will receive downvotes right away
---
P servers disagree. Everyone knows how they work - still a clown fiesta
---
nah, I think with Phase 2 and the amount of corpse runs we've all had to do, most of us are fed up with Wpvp and just want to join PvE and have the option to flag.
---
They wanted to give the authentic 'World PvP battle experience'.  
---
What they apparently didn't see coming was the mass gank-fest and the mass migration off of servers where 1 faction was vastly outnumbered.
---
They could've easily released BG's 2 or 3 weeks after the Honor system and everyone would've been happy, I think.
---
Or priest
---
I thought it was the defias pilagers. Those fireballs are no joke
---
AB is phase 4
---
In any good guild getting OEB doesn’t make you any less likely to get Spinal or BRE. You give your first OEB to your highest ranker to make sure he was a weapon, then give spinal or BRE to the same guy so that he actually has a good one.
---
ungefähr 75/25 zugunsten der Allianz.  
---
Man merkt den Überschuss aber ich finde es nicht all zu schlimm muss ich sagen.
---
PM, AM, who cares, right?
---
A lot of people in our guild seem to think that Battlegrounds on all servers are going to be made up entirely of premade alliance groups that will be constantly camping the horde graveyard making any pvp play by the horde impossible, I'm a casual player, I don't understand why this would be the case, can anyone explain?
---
For WSG and AB you can queue as group, so you just have to have a buddy in town to queue for you. When it comes to AV you have to queue are BG master since you cant queue as group/raid to AV.
---
Is UBRS considered as raid or dungeon in terms of resets? In other words can it be completed only once per week or 5 times per hour (in theory)?
---
I'm pretty sure it's the latter, but my friend states otherwise and he's firm about it. Who's right?
---
Just hit 60 and want to tank UBRS, so I better be prepared for it :D
---
A dungeon, 5 times per hour.
---
Yeah it’s only like half the rank 1s
---
&gt; most people just waited out the queue
---
Not really. Blizzard never reduced population cap to blizzlike levels. Lots of servers should still have queues. No queues = nobody will use the free transfers.
---
You are just delusional to think you need extreme experience to play the game efficient. A friend of mine never played mmos before classic, leveled bunch of classes to 40-50ish to see which one fits best for him, leveled a priest in 8-9 days of playtime, and is now collecting epic from mc and is the next in line for the the eye. He is not playing 12h a day either, he is having a job.
---
Finish him
---
no kidding, boggles my mind. The transfers should be FREE like they were back in Vanilla. This was completely blizzards fault, yes, i signed up for wpvp, no, I  didn't expect servers to have 3x the population.
---
You're wrong on most counts. SL locks and spriests are completely hopeless matchups due to fear + drain mana. Ret paladins only have an advantage vs rogues and warriors, which makes them one of the weaker classes for duels.
---
Enhance shamans aren't strong duelers either and suffer from the same issues, they're easily kited and go oom. Just look at the standings in the duel tourney; shamans are the class with the fewest wins.
---
Thanks. Damn that genuinely sucks to be honest.
---
You know what, thats some great points, I'll give you that. I lost that one, I'll end it on this. 
---
In my opinion, I find it scummy to take PUGs in, and then sell some of the best items you can get, and I'm targeting Karma, since I don't see any other guild doing this. 
---
I completely admit that you won that argument.
---
5 lol
---
I think you're projecting your insecurities on me. I don't think I'm better than anyone and the fact that you think that's what my wall of text means only goes to show that you have some unresolved issues. Please get mental help. If you want to think that I'm better than people here then that's on you, not me. Therapy can do wonders for people like you.
---
I suspect the logic is coded to just respond to waves and other emotes in a certain way, regardless of the affiliation. It's fun and it adds a little something to the game.
---
Hope it happens with more servers, it's amusing
---
ok
---
I think your #5 is supposed to say "accept your Res". Thanks for the tip though!
---
Yeah exaclty. People who claim x dps probably don't really know how it functions and spikes. I can do like 160 as prot tank. I don't have a great weapon, nor use all the buffs, but 400 would be insane for any tank unless they are fury prot
---
if i get killed by some twink over and over when im trying to level you can be your arse im going to kill you on my 60. Its like cool bro you got to lvl 19 and bough a bunch of blues. the only twink bracket i respect is the 39 bracket. anything lower is just lame!
---
So this will be nice. 
---
We're getting the keyring AV, WSG.
---
As a hunter, I'm just leveling engineering (mostly for the jumper cables), but I guess it will prove effective to stun those pesky rogues/warriors and others.
---
I'm looking forward to getting honored so I can buy those ice arrows with a frosty effect xD.
---
As much as it is unlikely that the rogue is both good and geared enough, it does happen. That said I'm perfectly aware that a warlock can beat literally anything, and usually does.
---
Is there a way to bind PvP trinket and wotf one button or should I keep them seperate?
---
 Nice thanks!
---
You can absolutely still queue...
---
Yup, it has been going good with +2 since people usually save atleast one charge for domo/rag, but +1 reset is a great thing to consider!
---
Please have my upvote, I'm crying.
---
You are correct. First place is the defias pillager. The second is vaelastraz
---
Can't wait to cap the last graveyard only to open the map and see all 39 players fighting in the middle
---
You either PVE or PVP.
---
Yeah, going with +2 now works fine, mainly used +1 in the beginning when most runs went 8/10 and people being to lazy to start douse q-line, but with +2 people tend to save one charge for domo/rag, which works fine.
---
I'd pay a 100$ tomorow to get me the fuck off this PvP server. Yes im happy, the sooner the better.
---
So you farm for two hours to be able to do MC in one hour instead of 3. I mean, I'm no math major but to me it kinda seems you aren't saving any time at all.
---
Simple and harsh totalitarian solutions are called for:
---
- Faction specific queues.
---
- Faction specific one direction faction-change.
---
- Faction specific transfers
---
- Forced login quotas. (Not necessarily 50/50, but atlease *somewhat* even).
---
I'm a horde player on Flamelash and I am really saddened about Alliance leaving, it sucks, I felt like they overreacted before BGs came out. I hope Alliance somehow resurrects itself from this situation or else I dont know if I wanna stay on Flamelash as Horde.
---
Alliance are winning on Golemagg
---
orc or gnome, 60.
---
I am so happy about it, as a casual player. I ve just randomed the server(they all were full) when i was choosing one and now my realm is pretty dead and so horde dominant, I hope i ll be able to move to more balance realm with more people on it. Do it Blizzard !
---
rofl this thread has me dying
---
Back in da day there was already all the "problems" u r refering to here. Nothing new, and its fine!
---
gief wsg griefing, endless av and noobs not knowing how ab works :) fight on the road moar and not by the cap points lol.
---
How did you get it to work? I created a Testserver and tried to set it up.  
---
I can't get it to work. The only thing it gives me an answer to is !help, !serversettings
---
The bot should have everything it needs. But it doesn't change any prefix, role, or anything.  
---
Dunno what I am doing wrong. The FAQ doesn't help.
---
Can confirm.
---
20% Warriors and people still wait so long to find a tank (esp for leveling content) is nuts. I started making my own groups when I kept noticing every ground I joined that needed a tank already had a Warrior dps who needed all the same gear I did. (Got a *lot* of angry whispers from dps warriors when I declined them)
---
lmaoo
---
Looks okay but the minimap location is way too centered and the default MSBT font looks horrendous.
---
If that isn't the Classic experience, I don't even know.
---
Yes I Agree with You, and Since he willn't Have it understanded, You is better kind And wisdom completely with Truth! Thank yes?
---
No. It detects players that appears in the combat log. E.g. attacks, gets attacked, casts a spell, receives a buff, etc.

The 4.1 revamp which I was talking about was.

---
Its like 40s and thats 1/10 of every herb
---
They have said from day 1 that BGs would be cross realm.... and cross realm BGs were added in patch 1.12 ("Drums of War") in vanilla. So idk why you would think that BGs wouldn't be cross realm this time around as well. 
---
But yeah, given that most PvP servers are horde dominated, alliance will have instant queues.
---
I get the Battletag option, no normal friend option.
---
I get a dropdown with two options, normal one disabled for enemy faction.
---
They were added in patch 1.12. Which is the patch we're in.
---
ironically it's the casual guilds that can't afford to accept subpar dps specs, as their dps players probably aren't tryharding enough to allow the guild to progress through certain dps checks later on.
---
Ask and ye shall receive.

100runs... you should consider yourself lucky.  
---
I just bought it after some while.... ive made 200G doing alot of those runs, and with that i could afford that book....
---
This shit is serious to us, okay?
---
Do you really think that it won't be a 15min race almost everytime after maybe 2-3 days of 'honey moon'?
---
With so many min-maxers in the game, I just can't imagine that there won't be a majority of players saying: 'don't fight them, just rush the end, it's more honor and reputation"

Tbh I leave Horde alone more often than they leave me alone. I have no problem to leave Reds living if I have something else to do but every Warrior I ride past turns to charge me, every Mage blinks back to Nova (and loses in the following duel if it stays 1v1). Rogues randomly saping and killing you from IF to Un'goro.
---
Whenever I see a shadow I'm getting at least two dots before I'm out of range.
---
Only time I have a problem with Reds is when they decide to contest my farming spot (dont let me see you pick my herbs, open my clams or kill my eles). Or when I actively try to farm honour in WPvP which is like 4 times for a few hours per week.
---
If youre below 500 health I might invest the two Moonfires for free 200 honour tho.
---
The Twitter message in your first link actually refers to the original blue post that quotes this:
---
"Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley will open in WoW Classic the week of December 10. At the same time, Elemental Invasions will occur in Kalimdor, with Blazing, Thundering, Watery, and Whirling Invaders appearing in Un’goro Crater, Azshara, Winterspring, and Silithus respectively."
---
Proving yourself wrong.
---
:)
---
Better known as retail.
---
It takes only 1 stooge on Ally side to cap iceblood and destroy all progress made
---
Well, it was mostly 4chan and such who "took" it, and they are not really supremacists of any sort, well, most of them are not, most of them are just bored and awkward, so they did all that shit to laugh. Their collective sence of humor is questionable, thats true. Also, wtf, you cant just "take" meme, thats the whole point of memes, its like you would fart in the crowded place and then be like this is my own personal fart, you are not smelling it, it is mine and only mine.
---
anything from chronicles and onwards should stay away from classic.
---
You are just irational , False admirating someone, Wasting The humanity in you , proving everybody That you could be a killer or agree saw ppl killing irl. And Ofc telling everyone that your bad.
---
but obviously you prefer to act like a crybaby (we all know where it come from when you watch those kind of ppl a lot)
---
Click the link in the Twitter message. It clearly says week of the 10th, which is the original blue post.
---

---
Why? Outland was originally supposed to be lvl 60 endgame zone.
---
Today most warriors think they are rogues though. Crossdressing in leather and going LF tank ect ect...
---
So easy to mix them up.
---
Understandable mistake these days.
---
What’s your current one? I just spam click mine to get it to work, doesn’t work from a single click
---
As someone who quit tanking Uldaman for pugs after 3 runs in a row a DPS drew aggro, healer started spamming max ranked heals on them while I died to dwarf casters and the troggs, **thank you**. 
---
DPS need to learn to stop pulling by then and they'll only learn if they die. Tank dying to save the DPS's life is why there's a tank shortage
---
I twinked a warrior back in the day and on priv servers and in theory warriors are great at burst at 29. 
---
But against decent players you will be perma novad, slowed and sheeped and will spend your days being kited without having intercept. If you go warrior at 29 I would recommend alliance because of paladins, it makes life a whole lot easier.
---
Yeah but it cost 750/900G on this serv, so farming this book is inevitable

I have a 24-0-27 build for -19% mana-cost on Healing-Touch. Omen of Clarity allows me to get Max-Rank-Regrowth or Healing-Touch casts without spending mana and disrupting my Mana-regen and I can use it on all fights that don't require constant healing out of me and that allow me to stand close to something I can smack with my Staff.
---
I said I'm botton on the healing meters on the easy fights like Garr while being top or near the top on the tougher ones like Ragnaros and Majordomo. I'm also not assigned MT-healer.
---
If I want to see big HPS numbers in "Details!" I have to go DM west.
---
Why would posting this on reddit help you? Most people reading this have no characters on your server to help you. You'd reach way more people advertising on your server. This is the literal interpretation of clogging up /r/classicwow
---
But since you're here, you've probably already printed out fliers for your local drycleaning business. I'd wish you luck, but I'm afraid you're in need of something else..
---
Baguette
---
Keep the change.
---
19 warrior with shield and sword with massive hp is very good, your job is not to do dmg, it is to control the enemy by spamming hamstring and getting in peoples faces and soak up dmg and flag carry since druids dont have travel form yet.
---
How is the demand for resto druids (horde if that matters)? I heard that in vanilla they were usually in demand, not so much because people wanted a lot of them but because hardly anyone played them. My current guild seems to have plenty of them though. I would like to play one as an alt but I'm worried that it's a bad choice because even though supply may be low, demand may be even lower, and druids are the one healing class that you can seemingly have too many of.
---
In high 50s here also. Took a break several weeks ago and started leveling an alt. It’s way more fun. But HoJ haunts my dreams.
---
yes, its very close
---
Land at a flight point or take a boat and not be ganked.
---
can i solo [Amnennar the Coldbringer
---
](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7358/amnennar-the-coldbringer) as a 58 rogue?
---
What an odd attitude, quite selfish if you ask me.
---
Blizzard, duh.
---
So I play ESO because I enjoy the Elder Scrolls Universe more at this point. 
---
It scales and it nice because no old content goes away. You can still find people running the original 'raids.' Their post 50 leveling system is a bit broken and pointless, but it still is good.
---
I would still give it a chance if you hear good things, you never know.
---
power corrupts,when you see you got spergs who will give you stuff its hard for majority of people to resist temptation,then you see Asmongold get 900g for his epic mount in 30 mins and you say fuck it Im doing it too. However there is weird pleasure in grinding your own gold to get your epic mount,handouts make you feel empty as you gained nothing.
---
wrath gear and questing progress was too hand fed to me. no attunements, no grinding faction rep to get into heroics, and gear was *significantly* easier to get. 
---
I felt that BC was both better than wrath before 2.4 and worse afterward, because after 2.4 it was basically the same as wrath with badges of justice and the SSO gear, but a lot less polished, with the class mechanics still being rather clunky.
---
so I called it weird because BC was both better and worse than wrath depending on what part we're talking about.
---
Every tank in those speedclear guilds is fury prot, many of them dont even wear any or barely any def gear, you can also check that their most used abilities are heroic strike and bloodthirst, they rarely spend rage on threath abilities that dont deal dmg.
---
Yet they still top out at 300 dps average, and those are tanks in the worlds fastest clears, if a tank claims to do 33% more dps than the mts in the top guilds, you know its bs.
---
Get to 60 and get that swift wolf mount :)
---
 /Pvp
---
OPs question did ask about feelings and opinions....so I gave them.
---
Transfer to a different server.
---
Blizzard has a notorious and proven Track Record of having what I call the Anti-Midas Touch. Assume the worst and they'll manage to make it even worse.
---
Full run i'd say no, raid geared maybe. Up to rend it's doable with 5.
---
By that reasoning, I think the servers named "Normal" would be the real experience ;)
---
When they announced BGs, they said "the week of Dec 10", and just like with DM, everyone ignored the "week of" part and only read the "Dec 10" part, then bitched when it didn't come out that day.
---
Yes.
---
&gt; More tanks, more healers
---
Not true, if people want to tank, they can tank now without speccing for it, same goes for healing, but they don't, why do you think that is?
---
More healer
---
&gt; Sure was. Flying mounts were immediately critisised for killing off world PvP and in the world interaction. Cross realm was critisised for hurting server communities, dungeon finder was critisised for the mass of toxic behavior it brought and further damaging server community.
---
That was *NOT* how they were received, that was the perception months after they were implemented.
---
&gt; You have no argument here other than "but but but no changes!" and that doesn't hold up sorry. The worst thing about classic is the idiotic "no changes" crowd.
---
Yet I'm not arguing against it, I'm arguing against your arguments that don't hold an ounce of water.
---
For the Alliance!
---
So true. Was playing male tauren druid in vanilla but this time around i made a female cow after trying them both out and feeling much faster and mobile as female.
---
Where can I find these? I am a discord nub
---
I think most people like myself thought the server caps would be a lot lower or the same as it was in 2004-2005. It’s one of the biggest contributors to complaints and caused phase 2 to be a nightmare if you still are leveling a character and even for 60 getting into raids and black rock mountain. Also with blizzard being no change but while at the same time make changes that change the dynamics of the game is fucking frustrating. If layers where still in and token out at BGs things would have been better or possible made a main layer that everyone can join by their own free will in order to have those massive PvP battles that made phase 2 fun, which were only the first week after that it became small gank squads roaming lower level zones killing the same players over and over again until other higher levels of the other fraction came into to help.
---
I feel real good about getting it for 200g then!
---
Yikes, that game is horrifically boring.  I couldn't make it past about 10 hours....after spending $60 on that game it made me super angry that it was so terrible.  The combat is fucking terrible.  The NPCs are terrible.  Everything is mind numblingly simple (so that it could be a console game I think).  
---
How does anyone like that game?  Seriously I need to know, it is honestly the worst MMO I have ever played.
---
Nice try
---
loool we have 4 dagger rogues 2 sword and we have been raiding since week 3 or so i think of release, ive never missed a raid.we have got:
---
1 cht
---
0 perd
---
1 brut blade
---
0 viskag
---
Has daily reset happened yet? If it did, then I guess it’s a bug and I hope it doesn’t happen to everyone!
---
Blizzard needed the combat log spy is basically useless unless a person isn’t visible to you like behind a tree but with like 10- yards.
---
People need to go outside.
---
Will there be separate queues for premades and solo players?
---
My guild gets onslaught every week. Never saw a weapon.
---
So when does EU get BGs? The [tweet](https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU_EN/status/1202915804100079616) said we should get it on 10th, but the blue post says it comes with maintenance, which is tomorrow?
---
now the alliance cowards can all flee to one mega server where there is 1% horde to feelgood
---
??? I know a bunch of people who were on PvP in vanilla who switched to PvE in classic. The whole point of a PvE realm is that you don't need to PvP. Will some people queue? Of course. Will some people not? Definitely. Will the horde queues balance out because of PvE in the cross realm battle groups?
---
Only time will tell.
---
Why is that an "excuse" to you?
---
It's logic.
---
Isnt it super easy to get Rank 14 on flamelash now since you compete agains maybe 60 Others allianze Players?
---
actually not BIS, the armor values are lower than private server so the boss is at 0 armor without the bre proc anyway, dw fury is better atm (so im told, i play rogue)
---
my "pure" sense of community includes a realms enemy faction and hundreds of random players.  the "community" after xrealm is just a handful of premades patting themselves on the back just like the pve community.
---
it's not even close to the same thing at all.
---
i mainly get food or mana buffs, the odd mana or health pot, and stones.....probably had the odd green item here and there, but nothing good.
---
Payed transfers coming online soon according to patch notes.
---
&gt; They’re missing out on world PVP with the migrations,
---
So they're missing out on a core part of why they chose that server in the first place and you don't see how that destroys the game for them?
---
&gt; Migration was the short term answer, simple as that.
---
Short sighted maybe, definitely not short term.
---
I’d give it a chance for sure if I play the PTR &amp; I like it then most definitely I’d play retail but probably not as much as I play classic or TBC. I still play on a TBC private server just bc I miss that time of the game so much, playing level 70 protection paladin is the most fun I’ve had in the last 10 years that wasn’t irl.
---
and $25 to go back to the server you migrated from
---
technology is hard
---
I thought I would never get a huge 2h on my warrior, I thought unstoppable Force was going to be it for mez but I got it a couple of weeks ago.....can confirm....it's glorious 😁 feel so grateful!
---
It's pretty random though, playing arms sword spec it can burst like friggen monster! Or you can just never proc anything. 
---
The best thing about it is when a rogue ganks you thinking your using a level 50 green sword then you turn around and wtfpwnoverpower them !
---
I think that's impossible to determine because people will farm gold just for a respec, others will farm excess for raiding consumables, others will farm to get gear crafted and others just farm gold because they're bored or it's the main thing they enjoy and they want as much as possible.  
---
Given all these factors I think it's impossible to determine what you've suggested.
---
Congrats on the ding! Fellow Mograine horde here. And shoutout to these allys for realising what what going on lol
---
No thanks. I really would have dual spec to be in the game. Then everyone is as healer or DPSer or Tank and DPSer, with no real difference in class.  
---
if you wish the change spec, then part with the necessary gold to do so!
---
It’s going to be 15 mins race since it’s just first to kill wins. Everyone knows what to do and the quickest way to win which is just everyone run and power north and hope the other side wipes on boss
---
Fam, I'm saying that both sides are Horde... just from different servers that are are 90%+ Horde
---
Sounds like you want TBC to me.
---
they could just cash in on transfers,and then after a while say "fuck it" and merge the low pop realms,that would make sense,and people would have to change names,who gives a fuck,do you value your name more then a healthy server? if you do fuck you
---
Didn't update for me either
---
I am thinking about rerolling on a PvE server. I play very casually and the whole PvP server drama kind of put me off continueing to play on zandalar-tribe. 
---
Where can I find realm pop information about PvE realms that are relatively up to date? I can only find data from aug-oct
---
Or just upload the video to your phone so you can use it in snapchat.
---
OMFG THOSE ALLY, HOW COULD THEY. FUCKING SHITBAGS. DIDN'T THEY KNOW YOU WERE MAKING A VIDEO. UGH. ALLY SUCK. ALL ALLY ARE EVIL!!! THEY SHOULD ALL BE BANNED FOREVER FOR BEING SO MEAN.
---
/s
---
That was cheery
---
Reddit has always been a site for people to play the victim, they just want an excuse to call a set group of people bad so they can feel morally superior.
---
You hate doing it yet you do it because it is the most effective way, which is understandable. Every MMO player can relate to that, which is why you've earned my upvote with your honesty.
---
However, the method described above is simply a way to enforce better game design which should have been in the game from the start. That is:
---
You should not be worth honor at 50% HP and Mana when forced to rezz in the middle of 50 enemy players. That is unless you start attacking other players or healing allies etc.
---
So theoretically say everyone does this (they won't) and camping level 55s going to Brd start becoming shit Honor per Hour. That would then force the Meta out of standing in one place spamming a macro, over to instead having more active WPvP. Further, when BGs are released it would ensure participating in those would be much more profiteable than the mind numbingly boring grind. I'm sadly not 100% confident that will be the case now...
---
So in the end, you might get to actually have fun while earning good honor per hour, which doesn't sound like a bad deal to me.
---
I don't get why people care?
---
In vanilla, you got additional BG rep for queuing outside cities for WSG and AV. Is this still going to be the case?
---
I got to TN during TBC and played there until end of Cata.
---
Easy: Those min-maxers are not important and they miss the point of classic.
---
They will be out sooner than later. Classic just isen't for them.
---
What's the point Minmaxing in a game that is a over a decade old?
---
The point of classic is: what could be possible? Not "How to play vanilla efficient". We did that years ago.
---
It is nothing that gives you any reputation. "Oh I am world first for a boss that was killed 15 years ago real first"?
---
That's pathetic.
---
Oh I won Alterac in 15 minutes.
---
Those people will be out soon. I have patience. This crowd will move on. The people that stay will have a lot of fun. Do wired things nobody thought were possible. (Cause this will be the only thing that counts: to do all the things the minmaxers never will do)
---
Pretty much.
---
"Should I stop being a piece of shit?"
---
"No, it's the victims who are wrong!"
---
Login screen.
---
Gz but the sword sucks, expecially for ork.
---
“”””
---
I'm pretty sure Alterac Valley after a week will be almost only two raids rushing last graveyard for the simple reason that it's better honor and reputation that way and if Classic so far has proved us something, it's people min-max everything in this game.
---
Then for WSG, I also agree that many people will be quite disappointed: it's a very special gameplay that may have some charm for a few people but is also very repetitive, not really balanced and quite frustrating...
---
Being in a pickup with the flag and seeing your whole team is fragging in the middle... knowing the enemy flag is alone but your whole team is fragging in the middle... playing a druid in team and going back and forth while your whole team is fragging in the middle...
---
It's that Longsword dude. He is unbelievably toxic in general. I guess that's normal when you play the game literally 24/7.
---
If entering through North entrance you just need to pass 2 packs which I was able to steahlt past if I'm not mistaken. I did it with just 1 friend so we for sure didn't clear anything.
---
Need the Crescent key for unlocking doors however.
---
MVP this guy
---
"“”””"
---
\*laughs in paladin\*
---
Thanks for the ipdate guys will edit
---
Yes, totally a "maybe". Blizzard corp doesn't like money and is putting the transfer tech in just in case they suddenly decide to enable it later!
---
Lmaooo. It's literally because they're to cheap to get proper servers, you tosser.
---
Pre p2 had layers.
---
keep yer feet on the ground
---
whats the profit on arcanite transmute or the hides?  
---
arcanite transmute is about 5g each on my server so thats 35g  
---
dunno about the leather but doubt its 65g profit :p  
---
My point stands, u cant earn 100g in profit each week with just one char and prof. Unless you are lucky and have a lucrative super expensive recipe early and already made thousands
---
„I‘m fine with my majority side! Anyone complaining just can‘t handle it or doesn‘t have the time“
---
-every majority player inhere, while corpse camping the minority faction
---
P.S.: somehow the minority faction left the realm
---
surprised pikachu
---
It feel like its about 45/55 at the moment, which is good. As of the last few weeks Horde have been upping their game significantly and started to push back the Alliance a heck of a lot. Last week there was a large faction war in Azshara and for the majority of the fight, the Horde was controlling the battlefield. Not sure what happened the last 2 weeks, but Horde have become far more organised and are a serious threat now.
---
Oldschool Runescape started with the 2007 client and had community votes on changes. Osrs is still going strong and beating out RS3 in active players.
---
There were no rankers in p1, plus have fun convincing the other 12 warrior that the same guy should get dibs on the first 2 weapon upgrades because he will be the highest ranker especially if u have multiple rankers.
---
And a lot of good don't actually give these weapons to people going for r14 since these hardcore pvpers are going to get their weapons anyway
---
We've carried pugs before with a 3 man. We can do so again if need be.
---
Plan on mostly guild groups though, so if we're salty, we'll have to suck it up and git gud.
---
Get another dps if its not working, that way you could also add the 3rd boss to make sure you dont go below 12min/run
---
Then stop talking as if you know what your doing hahaha, you don’t even play and claim dreaming getting rank 10, what a moron
---
That would be great tbh, where you see this though? Haven’t heard about it before :)
---
I would appreciate if you actually responded to what I wrote. Here, let me try again and see if that helps: 
---
What's not there? Horde players that aren't killing lowbies? Are you honestly claiming there are no Horde on the server (Heartseeker) that would kill lowbies? Because that's all that's being described. 
---
&gt; This person is clearly not playing alliance on this realm or they are lying.
---
So you are claiming that on Heartseeker (an Alliance dominated server) there aren't any Horde that are chill and wouldn't want to kill a lowbie? Because that's literally all that's being described. 
---
Heck, I play on a Horde-dominated server and I still don't kill lowbies.
---
Is that what people are going to do next? That’s just sad.. :/
---
Horde and Alliance have the same, except barreños consumes you for a while. But barreños is horrible. I'm not corrected auto correct barrena.
---
We have the guildname and we do run rets, boomkins and cats (atleast a couple) - though you would have to go alliance...
---
Actually Stonespine is pretty cool!
---
You can just dodge sweaty tryhard horde premades in WSG as alliance by dropping anyways. It’s a much bigger issue for horde who will have longer wait times.
---
Fair enough. My bad. :)
---
Coming out today in the patch
---
Holy shit I used to read these back in vanilla / BC, and never remembered the name CRAZY
---
I'm pretty sure that in some dev interview with the guys from vanilla they said that the start of UBRS was actually balanced around 5 people, with the last few bosses (I would guess the Beast and General) being balanced around 10. So the start should be possible, but the end would be very hard if not impossible.
---
Great stuff! But it seems that armor is not taken into account, since the value row only sums up rows P:T, or am I doing it wrong?
---
Jesus that's a lot, the crafted pots don't even sell for 4g on my server.
---
No, partially because you don’t have the dual wield hit penalty with a 2hander and partially because BRE’s on hit is really dank.
---
Guy in my guild in vanilla duel wielded these. I still to this day don't know how he managed to get not one...but two 😮
---
depends on party comp and if warrior uses bombs from engi. In general warrior cant hold 8+ mobs pull after pull vs mage + lock
---
It's at the end of the patch notes released yesterday. They say payed transfers will be available in the future, not sure when exactly
---
Definitely possible, people were doing it before it was nerfed to a 10 man dungeon.
---
Daghorn was the French CM during Vanilla, making all the French blue posts, he was the most known by French player, like Furor was in US forums. When they decided to translate \*everything\* in the French locale client, they used his name for the book.  And also rip for Forgefer, Hurlevent and La Fossoyeuse
---
How are you going to op if you cant swing.
---
You’re a genius
---
Actually he was the 2nd French CM, the main CM was Aguilar, which got his name to replace Tigole's name in the game. For example :
---

---
Alright then, sorry, I thought you guys were one of those victim complex alliances.
---
Nice move to do that transfer as horde. Stomp them!
---
The 2hers are pretty rare. My guild had 3 raid groups going since week 2 and our fourth just a few weeks ago and we have seen 1 rag 2her. A bit unlucky but not too far away from the average
---
All of my server is doing AV premades as it's the best way to rank up and you get the rep done quicker.
---
We overtake lhc once in awhile as horde, but the Ally death squads way outnumber the horde ones there.
---
Yeah I agree with most of what you said, and personally I am prepared for all these things because I've experienced them multiple times over. I'm just fairly confident we are going to be hearing these complaints. 
---
I think it will be similar to people were looking forward to wPvP but are now dreading it, and being told "you knew what PvP servers were like so stop complaining". I just think people need to prepare themselves that BGs aren't magically going to fix everything. And I more specifically mean this for people who have not spent much time on private servers.
---
Now it says 12 keys :(
---
&gt;Never ending AV battles with zero coordination
---
sign me up!
---
And why wouldn't that work on Alliance character?
---
Use logs. Problem solved.
---
Do you ever go outside
---
The resources at blizzard are depleted, the staff has been getting trimmed constantly over the years to lower operating costs and make profit margins look better to investors.  
---
There are no positives for ban waves vs botters, only vs hackers.  Botters use basic scripts, hackers are actually using invasive programs to manipulate the client.  
---
You obviously have no understanding about these things, so that begs the question why are you mindlessly defending blizzard?
---
&gt;Guess People are too entitled to have a gaming experience THEY would like to have.
---
How dare people wanting to enjoy things they paid for!
---
We only exist to give free HK's to horde and should be happy and proud to bath in their glory, goddamn entitled millenials!
---
I will admit Onslaught Girdle is a somewhat unfortunate example because it does not get replaced like many of the early tier pieces do. Still, this does not change my point because the girdle is BiS for ret pallies as well. Whether you want to hold onto a ret pally throughout AQ and Naxx is an entirely different discussion though.
---
There was a post about it on the Retail WoW reddit when Classic was announced. A bunch of kids who did nothing that try to condemn Classic basically banded together and created a bunch of bots that downvote stickied / important posts on Classic Reddit. I honestly thought they would have got board by now, but still seems to be going on. It's not as obvious as it used to be so some of them must have given up.
---
It’s an opinion, not logic, and it’s based on assumption!!  Thanks for making obvious statements to back up your opinion though.   Will people play the game?  Of course.  Will people not play the game?  Definitely.
---
I find it hilarious that people are still trying to shout out about wows death after all these years.
---
We can say that min-maxers are missing the point of classic but... they are here and in big numbers judging from the number who rushed lvl60, number of people following blindly BiS lists and guides and farming industrially honor while optimizing everything they do. 
---
We will see how it goes but personally I'm betting you that in two weeks, the trend will be massively to 15min Alterac BG and not 3 hours ones.
---
I'm herb an alch I don't spend anything :D swiftness potions, stopwatch, skull. I can catch up.
---
there's nothing wrong with pvp servers, megaservers are not the real experience
---
Belf Ret Paladins were actually viable in TBC because of how Seal of Blood worked and the mana back on receiving heals. Not amazing sure but viable. Sadly Seal of Vengeance didn't fill the same gap.
---
You’re getting owned in this comment section.
---
It's not just the information gaps, the game was indeed harder with less efficient and optimized talent trees, worse itemization, and playing in real time as content was released before everything was nerfed to high hell.
---
They could still change talents and create a new meta, could be interesting.
---
After maint
---
What are you catching up to ive already vanished?
---
And wow classic combat is better?
---
I remember pre-ordering TGT expansion (50 or 60 pack), and getting literally 0 legendaries. Never bought another pack.
---
Correct.
---
It's 800 but since you get it at Exalted you'll pay -20% =&gt; 640
---
Now I’m no expert, but I’m willing to bet dollars to donuts if you were to tell your average guild you were a meleeing mage, you would quickly be uninvited from your raid. If you were to play boomkin, I’m sure you can find a raid for MC and Ony, but the connotation that you’re a meme spec would certainly exist. Truly, I don’t know if you would still be invited to raid AQ or Naxx because I have never seen that content. OP asked what a meme spec is and I think I answered his question the way a majority of the community would answer it. I didn’t say don’t play those specs because you won’t be seen as a hardcore gamer, I said they won’t compete which is factual. Go ahead and play melee mage if you want, It’s your $15 a month play the game how you’d like.
---
Please do not show Alliance ganking Horde, it hurts the narrative of the sub.
---
I agree, the grind and the animations/combat is so much better in retail imo.
---
1400g on my server :( how many books have you seen near the outside lashers? Only ever seen the one by the big lasher.
---
It is common practice vs HACKERS, because companies don't have the resources to keep up with hack development in real time and it catches the most hackers with each wave.  (People that have gotten complacent and think the hack is safe)....
---
With botters they are damaging a persistent economy in real time, constantly, and if you aren't adamant about banning them they are encouraged to keep botting even when they get banned because they are allowed enough uptime to make each account pay for itself and then some.
---
Yes, it does, lol. You either choose to save your hard earned gold or you choose to spend your hard earned gold and become more efficient than the people who save their gold.
---
You no longer have an identity. You’re not a tank, or a PvP warrior, you’re just a warrior. You don’t don’t get to choose what to be most efficient, you simply exist as a class.
---
It also doesn’t matter if you want dualspec, because it’s never coming.
---
I fully expect everything that you stated to happen in WSG. I still played it anyway, long after I got my title. 
---
Anyone that played in vanilla should expect these things. I cannot say the same for pservers or new players, so you're probably right. We'll see 20 posts about the ud warrior in the middle of the wall untargetable. But we'll probably turtle and we'll see who wins this war of attrition.
---
but as a lvl 19 twink you can easily take on normal opponents up to lvl 25 or more.  So you can go to those first neutral pvp zones
---
How does it feel being a dickhead?
---
Druid bugs resolved? :D
---
K?
---
This patch includes client support for the Paid Character Transfer service, which **may be** enabled at a future date.
---
Don't start rerolling on another server before you've checked how your server is doing now that BG's are out :)))
---
no they said they "may" be available
---
I logged into retail for the first time in 12 years about a week ago.  Few things:
---
All the items just have no stats and no +dog.
---
Mounts fly everywhere.
---
People have entirely too many hit points. 
---
Talents look straight ripped from D3.
---
I have no idea the story.
---
Classic will not die from this so stop it.
---
The arguement is for people who aren't awful at the game, in which 50% percentile is where Hunters "are better" - They're not actually better unless you're in a guild full of idiots. If you are, then loot really doesn't make a difference at that point.
---
Nett
---
I‘m on Ashbringer and enjoy it so far. Seems to be a little more Alliance than Horde but it’s fine.
---
Totally agree. 
---
If there's one trend absolutely clear in classic at the moment is that everything is optimized by a large amount of players and Alterac won't be the exception past maybe the first days where people playing their first games will maybe try to have a bit of fun before grinding it seriously.
---
And I'm a human with perception I see all those sneaky bois
---
You won't get rank 11 spamming AV. Even less without premades.
---
Rank 10 is easy. Rank 11 is where you need to be within 1.4% of your server's overall ladder. You're competing against people who do 3min WSG. No way in hell you compete when pugging AV.
---
#NoChaNGEs *Hrrnnnn* *splurges*
---
Playing the bad guys has become the new playing the good guys. It’s the new trend. Just like how barely anyone rocks a clean shave anymore, growing a beard is the new thing even if it looks like shit. Soon enough it will probably change back and alliance will be more popular again.
---
I'd like to have 3 characters: mage, rogue, hunter, all geared, doing raids and stuff.
---
I'd like to get the nerubian slavemaker for once.
---
when did I say i want to hit any rank, not even 10 ?
---
You claim to know about ranking seeing as you said I’m dreaming about hitting rank 10. Stop talking about ranking you don’t know anything
---
why would alliance *not* sapper charge that valley Tuesday/Wednesday night from 7pm? Free honor is free honor
---
Hi, /u/Radical_Moderate_
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8pvxz/patch_time/). 
---
Could be, even just adding more talent points would be cool. I just don’t wanna run around Outland &amp; Northrend with the same exact character just more damage/healing is all I’m saying.
---
What’s premade and av.?
---
me in august: yeah I'm gonna farm the fuck out of pvp and bgs
---
me in december when alliance are quitting and horde are going to have long bg queues: \*doesn't resub and farms ranked mlg on halo reach pc\*
---
Dream on champ, I'm sure you'll get there camping flight paths, when people don't give any honor.
---
I’m confused what classic not being vanilla has to do with the topic at hand.
---
Or do you think classic, where gold is **much** more abundant and easily obtained should reduce the amount of gold sinks Vanilla had?
---
LMFAO
---
&gt; This will kill WoW
---
where have I heard that one before?
---
I am not saying your experience was same. I am saying that mine was. Being in an extremely well organised hardcore pvp guild was always fun regardless of the horde - alliance ratio.
---
Thats how our officers run the guild, very,very rare loot council, 95% cold dkp, but i like it regardless cz people are good and we clear content.
---
The patch they are using now had cross realm battle groups back then
---
Jouho aka the Gunner from BLC?
---
What are you talking about? You don’t even play the game. Stop speaking you don’t know anything about ranking, camping in between bg queues is still going to happen, I’m glad you’ve quit one less idiot
---
Yes... the little nostalgia videos blizzard made with old devs talking about the sense of community in early vanilla were all just fluff, blizzard doesn't care about server communities.
---
This is the normal behavior or spy now after blizzard decreased the range of combat log to 50 yards. So the player needs to show up in your combat log and be withing 50 yards or you need to target or hover over him with your cursor.
---
no change indeed :(
---
Nobody is saying that Alliance could not fight back.  
---
On 30/70 Alliance/Horde server we get first Azuregos kill and was able to take controls of different zones.  
---
Problem is that as soon as organized Alliance resistance go away - it would again be overcome by Horde.  
---
Average Alliance player could fight back ... for 15 minutes and then go by his own ways.  
---
Average Horde player will attack for hours, again and again. You kill him - he wait until you go away and continue attacking.  
---
At least this is my experience with Alliance players.
---
Baguette de fromage !? Wand of cheese? :D
---
The rating has nothing to do with your PvP skill, is also not possible to reach top ranks right now without some kind of abuse. They're doing it for the gear, and there's literally no alternative outside waiting.
---
I don't condone it of course, and I hope anyone breaking the rules is punished naturally.
---
Indeed. There are always the same number of flight masters and guards, so the higher the pop cap, the exponentially worse the faction imbalance will seem.
---
None on AH 3 days in a row
---
Tho the right thing here would be not to do so, since the most reactions of those players to others‘ complaints rightnow still are „blah, #nochanges“
---
Go play their game then
---
Zandalar tribe is such a nice server full of kind people, even oposite factions were fun, well atleast until honor sytem happened. Druid dream that both factions wpuld be frendly to eachother
---
&gt;WSG GY camping and honor farming
---
Yeah this is just outright toxic griefing and exploiting, but there is a very simple solution to this: You dont HAVE to accept the res at the bg gy's, you can either cancel it or just walk away as ghost.
---
And as someone who farmed AV exalted on 2 characters in original vanilla, atleast 5-6 different characters on different pservers, and is going to farm it again on atleast 2 characters in classic, I am absolutely hyped and looking forward to never-ending 5-6h av zerg battles (ofc those are not the ones you farm that rep or honor in). 
---
In 5-10 minute rushes, objectives mean nothing besides some bonus honor at the end. But when both sides are equally uncoordinated and just zerging in the middle, every objective feels like a win and can change the entire battlefield, and no other game or pvp mode I played since has recaptured that feeling.
---
It’s both.
---
May be if you stopped picking on us all the time we wouldnt have to play the victim jerk. I was raised not to do that
---
Rofl, no. Those stats are from launch. It was 70/30 before P2 and quickly dwindled to 80/20 as Horde were camping the entire world.
---
How many keys are there in the game anyway. Seems stupid if they wouldn't all fit.
---
no
---
As someone who has lived in that valley for the past weeks, hasta la vista 😎
---
Well, all the known farm places are occupied by alliance, but you could go DM for that. Leveling alts is a mess, it's hard to find groups for anything and many spots/Quest objectives are overfarmed by the Alliance. In the past days, they tend to camp on the bank in OG and no one is doing anything against it. The auction house is pretty empty on Horde side, for example there is only one Horde crafter on the whole realm for the Lionheart Helmet AFAIK.
---
Overall, I thought that we a least get separate PvE and PvP battle groups for BGs. Now it's only the disadvantage, not a single advantage at all.
---
I was sure about the 640, but apparently the -20% from Exalted was added in TBC indeed.
---
10% from Honored+ and 10% from Rank 3 then, yes!
---
yeah hold on lemme ask my uncle at blizzard
---
Yeah RPers seem to be attracted more to Alliance. How is the Horde community on Hydraxxian Waterlords? Any RP going on?
---
We have a Ret that parses 90% and is still bottom 5 dps. He brings improved might and always shows up so we allow it.
---
If you have 3/5 you're already hit capped for affliction spells, *but* it seems that talents that give additional resistance to certain effects (i.e. priest and paladin have extra fear resistance) can be mitigated by extra hit chance. Outside of those cases, more hit still helps your shadowbolt &amp; shadowburn.
---
That's how I always translate it in my mind when people say "I don't have time"... = "I have other priorities".
---
That's not the point. Maybe there were few things that were indeed different. 
---
My point is that if you were hardcore pvper and enjoyed PVP your experience would be similar. If your faction prevailed you would camp FPs. If it didn't - you would gather a group and roam killing smaller groups of campers.
---
If you have extra money lying around go crusader because it's the best enchant in the game and you'll be using thrash to raid.
---
Big up the lovelymages
---
The vanilla I remember had no xrealm BGs at all. And after that, I think the realmpools consisted of similar realms (not sure about the last thing though).
---
I mean, how are you gonna predict that in August?
---
Fury warriors should bring a shield so if they have aggro at the start of p3, they can switch to shield, tank her without dying and get her into position for the real tank to take over.
---
We do splits with 20-25 people and as a fury I always begin p3 in def stance and with a shield equipped, so that I have no issues surviving the first hits until the healers can react.
---
There are no official stats but i think people use some kind of census addon that works with /who.
---
Letting a ret into the raid group was the first mistake. I'd rather have an actual meme spec like a boomkin or sprieat, at least they provide unique buffs and have some extra spec specific utility. Rets are a complete waste of a raid spot. Go Holy for raiding unless you want to be a leech on your group.
---
Ret pallies are trash. 
---
And I don't just mean as DPS, I mean as human beings.
---
No it’s not dumbass, dominant faction are playing the game
---
Well it is entitled because you already have the game you are asking for (Retail) and yet still want to Change the game a lot of other People have asked for the way it currently is.
---
Therefore you put your own (already given) needs over other peoples "wants" (which have been given with classic).
---
I call that entitled because all you want is to take from the People that have asked for classic.
---
If you can't take corpsecamping then take a break for a couple of weeks, go to retail or just go on a PVE Server.
---
You even have a solution within classic and still want People to miss what they have asked for just so you get what YOU want with less effort :P
---
People Keep on QQ'ing because they know from retail that they get what they want.
---
That is exactly what the #nochanges People don't want because that is how retail turned into retail. 
---
And as you know a lot of People don't like retail which is the reason we don't want to go into the same direction again.
---
So just swallow it and push through it instead of complaining you could have made a40 man raid Team and corpsecamped the others xD
---
nochanges = some changes that casuals want
---
soon we will have BFA again :d
---
Haven't played retail since Wotlk. Don't intend to change that. 
---
If BGs don't fix my server, I won't be playing Classic much longer, either.
---
&gt;to have a half decent service right now
---
Then stop buying the product, it's the only way to get through to them. If I sell you dog crap in a bag for 20$ and you pay, then you're the moron.
---
With an adequate amount of foresight.
---
One line ELI5. A well known player griefer complaining why the other faction left them behind which is ironic.
---
If you’re being camped in wsg, don’t rez. Pretty sure you can cancel at the gy in classic. Tell your group not to rez. Cancel it and wait til the campers get bored. They’ll cap quickly and you can get back in and hopefully get a better group.
---
i agree with everything u said.
---
When you fight random faces that you never see on your server it doesn't foster interesting stories for your server community.  Before WoW went fully lame server communities used to matter, like they did in most first generation mmos.  
---
Since the modern wow player never experienced most of this they don't really understand, they pay more attention to who is trending on twitter or which streamer is big on twitch, instead of remembering all of their experiences and interactions with various players in their own "world".  
---
Character transfers are bad because 1.  It's blizzard being greedy blizzard per usual, and we all lose when blizzard focuses on squeezing us for money.  2.  It limited player accountability and destabilized server populations when people could conveniently go wherever they wanted.
---
Un'Goro Alliance are also savage FYI. Been level 54 for 2 weeks now. I log in and play about 15 minutes every night before I ragequit.
---
There are no private servers featuring the original talents though. Launch talents were extremely jank compared to 1.12 ones
---
Ah, thank you
---
What if I don’t have a guild or friends to group up, can I still play with randoms?
---
Imagine citing this data unironically as official
---
Yes it is actually quite hilarious.
---
I find it totally overexaggurated really. As if a whole game is gonna die because of a couple of severly imbalanced Servers...
---
Also Actiblizz is gonna go bankrupt... xD
---
The rootshaper mobs in WC almost 3 shot my lvl 20 warrior on LH. In classic I can tank 3 at the same time.. definitely miss that difficulty at times.
---
They changed it in the post. Possibly it was a typo.
---
Repairs are a constant gold sink, along with consumables. It's fine.
---
Some people I know are actively fueling their honor wintrading alts from other faction with resources for the very same reason so I wouldn't be so sure it's going to be a severe problem.
---
I dont understand this, I simply have no idea why an alliance only area is contested why??? Horde dont have to deal with this crap. Stonetalon does not count as alliance have quests there too, but redridge level 15 area??? Why isn't trstfall glades contested as it's near south shore and Gilneas if you want to make some lame lore argument.
---
And gnomes are 5'11"
---
Get so rich that I can raid log Naxx (if I want to, I just don't want to feel obliged to farm).

Raid log Naxx.
---
It was bugged that it did not clear threat for the primary target of the fireball, was fixed on November 8th.
---
I'm a University instructor and I'm about to go on a 40 day break for Winter Festival. Good luck everyone else. You'll need it.
---
This was a mistake was not meant for your comment . Sry
---
Yes they use data from wowhead and wowpopulation which uses the addon "Census" which is VERY inaccurate and only gives a rough estimate in SOME cases.
---
Compare Wowhead and Wowpopulation data and you will see the differences.... They both use census so there is a wide range of accuracy in the data
---
Eh that's their choice. It's like people not going for rank 14 or raiding because they cbf, it's no big deal and doesn't mean the game needs to change to suit those less committed players
---
If only there was some kind of free software to record videos.  Could someone help me out with that?
---
what? lmao
---
TF is NOT dps weapon. The treath it generates is off the roof. You might be top dps fir the first 2 minutes before you get aggro and either die yourself or wipe your raid. You can take it easy yes, but that defeats the whole purpose.
---
You could give TF for PvP rogues but personally I don't see any reason to give TF for DPS alone.
---
Or what if... hear me out.. we let people play where they want to and it that makes it worse for the Honor farmers I don’t really care.
---
Paid character transfers will worsen the imbalance on PVP servers though.
---
Except that the problem is what the modern gamer puts up with and is naive to.
---
I can not change blizzard's practices with my own individual business.
---
rip Olympus main tank too. It'll be hilarious.
---
Yep. I remember it specifically because I put in such an effort to get Warsong exalted. I believe you got 25 extra rep for a win when you queued in Ashenvale vs in a city
---
In bfa it makes sense since the game is mostly a seasons game and the bots are also much less problematic for classic even a month with a bot up is way profitable for the gold selling company
---
&gt; asking on classic sub
---
Oh boy I wonder what response you're gonna get
---
In blizzard language it means either KR, CN, OCE, NA or Eu

[https://www.twitch.tv/handsomelive/clip/AdventurousEnergeticFriseeWoofer?filter=clips&amp;range=30d&amp;sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/handsomelive/clip/AdventurousEnergeticFriseeWoofer?filter=clips&amp;range=30d&amp;sort=time) If you wanna see the horde coming to say grats lol
---
There's a bunch of materials you need to purchase, most notably 3 arcanite bars (around 150g total), plus about 50g worth of other stuff.
---
Then you need to buy stardust for 150g from a vendor.
---
The last step is 250g worth of mats for the ritual, which you can save by having someone else do it for you.
---
So you're probably looking at around 400g worth of mats if you don't need to buy the final stuff.
---
Premade groups will do that, but all it takes are a few random noobs (or intentional trolls) capping the wrong gy's at the wrong time to completely ruin a rush for their own faction, even unintentional. And most people are complete noobs, casuals, trolls, or just people that dgaf about min-maxing and rushing everything as fast as possible. 
---
The min-maxers are the minority and unless they can bring together a full 40-man raid to queue into av (which should make for extremely long queue times), they will be the ones getting salty all the time and ragequit as soon as their only known rushing strategy doesnt work out due to a few randoms, just as seen all the times on all pservers.
---
Please explain.
---
pretty alright as a warlock, undead with pvp trinket are annoying but that's what you save your death coil and grenade for. Only thing I'm really fucked against is a geared warrior.
---
So to summarize, emotional baby is crying because reality.
---
&gt;  It literally does nothing - there's zero packets sent when you click send.
---
Is there any place where this can be verified?
---
This.
---
Not true at all.the money is never traced back lol. They only ban the botted account.
---
According to your explanation: every single population-stat in this sub is *cough* bullshit?
---
About CRBG's I am split.
---
They both give less Queue times and take away from the community aspect.
---
I knew every single serious PVP'er on my Server back then by Name. That is not gonna happen this time around really.
---
Paid Transfers? Very simple :P
---
You make a raid --&gt; You ninja loot something (or multiple things) --&gt; you Transfer
---
You advertise craftin Sulfuron --&gt; you take the mats --&gt; you Transfer
---
Too many Options to scam People without any repercussions and anyone on you new Server actually knowing what you did... You can do this how ever many times you want.
---
Create a lvl1 char on new Server with the same Name and u get a free Name Change too! :)
---
Yes retail wow economy is already pimped out anyway because of the wow token and things like that.
---
Well nice.
---
2.4 didn't introduce batches, only batch gear somewhat equal to BT/Sunwell loot.
---
Whats wrong with raiders being able to get items for slots where nothing dropped or non raiders getting badge gear to do 5 mans more effectively?
---
You won't ever get world bosses for sure but access to resources?
---
you have 5 times less farmers sure but you alsso have 5 times less consumers
---
&gt;	*accept mediocrity because I’m too stubborn to let anyone change anything for the better because of my nostalgia* 
---
Fixed that for you
---
So no battlegroups? All servers play against each other? That kind of a bummer
---
They are thinking about retail bots
---
Well that was dumb.
---
What did we learn?
---
Inb4 lashing out at Blizzard and crying.
---
If you think shaman are better for PvP then paladins, you’re in for a rude awakening when BGs come out today. Paladins are far superior to shaman in PvE and PvP. 
---
People will be bitching about paladins non stop after getting steam rolled by alliance pre-mades.
---
Because it is a proactive move to better your character at this exact moment. Otherwise you are in an undesirable position that you have the power to remedy for ultimately not a life changing amount of money. Yes you are rewarding Blizzard but you are doing that anyway by playing Classic. The only way to actually force them to change is to unsub but that comes at the detriment of not playing a game most of us have waited for, for a long time.
---
It is probably still calculating just chill and restart the game every now and then.
---
It could mean that, yes.
---
Considering the pace at which content has been released so far, I would also put my money on mid January.
---
Dominating faction on imbalanced server has way less reasons to transfer than dominated one. So more and more people will use it, worsening the balance.
---
That's a rocket.  
---
To the Moon!
---
Is the nelf priest on a loot council by any chance
---
No changes died when the playerbase decided to continue min/maxing and exploiting the world. Demanding that Blizzard do nothing, not even correct exploits is unbelievably stupid.
---
Fair point on the alliance part of it. Skeram's a bit low in that department. :P
---
That is what I am expecting...
---
Classic will not be followed by Burning Crusade but by Battle for the Burning Crusade with all the useless changes that come with it...
---
Ive learned to never listen to blizz dates again and just take a day off on wednesday close to a release date haha
---
Or if you don’t want to leave but want to also deny them:  
---
1. Go to your corpse so that you can see the accept resurrection button
---
2. Start log out to character selection
---
3. On the last second before logging out, accept the resurrection 
---
4. If you do it right you will be logged out while alive without the enemy having any time to react
---
5. Log back in and you will get the honorless buff for 30sec, timer resets back to 30 every time you get hit
---
With enough people doing this the honor farming would become pointless
---
Players "How long the horde queues will be?" 
---
Blizzard "Yes"
---
Lol yes but what everyone is talking about here is pserver guilds getting it done so fast no one else will have a chance.
---
Not for me... Is everyone using the same addon? Details?
---
EU
---
True, but I also wouldn't mind playing with more casual-minded players and I think those are more present on PvE servers.
---
The fuck is +1 rule?
---
Obviously you have never bottles any game with a warden like system before.
---
But please continue on like you knows everything. I'm out.
---
Lol we will very soon.
---
Still reading them weekly. Still a pleasure, but has been more complicated recently as I stopped playing retail. But the comeback to drawing comics about classic is a real pleasure
---
Yes
---
Not both at the same time, one or the other.
---
Its called "very rewarding loot system" :D
---
A bit under 4' actually it seems : https://worldofwarcraft.judgehype.com/screenshots/arkentass/news2015/472.jpg
---
I don't know but I've never been shat on harder as an alliance warlock.
---
Oh he crit me better think about using sac soo...
---
Wtf just happened.
---
well Tauren can be neither rogue nor mage, so of course they are the least played race.
---
Yes you can :)
---
Mograine I would guess is about 60-40 H/A, big and active populations on both sides. 
---
Ashbringer I've heard is 50-50 and some surveys back that up.
---
BGs pre-60 will be full of twinks.
---
In my opinion the only thing CRBG conflict with is server identity. But people nowadays are connected via so many platforms, like reddit or discord that I dont think server identity is nowhere near important enough to deal with extreme queues.
---
Well I'm not saying "Bullshit" exactly.
---
I mean it could very well be correct sometimes.
---
But if you look at the data in one day even on the same Website it varies between 20/80 and 50/50 that tells me **cough** bullshit **cough** :D
---
NSFW???
---
Any melee getting punted is a bigger dps loss than running out for 2 seconds.
---
r/NothingEverHappens
---
Yup, you can solo queue and still have a blast.  Bgs are the best part of wow
---
I botted for many years, and I know you are an wrong.   But please, keep on thinking they bot in waves as bots run free for months making profit.
---
Lol how old are you?
---
you missed quite a lot on your map
---
It was stated from the beggining that BGs would be cross-realm, since that's how it was in 1.12, so there's no new info in here.
---
Also ja - es ist sehr ungenau und man sollte darauf keinen wert legen... 
---
Es benutzt /who (was maximal 50 leute anzeigt) und twinks mit rein rechnet etc. es könnte also  sein das die gleiche Person zwischen Level 1-60 3-4 mal auf unterschiedlichen characteren auftaucht
---
Havnt seen a single dagger - poor rogues :(
---
this joke took me a full minute
---
&gt; I knew every single serious PVP'er on my Server back then by Name. That is not gonna happen this time around really. 
---
would not happen without CRBGs tho.
---
servers are twice or triple the size of vanilla servers
---
Lol it doesn’t matter. No one has all the mats. They may have a bunch but they don’t have them all.
---
Oh yea reddit will always complain :)  
---
In the future, if Blizz decides to do a F R E S H (!) I hope they will learn from their mistakes and make a few good changes. One of them being, at the very least, release WSG with the honor system.
---
I've enjoyed classic a lot whilst levelling, it was a blast and lots of fun, when I hit 60 I started doing dungeons to work towards my better gear to prepare for raiding, and then I eventually went into Onyx &amp; MC with my guild and cleared it each week. The problem lies with what to do at that point, dungeons are essentially pointless because I don't get any gear from them, if I want to make gold then I can do mine or play the AH, but I don't really need gold so there's no point doing that, the only thing really left to do is complete my raids each week, level alts (time sink) and gear twinks (gold sink), but I've never really been interested in twinks and I don't really enjoy levelling alts now that the PvP has went up a notch. That's my problem with classic, the endgame without more raids releasing just isn't there compared to later expansions.
---
Retail is a mixed bag for sure, you have bad periods like WoD's lack of content, but you also have good times like the absurd abundance of content in Legion. I do miss doing all the end game stuff on retail to a certain degree, advancing to higher and higher difficulties and achieving progressively better feats, I felt like there was a pretty good progression, but that's where the two games really show their differences, Classic is about the community and the levelling, that's were most of the content is, but retail is about the endgame and the achievements, I think they're too different to compare at this point. My best time for WoW was probably WotLK (though probably wearing nostalgia goggles), with Legion being a close second (Legion's pretty fresh in my mind so very little nostalgia bias). Current retail doesn't really interest me, between all the animation changes and broken economy I don't really enjoy it, so yes I'd say I've have more fun with Classic than with current retail, but I've certain had more fun with retail as a whole over classic, since I've experienced everything from TBC to the start of BfA, that's a lot of good times.
---
Or the right time to use the [Light Of Elune ](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5816/light-of-elune)
---
/use pvp trinket 
---
/Cast [mod:shift] wotf 
---
On my phone currently so formatting might be off
---
Basically 5 more invent spots for me I’ll take it.
---
Currently rocking 2x Deathbringer on my human warr without edgemasters. I have so much rage that I actively have to stop attacking in many fights because I will just over aggro. The slow swing timer let's me queue up HS and almost always still have rage to use Bloodthirst or WW. The damage is unreal sometimes.
---
I agree that it's not a wrong way to play the game, but the sad thing is that with the min-maxing being the prevelant way to play it effectively hinders the other ways of playing (you have harder to get groups etc. and even if you can you dont want to feel like you are a burden to others). So even if you dont NEED to min-max the culture makes it very hard to resist.
---
Failure? They succeeded in recreating the EXACT system for vanilla. Exactly the thing that people wanted. They couldn't have expected that people are much bigger assholes than 15 years ago...
---
That's why you make your own decisions on who you play with:
---
you either play top end and deal with loot funneling for the sake of min-max progress, or;
---
you join a lesser guild that still kills stuff (because literally everyone can), that still attempts to funnel gear because they copy people and don't apply any thought, or;
---
you join a guild that kills stuff and just uses something like EPGP or /roll for loot.
---
Hint: avoid the second option.
---
"I'm an adult, I don't have time to play game much, I have real life, I cry irl when I get ganked."
---
This is a very tired meme at this point.
---
I have zero idea how any of this maintenance works, or what they have to do to implement bgs, but this seems little long for just a patch...
---
Chests just suck and that's all it had unfortunately.
---
One solution from back in the day was simple and probably easier to accomplish now. Share your account. With modern Remote Desktop software being more capable it’s even easier to do in a way that to Blizzard just looks like someone no-lifing the game 24/7. 
---
The honor system is terribly designed. Honor points points weren’t better but at least were transparent and more easily tuned.
---
I mean it was your choice to have kids.
---
I can give examples of what I currently do to achieve exactly what I mentioned.
---
I have Engineering on my 60 Mage. Sappers hover at around a 1.2g profit margin. It takes ages to craft a bunch, but they are consistent income. I don't usually craft them nowadays, but I know they're profitable enough to cover weekly respecs. An even better market IMO is the Engineering BoE items. Stuff like rocket helms, reflectors, rocket boots, green lenses, trinkets, and recombobulators. They sell and have some crazy margins on them.
---
I also have 300 Alchemy on my Warrior alt, cause why not. Most raid/PvP potions profit anywhere from 40-80s *each*. It's not uncommon to collect 50 to 100g *profit* just from crafting/auctioning at prime time once a day. Arcanite Transmute adds 25-30g profit/week. TSM is required if you want to be efficient with Alchemy. And I know TONS of people do this already, but it's still profitable (at least it is on my high pop pvp server).
---
I'm not here to debate whether the 50g respec should be changed. It doesn't matter what I think regarding that issue since the goal of Classic was never to recreate the 2004 game with QoL changes thrown into it. Any amount of reasoning one way or the other almost certainly isn't going to result in Blizzard making any actual changes to respec costs.
---
Yeah, my memory was not good at this either. I recently got my alt to 60 and I found out that I could save 100g off regular epic mount through bying it on my main (rank 3+)  then tradeing it to my alt.
---
How do you know that?
---
Twice or triple the size is not actually that much more. I knew a lot of serious pvp'ers on my Server and regularly saw them. I very well think the same would happen because you would Queue together over and over again.
---
Even in the middle of the night. Where a lot of People are offline.
---
I think you are wrong. 
---
It would defenitely happen!
---
What’s smarter to have on an alt for pure gold making - mining or enchanting for DEing?
---
I actually do recall something about this. Can't find any notes regarding it but it's the reason there were always a couple of people at the out of city BG instance portals. I believe it was to encourage people to leave the cities.
---
Paid server transfer does not equal paid faction change. That was never a thing in vanilla. It came in 2009.
---
Imagine thinking PVP is better with 45/55 Ally horde ratio instead of 30/70.
---
Enhancement and Moonkin are a lot more than 50 DPS worse than a Mage, Rogue, Warlock, Hunter, or Warrior.
---
Get one level so that you can get into AV. PvP the first week because it’s cool to live the release, then get back to levelling once you get frustrated by high lvl rogues handing your arse over to you.
---
Man, I get so sad when you say "dal rends still". I don't even have dal'rends yet. Struggling with my 20th UBRS run or so. Never seen MH. Seen OH once and lost the need roll to a fucking indifferent warrior...
---
Actually, the lions are more often scavengers than hyenas. In nature, ALL predators are scavengersas well. A pack of hyenas will kill prey, then get driven off by a lion. And, the hyenas actually look out for each other.
---
I mean it is just like real life.
---
I still know all the People that seriously Play WoW even though I now know 3-4 times the amount of People I used to 15 years ago
---
What's the alternative? All alliance players stop playing?
---
That's a lot of damage.
---
Shout out to bigdaddychad the gnome lock on faerlina who never leaves the crater and camps the fp unless youre 60, then he just runs away.
---
I be agree on comment, why do are the people waste The humanity. We should be of the good humans people.
---
You are missing the real experience, but if you're okay with that then that's fine.
---
&gt; I do get why people like PvP
---
Evidently you made the correct choice then.  Live happy in your ignorance.
---
Honestly I have no idea because I don’t focus on this and don’t mesure it: I am not a dedicated damage dealer.
---
On most fights I will judge light/wisdom because I’m the melee paladin so it’s easier for me to do that and I will cast a few flash of lights when I can (knocked back or during a flame strike...stuff like that) - I also don’t always have sanctity up because it’s not always useful for my group. I try to group up with Disc priest or other paladins for that.
---
On our last Golemagg fight I was number 20 on the damage meter (I asked by curiosity) but I didn’t spent the full fight dealing damage.
---
It's rule, but one more, so it's like 2 rule.
---
(Real answer: If you win an item then you won't be able to roll against people who haven't gotten an item that raid yet. It's so that everyone have a higher chance of getting something instead of one person getting everything because he's super lucky)
---
We have known this since before release...
---
Just to be clear, did you advertise it as MS &gt; OS +1, or did you just assume people would understand?
---
Damn I wish they took a much more "horizontal" expansion approach. I wish they'd have gradually and organically  added to and fleshed out the existing world instead of just piling on the next zones to go to. The interconnected sprawl is integral to what made it feel alive and appealing in the first place.
---
Modifier macro. 
---
 #showtooltip
---
/cast [nomod] Name of Trinket;[mod:alt] Will of the Forsaken
---
Put whichever modifier you want on there. Note that the control key is "ctrl"
---
I'm not certain if there's a space after the semicolon. Play around with it until you get it to work. When working properly it will also change the icon on the bar when you press the modifier.
---
You should be generating more rage than you can spend when you're tanking multiple mobs without CC so I leave it out.
---
Did you just explain something in under two minutes?
---
I love you.
---
There are two different ways the statistics are obtained, and it varies from one site to another which is used:
---
- Characters registered with the census addon
---
- Characters registered when raidlogs are uploaded to classic.warcraftlogs.com
---
Both methods are far from perfect and these sites should be taken with a mountain of salt.
---
Blizzard broke the census addon a couple of months ago and everyone stopped using it. Then it was fixed after a while but almost nobody picked it back up, so now the statistics are gleaned from so few data submissions that they're largely irrelevant. If there's two people on one faction uploading data and one on the other, it'll make the server look wildly imbalanced. On some of these sites, some servers/factions show 0 players because there's just nobody uploading. Other servers have stretches of days on end where nobody uploads.
---
The raidlog method is a bit more reliable because many guilds upload their logs, but it still only registers people who are actually in the raids whose logs get uploaded. Also, it has always been known that a larger percentage of horde guilds upload their logs than alliance because horde melees are the ones who break DPS records. I would venture to guess that 75% of horde guilds do it and 50% of alliance. This makes the statistics skewed.
---
The closest thing you'll find to the truth is the [Wowhead server population article](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community) from a few months back. That was when Classic was new and a lot of people uploaded census data because everyone wanted to see the faction balances. The stats will have shifted somewhat since then because it was three months ago, but they're still likely to be more accurate than anything you'll find today. It was highly accurate then, and aside from servers like Flamelash where everything imploded, most servers haven't gone through huge population changes.
---
You were always able to do PvP -&gt; PvE, but you couldn't do PvE -&gt; PvP.
---
No what crazy is that he's been doing them [nearly every week for 13 years](http://www.darklegacycomics.com/archive)
---
Earthfury?
---
Let's be real - the playing field IS even, nobody wants artificial restrictions on things that are part of the game..     
---
You either invest time and have wbuffs and flasks or you slack and you don't have anything.     
---
You either ride solo to the raid and die on the way and loose buffs or you coordinate multiple guilds at the same time if entrances are being massively camped.
---
Obviously you don't understand that basic gold farming bots are not the same as aimbotting.
---
&gt; Being in an extremely well organised hardcore pvp guild was always fun regardless of the horde - alliance ratio.
---
I'm not saying it can't be fun to you. But on the other hand, there's this old saying: *nine out of ten people think bullying is fun for everyone*.
---
The simple fact is that some servers like Flamelash and Heartseeker have completely gone overboard and become *nearly* unplayable for one faction. It's not just ganks. It's that you can't do anything out in the world because nobody can contest farming spots, you can nearly not raid without investing 1:30 hours more, and you can't even go to a capital from a contested territory because everything is KoS in their own capital.
---
And without new players and max level players, there is no way to contest anything from a faction that outnumbers you 10 to 1 everywhere.
---
There's already a sheer difference in quantity compared to Vanilla. Just by increasing the maximum player size for each server without increasing the size of the playground, they created an issue. Imagine you put two lonely football players on a normal football field, and then the enemy team is four times it's usual size.
---
And you're advocating that the two players getting their ass kicked is *fun*?
---
So how would you want to determine which one is used? Lots of things are possible you just have to decide what you actually want. And a tip, "the macro choosing the best one" isn't an option.
---

Why don’t you go... I dunno... level up instead of making fake ass hole-some stories.
---
thanks!
---
Good thing you are tinkering with your own, but here's some points I wanna make:
---
1) Where are your buffs and debuffs?
---
2) Where are target debuffs (IDK, like Viper Sting)
---
3) This scrolling combat text doesn't provide you with information WHERE damage was dealt (ie. it'll show on the side, regardless where target is and how many targets there are). I don't think scrolling combat text is good, in general
---
4) This is solo play, but I don't know where raid frames/party frames are
---
5) Pet frame? I know your pet is not summoned - I reckon it's the same as target's target + target's target's target.
---
6) Map location is in the middle - way too obtrusive
---
7) Cast bars? I know this might not be as relevant for this class, but you need target's cast bar and your pet's cast bar too (and your own).
---
8) Fonts are all over the place. Your chat is using one font. Your Spy addon is using another. Your scrolling combat text is using an AWFUL font.
---
9) Damage meters? Threat meter?
---
10) Spy will grow extremely large - your bars are too high. Unless you have very low number of target limits, it'll expand over your chat as soon as you enter BRM. You should probably configure it to rise upwards (and remove that god awful top bar)
---
11) Your cast bar style (etched borders, rounded) is clashing with SUF style (flat-ish/simplistic). In general you could unbify your styling (your attack bar, your UI frames, your minimap, your cast bar and spy frame).
---
Might post my UI at home. It's FAR from complete, since I still haven't found the proper addons, but well... It's work in progress.
---
On private servers, 100%. For blizz though, I honestly don't think it will be as bad as you say. There are so many people across so many realms. Not every. single. group. will be a premade, there are just too many people.
---
I have no clue since I don't raid with PUGs but it's some kind of loot distribution way. Per Blizzard rules, raid leader is obliged to explain loot rules if the master looter is set anyway.
---
They may have long queues, but since you can only queue from capital cities or the actual bg entrances - it's unlikely you'll see many roaming gank groups like now in any zones that are less than 10 mins from a capital.  Yes you can join as group and have one dude sat in a capital queueing everyone - and some people will employ this method but the vast majority are too lazy and/or disorganised for this.
---
Combine this with the fact there will be a LOT LESS targets to attack for both factions out in the open world since more and more will be chain queueing bgs.
---
Also don't forget you can't join AV as a raid group - so certainly on AV weekends there's gonna be fuck all world pvp going.
---
Where to find these stats?
---
This got to be a bug because certain mobs like the rattlegore skeletons chage up hits too and can one shot you but the combat log says 4 swings
---
because the gear was basically given away for nothing and was as good as T6.  by 2.4 even the worst players had plenty of badges and could clear 5 man heroics.
---
so they didn't need the gear for 5 mans, they had ZA for offset/fill, and the gear that was as good as BT and HS was given away, cheapening the effort of those who had been working much harder.
---
Top notch RP
---
You often get immune from grounding if you try to poly/silence/dot/fear it.
---
Nice. Wish ya luck! I'm the only one who's really expressed interest as far as I know for the Scarab Lord run, but a good amount in the guild has said they're willing to help with that.
---
Make a level 5 bank alt and send him all greens and stuff you want to sell. At level 5 you can DE.

Yeah, ElvUI reskins all of your whole UI to that style.

That 30/0/21 build. I was some really dodgy resto spec before honour was enabled where i went down in to Enhance for the Improved Weapon Totems so had a very gimped enhance DPS spec.   
---
30/0/21 is extremely satisfying - being able to use my resto raid gear (most of it) and dish out 1.3k Chain Lightning crits is so satisfying. I almost feel sorry for the alliance when i'm dishing out big heals and big ranged crits every 6 seconds. You genuinely feel like you're turning the tide of battle when you spike 3 enemies that are all on around 50% and the healers struggle to keep them alive. The second one of those dies, its GG - the rest soon follow.
---
Creating a problem to sell you the solution. It was pretty predictable considering Activision is at the helm and it’s “Blizz-Like”. They’ve been waiting for this
---
Also depends on what lvl you're gonna get on the alt. If it's a profession alt, lvl 35, alchemy and tailoring are solid for transmutes/mooncloth. Or if you're engineering on your main you might want to have an alt that can craft bombs.
---
If you're going 60 then herbalism.
---
I dont agree with you on the fact to give PvE servers as a overall solution. There is so much things that could had been reworked without compromising anything about the old vanilla core aspects of the game but anyways . ii didnt read the patch notes yet but as a quick example of something that clearly needs to change in bg's is the 'free mana cost' buff during the respawn which fade after couple of sec .If they do not give a fuck about it then yeah , we gonna hear and read 'Premade are too OP'.
---
I’ve been playing since TBC and have absolutely no fucking idea how AV works
---
Wow, to think my friend got banned from this sub reddit for saying that those websites information were false. However mods on here are dictators so not super surprising.
---
Rank 14 gear didn't exist before far into the game as an equaliser to naxx gear. We still got that in our phase 2 from the start..
---
Easy to win world bosses when brainlets on horde are too busy screwing each other over...
---
Damn you people.. Now i want to play Retail just to be sure it sucks..
---
Stoped playing at the end of Cata, never touched it after..
---
Right now in Classic i'm only raid loggin on my main and 0 desire to lvl an alt in my shitty realm, so i'll give retail a shot!
---
Is it possible to level from 1 to maxlevel? Or do we start at 60 or some dumb shit? Do people still do dungeons like RFC?
---
I do the same I start playing guitar or have a smoke and coffee and laugh my ass off when I come back and they still their wasting their time
---
Hard to get XP in a 5 min baserace
---
The BGs are actually already in the game and just need to be activated through a server restart. The 8 hour downtown is to implement the long awaited key ring, as well as to build hype by opening servers at primetime so everybody has an equal opportunity to get stuck in queue.
---
At work, so not going too in depth with it or searching too hard. But from a quick Google search, the first result "Bots can read maps. They go from coordinates to coordinates and scan around with bliz's apis for nodes. They attach to the process (wow) and/or inject and read the memory used by that process to find whatever it is that they're looking for (nodes, fishing pools, mobs)."
---
Obviously not a very technical answer. But yes, bots inject. Maybe not all of them do, but a majority of the "good" ones do
---
CD is per character, cost is per character as well.
---
Should be all good now; I also inflated the Armour value a bit further, so its much clearer that we should opt for Plate items in PVP, even at the cost of our healing output
---
So, dumb question. When you transfer do you get to bring all of your gold and whatnot with you?
---
The reason why. Is because in MC especially, a lot of the trash has cleave or mechanics that hurt melee. And if you are a healer bashing you aren’t healing your raid, you are probably taking some damage. And your staff dps is not a help at all. In the grand scheme of things, you are basically getting carried through MC. Also 100% mana? Rank 3 HT is fast enough to beat a lot of other classes heals. It honestly feels like you aren’t trying, even if you are 100% over healing and no mana at the end of the fight, atleast you can learn how to better time you heals. But 100% mana seems like you didn’t even bother trying. Maybe you are right and you have way to many healers. If you have 11-13 healers in MC that’s too many
---
That's hella effort m8
---
As a rogue I kept all my keys just cause a filled keyring is cool
---
The answer is simple: C.R.E.A.M.
---
No one was playing with that stupid addon back then. No one.
---
Imo wow classic is more complex tho. You have 30 spells to choose from. In ESO you have 10.
---
I have talking about animations and how the spells feel and look.
---
that's the joke you cringe
---
Not sure if the matchmaking will be trying to match premades against premades.
---
&gt; Find appropriate server matches, where the faction ratios are the opposite and merge them. 
---
This is how I know you haven't actually put any thought into what you're saying
---
I'm still not clear how it's Blizzard's fault that people chose more of one faction than the other to play.
---
I think AV is where it will be the most fun as no one is going to get a 40an raid group going, but the smaller ones will be mainly premade groups.
---
Cool! Now let me just open a ticket and wait 3 and a half days for them to tell me they are going to do nothing about it.
---
Yes, I've seen this guide before.
---
However it looks like more a generalised PVP gear list that is suitable for all specs. I'm looking mainly for fire gear only, for a POM spec.
---
Thanks anyway though :).
---
Only worth if you have someone to carry you throughout the quest.
---
Apparently they want to change the champion points system but they have no idea what to yet.
---
Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying. It drop in DM
---
I hate cross realm dungeon finder and raid finder. However, cross realm BGs are an absolute necessity. No way do I wanna wait an hour for AV or WSG anymore. Those days are long gone.
---
Already have, shhhhh
---
You should read my comment 20 time a day to try improve.
---
All the open world mats would be overfarmed by the other faction.
---
I'm saying because Blizz wanted WoW to have a competitive esport element to it they ruined their balancing to try to force it into a game that wasn't built with it in mind. PVP was supposed to just be a fun side activity to do out in the world and not a serious way to progress your character. Hence no BG's and no Arena at launch.
---
Three steps:
---
1. Blizzard offers too few servers.
---
2. Blizzard doesn't stop the creation of the favorite faction once it reaches a treshhold.
---
3. Blizzard doesn't implement faction specific queues to help alleviate the issues of one faction dominating the other.
---
you are such a redditer... good luck cleaning that soy milk off your kb
---
Not even level 60 yet and already had Spy installed, I heard that beep at the end! Typical Whorde
---
Ok, ich danke dir. :-)
---
Historically, it's been that you spawn back in the area that you originally queued for the bg. 
---
So if you queue for a bg at orgs battlemasters, after the bg you will spawn back at orgs battlemaster.
---
Don’t has already changed but after a game session I really enjoy the map
---
No he didn't.
---
Yes this will happen, anyone trying to be serious with ranking will be in a premade and with the way things are looking, there are a LOT of people ready to rank. I’d expect a massive number of premades for at least the next month before it calms down. AV shouldn’t be as bad as WSG premades though
---
Type /spy show
---
Let me get to work and I got you! It’s on curseforge.
---
Yeah I guess it depends on what he plans to do.
---
You're welcome to make an argument against it, but blindly dismissing my post because of a single line invalidates any criticism from you at this point. I hope you do reply though.
---
Be a fury warr in plate for pvp at least.
---
That's why I left. PvP doesn't really add anything for me, I don't play the game for that.
---
That doesn't really answer his question lol, that's a frost spec bis list. Fire can utilize some of the +fire gear on the game, and I imagine the fire spec in general values stats differently.
---
It's fine, because when all the casuals cry about premades and that becomes the next 'problem' with the game - Blizzard will just bring forward the BWL release.
---
Why do people think this is a clever response?
---
Hope your warchief don't mind it
---
They did in Vanilla at least.. Over half my guild (I wasn't part of it 'cause AV rewards were shit for priests) got banned for 24 hours for rep-trading with a horde guild. They all queued at the same time and just GY camped each other for turn-ins.
---
If by PVPing you mean BG, then as a lvl 50 you'll be on the low end of your BG lvl range and you will not have fun, I'd say lvl and you can do some pvp at lvl 55-56 and actually enjoy it.
---
Some people are bad. But they found a way to get the good loot still. Thats the point lul
---
The fuck is that?
---
Can confirm, am the 17 undead rouges who killied him and his unborn first son when he was in the character selection screen.

The 2nd post was from the NA twitter account and it is coming Dec 10 in NA.  Also, you shouldn't really trust a twitter account saying Dec 10 and linking something that says week of the 10th.  I mean I get it, it's bad communication and the person running the twitter count didn't really think it through, but come on.  It didn't take too much thinking to figure out when the earliest the BGs would be coming (after reset).
---
As a lvl 60 mage, would Lasher runs without herbalism be better gold/hour than ZF graves?
---
I mean so is WoW Retail's. That's more about them releasing more landmass than expanding vertically or horizontally. If you make content in zones a-c expired because objectively better stuff is in zone D, then a-c won't be visited. At the same time you can't easily readjust the same old zones over and over, GW2 has done that a bit and even Cata did that for WoW (though it still added new zones, defeating its own purpose.
---
It's definitely this. I remember major change patches (new talent trees, the entire sunwell, etc) and they didn't take 8 hours. It's a stunt.
---
Thank u, i will be trying to improvement
---
This isn’t in classic when people actually fought it AV. The meta for this now it to just run right by each other and try to Zerg the last boss before the other team. This is the best honor/rep to farm for both sides involved. There won’t be any multiple day long matches like in vanilla
---
It's always nice when people trying to troll are really bad at it. Lets me know not to bother talking to them again.
---
Enjoy remembering me when dualspec gets put in :).
---
The population problem is one born largely of Blizzard's own incompetence, in a game which we already pay a monthly fee for.
---
I am all for CRBGs though.
---
I can see what you're saying, but for me the RP opportunities would be even richer in Classic, playing as a more or less unknown adventurer, struggling to make ends meet and taking what you can find to make your way in the world. 
---
"Them boots don't match your ensemble? Better than no boots, youngin! Now on your way before I give you a thick ear. And get them Scorpid Tails pronto! Honestly you can't get the staff these days..."
---
Something like that.
---
It's so obviously I shouldn't even need to explain it. The overwhelming majority of PVP servers are Horde dominated. You literally can't achieve it.
---
Not only that but part of the reason layering was introduced was to *avoid* server merges which were always a last resort option.
---
I am on Razoregore. Razoregore is a fine server. Why should I be able to transfer whenever/wherever I want for free?
---
Not all servers have an imbalance
---
Because this is reddit and answering in decade old memes gets you fake internet points.
---
But didn't they exist just to fix a problem our shitty internet speed caused back then?
---
Shield is actually good despite having +int on it. Lots of armor and block.
---
Snapchat is the cancer that is the cause for the mass widespread of vertical videos.
---
Stop talking out of your ass pls and stop blaming Blizzard for everything the community fcked up.
---
If Blizzard did all those things People would currently complain about "how Blizzard fcked up the Server by intervening too much" "they should have just let it sort itself" 
---
Like wtf People stop complaining 24/7 and other People ask me why I call you shits "entitled"
---
#go back to retail...^^^^^^^^^^ok-boomer
---
Experienced warrior tank/dps here
---
Got raiding experience up to AQ40.
---
Ask me anything :)
---
I agree, it happened to a friend of mine months ago and it took a while to figure this out.
---
Idk if we’ve ever seen 5 epics from Rag... always 4...
---
100g on most big servers.
---
NANI?!
---
Sadly you’re probably right.
---
If the dwarf came to earthshaker, then yes it will be more balanced. Not sure about the peaceful part...
---
1. If Blizzard stuck with offering too few servers, then yes, it would conflict. However Blizzard quickly offered more servers, even too many, without realizing that their layering efforts would then be in vain, because once layering was removed and the majority of servers weren't facing high population, many would be with too few players.
---
2. Great, so you play on another server, which means the server that you cannot create your faction on, will have balanced faction ratios. That's the intended point. Are there still going to be servers with imbalanced factions? Yes, but much fewer than we see today, because people cannot tell which servers have high or low faction imbalance and thus cannot make an educated choice before choosing server.
---
3. It's a less intrusive version of 2, which should have been used in addition to 2 to help cope with the faction imbalance.
---
I'm not sure you're correct on your idea of racials. Private servers were never completely imbalanced to the point of one faction being dominant (unless the private server was nearing it's end of life). What is your excuse for PvE servers with faction imbalance then?
---
A few
---
&gt; go back to retail...
---
It's odd to hear this consdering I haven't played retail for 8 years now.
---
The funny thing is, all Everquest players accused wow classic of being exactly what you say is the problem in retail. 
---
I guess it really is just a perfect storm sweet spot that the stumble onto for Wow originally. Not too hard to get the casuals addicted, not too easy for people to get bored before getting to the level cap.
---
They didn't set it up, but they are likely holding back any solution for the problem hoping that players left behind on these servers will end up paying for a transfer.
---
I have a tough time as an arms warr burning through your shield, make sure it's up. If I catch you without it you're going to have a bad time. While warlocks want to burn deathcoil early to get dots up and start a rotation, priests are kinda the opposite and should be saving their fear for a bit, as most warrs seem to burn zerk rage early and it only lasts 10s.
---
It's a joke plz look up 6 ft chad 5ft 11 virgin ty
---
End state would be finding appropriate servers where 80/20 servers are merged with 30/70 servers or 60/40 servers are merged with 40/60 servers.
---
Yup. My server has two 5 man multiboxing mages who just spawn and try and get as many kills as possible every 2 minutes in Kargath. There's like 4 others who camp the inn in spirit and wait for an easy target or someone that's low HP. One of them didn't kill me with a pom pyro once and then 2 of others spawn and pom pyro me and they'll just sit in there all day long trying to do that.
---
There wasn't Paid Character Transfers initially. You would know this if you were old enough to have played Vanilla.
---
Are  you pure physical dps ret? From what Ive read on some theorycrafting, spell power palladins can place themselves in top 10, even top 5, for MC. 
---
Im still leveling one to try it out. However, for a casual guild I dont see why 1-3 Ret pallies would be a problem. If you like your guild, I would try to work it out in some manner. A lot of guilds have the same mentality, and if they do plan to have a few rets in their raid group, they propabably already those filled with guildies that leveled to 60 with them.
---
I think it’s a combination of both your ideas, actually;  while they may not have had a sinister master plan from the get-go, you can be sure in this capitalistic 21st century that some executives saw the potential to profit from the current situation.
---
yeah I transfered with them to the server that is now alliance favoured and it's even better that's why I don't get the complaints
---
dwarf
---
I just can’t believe Blizzard charges the price of a month of game time to move a character.  It’s stupidly over priced.
---
&gt;If it hasn't happened to you personally, you can't be sure that it has happened!
---
To make faction change possible Blizzard needed to throw out all old world with Cataclism and redo all quests and rewards with possible faction change in mind.  
---
It's not possible to do in Classic. This is not changing one value in the database. It's huge change.
---
My bad, sir.
---
That's exactly what I'm doing. Stockpile and sell it on Tuesdays for maximum profit. The briarthorn is usually pretty decent as well.
---
Earthfury is nice, healthy pop was originally balanced close to 50-50 and now it’s 60-40 in favor of ally. I play horde and ally deffinitly PvP more
---
Definitely. I adressed that in my comment myself as well. 
---
That being said, if they choose to include a ret in the first place, they must also accept the fact that he is eligible for potential fury warrior gear.
---
its a pve server
---
100people is 100 people unless they can attack each other, no matter if its 20 horde and 80 allies or 50allies and 50 horde
---
We don't know yet. Originally it didn't, which made solo queue experience quite miserable. Eventually they added group matchmaking, but we won't know which will be the case until tomorrow. Also it was possible to bypass it (and group size limitation for AV) by queueing up at the exact same time, which usually puts at least most of the group in the same battleground.
---
It means if you win something, you’re done rolling. Which is fair since you have forty people vying for like 5-6 drops. This game sure seems to bring out people’s greedy side though, that’s one thing that’ll never change.
---
No sexy dance... Sorry.
---
Female Orc &gt; Female NE &gt; Female Human.
---
Thats the sexy tiers.
---
I honestly would just find a new guild, if they don't want to take rets, and you don't want to heal, just try your luck with other guilds. 
---
I would suggest talking to raid leads in other guilds and just let them know, you understand that you are a meme spec. And you can still contribute to the raid in other ways besides dps. Paladins are mazing with dispells and bops. Just got to make sure you are on top of that and secure a raid spot for yourself.
---
nothing quite like making someone elses life miserable in the little time they have free from work
---
It's great Alliance side. None of that annoying competition for quest mobs.
---
Can't believe we're still getting this nostalgia coping that vanilla wasn't as hard as people thought when they were kids. Get over it and accept it, they've had private servers using 1.2 talents and gear still wiping out MC no problem.
---
IF AZEROTH GO TO WAR, INVEST IN SOME ARCANITE BOMBS.
---
Excuse the fuck out of me, you don't think the male nightelf dance is sexy?
---
Right and those don’t exist in enough numbers.  You can get maybe two servers to balance out, what about everywhere else
---
Not really. You have to queue in the cities to get in BGS right? Please correct me if I’m wrong
---
Just PM me your in game name and class when you start.
---
I don't think I claimed I know what I'm talking about. I am describing the current situation with details of what we asked of Blizzard before Classic was launched. We asked Blizzard for merges back in Vanilla, after their exodus of Spanish and Russian players to their own realms, leaving many English servers with completely horrible ratios or completely dead servers.
---
We asked Blizzard in TBC and WotLK, to merge servers to get back a healthy realm population.
---
We asked Blizzard to take good consideration of faction ratios and server population before Classic launched, but in vain. We now have the same situation as we always had, because Blizzard did not change their approach.
---
Now we're looking at only getting "rescued" from dead servers or horrible faction ratios by paying more to Blizzard and your only response is "Oh my sweet summer child."
---
I actually tend to find that the people trying hard with meme specs are good at the game without having adapted the entire elitist minmax narrative. To each his own I guess.
---
Well, I can give you a list of all mobs and bosses in MC that are "save to stand next to in melee range" as a healer and which ones you have to avoid.
---
Not saying it's super-usefull to do so in a raid. It's just a way of preventing boredom, similar to casting starfire instead.
---
In 5 mans it's more usefull... depending on the instance as some are more nasty than others.
---
Also 100% mana at the end of the fight doesn't mean I haven't healed. I had to heal one of the tanks who's add was killed first. The time from when it died to when the fight was over was enough to get my mana back full. Also Garr is one of the bosses you can stand right next to without taking damage. But since he dispells all the buffs over time, this usually includes Omen.
---
Rank 3 HT is probably the heal I use most because it's often the only chance to get off some heal on some random person who is at -600 so noone else sees an urge to heal them yet. It just feels a bit pointless competing over topping people off because there's nothing else I can do to contribute to speeding up the raid.
---
The only bosses where I actually get over 200 HPS are Majordomo and Ragnaros. For all others I'd say: we'd be faster with fewer healers. But what healer would admit that? We want the loot even if we are practically useless. :o
---
That's super unfortunate.
---
You can 2 man jump runs depending on your gear. The issue is most rogue pre-raid lacks Stam/Agility since they go so heavily into Hit/Crit, so they’re not able to tank those runs until they have a good amount of tier gear
---
He said he explained the rules up front in both discord and chat and nobody said anything or asked any questions. I love how everybody assumes it’s the loot master’s fault, lol.
---
Contrary to popular opinion on this subreddit.. BFA doesn't suck... it's just not the same game as classic.  You play BFA for a different reason than you play classic and it appeals to different types of people.  
---
Some of the most fun I've had in WoW is pushing M+ keys early in the season with a group of friends.  BFA gives you that and it's nice to have something to do whenever you log in.  What it doesn't give you is the feeling of character development/investment.. the things that make an RPG an RPG and what appeals to a lot of us here in this subreddit.
---
I mean, he’s a hunter - isn’t he? He has the pet in the picture.
---
This is the best way to play paladin good sir. Focusing more on supporting the raid over dealing damage.
---
No... this breaks honorspy, not spy. Keep trying.
---
Shammy rogue can solo last boss and probably hydro in dme. I don't know about cockface mcputyouonthealtar though.
---
One faction bullying the other is the perfect example of Blizzard not adressing the faction ratio issues soon enough. They allowed servers to reach 70/30 ratios, meaning one faction would completely dominate the other.
---
Stop blaming this on players. Blizzard could have acted, but they didn't. Just like they didn't act back in Vanilla, or TBC or WotLK.
---
I guess we agree to disagree on the effectiveness of limiting faction-specific character creation/login.
---
PvE content is affected by racial abilities also, and in different ways. This is seen in which ways the PvE servers are skewed vs. the PvP ones.
---
forums?
---
&gt; A lot of meme potential felt left out? Where are the clichés?
---
Such as what?
---
You know this video isn't based on clASSic, right?
---
Doesn't happen.
---
No, it's terrible and there are no cool people there

Accept responsibility for your actions. everyone wanted no changes and that's exactly what they got.

Please, read the changelog in addon updates. No, it will not affect addon in any way. Update pls.  
---

---
ClassicLFG has been already updated with workaround.
---
Issue is, it only takes them hours or a couple days to tweak things. With waves being so spaced out, they only have a small window of down time.
---
"Safer but short-legged" is a great term for going the TBC-wrath route...
---
But that's also exactly what I'd expect blizztavision would go for. I expect them to try and finish all of the classic content a couple months before shadowlands, hoping that the majority of the playerbase will transfer over to the new xpac. Then, when shadowlands is in a lull two years down the road, release TBC and do the same thing.
---
Shadowlands is clearly an attempt to bring the classic playerbase back into retail... Dropping level cap to 60, and doing a whole leveling re-boot is a pretty clear indication of that IMO. And the timing will be very "convenient" for them.
---
Would you please give me your source for your statement that the majority of PvP servers are Horde dominated? Don't just give me census stat, as those are irrelevant.
---
No. Layering was exclusively introduced to alleviate server issues to help Blizzard cut back on costs, which is why they introduced so few servers to begin with. They actually thought just a few would be enough to sustain the interest in Classic, which is now completely untrue.
---
Sorry, friend. I do not.
---
Also, if you really want the best beard, go Dwarf or Gnome, pink mustache ftw.
---
So I won an auction for [Kang the Decapitator](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2291/kang-the-decapitator). I paid about 40 gold for it noticing it sells fro 100+gold normally.
---
I am a lvl 29 human warrior with 130gold currently. I plan on respeccing arms at 40 (or even 30 for sweeping strikes). My question is does the bleed proc from Kang get boosted by the arms bleeding talents? If so, I am thinking I might actually use it. Is that silly? It is great dps and having a purp is fun. That said, I'd be missing out on 100 gold which is a lot.
---
With Alterac Valley coming out, I can also get the Ice barbed Spear at 51 which is huge. I'll probably sell it. Thoughts?
---
Oldie but a goldie.
---
Small classic tidbit: the shadowmeld racial also increases your stealth level, so you have a slight advantage in rogue vs rogue; at the same stealth levels, you can see them slightly before before they see you, and horde don't get Perception.
---
Apparently, nelfs also have slightly higher base agi than gnomes.
---
Ah, that stuff does not interest me in the slightest.
---
The post says BGs are entirely cross realm. I'd wager queue times will be 5 mins or less regardless of faction if there is that massive of a pool to pick people from.
---
If you're grinding 15 hrs a day you should be at least rank 7 or even 8 by now...

Flask of titan goes for 72g

I raid as Ret! :D
---
...slowly, but surely, my DPS is rising as my gear improves.
---
&gt; This breaks Spy.
---
Not even close sadly. One minor part of Spy many didn't even know was there got nerfed. If you understood what the conversation about Spy is you would know it. The issue with Spy was explained pretty well in that thread, if you wish to understand what it even is. I had hopes for a combat log range reduction to reign it in a bit. Blizzard could do more, but they can't break it. Also while you were told Honorspy is not Spy, you should know it's not even similar.
---
Anyway, if you still think Spy is broken, make a thread. Tell the community, because seems like the community doesn't know about it at all. You might even fool some people, if Spy has to be updated and the old version doesn't work.
---
&gt; just as I said, crazy isn't it?

You do seem crazy but I see this all the time. There was a small chance one could have taken the hint and done some self reflection from my previous post. There is this type of people that the most important thing to them is their self image as a genius. Not caring how things are, but caring what others about your intellect. Correlates nicely with just as I saids, demanding apologies, victory laps and 10k karma a month. When you have high output, hard to have high input, listening and learning.
---
&gt; I'll take your apology in however you wish.
---
You are wise and beautiful. I did read your victory lap posts, and it's great that you know about Dunning-Kruger even if you don't know anything about Spy. Watch out for those dummies like me and all the others (not you) out there. Dunning-Kruger is not universal, it's universal minus one.
---
Sooo there were like 3 or 4 quest in AV that gave like 40-50k experience EACH on Private Servers.
---
Do you have any idea if those are going to be in the game or was that a private Server Thing?
---
I remember always doing one alterac when I hit 58 1/2 and dinging 60 :)
---
Because you can reroll for free.
---
Retail is just dead to me.
---
I originally quit back in Cata since I just couldn't really get with the feel of all the changes they made in the game. I came back in Legion and it just wasn't WoW anymore. Just about every element of the game was changed to something radically different. The game felt like just an instance farming game where the only engaging gameplay was in mythic. Then the classes just weren't my thing. I mained a mage from vanilla to cata, and the mage in Legion just felt like an apprentice who only knew one school of pewpew. Game really reminded me of Diablo 3, which I just didn't like. I saw potential though, especially since the specs were fun, but just felt shallow except for the Shadow Priest.
---
I tried BFA because of a friend and BFA was so much worse. So many systems were just thrown out. I was handed ten levels that were so meaningless that I don't even know how a AAA company could let that out the door. None of the zones were interesting to me, the Azarite armor on launch was just straight boring garbage non choices. I didn't even hit the cap because there was not a single aspect of BFA that I was interested in. The very best I can say of it is that the art assets were nice.
---
Biggest thing that stuck out to me is I had epics on my level 117 lock that I can't tell you where they came from but my previous main, the level 85 mage, I can tell you where every item in my bags, bank, and on him was gotten from. 
---
Classic is very brain dead on difficulty and most of what I love in WoW came in BC and early WotLK. But I still get on it, it feels like an mmo and the character I play feels like one I'm building, developing, and mastering. I feel no connection to my retail mage I played for years, but my warrior on classic, it's my jam. It just feels like I'm in a world and playing an rpg and I just don't get that feeling from retail.
---
If players notice that classic will become retail I dont think many will keep playing
---
Kang is the weapon of choice for 49 shaman and warrior twinks. If you plan to keep leveling, it's probably better to sell it since you'll get better options soon enough.
---
&gt;I still have to note faction change was in WotLK so your comment is hardly relevant also.
---
Because in WotLK they gave humans most powerful PvP racial - EMfH.  
---
This balanced things, because hardcore PvP players switched to humans.
---
Why wouldn't they?
---
It's based on what people will pay
---
But they did have 1.2 itemization, which is what the other guy is talking about. They also had overtuned bosses. (more health/armor)
---
That it doesnt go to 70 and the loot doesnt have higher stat on it doesnt mean there is no char development...
---
I see you never played a sandbox mmo. What wow should have gone with 15years ago instead of this trash garbage xpac system. But tbf, that made them a lot of money so I can understand why they did it. 
---
I hope they take classic as it should have been and make it a sandbox mmo.
---
Been there. There is this one mage that just arcane explosions everything while I'm about to pull. Can't get any fucking aggro. Always asks me to tank dungeons for him...
---
could I see one on view only mode please :)
---
Vanilla to TBC horde queues averaged around 2-5 minutes in my battle group with 10 minutes highest I’ve seen during off hours(like early Tuesday morning). The speculation on long horde queues is based off recent expansions.
---
Not to mention most players waiting for a queue are going to still be rolling around the world looking to kill.
---
Thanks a lot! Didn't know about this site - very useful.
---
Those aren't correct though. They do not fully diclose their method fo data collection, because they know it's very random and always incorrect.
---
I'm not pretending there isn't a faction disbalance. I'm saying the horde favoritism on PvP servers isn't as huge as you're making it out to be. You're using non-official sources and claim them as facts.
---
Sell it.
---
So they realize there is a problem and found a solution and sold a product? That’s the basis of almost every economy in the world.  What’s the problem?
---
Man, just read this and it's surreal to see how big a douchebag you are after watching your stream. You're a massive tool...and for what?
---
Won't make the mistake of watching again.
---
TBC and WotLK are widely seen as hugely positive additions to the game. That's 5 more years of classic at least. 5 years of not having to pay any content developers yet still raking in cash.
---
Deffo an instance or something where the fur blogs guard the gate
---
Your bis list is fairly similar, theres not a whole lot of great options yet. Value crit much more highly, robes of volatile power will be bis for chest. Also try to grab the fire gloves from MC, those have a ton of stats on them and a bunch of fire SP. I haven't fleshed out a full list as I'd say frost has better options this phase for pvp
---
&gt; The majority wanted no change. That's what blizzard gave us.
---
No. Blizzard implemented battle.net. Blizzard made short phases. Blizzard gave us layering. Blizzard gave us too few servers.
---
Stop saying Blizzard gave us no changes. They didn't. Classic launch is wildly different from retail Vanilla launch.
---
&gt; Blizzard didn't force the horde to camp ironforge for 24 hours. 
---
No, they allowed it by not policing character creation. By not introducing faction queues.
---
TIL it's against the spirit of the game to use addons to help deal with terrible, terrible game mechanics (such as blind ranking) :(
---
Ahh sounds cool
---
While people are still clearing MC and soon BWL, why would you want to go fire? A lot of the things in both raids have a lot of fire resist or worse, are immune.
---
I’m a different guy.  I didn’t say there was a problem.
---
In AV you capture graveyards for field position, and capture objectives to make the final boss fight easier. In the old 51-60 bracket it was really hard to tank all three mobs (like Drek and his two guards) so you want to capture the towers which will remove the two guards.
---
Then there’s also the mini-boss about halfway up the map you can eliminate for extra honor points, which in retail is the position both sides usually zerg past.
---
I don't think this is a thing.
---
Nothing quite like pvping on a pvp server.
---
We use Warcraft logs to log our fights. I imagine you can extract the data from there.
---
Accept responsibility for your actions and stop demanding someone take responsibility for you.
---
I know that and I don't really care about that.
---
If it was for that I would have had to quit a Long time ago since plenty of changes happened this time around.
---
What I really care about is how People no matter what is being done - always find a way to complain.
---
This is not even particularly targeted at you honestly just in General the negativity on this subreddit...
---
Plenty of People asked for the Transfers and now People complain about it. 
---
I'm not saying that you asked for it but the General 4/5 Posts are complaint Posts is really pissing me off.
---
Sorry I now realize that this sounds a bit too much like it is aimed at you. I'm just pissed off with the People in General... It  takes away from the fun tbh
---
Lol you need evidence for something that's common knowledge?
---
Get the fuck outta here with that boomer meme shit.
---
And you’ve just described why world pvp is awesome right up until you ding 51.
---
I never get 1v1, it's always a gank squad, or while I'm in the world I get attacked with less than half mana. 
---
At first I dot them, shield, fear, mind blast then mind flay. But the moment I have a shield I am stun locked and dead. I'm lucky to get a shield up most of the time before I'm stun locked. It happens so often my trinket is usually down too.
---
At this point farming for money on a priest is pathetic so no means of respec between raid and bg's. Sure I can farm all day everyday but if that's all I'm doing then it's no fun and no point. Plus getting to DME has made it not worth going to farm.
---
Amen brother. My bro and I wished paid transfers were in the first month so we could reconnect with our old WOTLK guild leader, but we didn’t coordinate making characters and now we’re all on diff servers. Would’ve loved paid transfers first month of the game to organize but now I’m in a raiding guild as the only Druid and now I really don’t wanna transfer anymore lol
---
I dont have one, whats yours?
---
I'll be honest , ive not watched the video yet (I'm at work) but the title caught my eye as I did WC last week. 
---
If it can be utilised as end game (I imagine there will still be some difficulties with placement and mob navigation) then it would be interesting !
---
I have 13 healers and only 3 holy pallies
---
Yes, I did it from lvl54 by grinding npcs for terrible XP in AV whenever a side started to turtle.
---
Yeah except you can't queue to BG's if you're in a raid in classic............................
---
So far I've picked up those gloves, Eye of flame and the fire ring from UBRS. But I agree, there isn't too much out there!
---
Yeah but what rank are you now? Or are you just gonna play the shit out of WoW and live your elemental dreams?
---
The majority of bots are using a basic script and basically roam a relatively small area with a rally point that they tether back to.  It's not sophisticated at all.  
---
These are the majority of chinese farm bots you will see swarming every zone.
---
Pro tip: For the Rend fight, have whoever has your UBRS key/ring equip it. When Rend dismounts and things are getting tough, USE the ring (it doesn't say it has a use effect, but it does). It will heal your entire party by 5k each and summon Vael (a red dragon) to help fight Rend. Trivializes an already easy fight, but could be helpful in five man if you're struggling.
---
I would play classic plus. I’m not going to play a new retail expansion
---
RP through gameplay. That's nice but doesn't work that well for either game. If you want that type of experience, it's better to try a survival game.
---
No probs it really is cool. Only issue is that is doesn't factor in things like the blink CD reduction on PVP gloves, but with a bit of common sense you can put together a decent gear set.
---
I am not camping the opposite faction, so what responsibility do I have?
---
I'm part of the crowd that actively asked for server mages throughout Vanilla, TBC, WotLK, because I played on a low populated server.
---
I'm not demanding anything. I'm criticizing Blizzards decision to go with PCT.
---
That's honestly more because GW2 has been a flaming pile of irredeemable, overmonetized, mismanaged contentless dogshit since about mid 2016 than it is anything else.
---
Anet in a nutshell: What's that? Back in 2004 our actually good game let you [freely save and share your character builds as strings of text?](https://gwpvx.gamepedia.com/Build:Team_-_7_Hero_BiP_Melee_Support) And you could make and save as many of them as you want and they'll be stored as text documents that you can copy, paste and backup as you please? Oh, and you've been asking for that in GW2 for 6 years?  No, the technology isn't there yet... Wait, it is? Oh right! Now in GW2. build templates! You get 2 for free and if you want more... FUCK YOU PAY ME! That's right, for only $4 worth of our Premium Funbucks you can save a single extra build template in-game!
---
And god forbid you actually point out that they've become greedy, lazy fucks because their mindless fanboys will give you the same canned spiel
---
&gt;What? How dare you not be grateful for this FREE game that's FREE! You should be grateful they're giving you the opportunity to be nickle and dimed by them, because it's a FREE game that you play for FREE for thousands of hours for FREE so they deserve to charge so much! Fuck you if you expect them to actually release cosmetics as in-game rewards after advertising the game as being focused around cosmetic rewards! They're hard at work making sure the cash shop has a new outfit bundle or chair skin every week!
---
But what else can you expect from the same kind dumbshit company that thinks it's a good idea to release lootboxes filled over a hundred low effort palette swaps that would cost hundreds of dollars to collect them all.... right in the middle of E.A. getting reamed by the mainstream public for their abuse of lootboxes in battlefield 2.
---
kinda hard to tell exactly where this is but this is definitely useful.  will look around for it next time I do pickpocket runs
---
Yes again - sorry if I made it Sound like it was aimed particularly at you.
---
Just pissed off at everybody that is complaining. This Topic particularly because there were SO MANY thread about paid Transfers and that we Need it especially because Blizzard fucked up in the beginning and People were split up because there were too Little Servers.
---
Now that People finally get what they want there is the next threadS that complain about paid Transfers.
---
Never have I seen a single post about thanks Blizzard for giving us what we have asked for for 3months..
---
Sry if I made you feel like I was mad at you in particular... Probably just me being mad in General :p &lt;3
---
Most common knowledge have plain evidence?
---
Oh I'm sure without an addon nobody would have noticed 5x the opposing faction at every important flightpath and dungeon.
---
If he had recorded it sensibly, it would’ve been too obviously staged.
---
Seriously the worst.
---
I’m expecting a lot of them to quit or at least slow down once they realize that rank 14 is un achievable for them. Reading this sub, everyone is assuming they’ll be first to be rank 14 on their server... well it simply can’t happen ;)
---
There are like 5-6 av quests iirc, but they do not give 40-50k each.
---
I play eve champ. I can lose months of grinding in a single doomsday volley. 
---
Multiple 60s. Tell me, when your neckbeard merges with your chest hair, are you still a neckbeard?
---
The population is the evidence....
---
Might this also work for HonorSpy?
---
Other than the massive WoD ban wave around BRF release, I don't remember Blizzard releasing much info about the number of players suspended/banned in recent memory.  You can usually gauge the scope by going to botter forums and seeing how many people are whining.
---
that's what i would say to people bitching about current wpvp but they would cry it's not the same thing ha
---
Then you need to understand it isn't blizzards fault that they listened to their players in the first place. Layering worked to balance the world. 
---
We wouldn't have the issue we are having right now if we had more layers.
---
Male human with a night elf mount is the real answer.
---
Do AV at 50-60.  Kill Harpies gain honor and exp.
---
They have already hinted about doing the future expansions depending on the success of classic. I for one enjoyed BC the most raid wise. WotLK only had Ulduar for me to enjoy. Once that's finished I think I will be done with classic if they go this route.
---
Thank you for the perspective. This helps a lot.
---
I'm not familiar with Powershifting. How does this work for a cat Druid? Is it just the idea of jumping out of cat form to throw some heals out, or into bear form to pick up an add, something like that? Or is it something else entirely? 
---
Also, is a Feral's DPS primarily focused around bleeds and DoTs, or is it instant attacks? White hits?
---
How much hit percentage does a Feral need? 9% and I'm assuming weapon skill doesn't play into this, correct?
---
FFXIV has an insane amount of bots.
---
Well what do u use?
---
It's not so random that both websites don't point to the exact same thing that most people are aware of. You think it's just a *massive* coincidence? Horde favor PVP servers, Alliance favor PVE servers, it's just how it goes.
---
How do you know they aren't shutting down WoW Classic next week? You don't, you can't prove it. But you can use reasoning to deduct that it isn't happening.
---
There is a Battlemaster in Darnassus.
---
Desperate times call for desperate measures!
---
How do you get honor points in bg as a healer ?
---
I just come to terms to this current meta. Still having fun playing with the guys, and that's what matters in the end.
---
There’s a couple quests in AV, and you also can get XP for killing NPC mobs in the mines, but there’s no XP reward for playing the match.
---
omg....I'm praying to all the RNG gods for a BRE to drop tonight so I can start hitting BG's the right way.
---
" in my opinion the super tryhard no lifers and streamers ruined classic "
---
I 100% agree with you on this.
---
I put in both the title and body - PVP purposes ...
---
Alliance boss.
---
Now go fall over and hold your knee crying like a good little soccer girl.
---
Some servers people give new players bags...on grobbulus I had a level 60 take away my 6 slot bags.
---
Gnome or dwarf both solid pvp options, dwarves are pretty clutch for rogue 1v1s and stone form is nice against wars to get bleeds off for vanish. Id still go gnome though, escape artist is useable in almost every fight you'd ever get in plus.... 1 min CD.
---
True, but that's only $15 million a month in revenue. "Sparkle Pony" minted them about $3.5 million in roughly about three hours. ((https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/USD25-wow-horse-makes-millions))
---
...and those waiting had active subs, so another ~$2.1 million (but only every 30 days; naturally).
---
Absolutely, that's still less. But the key is they can release as many mounts as they want and get even more money that 'just $15' a month.
---
Where as, with Classic, they can't do anything of the sort with out pitchforks being raised. - Hell, people are bitching about paid character transfers.
---
((Which I agree, the process is automated. Just put a "1 character per 90 days" limit on the transfers. But no. They (the suits) want Classic monetized.))
---
Classic plays a role:
---
* Test old ideas in the new game
---
* Keep MAUs up
---
* Provide a lil extra cash flow
---
The biggest is probably MAUs, because that's what investors will use to gauge how successful Activision is.
---
With the talent and the Wolfshead Helmet, druid gain 60 energy when shapeshifting into cat form. Powershifting is shapeshifting quickly out of and back into cat form inbetween energy ticks to gain energy.
---
Feral DPS in raids consist entirely of shred and ferocious bite. In PvP bleeds are great against mail or plate wearers while instant damage are great against leather and lighter.
---
Ferals should only aim for 9% and are not affected by weapon skill, weapon damage, or weapon speed.
---
Come to Earthfuy
---
Yes, your bank and everything. You need to have empty mail to transfer IIRC.
---
Yea except pvp itself adds a dynamic element because of the players you are playing against.
---
Honest question: you ever buy invisibility, speed, or free action potions? They all work wonders for avoiding repeat ganks and getting to instance portals.
---
&gt; Definitely. Will the horde queues balance out because of PvE in the cross realm battle groups?
---
Obviously not, horde still outnumber to a big degree. The point is that if *any* players from PvE servers are queueing (we both seem to agree that some amount will) it will be a benefit to horde pvp queues
---
That's fine. You need to take in consideration your context.
---
Heroic strike deals nice threat AND damage, but it also consumes the rage generation of your next white attack, so it will leave you rage starved if you use it early on.
---
Shield slam deals a lot of threat and damage, and when it crit it will deal a ton of threat (like 1400)
---
Revenge deals shit damage, but a lot of threat and only costs 5 rage, making it the best threat per rage cost skill.
---
So your rotation is about right.
---
What do you know?
---
You may as well join a server that leaves you on the better end of the big stick though.
---
69 years old
---
yeah i never understood people that enjoy getting ganked every 2 minutes. but if you dont like playing the game at all its fine for you i guess
---
Because killing it fucks over thousands of people who's only crime is picking Flamelash on launch, a week or two before they even saw an alliance player let alone knew what the server balance was.
---
&gt;I can pace myself and not burn out as easily on the most batshit crazy ranking system in any game ever.
---
you are the only person making yourself care about this. You seem to be okay with breaking the game for over 90% of the population because 10% like you NEED TO FUCKING KNOW.
---
I like you idea of merging, but adding wait times to log in would make me quit. Its the reason I took the free transfer off Fearlina.
---
I know you've had a lot of replies but I'll throw my 2 cents in because I've personally tried both with good weapons.
---
The following only applies to horde, I have no idea about alliance but most people say 2h is worse by a decent amount.
---
2handed fury as an orc with spinal reaper is very good. You can easily top DPS on trash fights with 2 or more mobs. Same with bosses that have adds. WITHOUT world buffs but with mongoose, firewater, JuJu, ROIDS, and str or agi food, I was pulling 500+ DPS on single target, 700+ on 2 targets, and 1000+ on 3 or more targets.
---
With deathtbinger &amp; serathil and the same gear as 2h(pre BiS+ lionheart, quickstrike, and onyxoa tooth)  I was equal to or below 2h spinal reaper on everything but single target. 600+DPS with the same buffs as 2h on single target, 600-700 on 2 targets, and 7-800 on 3+ targets.
---
All the numbers are rough, and upper end because they assume recklessness pop+might rage potion.
---
Typically numbers will be 20% or so lower if you're not using reck.
---
I personally actually preferred 2h because the rotation is much easier. Dual wield rotation is a bit more involved but still very fun.
---
You poor oppressed child. Show me where the mean mod touched you, lol.
---
Appreciate that!
---
The biggest thing would've initially not have let people transfer off a server when they're the underdog faction, or to limit how many could transfer compared to the dominant faction. That's what really sealed in the fate of a lot of servers
---
I keep hearing people talk about the neverending AVs but we're getting the 1.12 version so that isn't going to happen
---
This is the type of content that needs to be deleted.  This is just spam.
---
Yes. You can see it from the Burning Steppes.
---
Yeah but GW2 is a terrible game. They shouldn't have changed so damn much
---
I only played on weekends and made 60 in reasonable time. Have an epic mount, t1, and perdition. 
---
That said PvE server is a neutered version of WoW. You see a rich thorium node and start mining and be suddenly a enemy faction comes up and take a couple swings with no repercussions. Want a prime farming spot like saytrs or elemental? Be ready to share with your own faction and yellow names. On a PvP server you can kick them out. World bosses go to whoever tags them first. You’ll get a taste of PvP with battlegrounds but you’ll never experience the battle over limited resources or catching the enemy unprepared.
---
Leveling on a PvP server I p1 was not bad at all, the first week or two of p2 was rough but it lessened immensely already now that people actually understand how honor rankings work.
---
I got the onslaught but killed iny 10+ times, not a single weapon drop, no deathbringer, no bloodletter, nothing.
---
To get it done? You can farm ram/wolf for exp there. Also if you plan on ranking it's a head-start.
---
I just have the feeling things are moving way too fast. Everything was fine before honor rank came along and now BG's will contribute to less wPVP.
---
Why not stay at the "before honor points" timeline a while longer. I guess only a small fraction of the player base has raids on farm. The more hardcore people could invest in alts at that point.
---
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few... flamelash must be used as an example of blizzard's incompetence, hopefully if blizzard missteps enough times people will finally hurt them where it counts, in the revenue, and then blizzard will have to go back to making thoughtful games for their consumers.  yay.
---
Ya, I tried that. WHO was still busted (shift-click a name in chat and nothing  happens).
---
Finally, what ever the author did with the change to get around the WHO protections, completely wiped my DB of scans.
---
....so I just gave up. Wasn't worth the trouble.
---
Yeah, as a priest I've run BRD a lot (got very lucky getting four great drops on one run, please don't kill me, but have gone back to try and get the last piece I need and also still questing). It's a fun instance, people are always looking to do some variation of it, and if you have a good group it goes pretty smoothly, even if you're "underleveled" as a healer.
---
I disagree.
---
Talking about patches only, as how they go about this topic has no bearing anything else, 1.12 is a state that actually existed in Vanilla. 1.0 with the next 12 patches fully known is not.
---
Still... very few were playing with it then***. It really took off in Classic.
---
Inb4 keyring release and bgs delayed keyring style
---
So you are ignorant of anyone else’s plight and actually criticizing them for bringing it up, while you hide out in dungeons.... riiiight...
---
I'm sure a lot of people would. That isn't the point. The point is that a lot of people would _also_ play the stuff they released over a decade ago, and _that stuff_ doesn't cost them a dime to develop today.
---
Maybe it’ll default to bear form then :o
---
You should have more than enough time to dungeon level as resto or normal quest leveling as boomy before Phase 3 hits.
---
BGs themselves do not give XP until WotLK, which is also when you got the ability to lock your characger’s xp.
---
Would it hurt you to try to be original for once?
---
Think everyone is forgetting how unfun it will be to bring a non twink into a BG.
---
I see no issues with it.
---
Were you doing solo runs? If so pls explain to another fellow warrior ha
---
Probably because horde are the zerg right now?
---
It’s perfect
---
Nope. Just you.
---
I bet you felt so edgy posting that. pvp is fun - but there is no excuse for being a cunt besides "i want to be a cunt". I see my level 60 horde buddies trashing 30s and 40s who are trying to level, while avoiding the 60s who are outside of org gates looking to fight, for example.
---
Raiding Shadow Priest here, just got the Mana Storm pants as an off spec roll during raid last night. Would they be an upgrade to the Skyshroud Leggings which are pre raid bis?
---
It can fail.
---
Thank you, stranger!
---
You spelled paladin incorrectly
---
Okay karen
---
resist most of them, still not all
---
You really couldn't figure it out on your own?
---
That's alliance for ya 🤷‍♂️
---
Battlegrounds didn’t reward exp upon completion until Cata iirc. Maybe as early as mid-Wrath.
---
I hate this shit so much. Seems like 50-60% of the time they pop one. It's like horde get mailed 40 every day they log in
---
getting in a bit late here, but Im 2 weeks into raiding as resto druid (first time ever raiding as a druid or a healer). I've done a lot of research and capped out my respec cost trying to work all the different builds. This is where I'm at:
---
HOTW/NS is so nasty if you are doing any pvp, you get everything you really need and still have the ability to put out some healing in pve. MY biggest issue with this spec in PVE, was getting heal sniped, even when using rank 4 - this will probably be better once i know how to predict damage in certain fights a bit better. In terms of just healing - you dont miss out on a whole lot with this spec
---
Moonglow/natures grace/resto - This is definitely the best PVE healing spec for tank healing - Rank 4 h-touch is dropping for about 700-850 and i can pretty much spam this for the duration of any fight if needed - The largest difference with this spec, to me, is when you do use max rank H-touch, the mana saving is noticeable - max rank h-touches in HOTW seem to really tank the mana pool. The nature's grace proc isn't a massive game changer at all, but is a little bonus when you get a proc for sure. 
---
With one MC as HOTW and 1 MC as moonglow - I was able to contribute more to the raid/need less consumables with moonglow, but man all the bonuses from HOTW and the pvp talents that you can take in feral make HOTW super attractive - especially with BG's dropping today.
---
Dropped to sub 200g on my server. A lot of people are constantly farming DMN chests and jump runs even through phase 2.
---
Haha yea, figured as much :) If I hop on to wow more seriously, I might switch for a larger monitor too.
---
Retail is just an embarrassing dumpster fire. 
---
I didn’t think it was possible, but they actually found a dumber race than pandas to add to the game lul
---
You okay?
---
Mount/dismount via Leatrix Plus. :P
---
Flight paths are fine, and definitely don't need the extra ones Retail added to zones. ((Not saying you're saying you want more FPs.))
---
I, personally, was hoping for all the new models and animations. With options to turn them back to 'vanilla mode'.
---
((Though, I'd really like 'remastered' character models; keep the same look 'n feel, but just make them look better.))
---
Thank you for the input. I noticed you didn't include 3-set bonus from Tier 2 in your calculation (20% extra AP from Aspect of the Hawk, 110\*1.2 = 132 AP)... So it would be:
---
60AP (inc. 22 extra AP from 3-set) + 1 crit + .35 crit = 60AP + 1.35 crit
---
Assuming the same base DPS of 160 and 4.29 extra dps from AP (60/14)... Result is 2.68% dps increase PLUS 1.35% from crit which would mean a total of **4.03%**.
---
That DPS increase is 1% higher than what I calculated (roughly) from 8pc Tier 1 bonus. I got a result of around 3% overall DPS increase from +15% multi-shot damage.
---
I do still stand behind my initial statement that using 8/8 of Tier 1 until you get 8/8 of Tier 2 is the way to go.
---
The only people that were good were those who came from Everquest, which was a good amount.
---
Ok zoomer if it’s “trash garbage” then why are u on this subreddit? WoW Classic has Phases, retail WoW has expansions &amp; patches. It will never be a sandbox mmo, thank God. So just accept it or go play a different game.
---
The main problem with the statistics is nobody interprets them correctly. I’ve seen several people say “well, 60/40 wasn’t that bad, but now it’s 90/10 after the exodus.”
---
That means they can’t comprehend how awful a 60/40 imbalance even is. It doesn’t look like much, and at face value the dominant faction is only 20% more of the total. However in-game that translates to 50% more players in the dominant faction. 
---
Further imbalances make that even worse.
---
The dude seems like a tool, and giving the head to a pally feels like flushing it down the toilet, but both items dropped from the same boss he probably should have gotten to just chose one or the other in that case.
---
I fucking hate that people are doing this, but it's not what you say it is. People are just trying to minmax. If you can organize proper win trading it's simply the best way to get honor. If you are amazing at PvP but care about getting rank 14 as fast as possible and are willing to break the rules, this is the way to do it. It doesn't at all include admitting that you are bat at PvP or *need* to do it. 
---
That's like saying "if you do spellcleave you're basically admitting you could never do a dungeon the normal standard slow way." No, you're just trying to be efficient. Except in this case the efficiency is cheating
---
Save money? How? It cost them money to actually develop it. Rather than just using the existing 'retail method'.
---
Careful you’ll just be downvoted for hurting their feelings :(
---
oeb is better than bre for pve, why was he even allowed to spend on a downgrade?
---
55-45.. before all the transfers arrived, yes.
---
oh no, you got ganked on the boat? so awful.
---
you're aware BRM has been alliance territory for like an entire week now?
---
Yes, it's the same as in open world - if you're a member of the party/raid that damaged the target (and are close enough), you will get honor no matter what your contribution is. Since everyone in the BG is in the same raid, it doesn't matter what role you play.
---
In theory it's possible to not be part of the BG raid (originally battlegrounds didn't group players and we had to do it manually, and in later versions AV sometimed bugged out and didn't put some players in the big raid), in which case you could get more honor than other players by doing enough damage - same as in WPVP.
---
I am sure Acti-Blizz are very sure of themselves and will try another expansion after ShadowLands that would be backed up by TBC Classic, then if it and Shadowlands fail they would raise the alarm roll in Wrath and throw every creative force on xpack ShadowLands+2
---
I mean in terms of faction balance, not total players.
---
How is the game broken for 90% of people? All seems fine here.
---
How are you running MC so much, that many alts or giant guild or what?
---
yes, according to data that doesn't take into account the last 2 week worth of transfer with a ton of alliance refugee coming her.e
---
thanks for reading the whole thing.
---
It's a different kind of shitshow, but that does not prevent it from being a shitshow. I didn't "rank" in vanilla because I barely knew what I was doing but I sure as shit got my ass farmed for long stretches of time on multiple occasions.
---
Yes, but it worsens the imbalance on both servers then. First server has 1 player less for the dominated faction, second server has 1 player more for the dominant faction.
---
The post is literally talking about WPL. If you are in WPL you better be ready for pvp. There is a difference between griefing low levels and pvp.
---
Nobody thinks it proves skill, we just know blizzard is incapable of making a good video game. #nochanges is the only way
---
What does DE those green items do?
---
Nope, the leader queues for the entire group. Only problem is that you have to wait for a new match to pop up and make sure it's the same BG number for everybody. Sometimes an existing BG instantly pops up, if you go in, chances are you just fill an empty spot on the losing side and get camped at the graveyard.
---
and if I don't have the issue it's not the server, it's your machine
---
yep it is
---
If those pants weren't rogue only hunters would definitely roll 9n them :(
---
75g?!?!?! I bought it for 6g from the AH the other day alliance mograine and horde are always camping the vendor
---
Thanks for the input, do you know if the threat values for abilities in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bif380/a_warriors_guide_to_threat_aggro_and_tanking/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) are correct?
---
indeed. you were mildly entertaining during a slow day.
---
Any area that works in is a poorly designed area. Ground travel should have obstacles, npcs and possibly other players that force you to pay a little attention to the game.
---
If you want #changes to play retail
---
6.7k upvotes. I think a lot of people enjoyed the clip! It being low quality actually makes it even better.
---
Yeah, Ice Barbed Spear is so good and only like 7 levels later. Plus, I gotta save up for that sweet AV ram!
---
If Nef mechanic will include GUID, I will laugh so hard.
---
Cleanse, blessing of prot/freedom and heal, heal, heal is all I am good for tho.
---
guess i'll really just have to move on with my total non-issue . it has never affected me before and sure as hell wont now.
---
But there's only so much room to add new stuff to existing areas. Asheron's Call 2 did a lot of vertical development with new stuff appearing all over the world with patches. The result was that when I logged in on a character after 3 months of not playing the entire world was unrecognisable with maxlevel mobs clustered in each area.
---
I appreciated all the effort they put in, saw that current endgame players were invested, then cancelled my sub.
---
Well we will have to agree to disagree then..
---
Well I agree that they were no state that existed in Vanilla.
---
But the patch cicle is an Environment that very well existed and would be something to look Forward to.
---
The Original unarmored Mounts for example were nonexistent in Classic.
---
On private Servers I used to power through to 60 and try and get at least one - if somehow possible maybe 2 of those and sell them later on.
---
That was a huge incentive to Level as fast as possible.
---
I didn't have that and with that we didn't have the progressive itemization which I also really enjoy. 
---
It makes certain things just that much more difficult that it sets apart your average guild from your more serious guilds. 
---
Yeah I don't know really.
---
I am not unhappy with the way it is in Classic. I just prefer the "normal/usual" way I got used to I guess. 
---
Also the Thing about armored Mounts was a real bummer - honestly. I was very disappointed :/
---
The fact that you would just take the BGS instead doesn't mean everybody would. For some of us getting those 1v1s and the open world team fights is worth suffering through the ganks.
---
Of course, it depends how often one happens and how often the other happens. If you get ganked 95% of the time then yeah, it's not fun. There are however also at least some servers where the world PvP is decent. Ashbringer EU is one for example.
---
An add-on that shows incoming heal from other healers in your raid-frames. It helps with preventing overheal.
---
This subreddit will always cry about something. Don't look too much into it.
---
&gt;I just auto run in *as clean a path* as I can and then minimize my screen
---
holy fuck . Reckoning on everything
---
People are so worried about “omg the bag space is freed”, but your comment is the real issue. Keeping them on you for when you actually need them. The whopping 8 slots freed up isnt shit. But not having to juggle them or keep them on you at all times is the real QOL improvement it provides.
---
As a paladin I like level 10-19 because everyone else only has one spell too.
---
Why not?
---
Not everyone is a winner tho so it must be changed or it’s “killing the game”
---
Certain items have a low vendor price compared to what they can possibly DE into.
---
WSG 10-19 bracket.
---
Otherwise, there are literally 2 options. Redridge or Ashenvale. Take your pick, or just wait for BGs like a normal sane person.
---
It may as far as determining the order of who gets called first. 
---
🤣
---
Do elaborate on what emfh is?
---
I don't think getting angry at everyone &amp; calling them dumb asses for objectively proving you wrong counts as entertainment, champ.
---
Day 1 *of Classic*, not vanilla. Which you would know if you read his whole comment, where he says "Since day 1 People asked for no layers".
---
Take your own advice and read everything before replying, chief.
---
I remember in late BC and especially Wrath AV was literally just a pve speedrun, it was such an outlandish shitshow that it was even listed as a BG.
---
Should have rolled on a full server like the smart kids.
---
I think they're saying it piggy backs from person to person to create an aggregate
---
As in, you don't necessarily need to have grouped with somebody to have information about them, you just need to group with somebody who grouped with somebody who grouped with somebody who grouped with somebody who grouped with somebody who grouped with him.
---
Probably fake. I wouldn't put it past OP since he's a karma whore whose posts are mostly either low effort or stolen.
---
The proof is they said they added it and MAY implement it in the future, that's enough hook line and sinker for pretty much anyone.
---
&gt; because blizzard didn't want to lock character creation on servers to a faction
---
I don't understand why people keep parroting this and a faction based queue. It does _fucking nothing_ because you can game that system. How can you make sure you arent keeping a faction locked out wrongly? What if someone just creates a whole bunch of lvl 1 alts, are you going to count all those players? Or even lvl 10-20 alts? A faction based queue is going to have to take into account the level of the people logged on.
---
Guys do any of u run gdkp? Just wondering what for how much certain items go out for your raids. Fe staff of dominance was only 600g for us, benediction eye 850 and onslaught 1.2k. Crazy if u ask me
---
Skolde
---
&gt;I know that NE has the highest amount of Agility, with 25 and Gnomes at 23 (compared to Humans at 20) realistically will this make any noticeable DPS increases?
---
Got a feeling OP is into the min/max mentality since he's asking if 2 agi will make a noticeable difference.
---
So, does this impact the spy addon or just honorspy?   I mean, who the fuck was complaining about honorspy?
---
Powershifting actually sounds insanely fun. 
---
Messing around with talents, i have [something like this in mind.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVZVTMsfbztE) Anything you do differently?
---
Anything that has improved spell effect or improved talents, like a rogue with a greater chance for your poisons to not be dispelled, can make the spell fizzle.
---
Of course people are going to complain about bg, but BGs will reduce pressure in wPvP as some people will be in BGs, not roaming in zones. This will help a bit avoid the 7vs1 a bit. Reduce it to 2 vs1 maybe
---
The point is that paid character transfers were coming faction imbalance or not.  So why are you using faction balance as a point in the discussion?  They aren't making you pay to fix their mistake.  They are offering a service they were going to offer all along.
---
That's only because of the direction blizzard took with pvp.
---
They turn into Enchanting materials that net a better profit/provide materials for you to enchant your gear.
---
Just create a google survey and then invite based off the results. Name, Spec, Can You Attend.
---
That's like 85% of zones.  Frankly, the whole tourist run loses it's shine after first dozen times and I've been playing this game on and off for 15 years - I'd rather just get there ASAP.
---
&gt;We might as well get teleported to dungeons at that point.
---
Even now, who the fuck would say no to a Warlock summon so that they can make the journey?
---
If you are on super uneven population I get the frustration though, I dont have that problem. I feel like horde may have a little more on my server but we alliance hold our own.
---
We've been raiding for over 2 months and haven't seen a deathbringer, brutality blade, bre, spinal reaper, or even an oeb.  Garbage weapon luck across the board
---
I was thinking most healing addons had that built in?   I wonder if the classic version of vuhdo does it?
---
Oh and it’s blizzards fault that most players didn’t listen launch week when bliz was talking everyone over and over to spread out on the servers. But now that there’s faction imbalance. Blizzard fucked up, it’s their fault, they should change things,
---
Horde queue will be longer, and you have to queue in a capital city so travel time will be a thing. Even if horde queue is only 5 mins there's not much point roaming. It depends how things shake out.
---
these people have been doing just that for years now, they are not the kind of person to quit the game as for a lot of them this is the 3rd or even 4th time they have gone through the "vanilla experience". If you think its boring for them you would be surprised. Some people just find playing "efficiently" fun
---
Just tank or heal dungeons to level
---
Nope Master looter is Master looter. He can do whatever he wants with the gear.
---
But it also means that if someone on your guild collect data from a raid/group, he'll share those data with you ? Like one of your guildmate premade with another guild, you'll have data from both guilds at the end ?
---
For everything people hate about retail, what I will say is that Paid Transfers are probably the single biggest driver for what harmed vanilla and make retail what it is today.
---
Paid transfers accelerated the "death" of servers by allowing the top players on servers to transfer to higher pop servers and better guilds.  Those servers left behind would atrophy until a solution had to be created to allow them to play the game in some semblance of an acceptable manner.  That solution led to both the dungeon queue and LFG system.  The amount of small servers not being able to raid as easily and people missing content helped push for the LFR system.
---
For as much as people love BC as the "definitive vanilla experience", BC was also the by product of a huge exodus from smaller servers to bigger servers during naxx.  BC had the most difficult entry into most raids as there was a constant requirement to do the older raids to attune for the new ones.  With many servers losing so many people during the Naxx exodus, some servers would barely get into Gruul/Magtheridon to be able to progress further.  It wasn't until the removal of the attunements that more people were able to do Hyjal/BT, which were honestly easier than SSC/TK.  Sunwell had more people complete it than Naxx, largely driven by this expansion of the mega servers.  Raiding was "easier" for the top end people because they could transfer to bigger servers, but solutions had to be made to save the abandoned servers.
---
People individually like paid transfers because it means they can choose where they want to play.  The issue with them is that it creates other problems which need to be solved.  Everyone who is excited about paid transfers so they can escape whatever hellhole they are currently on, just know that this is the first step which brought retail into the position it is today.
---
Hello there fellow key collecting Rogue!
---
I cashed all my classic RNG when I got both rends on my 2nd and 3rd run. I lost my shit I was so happy. Now almost two months later and I desperately want to get rid of them for vskag and brute blade.
---
Same, feels like there’s more horde on my server but ally dominated everlook for a few hours last night
---
You don't need a tank for any dungeon in Classic unless you're 5 manning UBRS. I don't know why people think you do -- especially considering that tanks can't generate enough threat in low level gear to actually tank for the group.
---
Official forums are on fire with people no longer happy with their server. Have faith. it will happen.
---
Best comment on this *by far* in my opinion as a dedicated PvE server player.
---
Well it depends a bit on your spec, and what weapons you use. If you have not already done the berserker stance quest, do it now. 
---
I’m arms, if I pull two mobs I pop sweeping strikes, blood rage and then switch to berserker stance to use whirlwind to do as much dmg as possible to both enemies.
---
I usually stay in battle stance just to charge, and burn some rage using sundar armour. Then I switch to berserker stance to have a better chance of criting.
---
I’ll use defensive stance if I’m in a bit of a bind running away, or if I need to taunt an enemy.
---
It’s a good idea to make macros that will switch stances and use stance specific moves (overpower, taunt, whirlwind, etc.) using /castsequence 
---
That’s all I got for now haha!
---
who forced you to respec?
---
Thats right, no one did. Except you. Just cause one spec isn't viable in PvP or another isn't doesn't mean you are F O R C E D to change spec. Thats your call dude.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/
---
Alliance out number horde by 4% over all. Facts matter.
---
Exactly.  The only thing that matters.
---
At no point is that specified or implied. Try again.
---
Mages get all the love, let the druids shine for once.
---
Seems basically impossible to do with cross-realm BGs, at least in the bigger regions
---
To bad it's in gibberish
---
I like it and it's more fun that way.
---
I'll never top the damage meters and that is fine.
---
The core design of the game is what sealed it's fate, I don't believe I ever played a major private server that didn't implement some form of change to one faction (free 40 mount, bonus XP, queue priority, etc) that had a decent balance because the consensus is simply "horde are better for PvP servers" and that's how the majority play. 
---
There's simply no way to balance the fact that the average ratio on a majority of PvP servers is going to be 60:40, when one faction has 50% more players across the entire region some servers are just fucked and it only gets worse over time. 
---
Merges, transfers, etc however they are handled don't fix the issue. They just move it around. The issue is and always will be a result of poor initial balancing when designing racials over a decade ago and the level of knowledge we have now.
---
1. buffs and debuffs are below my character plate (i have no buffs in screenshot)
---
2. they are below the target character plate (no debuffs on target in screenshot)
---
3. i still have the text show up over target frame so i see how much i hit that individual target for.
---
4. Party/Raid Frames are locked to the top left and sized down. Raids take up a box in the top left, party frame start locked to top left corner and grow towards the right along the top edge of the screen.
---
5. Pet frame is below my frame, left enough room for my buffs and debuffs.
---
6. I wouldn't say its obtrusive. That would be otherwise empty space. Allows me to keep everything to the bottom portion of the screen so I can see the world more.
---
7. My cast bar is below my target frame, since as I hunter the only things I cast are revive/mend pet and barrage. If i reroll a caster I will definitely change this.
---
8. I swapped combat text font. Not really particular on matching spy to chat.
---
9. Damage meters go in the bottom right and mirror the chat, but smaller. I don't use threat meters.
---
10. Didn't know I could make it grow up, I will definitely do that.
---
11. My cast bar style is Weapon Swing Timer. Not sure how customizable it is besides changing its height and width.
---
Not at all.
---
Oh shit that would be a hilarious way to grief people
---
i love the rare elite portrait haha
---
Why dont you go and play league then, instead of trying to get people care about a game in a completely different subreddit?
---
Clown.
---
Most healing addons will only show your own incoming heal, not others in your raid.
---
That's what Shadowlands is setting up!
---
Yeah it is, giving a min-max response to a min-max question. Reasonable people read the post.
---
Swap to berserker stance and intercept a fleeing enemy
---
after a charge, swap to zerk and use berserker rage, use your whirlwind and eventually swap back to battle stance
---
C O N C E R N T R O L L
---
I hope that's a mistake.
---
I downloaded that addon, and not a single other fucking person was using it.  I ended up using slashfour, which just filters the LFG channel.
---
Class call for druids makes them turn into kitty form and be in it till the call debuff ends.  Even if you dont have it trained. We did the hole dont train cat back in vanilla and our 2 reston druids still ended upnas kittens 🤣
---
Priests turn there HoT into a DoT
---
Warrior switches to berserker stance and take an added 30% dmg 
---
Hunters range weapon breaks
---
Rogue teleport to infront of Nef and are Frozen
---
Pali cast BoP on Nef
---
Mage wild poly on a target (no LoS or Range lot). 
---
Locks summon 2 infernals per lock.
---
A lot of Reddit users only use their phone and taking a screenshot and sending it to your phone is a lot more work than just taking a picture.
---
NO CHANGES
---
A lot of the good twink BoEs have a low chance of dropping from elite mobs in their low 20s. Just running stocks and sfk over and over will get them eventually.
---
Love anathema.  But fuck subzy.  Dudes got literally no life
---
You aren't entitled to enjoy the things you paid for.
---
Every man for himself (also it's from later expansions anyway).
---
Does that addon work with any raid frame? My guild requires it for healers. I know lots use grid but I use healbot.
---
The servers could be 2004 sized and you'd still have the *exact* same issues with balance. Some people just aren't willing to accept that vanilla PVP is a complete mess, it always was, it is now. Offering people shit that tastes slightly less like shit than some other shit isn't some miraculous problem solver.
---
I got an ally story. Running UBRS last night fly into Morgan's. Two ally raids about to goto UBRS. Sweet. So about 8 of my raid ride with these guys, including a guildy opening the door. We are riding up the road, walking into BRM there's am open gate, and maybe 20 horde. Maybe.  It's also the backdoor jump. Everyone fucking alliance in the MC raids jumped. 8 if us stood there. Kinda slackajwed. Before just being ran over by the border swarm. 
---
So your experiences may vary.
---
You need omen of clarity and natural shapeshifter.
---
That's what you have though.
---
Good thing they’re not going to go this route lol. 
---
Maybe the alliance players should just get used to being outnumbered like in retail.
---
He didn't gimp himself -- a kodo did it!
---
&gt;World Buffs also promote a more toxic raid environment upon a wipe and discourage strategic experimentation by a raid team. Many of us know the feeling when an unexpected wipe clears your raid team's world buffs. The morale instantly drops into the cellar for the rest of the night as literally dozens of man hours of preparation are instantly wiped away from the raid team.
---
I was a bit skeptical reading but you are absolutely right here to be honest. World buffs are cancerous, we have people sitting in MC refusing to leave to help their team summon or help against gankers because of "Muh worldbuffs" Get a grip.
---
Yeah one of the reason I decided yo switch grom feral/tank to resto druid healing.
---
You get XP for turning in win tokens.
---
I mentally checked out of GW2's story for good after about the second? third? (ngl I lost count) pair of lesbians showed up.
---
&gt;  Also, it has always been known that a larger percentage of horde guilds upload their logs than alliance because horde melees are the ones who break DPS records.
---
That seems like BS to me.
---
Any decent guild uploads their logs. 
---
If there are more Horde logs than Alliance logs, then that is almost certainly because there are more Horde players than Alliance players.
---
Ton of ally go to heart.  Ton of horde go to flame.  Blizzard combines the two servers.  Problem solved
---
I would do AV for the quest reward. The weapons are good for lvl51!
---
If youre interested you should give it a try, I thought it was soulless and boring but so is raidlogging.
---
Retail gives you an infinitely long endgame progression throught mythic key pushing and you get to upload your achievements on a leaderboard to flex your epeen. Its a different game and some people like that stuff more.
---
the 33k quests were fixed in later versions of the private servers, still gave like 6k each.  But I don't know if those body part quests will even be in the game with 1.12.1 version of AV.
---
they can even so the last boss if you're willing to get boss to 50%, reset, endlessly run around killing one imp at a time, reset, re-kill boss
---
They usually clump all of NA together. They only separated them in the realm select screen so people could easily tell which were east cost and west coast for latency concerns.
---

---
They give shit exp because you're in raid
---
Well you'd want to group anyway so you can actually work together.
---
&gt; Our server discord has a lively PvP channel which almost everyone has a good time ribbing each other in rather than insulting or QQing. I’d prefer having at least a couple weeks of non-cross server BGs and think it would be a blast.
---
Our server discord is filled with toxic gamers.
---
see to be honest, that "novelty" you suggest, would wear thin, after the 2nd -3rd time I was ganked and couldnt play the game as/when I wanted to. 
---
I love playing wow, I love questing away, I love running instances, and I love pvping when I want to. What I hate is some group thinking its great to gank me when I want to play.  
---
This is the amazing thing about choice! I chose to go PvE, and i am loving every bit about classic. I' m not QQing about not getting to BRM, or being out numbered, or being farmed..... I'm having great fun playing exactly how I thought it'd be when it was released.
---
You can reuse the 250g for the final part, but everything else you need to do yourself.
---
if a realm is 40/60 that isn't "slight". lots of people find that unplayable, so they have quit (I know a bunch). If they have an option to transfer and continue using the game, they will take it. A lot of people dont want to reroll, and a lot of people dont want to have to deal with such horrible imbalances.
---
Also keep in mind, horde can easily shut down alliance gameplay by camping boats or flightpaths. Horde can always use zeppelins safely, and a lot of their towns (kargath vs morgans vigil, bulwark vs chillwind point) are uncampable compared to alliance because they have tons of guards (alliance have 0) or are in horde territory.
---
The game just isnt fun for a lot of alliance when they are outnumbered like this.
---
My account isn't even active right now. We raid on thursdays and it ran out right after the last raid. 
---
I almost wished BGs weren't coming already, it kinda forces me to do PvP.
---
Yeah but Ulduar is the best raid ever so that's not a bad thing.
---
Ok, I understand. Thank you!
---
oh, I'm not angry, and you haven't proven anything... but you are a dumb ass that's for sure.
---
Perhaps it also just depends on things like your personality. Most of my friends have stopped playing classic, with two of them enjoying things like mount farming and achievement farming on retail; For me that's something I used to do when I was absolutely bored out of my mind, but they apparently care about that kind of thing and aren't annoyed by the things that annoy me. Other friends of mine really like 2007scape, a game that's arguably more hardcore (at least more grindy and with more risk of losing stuff) than classic, I always found those insane grinds to be boring and the combat uninteresting. Seems to me it's a matter of personal taste.
---
Though perhaps I would've liked Everquest, I never really tried to get into it (it was a slightly before "my time"); but I do like the high-risk and high-investment kind of mmo's like Eve online as well so who knows.
---
warcraft logs actually has an attendance section. Its what we use its awesome. 
---
 [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/guild/attendance/475922](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/guild/attendance/475922)
---
I played retail a few hours it's neat, but classic is way better
---
Also ban-waves kill bots faster than banning in chunks because people will just say "oh you probably just got reported by people"
---
You can't say that when everyone using your bot gets banned at the same time
---
Cool, I've done the whole pvp server thing before.  I did it years ago.  I was always on PvP servers.  I also know I don't give two shits about pvping.  I played this game long enough to know what parts of the game I like and what parts I don't like.  I made my choice and I don't regret it.
---
Take off all your gear, die (drown if no mobs handy or alive) run back to portal, then just walk back out and redress.
---
WCL has an attendance feature built in
---
you wont get xp for winning a game. However in AV, if you are less than 60, and hand in quests or kill mobs like the harpies or wolves, you'll get XP.
---
To me, the main fun factor of a patch cycle is the unknown factor. What will they buff/nerf next. A patch cycle with every think known in advance is just zero fun for me.
---
The guy was talking about rolling on chests, meaning in a dungeon. They reset with the instance.
---
I read this wrong and thought you wanted to know if Horde Roleplay about Hydraxian Waterford’s. Left me wondering what that would be like
---
How is it not blizzards fault? Giving free transfers to the fickle alliance players on pvp realms creating huge faction imbalance was the real fuck up.
---
I guess you know nothing about Latin squares or NP-completeness. Sudoku is a lot of math, you are simply ignorant and stupid.
---
I can promise you that games like starcraft:broodwar didn't have any set choreography, the meta was always changing because players had to evolve themselves instead of having the devs spoonfeed them balance in whatever direction the devs thought would keep the game fresh and keep players subbing.
---
How is it like that at all? Taking a picture from your phone and posting to Reddit is less steps than screenshotting, finding it, uploading it, posting it.
---
Not really no lol
---
Sounds like a normal classic WoW patch.
---
Yes, you can enjoy the game without the tedium of PvP servers... that's what PvE is, indeed.
---
As a long time horde player. 
---
Classic Night elf cat form is superior
---
But yeah, for latency problems if I’m on a US East server and the host of my BG is in US West I’ll get increased latency. That’s why I thought they were in separate pools.
---
Is there a date for when we are getting the key ring?
---

#WITH THE SAME NUMBERS THAT OP WANTS THEM TO RELEASE
---
Vanilla had xrealm bg's starting with naxx (might of even been aq)
---
speak for yourself, thanks.
---
Yeah thats how I got here lol. He copypasta'd something from Twitter into ShowerThoughts (given, it was funny and new to me, but still not original content)
---
MS warriors can still do pretty good damage in raids, and should still be topping the meters. The issue is when pve and pve specs differ drastically, like if all your priests show up as shadow and your warlocks are soul link.
---
i honestly think rule 8 of this sub should be to ban anyone who posts this and nothing else in a thread
---
Lol. I'm just curious if its possible...
---
what's the problem you are seeing?
---
So then you just have to fear twice instead of not being able to fear at all :D
---
But what does that have to do with current honor system??
---
it was originally just your server.
---
Don't do this as the one being camped, just  run back and await a potential opening. Logging to maintain some buff isn't worth it at all and will further feed the cycle of greif. 
---
They will hold cc on you and prevent further advancement even more so.  Just res when it appears clear and go.  
---
Waste of time and I'm on the shit end of the stick as alliance on herod.  BRM is just the worst.
---
Get a krol and mirah's, get hit capped and start raiding. Guilds right now dont want you to do dmg. They want you to take all the loot nobody needs anymore and be ready for BWL. Stop wasting time on dungeon gear that never drops. I never got baron cape (pvp focused player anyway and have gargoyle lol).
---
Mine came with a Brutality blade at 57 during the guilds first mc
---
I did respond to what you wrote and what he wrote. He was stating that the horde were "chill" on the server. This statement is not a factual statement, nor is representative to the horde as a whole on the server. On top of this, I would very much like to see a typical play session by him 2-3 hours where is see these "chill" horde and isn't ganked. I'm not ranting, I'm pointing out he and you are not being truthful. But please continue painting a picture of the server that isn't there. /cheers
---
You don't have to farm this. The long way is to get the access. Card which drops from Mona outside and upgrade it at each machine. Should let you learn discombobulator and minor recombobulator from the final machine once you upgrade the Access card at each successive machine
---
EQ 1 is relevant?
---
My main was a pally and I haven't touched the UI, also I'm just bad with all that stuff
---
You never did something you didn’t like because it was the best available option?
---
&gt;Of you are part of the PvE master race and enjoy it more power to you but the downsides of being in PvE server are unchangable.
---
For sure man, anyone that chooses to ENJOY their time playing without having to be "prepared" out in the world is definitely having "less fun" than you.
---
You outnumbering people in the open world or attacking them while they fish is really "talented" and your show of skill is unmatched.
---
PvE servers = people that enjoying playing the game solo or with a group and get to decide when they want to pvp.
---
Pvp servers = people that need attention and go out of their way to make threads about how there is "one" way to play the game.
---
Go take a shower, bgs are out later and we all know you won't leave your chair for months to come... enjoy spending thousands of hours to increase your honor which does not show skill, but shows no out of game fulfillment.
---
Resto Druid here I use rank 3-4-8 HT  max rejuv and rank5/9 regrow the depends on what spec I am. I’m not sure if you can down-rank your healing spells though with that little +healing.
---
you can export it as a CSV and import it into excel or google sheets
---
it calculates attendance % automatically but is based on all logs. so if you have some recently join their % will be off
---
yes, I think its 0.5 damage per mana burnt
---
Felwood or around Dire Maul
---
yeah i'm not even sure why they have world bosses on pve servers, sounds so fucking useless.
---
Disagree.
---
While there is a degree of depopulation, people still go in maps to complete various collections.
---
Also, there is much less problem to merge servers since it is never intended to be world pvp.
---
The reason why some maps feel empty is mostly because each has far too many things going on, so people focus on few ones, and the maps are too many. This is especially true regarding post HoT maps.
---
And even worst case scenario, even if we take 90% of empty maps, it's still better than wow's 95% or so of empty maps.
---
ahh. Ok. I just remember being in a battlegroup haha.
---
There was no system for this in Vanilla at all so it’s extremely unlikely.
---
Yeah, even an ele or balance caster won't oom in one minute with decent mana pots. Maybe save for bwl but that'll probably be similar.
---
It’s not. Horde can’t get 2h sword skill
---
Water gud. Fire bad.
---
Where the fuck did that guy come from?!?! XD
---
HIGH POP server here. Last week a 5stack of Faps 5g. This morning before server restart 12g.
---
I’m aware that the majority of tanks are not privy to this knowledge, but if they exert even the tiniest effort to find these resources, they will find them.
---
/r/ThatHappened
---
if the tables were turned Alliance would be the ones sitting in Orgrimmar while Horde would have transferred elsewhere, if you have the numbers it just becomes so much easier and inviting to just do the shit.
---
Welp, Guangfu Xianggang it is, then
---
lol same
---
How do I repost this to remind everyone just had a few groups like this today and I’m really considering going fury
---
&gt; who the fuck was complaining about honorspy?
---
Blizzard's Server Engineers
---
Second this. It’s been amazing for keeping track of attendance for me.
---
Won't load for me.
---
Economies vary. 
---
I sold one for 900 and one for 700.
---
You can easily manipulate AV into forming pre-made groups.  You were always able to do this.  
---
Group meets at battle master and everyone queues at the same time.   You will very frequently see 20-30 people in the same guild in one AV.  That's all it takes to get a crushing victory in there.
---
My racial priority-list for alliance is:
---
Gnome&gt;Nightelf&gt;Human&gt;Dwarf
---
So my Rogue, Warrior, Mage and Warlock are Gnomes,
---
my Druid, Hunter and Priest are Nightelves
---
and my Paladin is Human.
---
Remember that awful chat lag from a few weeks ago that sometimes would have typed messages take over 5 minutes to be visible by anybody? That was caused by the surge of people using HonorSpy and how it communicated/shared info at the time.  The maker already changed how the addon worked, this is preventing that from ever becoming an issue again.
---
That dude is absolute dog shit at the game. Killed a him a bunch since he has a note on my KoS that he attacks low lv warriors before PvP update. I tbag that shit head druid all day
---
Well it may not increase the fun in particular but in increases the Engagement for me at least.
---
Since I know what will come next I try to prepare for it and take Advantage of it - like with the unarmored Mounts - they are an easy way to make good Profit as Long as you know they exist, you can get them in time and they are removed again.
---
You can only have that with a patch cicle of some sorts though.
---
I would have even accepted a new patch cicle created just for classic that includes most/all changes but bunched up in a smaller amount of patches and it even leaves some room for the unknown factor since Blizzard could bunch them up however they would like. 
---
But that is probably still far more foreseeable than I currently think :p
---
Yeah I think there is no perfect way and People will always be unhappy.
---
But do People constantly have to complain when they are unhappy?
---
I don't particularly love going to work but I still don't complain about it all day...
---
Same like I don't always like going to the gym - even though I pay for it - and still I don't complain about it all day.
---
Yeah I'm apparently one salty Person that is really pissed off at all the complaining... don't mind me :D
---
If blizzard offered faction thresholds at the beginning how would they ensure the faction stay healthy? That’s the only thing I never understood with this argument. What’s to ensure more alliance players don’t stop playing than horde leading to an imbalance again? 
---
I do agree they shoulda done server mergers.
---
Good healer &amp; tank you can do Jed/rend with 4, but those are a slog imo. 
---
5-6 make the runs much easier.
---
Not much, Glacial Stone is the best 2H in 19 bracket and is a quest reward. It's alliance only but on horde you have no paladins anyway so it doesn't matter (19 warriors will be using sword &amp; board for the most part).
---
Welcome to blizzard games!
---
Yes be on at 3pm pdt and expect to not be able to log in until 8 or 9pm pdt.
---
Bgs aren't going anywhere - if you miss out on the first 10 minutes of servers going live it's okay, you'll be doing bgs for months...
---
Lol also true. 8 hours isn't so bad if the game works correctly.
---
I forget what dungeon but there is one where you loot some powder and then use a cannon to blast down a door. Me being the noob I am, looting everything I can and cleaning out my inventory of things I don't need, looted the powder and then destroyed it for space for loot. Queue my group sitting dumbfounded at the door as I explain to them that I done goofed.. we sittin there for awhile contemplating lifes existance (and whether to kill me or not), I forgot if it was me or someone else that realized I was a rogue and could just open the door anyways.. 
---
Huge face palm
---
&gt; Baguette 
---
Wait, this translates to wand?
---
Their shadow priest doesnt even have an Anathema xD
---
today
---
dark legacy is easily my favourite comic , if you go all the way back some of the very early art was a bit rough but the art and jokes get great pretty fast , highly reccomend people look at pretty much all of them new or old
---
YES!  Exactly this!  I wish they would have just expanded on the existing world instead of just tacking on new lands.  Its so sad to go to existing lands and see them desolate.   
---
Its just not fun when everyone is so spread out.  Not to mention with flying mounts and dungeon queues that it just saps the game of any social aspect which is the point of an MMOrpg.  
---
I really wish they'd do a classic plus or "alternate story line" and just flesh out the existing world, add dungeons and not make MC, BWL and AQ obsolete
---
Actually I cannot care less. I am still on the realm I've chosen at release. I've endured all the queues and am still not lvl 60. My realm (faction) is still populated.
---
A lot of people just acted impulsively, used the free transfer and now regret their decision. Making the pay money to come back just feels about right.
---
Damn it!
---
Then I can only think of the "take ragemode off the Boss" ability from MC and even there I have no clue if it deals damage xD
---
Don't they have some Kind of threat reduction ability that doesn't deal damage but "attacks" the target? :P
---
WSG won’t be “all premades” or even mostly premades. Most games will still be PUG v PUG. You’ll still see plenty of partial or full groups but there are a lot more casual players than hardcore, plus lots of hardcore players who just don’t want to bother with premades and will queue solo. I’d also like to point out that not all premades are created equal. You will see plenty of people just advertising in chat to put a premade together, and will have no coordination or strategy in the BG and will perform just like a PUG that happen to all be from the same server.
---
Man I remember joining my first rvr battle here and having a huge blast the night before the Blitzchung incident.
---
&gt; Per Blizzard rules, raid leader is obliged to explain loot rules if the master looter is set anyway.
---
&gt; Game Masters may deem it appropriate to penalize a raid leader who fails to adhere to clearly established looting rules.
---
The point he was making is that you CAN set the loot to master, not explain what the rules are, then take all of the loot and not be in violation of ToS. The violation of ToS comes in when you post clearly established looting rules and you do not adhere to them, aka scam/lying.
---
Best available option? If he wanted random rolls so much he could have started his own group, and use his own loot rules. Just because you don't like someone's rules doesn't make them scum.
---
Not bad at all. You see the obvious signs of a premade enemy team, you leave, in ten minutes you Q again.
---
Is 20 mil a reasonable figure for xpac development? With no frame of reference it seems a bit high.
---
I'd argue the +1 is an "clearly established loot rule"
---
&gt;The idea that people will be done with Classic and return to retail is laughable.  
---
Yup, once classic is over or they release TBC i am OUT!  If they do classic plus then i will be interested in stay.  Flying mounts and dunegeon finders ruined the game for me.
---
See; I already have 2 Gnomes and I feel weirdly guilty that I’m not using other races!
---
You are making up facts that aint true and get proven wrong? And this is your comeback? Shiiiiiiet. I'll let you have this one, since I realize how sad it must be to be you.
---
What I love about old Azeroth is the wonder about the areas you can't officially get to. Chance back then were that you knew about Northrend and Outland if you played Warcraft 3 and were wondering what those places would be like in WoW.
---
Or what always did it for me was Hyjal. Even before knowing that there is an unaccessible region, I looked up that massive mountain seeing the silouhette of the world tree and wondering what its like.
---
Then of course people did find ways up into the region and making videos about it.
---
More than that apparently... Sometime you get through sometimes you don't...
---
But you cannot tell me that is exactly a lot of effort...
---
I googled "Narcos meme" and got the exact same 3 Pictures in one Picture. You just added the text.
---
It doesn't get much lower effort than this :P
---
I used bear most of times. You are frail like paper in cat form and i got myself forced to heal lots of times.
---
&gt;But there's only so much room to add new stuff to existing areas. 
---
How about all the impassable rocks (or trees) that restrict the actual world to narrow areas along the roads just to slightly cover up how much larger it could actually be? 
---
&gt;The result was that when I logged in on a character after 3 months of not playing the entire world was unrecognisable with maxlevel mobs clustered in each area.
---
Why did it bother you? That seems pretty cool. A reason to return to North-Shire abbey for a hidden secret? Old god corruption finding its way into a dungeon in Teldrassil, beyond what lvl 5 players can handle? Yes please.
---
You left out the possibility of a cap and trade system in which some farmers can compensate others for using less cows. So the government takes responsibility for the field and distributes 14 cow licenses, either equally among stakeholders(i.e. farmers) or puts them to auction. Once the licenses are distributed, they can be traded among farmers. That is, Jeffrey can purchase one cow license from Greg, so that (assuming an equal distribution, which should be the natural market outcome of an auction, or government mandate) Jeffery is allowed to put 3 cows on the pasture, and Greg is compensated (in the form of the cash he receives for the license from Jeff) for only putting 1 cow out.
---
But yes, everything else is correct. And the paradox you encounter in the third option is called the "free rider problem".
---
Economics is FUN
---
Do you need to have ram riding skill in order to ride the AV mount?
---
Interesting to see all the models lined by beside each other with the meter, but why do they have to be half naked.
---
I would expect A LOT of premades, and A LOT of epic'd out, 300 engineer, filled with consumable premade too. ( and it's just gonna get better with BWL and co.)
---
I would expect those premade to drive off the casual players somewhat quickly... few weeks?
---
you have to photoshop the dude as a tier 1 geared orc
---
I play Alliance. My realm used to be something like 45/55. So pretty balanced. I expected there to be a bit more Horde. But it was fine.
---
Now it's more like 35/65.
---
And you don't have to tell me that it sucks. Invis pot + Stopwatch are my default reaction to landing at any flight point. When I port to Ironforge, I always make sure to keep Frost Shield, Mana Shield, Ice Armor and Fire Protection up for 5 minutes until I get out of PvP mode.
---
It's bullshit. And it wouldn't be nearly as bad if Allies hadn't transferred off my server.
---
But the title, the title is where I really put the effort...
---
ClassicLFG just parses chat channels-it doesn't matter if other people have it or not for it to work lmao.
---
Why would you not farm that spot while in queue?
---
Sorry but WoW is at heart a pve game modeled after other PvE games.
---
PvP was an addition that in wpvp feels like it's only there because someone said it's Warcraft we have to have pvp.  BG's are fine but wpvp is largely a joke.
---
You need to run dungeons for plate pieces.  Specifically Valor
---
Pvp only
---
As an orc warrior how much better is the BRE then the Spinal reaper?
---
Russia is full of cheaters
---
The difference is the infrastructure set up.  For the pros in league the world finals prize pool is more of a "bonus" compared to the salary they're raking in just for being on a top team.  In dota 2 the prize pool is make or break whether its worth it to even be a pro.
---
You still get the data from everyone you see in the world physically then that data is synced between everyone you group/guild/bg with. It will sync to most people other than super hidden boys.
---
Yeah that sounds right, I've only done a handfull of them
---
Runescape is a really strange case. It’s core fans really keep the game alive even though they are swarmed with bots. There’s a massive black market and botting scene. The amount of gambling, scamming and general scummery going on underground is crazy. The amount of real life money being made is shocking, too.
---
Mining,herb,alchemy
---
No one cares, the mods should delete more of the shit tier memes
---
What add-ons does this affect?
---
as you can tell from the picture I am alliance, I am not expecting much of a queue
---
With some squiggly paint lines for combat effects
---
A R T
---
Mage
---

---
OPs question probably stems from general wow addiction moreso than a desire to immediately get into a bg. I mean, that's why I hope it isn't 8 hours (today is my day off, please no 8h downtime....)
---
I order my burgers without pickles.
---
Is my burger a lesser experience?  Objectively, yes there is less to experience.
---
Do I care that I'm missing out?  No, because I don't like pickles.
---
I rolled rogue to be able to hide.
---
You may always Appeal this to the mods. But if the first Picture in a search is exactly the same 3 Pictures in one - just without text - then you won't have a lot of chances.
---
This rule is very unclear and leaves a lot of room for Interpretation. We have Trouble with this a lot of times... I don't know why it sometimes is enough effort and sometimes it isn't...
---
Awesome. I use both of those.
---
Maybe the aren't using grid. Could definitely be wrong.
---
No need invisible pots, you can exploit safe spots
---
More accurate than the skeptics thing, less accurate than those that live and die by them think
---
There are 1-2 keys that you need to carry anyway - so it’s still useful.
---
Try being a warlock or hunter with 1 less bag than everyone else. I am looking forward to this patch more than any other just becuase of the stupid key ring lol
---
I healed all the way to 60 before i quit because of the bullshit ganking
---
I'm 30 tauren and i have some friends to help me. I'll go for it, thanks !
---
Imagine a world where you can play more than 1 game.
---
/thathappened
---
But if you're on a device that can play WoW... why not just use reddit in browser? Why force mobile reddit on yourself? I just don't get it.
---
I'm 30 tauren :)
---
Interesting strat to change to the 2 faster weapons during execute. Never thought of that but it makes sense. My only problem is we have like 7-8 warriors in raid and i usually only get off like 2-4 executes while spamming just executehaha.
---
I agree but their is an excessive amount of people extolling the virtues of a PvE server with acknowledging the negatives.
---
Correct answer.
---
Such an awesome tool!
---
I felt this way too, like killing with cat was faster but you nearly died on every mob. Bear wasn't all that slower but could easily take on 2-3 before recouping.
---
I still mostly used cat, it was still faster overall.
---
Night reaver is better for damage, and for stats warriors are going to use sword &amp; board anyway. Besides 19 warriors are one of the worst classes to play.
---
Yeah 8hr would suck - realistically they'll be up by 1pm but could easily be extended because blizzard is a fairly new company.
---
Oh yeah for sure, basically the only way to dump is heroic strike and spamming it will 100% get you aggro every time, there's no competing with the extra threat on top of the damage.
---
Hehe :D Is that the actual title or is that what the mods changed it to? xD
---
If that was you title then cudos. You must be a Prophet for knowing what was going to happen xD
---
&gt; 90% of the time in development is spent on the first 90% of the job, and the other 90% of the time is spent on the last 10%
---
Literally the entirety of retail wow too.
---
In PvP you won't have many opportunities to use shred, so your main form of combo point generation will come from Rake and Claw. With that in mind you'll absolutely want to take Savage Fury for the 20% damage increase for those two skills. Ferocity is also not optional as it reduces your claw energy cost from 45-&gt;40. Since powershifts give you 60 energy + 20 energy from one tick, you'll be able to cast claw twice inbetween powershifts instead of having to wait 2 seconds for an extra energy tick.
---
I'd recommend taking Natural Shapeshifter for the shapeshift mana cost reduction. This will allow you to have around 8 shapeshifts instead of 6 without having to wear intellect gear or drink any potions. This means more root escapes, more bear form feral charges, more mana for heals, etc. Omen of clarity also isn't bad since it procs fairly often with Cat form's 1.0 attack speed.
---
This doesn't give you many talent points to work with, so I'd definitely spec out of Improved Mark of the Wild. It only gives 100 armor (not affected by bear form increased armor), +4 to all stats, and +7 to all resistances, which is not worth it in solo or small group pvp.
---
Basically, your main talent choices are 9 points to spend between random free skills, reduced mana costs, cat stealth, stun duration, bear tankiness, and cat burst/roar ap reduction.
---
Well any pvper worth his salt, will carry LIPs on him. I know its saved my ass many times when a warrior with hand of rag jumps me. Or a rogue for that matter.  Either die in the stunlock. Or come out barely alive and instantly LIP.
---
Imagine thinking fun gameplay is objective. How dare they have fun differently than you!
---
I fucking hate people
---
I don't see no problem that isn't with cross realm BGs.
---
is it gonna be 8 hours for real?
---
Thought this was another Broken Tooth is dead post, then realized it was Thousand Needles.
---
That was the original title, I foresee these things.
---
Engineering.  Not dying in world pvp as much will give you more time to make gold.
---
You arent wrong.
---
I think you need to visit a hospital.  Quickly.
---
Nope, auctions continue to run as normal even if the server goes down.
---
If you want to snag something using a low bid, then you can try your luck. However, usually this doesn't work very well. Downtimes are not that long usually and there are unusally many people online when the servers come back up.
---
In fact, the opposite is good live advice for all of WoW: BUY only during weekends and SELL your stuff at the beginning of a new ID, just after server downtime.
---
It's not really news at all
---
100% wrong
---
Solid reasoning. I'm not allowed to ever want anything changed if it disagrees with you.
---
Get over it and accept this game should have changes made.
---
What is sadmoons current progress?
---
Agreed
---
Just pve players angry they didn't understand how world pvp would work.
---
I agree. I think they should make changes that were originally planned, but they didn't have time to do it. One glaring example would be adding nature to curse of elements. They've admitted it was intended but they simply forgot. Fix the things that were meant to be fixed, but were pushed to TBC because of time constraints. There were Shaman changes that were going to be implemented, but the lead developer for that got sick for 2 weeks and they fell behind, so those changes got pushed to TBC. I say fix, balance, make adjustments and make it a better game while protecting the core. No new features. Just balance classes and gear a bit better especially if they were originally planned. It's not often you get a second chance to do something right.
---
Dude i want that shield so bad let me join
---
[It's like when Kevin from The Office invented his own shorthand language.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K-L9uhsBLM)
---
&gt; nobody who rolled on a pvp server could have predicted this result 
---
Yeah, they could, and they did. *Many* people. We knew the servers were gonna be much bigger before the game launched. Everyone who made memes about it in the run up to launch knew. Everyone in my guild knew. Of course it was predictable.
---
I get what you're saying, I know it's not the same scale. I'm saying that even if they launched with 4x as many 3.5k concurrent player servers (which would all now  be fucking dead as donuts and we'd be facing a horrendous merger situation) you'd still have a 2019 meta of multi-raid death squads that didn't exist in 2004 and you'd still have people on here moaning about it. 
---
Fair enough, leave it here.
---
It was a battlegroup when crbgs came out. That was probably for the sake of saving servers from blowing up though

---
Smarter comebacks are wasted on you, no thanks.
---
But not all the time, right? Just from other healers using healbot?
---
You don't buy them with honor who told you that? :D There is no "honor" in Classic. You honor resets every week and you don't Keep it. 
---
All you Keep is your "Ranking Points"
---
Always on the lookout for a fine addition to their collection
---
Escape Artist can not fail
---
What? How do tanks use ability when she is in the air? Didn’t know that before? How do you do it? Just stand below her?
---
considering ironforge /wowcensus and stuff like that don't reflect the latest wave of transfers...
---
i'd say wholefully unreliable.
---
They cost gold not honor iirc
---
Stop playing WoW then, lol?
---
Now I'm sad
---
and world bosses
---
Lucky, you! Sounds like you can have a geared shadow preist or two and a feral offtank.
---
I'd rather have a shadow preist or power shifting feral druid both chugging potions than a ret paladin taking warrior gear any day.
---
tanks are in high demamd on my server 
---
check if tanks or healers are in a huge demand and just instance level tbh its less painful than questing anyway
---
It's only as clean as your view distance show you, and barely even that in some zones. Compared to flying where it's clean all the way
---
Uhh actually mc is fucking easy. The base raid of a 15 year old game with like 2 mechanics is not hard. People cleared that shit in greens in the first week. I'm sorry, it's time to accept that vanilla pve was and still is a joke.
---
Ill concede that, perhaps specifically in the last 2-3 weeks, it hasn’t been bad for alliance at LHC.  
---
That being said, I think those statements inaccurately represent the state of the server as a whole, which IMO, while fine, is absolutely horde dominated in almost every major hub. BRM isn’t close. Everlook is almost always horde. Felwood is Horde. Chillwind is horde. And LHC flips, little more alliance recently. But there’s no doubt that this server is more horde beating on alliance than the other way around.   
---
Tell your compatriot eviscerate to fuck off on all the lowbies on the menethil boat btw, guy is straight up the biggest asshole I’ve ever met in wow.
---
Always a catch! Gosh darn it

Not much to like about a cheating fat slob

Full Necro is definitely the superior way to go for all PvP situations before Rank 10.

+ spell power

For the set bonus, stacked high with stamina.

Get every single piece of it

Holy shit I’ve forgotten run speed on my boots. Thank you for the reminder.
---
Groups or raids?  I've yet to see a pug group honor those rules and lost a ton of upgrades to raid geared mages in Scholomance.
---
There's 0 reason to camp you for an hour. They get diminishing returns...
---
haha excellent
---
I use a dynamic group within Weak Aura to display my cooldowns. It's pretty easy to set up based on what class you are and the type of cooldowns you need to monitor. [Here's the pastebin](https://pastebin.com/LKmDypBh). You'll need to get the Weak Aura addon and import this string. Then you'll need to change the names for spells/items under "Trigger 1" and "Trigger 2" for each spell/item you use.
---
As for the rest of my addons that are worth mentioning:
---
* Bartender for my action bars that are visible
---
* Itemrack - to swap gear fast 
---
* Luna Unit Frames 
---
* [Ringmenu](https://imgur.com/a/NdKONpe) \- with a single keybind, it displays a circular actionbar around your mouse to show additional spells/macros/profession-related that I don't need to use often.
---
* Sexy map - to get a square minimap
---
* Weak aura 2 - I use it for my cooldowns as I have mentioned, but also use it to show my totembar as well as many other things.
---
* prat - chat addon that adds a lot of functionality
---
You can also LOS the cast, but it is a quick cast (1.5s I think) so you gotta be on your toes.
---
Turning in the bg marks of honor give exp. Back in the day when Id hit the top end of the bracket I would just pvp until mark turn ins forced me to level.
---
I got Blood Guard at 49.
---
*heavy breathing*
---
39 with a Pendulum of Doom
---
LOL omfg imagine being this person
---
Hey, is that TukUI you are using, or ElvUI, either way, would you be able to PM me your profile for this UI? It looks great!
---
I’ve been keeping my keys in the bank and therefore never have them when I go to the instance, so I’m actually stoked for this
---
I mean... do people not realize that retail is a wildly different game than classic? It has the same name but its overrun with micro transactions, impersonal multiplayer mechanics, endless grinds and it plays much more like an action rpg than an mmorpg.
---
"Go back to retail" is like "if you dont like WoW classic as it is, maybe you should try animal crossing?"
---
Thank you man!!
---
Guess I should have posted this here: How many can queue at a time for Alterac Valley? I can't seem to find anything on this other than a vague mention of a possible 5 man queue limit?
---
That sounds like a plan. Druids are harder to play than any other class in my opinion, but they have a high skill cap and the most versatile class in the game. It's the perfect class for a casual like myself who likes a challenge.
---
Actually forget the sub lol
---
If rules were explained to him, it's his fault. If they weren't it's yours. Going by the screenshot he doesnt seem to be informed how it works. Seems like just bad communication.
---
I don’t think we are man. I don’t know if you play at odd times of day, but it’s a horde world here. Not to say that it’s completely unbalanced, but that’s absolutely how it is.
---
If I remember correctly you could que up raids for it. But I stopped playing during TBC so my memory could be wrong.
---
God dammmmmmm! 
---
Now I can look at stocks
---
Yeah, and honestly they said at the outset they saw it almost like a museum piece so, imo, even the idea of TBC is kind of just wishful speculation - although, admittedly, not for me because I have no interest in going past classic, I'm not here to get back on a treadmill. 
---
Besides, I'm guessing they'll have made their money back and plenty more on the cost to get classic up and running, and will just run the servers until they die. Basically any remaining subs after all the content rolls out will be gravy.
---
The mount is 640g
---
Maybe it’s normal for a 15 year old game to feel old?
---
I havn't had any problems with 30% aspect, you just have to be patient and sometimes bandage during the aoe :)
---
yeah, we did the same on alliance the other day. get ony buff, run molten core with 4 raids.
---
LMAO no way
---
I'm not saying it's you, I'm saying there's tons of idiots in this sub that treat vanilla like the second coming of christ, and will oppose any expansion even though they bring improvements.
---
They have better uptime than most warriors and double the uptime compared to shamans. 
---
Saw something close to 50% uptime for retadins. Also, youre probably better off having that warrior actually deal damage instead of having to spam hamstring all the time.
---
When your experience is logging in to your capital city, having a dead flight master, and being followed by 5 horde when you leave the city is your option, you get tired of logging in. I only raid log atm because of it.
---
I love my Malisters Defender. BiS for resto Shaman.
---
Author will just make the addon use yell instead, considering everyone and their dog will hug battlemasters 24/7 this won't change much.
---
It'll relieve things for a solid day, maybe two. Then people will realize the queue timers suck and go back to FP/corpse camping.
---
That's why when people told me to hold off on rerolling PVE I said no. BGs will not fix the issue. The issue is the mentality of instant gratification of the current day. BGs are not going to fix that unless they can come up with a way to have no queue for anyone ever.
---
I tried looking it up and I recognize a ton of the guild names. There was even someone listed from my guild (Shadowwalkers) 
---
But, unfortunately there discord name isn't working and can't be found. Bummer. This was great though, I've made my own with a link to my Reddit name. I hope someone finds me. I really miss everyone and it would be amazing to find them and see how their lives are doing.
---
haha
---
The list of groups in ClassicLFG contains the same information as slashfour since they both parse the chat. I guess this change breaks the "Create group" functionality of ClassicLFG though? but I don't know how many actually bothered using that part of the addons anyway when I found that it restricted how I could formulate the LFM messages to much.
---
It's a raid loot system.
---
I would love Classic+ more than anything, however people seem to forget that Blizzard is first and foremost a business, which aims to minimize costs to maximize profits. 
---
Unfortunately the best way to do this is to simply re-release already existing assets - TBC and Wotlk. After those then MAYBE we'll get a WoW2 or Classic+
---
As a long-time rogue player, I demand more Ravenholdt! So much potential that didn't get fleshed out  :(
---
got my druid to level 56, and I only use cat on casters, and if it is a safe 1v1. Otherwise I used bear. can semi-afk grind as bear :D
---
your anime pillow does not count as a wife
---
Which really isn't different from any other day on this sub.
---
Could list a bunch of no life corpse camping alli. Fuck all them
---
I"m in the same boat, had my 56 hunter parked getting drunk in the inn since P2 hit.
---
Haven't done a pug raid yet, so I can't say.
---
you can dislike me and downvote me all you want but i'm still right lmao
---
On his way to area 51
---
Good thing I don't own one then.
---
Man I’m so happy I ignored my friends that wanted to roll PvP. I’m still playing and they went back to other games.
---
Log your fights with Warcraft logs. These use external logging which isn’t effected by range. If you really want to analyse dps data Warcraft Logs has HEAPS of tools to do this and would be better than details anyway.
---
The 2 commenters before you validated my serious inquiry for knowledge, so if you're not familiar with the subject, why chime in at all? I asked because this was a thing, and helpful people answered and contributed. I'd like to think you did it because you'd cooked up a red hot insult but I have no idea what msm is, so, maybe keep the toxicity to yourself?
---
Also, lvl 19 twink is the goal fwiw
---
&gt; It's not a very effective gold sink as is when only 5% of people play enough to afford it 
---
Good thing that statement comes from a strong, reliable source.
---
I’m on an unbalanced PvP server and the last two weeks have calmed down a lot. Only smaller groups of hardcore honor farmers remain and they will likely go to battlegrounds since it will be more efficient.
---
You can still fail at 315 herb
---
does anyone know what phase the corehound belt recipe will be available?
---
We have had no 1h sword drops :( however weve gotten like 3 oeb, and 1 onslaught
---
If you think it's something you can get used to, you must be unaware of what it's like to be on the alliance. If battlegrounds don't fix it, the alliance are going to quit in droves. Comparing your occasional death into BRM is nothing compared to progressing into BRM exclusively by rezzing 20 yards ahead of your body and dying instantly. The overworld is completely unavailable to us. I've completed 4 non-dungeon quests since the war started. Seriously, stop pretending like what the alliance is currently going through can continue any longer without killing off what few alliance players remain.
---
You used to be able to q entire raids of 40 people then later not even groups of five and eventually they allowed you to q up to 40 people again. I have never remembered you being able to q up in just 5 man groups for av ever.
---
Why did they put +8 sta on Head/Pants and not +100 hp. Am I missing something here?
---
Anyway, thanks for the link. Awesome page.
---
but you can take zeps being unflagged, alliance cannot. just sit 5 minutes and then hop on the zeppelin. alliance have no such option. I am not complaining about pvp, I am just saying its very one sided because horde cant be griefed as hard as alliance can.
---
Wrong. I played and followed this game from its inception. What killed GW2 with the introduction of lootboxes, etc. was not Arenanet, but rather NCSoft... their Korean overlords that own AN.  I need not remind you how much Asians love their gambling lootboxes of fun.  NCSoft ruined what was the best chance in years for a wow killer if one ever existed.  Parallels do seem to exist with Activision’s stranglehold on Blizzard 🥶.
---
What level can I begin to farm DM:E as a solo warlock? Also, what gear requirements are suggested? Currently lvl 56 with about 220 shadow SP
---
I believe 3.
---
It does! Baguette magique :)
---
I had a few carries through deadmines and happened to get two cruel  barbs while not getting Smite's mace and chose to use them till 30. It was actually really, really good. I know I was pretty lucky getting both those, but even at 29 I was killing things fairly fast.
---
Thunderfury?
---
Having to share limited resources with a second faction is a pretty big difference.
---
Uh..... no this is not a good explanation, this guy's math doesn't add up **at all**. 
---
It's true people don't interpret statistics correctly but a 60/40 population skew has 20% horde favor total *period*, there is no difference in game or on paper. For them to have a 50% advantage the pop. skew would have to be 65/35 minimum, you know 30 is half of 60.... 50% lol. 
---
That said I wish people would stop using these now outdated websites altogether.
---
yea I am pretty much auto-transferring as soon as its available.
---
In before this gets removed hahaha
---
Supper hidden boys = weirdos that queue WSG from ashenvale?
---
A lot of us are married. Average Classic WoW player is in their 20s/30s.
---
It's TukUi, sure I'll send you that tomorrow
---
I know lots of folks wall-climbed to Hyjal back in the day, as an example.
---
Hardly, lol.
---
Awesome
---
All from the same server, same guildname, sensible class/role distribution, heavy use of consumables and strategies.
---
Yes, its the post Cata version of deadmines, with the door that leads to the ship area.
---
If they were smart they would do both. Go back and flesh out some of the scrapped content to make Classic + and then when that wears thin, reskin it with Classic + TBC.
---
Lot of good things about it, but Rogue legendaries and EMFH abuse were bad for the game. Mists had similar core mechanics -- last xpac before merged CC DR's and ability pruning -- but without many of the flaws of earlier xpacs. After a few patches, once DK and Warrior got under control, and God Comp was slightly less ridiculous, Mists was pretty much Cata but better. Also, Ring of Valor was removed from the ladder in Mists, possibly the best change in the history of PvP.
---
I started WoW in Cata and I loved it. However, I do also recognize it as the end of the "classic" WoW experience and the beginning of modern WoW, so I can understand your point of view.
---
Well it's possible to get it into a bonus week-end if it's 20min AV and you play hardcore. If people start turtling on regular night then the 20-30 hours grind become a 150 hours grind 
---
(which is why people will rush it)
---
And I expect that many people will not play a lot once they are exalted. I mean... it was never really the most popular BG (even the devs who made it stated that it was not particularly liked)
---
But like I said we will see, I don't pretend to know the truth and I can be wrong but I'll be very surprised.
---
Good job!
---
See, you have the same muddle confusion I have. It changed so many times that I have no idea wtf we are getting here. I'd like some concrete clarification if it even exists.
---
It's a library, and most if not all frame addons should be using it already. There's also an addon that adds it to default frames.
---
Spiders do not have webs in vanilla
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah the alliance are gonna make the problem worse by refusing to queue up, since they only get honor when they have some random choke point locked down. Get them 1v1 and the crumble, I expect nonstop whining about absurdities like BGs being horde favored
---
People truly underestimate how much time is saved with this racial lol
---
Petopedia is your friend
---
I remember that we had to use a specific add-on to synchronize our Q because I wasn't possible to Q as a group/raid.
---
But my memory might be blurred due to 3 different private servers meanwhile.
---
I made my gf play wow. (Its ok forcing women is a-ok in my culture) and now she endures it, almost likes it.
---

More likely haven't updated (or you're on EU)
---
&gt; Up until 10-11 it's ezpz.
---
Yeah I stopped reading after that. You are so incredibly wrong.
---
Ur gonna want atleast level 60
---
Because its paying $25 for a single char xfer due to issues that are the developer end
---
It has a pathetic amount of spellpower and I don't like low damage in PvP as fire ... since you can't CC &amp; outlast like a frost mage can, so you have to do damage quick.
---
I really hate cross realm but it wouldn't be so bad if it had some sort of prioritization. Being able to meet people in a battleground to party up with is a lot of fun. I guess I knew that going into the game though at least and decided not to play a healer because of it.
---
Can you share some of your macros?
---
Actually, you are right. If the raid leader refuses to explain loot rules but people join anyway, it's on them.
---
What do you even fucking mean? Literally the reason they didn't add the BGs with the honor is because that's not how they did it in Vanilla. The Classic team have been very clear about the phases since before Classic launched. Yea, no changes is right, maybe stop being an asshole.
---
Of course it can happen but I also imagine people at the last graveyard just giving up and say "just let them win and go next" instead of trying to win if queues are not that big.
---
Yes "baguette" in French means wand or bread
---
I'm on Eastern Time. Also my day off. Bummer.

There is two People listed from Shadowwalkers Zeeran has his Discord the other guy has his Reddit Name posted. Try that one :) The guy with the antenna on top is Reddit the one with the # is Discord :P
---
Hope you find them!! I found some old friends who actually were in contact with other old friends. It is a blast!
---
Good luck and have fun either way :)
---
It kinda dead on horde side put the alliance is good.
---
I haven't looked on Details settings after the nerf but if they added a sync feature I doubt it is working over custom chat channels and not the RAID channel. In order for a sync function like this to work properly, more players than you would need to update and enable this option preferably everyone but as long as a few ppl spread out to be in range of everyone it should be enough I guess (as long as the sync is not limited to your own info only, then everyone would need to have it installed and turned on).
---
BWL came out 5 weeks after BGs. Since everything has been rushed so far... Max 2 months, but probably much less till BWL.
---
Oh shit *Ross* doesnt respect the lvl 19 bracket?! I gotta change my plans....
---
is there an addon to track instance lockout?
---
Bunch of idiots, you are not the asshole. Soul stone only lasts 30 mins, maybe it run out or maybe he just didn't see it. Eitherway if any stupid healer in the future says they won't ress you after you battle ressed them, either leave the grp, or if his stupid ass says it's too much mana just give him one drink so he shuts up.
---
Thank you. This at least gives me SOME idea of what to expect.
---
Deadly Boss Mods keeps track of this, among all the other things it does. It even tells you your last kill time and your record kill time when the boss is downed.
---
When I played my first character there I wanted to find this way so much! Quests said go to Westfall but I saw the mysterious Burning Steppes on the map and spent an hour jumping up the slopes.
---
Once I decided to fly to Ironforge instead of taking the tram I was glad I didn't find the way earlier, what I've seen was scary
---
If the entire group dies and the entire group has to run back to the dungeon and you are part of that group then you too must run back. That is the proper etiquette. You were in the wrong.
---
Now this is the nostalgia that I was looking for
---
the thing is most people want to be on a balanced server, right? i mean, right now, you'd rather have a balanced server. so you're likely not going to create more horribly imbalanced servers by providing paid transfers.
---
in fact, you give the opportunity for the remaining players (i.e., the remaining faction) on those servers that were so horribly imbalanced to move off the server to a more balanced server (which, as we've discussed, is what most people want).
---
in this way, you strengthen already balanced servers, and can begin to rebalance those servers that are imbalanced. either that, or those imbalanced servers die. economics at work. servers (i.e. firms) with desirable qualities thrive, and servers with undesirable qualities either correct themselves or die.
---
Is it understandable? He clearly comes into the shot via charge, then proceeds to use warrior abilities. I would argue it's not understandable so much as not knowing the most basic game mechanics.
---
Yeah I hadnt had that much Econ.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
Clearly not an English major either.
---
These are awesome, can I ask where you got the idea to have their hands in the air? Was it designed for one class to look like it was placing the helmet on (Like Mage#2?) or just a design you liked?
---
I'm using Mage #2 looks awesome! Ty for the free design!
---
The priest absolutely should have used the soulstone. It saves them the run back, as well as the entire party. With that being said, once you saw the priest didn't use the SS, you should have released as well.  
---
To go even further though, the priest is a mega dick for not rezzing because "muh mana". It also takes significantly more time to wait for somebody to run back rather than rezzing them and drinking after.  
---
In short, you're NTA. The priest sucks
---
Honestly, I really haven't been a fan of the treadmill-style content progression in the expacs, but if we're looking at how successful WoW has been over the years it's clear there's a demand for it. Hell, I'd even argue that their declining sub numbers are more of an indication of failed implementation than people not liking the way WoW's expansions kept pushing the gearing/level envelope. But with the level crunch coming in retail, I guess we'll see just how much that theory holds water - although I assume gear progression will still be a thing...
---
Thank you very much. :) I hope so too. Some of my best memories as a teenager were playing WoW with these people.
---
Gear requirements shouldn't be an issue, you shouldn't be getting hit much on bosses. More SP just makes it faster.
---
Idk how much level matters, I'd rather focus on getting 60.
---
The thing is, I want it to see on my screen during the fight, not just keep a track of it.   
---
Is it possible to enable some option in DBM to show the boss session time on screen?
---
If the priest doesnt use SS and runs, the rest runs too. Not only because it saves time. But us priests cant handle a respawned patroll solo and will die and take a big ton of time running again.  
---
You can however tell u need a bio break and ask if priest will rezz u after walk, 9/10 will do the run for u and rezz u.
---
Ummm as a priest its literally my job to rez you to help keep the run going smoothly. I would never ever ask someone to just run back if I can rez them instead.
---
Reading?! In 2019?? What do you take me for?
---
If EU, I highly recommend Mograine. 
---
FYI; if the subject is countable/plural, it’s fewer. If it’s not countable/singular, it’s less.

/tips cap
---
Leveled a pally in BC. It was slow and brutal. Especially because I did so as holy. (Total noob who didn't know any better. Also didn't know about LFG channels so it's not like I healed a lot of instances for XP.)
---
But once I got to 70 and obtained some gear I was hooked. Pretty much was an unkillable god who just took 5-10 minutes to kill someone because I was still holy. Unlimited mana, divine intervention to prevent repair bills, bubble to solve any problem, LoH to reset the fight, shield to laugh at DW classes as I block and take trivial damage with my high armor rating from plate, etc.
---
I play solo, 90% of the time. Getting 50-70 kills per day while averaging about 9-12k honor. 
---
As such, I’ve discovered who else roams around and plays solo on the horde side and they’ve recognized me. When we find each other on the road we simply /nod, buff up, and get some good fights in. 
---
There’s a good chance that people would think we are win trading.
---
I’m almost like 95% sure we were only allowed to que as 5 without the help of external addons. Cause I remember when I grinded to rank 13 my premade group would split into 2-3 teams of 5 for AV bonus weekend. And I can’t imagine any other reason why we woulda done that.
---
Just PM me tomorrow if I forget ^^

Engineering, need large seaforium charges to solo tribute runs
---
What he means is his gf is wow and wifey no likey him playing because she gets jealous.
---
Engineering 300
---
If you have a soulstone on him, he should use the soulstone once all mobs have reset and then rez the party.
---
If there's no soulstone, then the entire party should corpse run from the graveyard to the instance.
---
You didn't do anything wrong, and the priest should have used the soulstone. Not sure why he wouldn't considering it's a big popup in the middle.
---
I had a deadmines run as a priest where one guy didn't corpse run with the rest of us and I told him if he doesn't run with us I'm not going to rez him. He just said "lol ok I'm gonna go hit my bong" or some dumb shit. We got there and I didn't rez him. Party lead said rez him or we find another healer. I said "ok" left the party and immediately found another one. They were in the same deadmines run for 3 hours according to /who lmao
---
Oh i will for sure, thanks brother!
---
&gt; I'm just saying that releasing the exact same game in the same time order is just going to lead to... the same game.
---
It won't because nobody would stay for Cataclysm.
---
I never finished the xpac when it was retail, but I was hyped as hell to get to Northrend and, honestly, the early questing experience and the beautiful zones didn't disappoint. I just had other things going on at the time and didn't end up playing much.
---
Are DR's only held within that BG? Didn't realize you got DR's at all in BGs.
---
How good is crown for warriors? I always think hunter/pally (or shaman for horde) when I see it
---
Gigi is an absolute psycho.
---
Your best bet for a "pvp pet ability" is scorpion with poison for the extra dot.
---
If the healer is also corpsewalking (so not Ss'd), its very rude/lazy to wait for a ress.
---
Yeah, it can be picked in classic.
---
You really think the person who merely waited for a rez is in the wrong over the person who refused to use one of their core class abilities and wasted the entire groups time by making somebody walk back to the instance and called them a pleb?  
---
Sorry chief, don't agree with you at all
---
^ This
---
I can’t remember if 5 mans were okay, but I remember this addon for sync queues in any raid size. Tho this didn’t guarantee that you will all join the same BG
---
Le guide secret de la boulangerie
---
there have been a million changes made to classic from vanilla, the no changes BS people are spouting failed at the creation of classic 
---
the server size changes alone basically negate all arguments for no changes. because that fucks over basically everything
---
Anything that syncs with people outside your group or guild. I've heard honorspy (honorspy is for checking honor progress, it is not spy) and LFG addons.
---
I don't think so for BWL.
---
We have requirements to raid (gear levels, consumable use, engineering, etc) so all the raids typically 1-shot all the encounters (barring occasional cockups) and our clear times are comparable across the raids.
---
The GM is on record as believing that we could well be down to 1 group by the time Naxx hits, due to people not being able to make the cut, keep up with the consumable demands, or outright quitting the game, but I think BWL is still something we'll have several groups clearing.
---
Haha, yeah, seems that way.
---
How do you lack so much vision?! If enough players demand classic plus, they will do it.
---
Yeah, as if big streamers are ever treated the same as the average joe
---
Good call. Still haven't done that quest.
---
Tomorrow (EU)
---
We have to share resources on a pve server too.
---
I'd say go with a scorpion/boar. Scorpions get a DoT IIRC and Boars can Charge up to the WSG GY allowing you to kill players as they respawn.
---
Thats some fine threesome
---
Goes for 600-700 on my server

Those two abilities each class has in the 19 bracket really let player skill shine. /s

Uh, I mean, you're not really?  
---
If you choose to stay dead to just troll someone, your progress is stalled either way, they're achieving their objective, while you (unless your objective is to be a ghost) achieve nothing.
---
Feels that way ok my server except as a shaman. Seems to be quite a shortage. No one bats an eye that I'm enhance or ele depending on my mood. They just want me for the totems and I'm fine with that.
---
60.
---
Sarcasm? Because lol...
---
yes, it does
---
Usually the whole group runs back. But it should be expected that any healer dish out rezs. The healer was one of your typical selfish losers. Every once in a while you can get those entitled people who think they are god's greatest gift to earth.
---
When every game is 10v10 twinks, you may as well just PvP on your 60. lol
---
Did you do solo runs just for the books? Curious because I’m a warrior and would like to farm this
---
Seems a bit unfair. I like it....
---
Waiting for a Rez instead of running back wastes far more time. There is no argument here. What the op experienced will be the exact same experience he faces in 99% of groups. Unless you specifically ask for a Rez because you need to go afk you.
---
Sure, my guild leaders always post the logs after our raids and I do review them. I’m talking more specifically as a real time tool during the raid - which may not be feasible at the moment anymore post nerf.
---
Onslaught?
---
I mean, I was referencing the insane amount of + spelldamage gear that is available due to 1.12 itemization.
---
By the time mythic is released, most of the bosses have guides and videos from ptr. DBM is updated with timers and abilities.
---
The ONLY reason this is being changed is due to the load it was placing on Blizzard’s chat service. Remember the threads about the 2-3 minute delay in sending messages in large servers?
---
Blizzard couldn’t give a damn about “social aspects of the game”. If they did, they’d not have allowed the faction balances to get so out of hand.
---
I understand how the mechanic works, but these abilities will help the tank pick up the target in this fight. And keep her in place so she doesn’t turn and breathe into the group, or instakill anyone upon landing. It’s important for mages to stay alive, ice block helps there! 
---
Also, I would call Fade a threat dump. It dumps your threat to be gained back at a later time (which is negligible here, as the tank should surpass you by that time)
---
&gt; Going back to the main topic of the thread, why wouldn't organic balances be more true to vanilla authenticity
---
Because playing your class 'as it was in vanilla' is a big part of the vanilla experience. 
---
So your options are either to follow the patch progression as it was, or to not touch classes. 
---
A big thing for many people in Vanilla is that they knew exactly what they were getting when they picked their class. These are my talents, this will be my role, this is my niche within the game, I am actively choosing this. 
---
Organic balance removes that from the game. So not only would it not be classic, but now we lose one of the biggest selling points for min/maxers. 
---
&gt;I'm just pointing out that the game has failed if it was meant to be authentic.
---
You were using it as an argument for your ideas, not 'just pointing it out.' You argued that since the authentic experience failed, that everything was on the table. 
---
Or are you really saying that you just randomly pointed it out for no reason? Come on. Like you just thought it so you typed it? 
---
&gt;The authentic vanilla experience is about the state of the game, and the change of the state of the game.
---
This is why I reference retail.
---
The point of classic is not to have an ever-changing game, it's to go back to a prior state of the game. 'Why don't we just have some balance and content patches' ignores the whole point of classic WoW. 
---
Retail is the version that is ever-changing. People want to know what will be good next patch, what is the meta now, what's the meta going to be, where is the story going to go, etc. 
---
Classic isn't about that.
---
&gt;The latter is far more influential on the experience, so surely we could focus on vanilla flavored changes too.
---
Yes, after phase 6. 
---
1/6 raid instances is released, BGs aren't even out, and you already want changes lol. People want to experience the content as it was. There's certainly an argument that right now they aren't, but they'll be much closer to the 'real' experience in AQ and Naxx, and the BG experience will be the same as it was in 1.12.
---
What is the downvote about? 
---
 &gt; Addons will still be able to communicate using PARTY, RAID, GUILD, and WHISPER in the same ways that they can now. Additionally, we are going to test a change to permit C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage to be called with SAY and YELL, allowing your addons to communicate with players in your immediate vicinity.
---
Or did you like the 5-10min chat lag and want it to return the next time some addon developer is using custom channels to share data across the entire server?
---
&gt;I’m a newbie redditor and never moderated a sub but if there’s a will I will try to find a way.
---
I non-ironically wish you good luck. It's not that it's *tough* persay, but there are small choices you make when running a subreddit that can have much larger outcomes than you'd anticipate.
---
Thank you, that makes perfect sense and is the information I was looking for. I’ll see if I can get guildies to use Details with sync on.
---
Thanks for the info. Still not as concrete an answer as I'd hoped, but at least its an idea. Wish Blizz would post this somewhere.
---
For fucks sake

Old Blanchy has been great so far on Ally.   Randoms donating gear and gold while I was still lowbie, and overall sense of community.

those 3 guys are rogues, they don't need keys because they have picklock ability
---
You shouldn't AFK out right away when facing a premade. Any decent one will win as quickly as possible. You might run into a group that GY camps excessively, but any decent group wants to get in, win and, move on to the next game as quickly as possible.
---
This happens so much more than it ever did in vanilla.
---
Wow we’re you offended that he didn’t run? Lmao you sound like a moron
---
SM Cath runs. On my own I can do 25-30g/h. You can also carry people, they can pay 2-3g per run so with a full group you get 8-12g + vendor items.
---
ive spent like 30 dollars on gw2 since the xpack and have everything i could want.  Theres literally zero requirement to spend money on that game.  As if you really wanted, you can buy everything with in game gold.
---
Use shield slam #1 unless you are under 30 rage. Then doing a revenge with a hs better. Every global you need to make a gap of threat between you and everyone else. Also 2 high threat attacks &gt; 1 attack for raids when low rage because of high chance of parry and dodge. It just helps keep your threat smooth due to better rage per abilities. 
---
If you ss and regular auto, your auto doesn't have any special threat modifiers so you're just losing free threat per weapon swing. Again this is pretty specific to raids where the boss damage will be helping you get lots of rage.
---
Specific weapons like eskhander proc, you can just auto, cause you can rage starve yourself early if you hs too much wihout enough rage already built up
---
Once you are high in rage shield slam + hs is always better.
---
Opener should look like below:
---
Always start with blood rage/charge then battle shout when party members are in range. Buffing your party members generates threat. 
---
Hit berserker rage after your battle shout, switch back to defensive. Berserker rage is one of your best rage generation you can do which then increases your threat. 
---
Don't use your berserker rage on cd if it's a fight with fear obviously.  
---
Single target
---
Ss &gt; revenge &gt; sunder armor.
---
Queue heroic when the rage permits.
---
Nobody is saying it'll fix everything, just that it setter than no BGs.
---
You've provided no new information

Ok, solved!
---
I renamed WowClassic.exe to Wow.exe and Twitch picked it up again.

I guess Twitch will need to push out an update
---
Definitely.
---
It's not acceptable, it's the new normal because unless we organize as consumers and don't continue to pay for such services/microtransactions then it will continue

Totally different on a hunter, no DoT's and you're using a pet to bait dust field.

Timing attacks are very much part of Broodwar's choreography. The first 10 minutes of nearly every high level Broodwar game is treading one of a handful of well-worn paths. Sure, occasionally a new path is discovered, like corsair dt, but the structure of the dance remains.

Man I come here to Reddit just to hear the crybaby Alliance players. 
---
Crybabies and reddit go together perfectly, makes sense most here went alliance.
---
Second this.
---
The healer's job is to heal and res the stupid dps who get killed. You held up your part of the deal by putting your SS on the person who can res should you actually need it.  Your group needed the wipe prevention and the priest just dead ass said "Nah fuck you guys".
---
As someone who browses /new too much, it doesnt take long until the "i know its not much, but im so proud of my first mount" posts get repetitive.
---
I also dislike all the complaints from 3-4 toxic servers where stuff is unplayable tho.
---
The main problem on this sub is that 99% of the good posts get deleted by the mods because of wrong tag, witchhunting, not enough wow assets in the meme or bugs being seen as promoting cheats. Its pretty sad.
---
I think the current amount of posts are too limited (bcuz of mods) to start a sub-sub.
---
I'm in the same boat. No idea.
---
I used this same mentality when I was leveling and some other mage would gank me while I had 10+ mobs, then proceed to try and farm in the same aoe spot. Only I'd just wait until they tried aoe farming and then I'd res and spam poly on them till the mobs killed them. The mind games it would play was hilarious, they'd start off gingerly pulling 1-2 mobs then grow more confident before getting killed again and again.
---
Pathfinding makes its super easy to outrun her. Get a weakaura that tell you target range. Practice to keep her at max range and baiting the boulder. Out run the boulder and multishot her. I find rank 1 multi shot is super mana efficient. Auto shot between the boulders. Aimed shot only when she stops to fart. Practice using the pet to trigger the fart.  Goodluck and have fun!
---
If I remember correctly this has always been possible. It's pvp - pvp or pvp- pve.
---
I would imagine they are just going to let the mega servers die out if faction balance goes that bad. I don't see another viable option.
---
Yeah of course I am? I'm not talking about whether they've said they will. Just pointing out that the sub linked is OBVIOUSLY about speculation and "but it's unconfirmed and they haven't said anything" is a useless comment. It's obvious to everyone. No one is arguing that they've implied they'll do it.
---
On EU Pyrewood Village is a good server for Alliance. Lots of players still leveling!
---
This is actually true. I was being a bit humorous in my reply since that's the usual route to dealing with premades, but a good one will steamroll you so fast timewise it makes more sense to just stay in.

Farm elite Chimaeroks for meat on the island in the southwest of Feralas.

Wont they hit DR super fast doing that?
---
If the group runs, you run.  In your scenario it makes no sense why the priest didnt SS and res all, but as he ran, you shoulda all run back together.
---
Only exception to that rule is if you ask nicely like "im busting for the loo, would you mind ressing me please?" etc.
---
Why will you have super long queues? The BGs will be cross-realm, which will make queuing non-dependent on your server. Furthermore, there is almost a perfect 50-50 split across all servers (PVE, PVP, RP-PVE, RP-PVP):
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
That is from a couple months ago but I couldn't find anything more recent. There are undoubtedly changes since then but I imagine the faction balance is still going to be close to 50/50. Your queues are going to be fine.

I wouldn't have any problem with him saying "hey, mind if I go smoke for a sec and you rez when I get back?" but he just had complete disregard for everything. We had to kill 3 patrols to get to him and he was like "hurry up" :\
---
&gt; It's true people don't interpret statistics correctly but a 60/40 population skew has 20% horde favor total period, there is no difference in game or on paper. For them to have a 50% advantage the pop. skew would have to be 65/35 minimum, you know 30 is half of 60.... 50% lol. 
---
Are you sure about that? Let's do the actual math:
---
Assuming 1.000 players on a server: 
---
60:40 = 600 H + 400 A = 50% more Horde players compared to Alliance players
---
65:35 = 650 H + 350 A = 85% more Horde players compared to Alliance players
---
Your reasoning implies that you are the one whose math doesn't add up.
---
Everyone who would bother downloading honorspy _should_.
---
Fair enough, not sure why i remember dungeon queue changes from TBC then.  Weird.  Regardless i def think flying mounts fucked up the social aspect of wow and world PVP as well
---
if you're in BRD, rend isn't very good damage any more (it was when you were a young warrior).

3,300 xp per turn-in. It’s possible to level to 60, yes. It is also going to be excruciatingly slow.
---
i played on in vanilla lol
---
some people have a really warped perception of what "ezpz" is. it is for sure not grinding for 3h a day for 3 weeks for the great benefit of getting to buy blue trashloot.
---
3h a day is more than most people play, and you dedicate that just to pvp.
---
I would really advice you take a break from the game. It's clearly a factor on your mental health.
---
Man alliance players come up with the dumbest shit.
---
That's really odd considering my guild mates, who spend 8+ hours *per weekday* farming honor, only *might* hit rank 8 this week. Maybe. Most will be rank 7. 
---
And still, going from 7/8 to 10/11 is not a walk in the park, saying that's "ezpz" leads me to believe you've never actually done the honor grind.
---
Why don't we just speculate that Chris Metzen is a lizard-person then? That's equally valid.
---
Lmao yeah right.
---
Never played in a +1 group.
---
somewhat true but you are only kidding yourself if you think most of those honor grinders at the top now aren't already in a premade
---
Meh.
---
Very interesting. That's good to here. Though clearly it will be less effectively at synching, maybe that's a good thing.
---
If everyone but you ran back and you expected a rez, you're a dick.  
---
I mean, I would still rez you, but I would berate you.  
---
If the priest wasted a soul stone and ran back instead, well he's an idiot too.
---
Alliance get a faction wide obtainable cat mount, horde gets no extra mount, in my mind that makes up for any imbalance lol
---

You can see safe spots in some DM Est solo run videos. But I didn't find videos for warriors. I can make one if some people need. For solo runs you have to use fear, stun, hamstring and safe spots

What colour is the +30 spell power enchant? Purple?

I'm in love with [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13246/argent-avenger](this item) and I want to get it enchanted with +30 sp (I have 2k gold and epic mount) to make it a viable weapon for my warlock. Does anybody know if the glow will be more intense?
---
honestly if you can handle being shit outside dungeons, it's nicer inside dungeons as you generate so much threat and hold mobs better in general than fury (and probably arms). plus conc blow and last stand are great utility.
---
If you're talking about pickpocket resists, that has nothing to do with your stealth level.
---
All 8 hours is just for the keyring.

Omg, this. Trying to sell mats on the auction house, and so much shit selling BELOW vendor price.

Wait to sell it until people start twinking! But defo sell it, even tho it's really cool.
---
I enjoy AV for being a disorganized mess. Premade vs premade is fun for tactics and you see some good battles, but PUG vs PUG is entertainingly chaotic.
---
It's because these rats were given a room to breathe. that's why you don't give them an inch or they will take a mile. Horde didn't WPVP for 2 days and this happened lmao.
---
If they are pvping that often they must be running in big groups/zergs and getting very little honour. Getting rank 8 this week is not difficult.
---
Damn you got great memory! I have no fcking clue who i played with back then.. besides it being with some friends at school and we were in a native language speaking guild.
---
I would want to be 60 at least for the reduced aggro radius.
---
flurry charges get used up more quickly with a fast weapon.

it's possible that the optimal offhand is slow until execute phase, then fast after.

On the very last image, on the left side, there is a bar of sorts. What addon is that?

Theres a super quick answer to this question.

Stop trying to farm Mara and go farm solo trib runs.

Earns you way more money and is significantly easier.

Cross realm BGs, so the Horde there get to wait in queue for battle grounds, and get ganked mercilessly by 40 mans when not in queue.

Perfect!

I only have 1 key, but like 4 other non-key objects that I need within various dungeons. Keyring saves me 0 slots until I get into, what, Strat and Scholo?
---
Rogues: *heavy breathing*
---
Unfortunately, I think it still forces you into cat form because its a "special type" of cat form. 
---
Its not like if you get mind controlled and the mob or player usese a rank 1 skill or is unable to cast a skill you don't have.  Nefarian class call on druids irrc just straight up forces you into "a" cat form, regardless if you actually learned it.
---
Sauce: Druid in vanilla era.
---
in particular a bunch of people are learning what the private servers got wrong ;)

Depends on what you find more fun. My 54 mage, will probably level up a few levels in BG's just because I like them, although I'm sure I'll die a lot.
---
Heartstriker. Horde will transfer away the second PCT open.
---
Sword spec is better if the weapons are equal. But even if you completely disregard the proc on Spinal Reaper and also factor in the gain from strength and the weapon skill on OEB, Spinal Reaper is about 5% stronger. 
---
Just go with the best weapon available to you and spec accordingly.

MC gloves and UBRS ring are 2 big hurdles, so you're in good shape so far. Those are not only pre-BiS, but BiS ... AND BiS for a long LONG time.
---
The most important thing is to do what the rest of the group does, for the very reasons you specified. You split the group and respawns ended your run. Imo you should have run back.
---
On my rogue I can often avoid death in a wipe but even then it is better for me to just kill myself and run back with the group so we are together.
---
Tauren cats are mouthbreathers lol
---
Timing attacks are a part of broodwar's choreography but those timings having changed up many many times because the meta solely revolves around player tactics now because the meta has been allowed to evolve without "balance" patches to keep it "fresh".
---
What if they send one guy to queue and then summon him? This way they can literally be doing wPvP during the whole duration of the queue.
---
IIRC there was supposed to be an underwater raid entrance there as well.
---
Sure, they don’t want to but that’s not how the system works. To get R14 as soon as possible they’ll be near required to chase ally all day. That or camp the battlemasters. Don’t forget that the R14 system doesn’t put you against players of the opposite faction. Not really. It has you going against players of the *same* faction. Meaning that the harder you make it for other people of your faction to get honor and the easier you make it for yourself the quicker the grind. 
---
So, because of how quickly information spreads and how knowledgeable the player base is compared to vanilla fully informed game theory kicks into effect and roaming the world and battle master camping will become the norm.
---
And its gonna stay unexplored because you know, its blizzard we talking about here...
---
If you want to be the most bad-ass player you need to invest some time in the game. It's a fucking long way to 60 and then more.
---
"listen, Duke, we have a fishing pond in Org, you really don't need to stay clear the fuck out here."
---
Yes, people will be complaining about things in BGs and other related PVP things. But did you realize that all of the items that listed have something in common? 
---
They all entirely take place within instanced battlegrounds. They don't affect the world at large. 
---
I've seen this point as a common retort lately to wPVP complaining: "well, people are just going to complain about BGs!!"
---
They aren't related. The shit-show that is wPVP has almost completely blocked the world for half the population. wPVP was being abused so hard it was ruining the PVE portion of the game for a lot of people. People were unable to quest, to level, to farm, to get to dungeons, etc. That was the primary complaint about wPVP and that issue is largely "resolved" with BGs. 
---
Yes, people are going to complain about BGs. But this is an apples-to-oranges comparison with the current complaints about wPVP. 
---
And yes, I am Horde on a PVP server.
---
We tried yesterday didnt really work out too good haha
---
Godspeed good sir lol
---
The place below Silverpine Forest is Gilneas, where the Worgen race starts in retail
---
You could have done something as simple as cast battle shout twice in defensive stance to gain a pretty hefty amount of threat.... before the rest of your ranged &amp; healers all ate fireballs or wiped threat on their own. 
---
It is 100% the fireballs doing all of the threat wiping. You can go ahead and look through raid logs - as I have - and you will consistently see late fireballed dps/healers never pulling aggro in ph3 no matter what they do ... and dps/healers that never got fireballed being the ones that pull threat almost instantly.
---
So, I am a 60 mage without Herbs and I am farming Lashers over ZF. When I started farming I had under 6k mana and my stamina was lowish as I am not raid geared, some blues from AH but nothing special.  I found the graves very challenging, especially the second pull.  Lashers are less gold but so easy once you figure out the pulls.  I do them one group at a time and still raid lock out because I am too fast.  The herbs sell well and so do Living Essence and you also get the occasional libram and books from dusty tomes which sell pretty good.  
---
It also had the added benefit of a hunter advertising rod of the orge magi from his solo tribute run so for an undisclosed amount of gold I got that staff.  I have farmed hundreds of gold there, I rarely have more than an hour to play so i log in my accounts, and farm 2-3 runs then AH my loot when I am full up.  
---
I am sure if you are a better mage than me, so you can farm ZF for more gold, but I prefer easy and steady, also the tiny chance that a freezing band or Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying
---
Will give it a shot, thanks!
---
My favorite thing about this is that you loot that powder like 1 pull before you need to use it.
---
well, if you don't want to alt-tab but you have reddit on your phone, ready to go...
---
There is an EZ fix for that.
---
With the sacrifice specc you don't relly on having corruption up (which can get knocked off, which is annoying). So I would say its slightly better in a lot of scenarios in raid, because you just need to CoE/CoS and spam shadowbolt 24/7.
---
Its not as good in PvP/World content tho, which is why SM/Ruin is the prefered specc for most locks.
---
I’ve never once blamed the horde (well individuals here and there for exploiting and grieving). But it’s not my fault either that the alliance are overwhelmed. So if there’s a solution available, I will take it.
---
There are no battlegroups. They clearly state you're playing with all realms in your region.
---
&gt;	If you're talking about a 80/20 servers then I dont care.

You should. BGs are cross realm in your region. Meaning the actions of people on those servers affect your queue times.
---
We did alter dude np, last boss tore me (Rogue) apart tho
---
Defense is disabled in BGs or in pvp in general? Also does that only apply to racials or are items and skilltree points included?
---
Yes 3 with BWL. Have all the mats waiting!
---
I only log into retail for arena, the problem is I’m falling behind in gear and since pvp has become a pve thing now it’s just not as fun. There’s no vendors for pvp gear, and anyone who plays pve more than you will most definitely have a decent advantage over you in a match. I’ve played since vanilla and my main has 2008 season 2 arena mount merciless netherdrake. I’ve essentially played this game for pvp up until wrath and honestly it’s just not fun anymore, all the balancing really really ruined the experience. Everyone’s got a stun, heal, silence and that’s just stupid as fuck. Rouges now heal so much it’s insane, mages and locks took on the form of my shadow priest and now absorb insane amounts of damage. I get that things change and I was enjoying those changes, at least that’s what I thought with each and every update to my mains. After being back on classic it’s shown me all the reasons I play this game and why I no longer care for bfa. My priest has over 302 days played on him. I recreated him in classic and it’s just amazing. Bgs release today and that’s all I’ll be doing other than raiding on the weekend for some gear. From a pvp perspective the game shot itself in the foot trying to balance every class and spec, class identity went out the window some time after wrath, I just wanted wpvp and vendors back before classic dropped, now I feel like retail needs a lot of work if it wants to get players back. So far from the shadowlands preview I think that might be a good start but we will see.

Ally dominated though, and it will be worse when paid xfers are released

Who said I would be queuing for BGs?  Are you people this dense?
---
you didnt quit you are just biding time
---
I understand people think this is 'etiquette', but it frankly baffles me.
---
As a healer, I *have* to run back. You do not and, frankly, I don't care if you do. The only reason I would have for you running back is if I need you alive and functional to get back to our bodies.
---
Indeed, to some extent, I *prefer* if you just stay dead on the ground because it circumvents all sorts of potential problems. I know how to get back to where we were, which walls to hug, etc. If you're dead on the ground at my destination, I don't need to worry about you screwing up on the way there. Not that I don't trust you in particular, but when you have 5 people independently weaving their way through a partially cleared dungeon the opportunities for error are significant.
---
Nah.  If you didn't think this happens, then you clearly didn't play in Vanilla.
---
How do you get into the best premade?
---
Well they shouldn't have the same loot in the first place, since there is no peril attached to them. Basically tank and spank fights outdoor. It's just so lame \^\^
---
The man comes around - Johnny Cash 
---
Need to get in the mindset for evenly matched horde battles....
---
just make one of the Priests go Disc/Shadoweaving and free up four debuff slots. :/
---
But that song is anti-war... Might as well be playing Give Peace a Chance.
---
Didn't realize we went back in time to when we had to hard restart every server. 
---
Kind of shit it takes this long these days.
---
Okay, see you when you come out.
---
Level 60 for sure. The better your gear, the easier it will be. People have done it without gear, but it takes a lot of practice. SM/DS is the best spec for this (but is not good for group PVE). 3k+ HP and 350+ shadow power are numbers i see often trown around as a guideline.
---
Yea that’s fair. I didn’t want to imply horde have it bad. It’s really only the gromgol zep, once in stv they can kill you no matter what
---
&gt; Don't forget Silithus. Like half that zone is not 'cut out' (highlight the zone, you'll see it).
---
Uh... You mean the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj?
---
Mate you don't understand, I had a lot of valuable items. A cool bandana, a rock. You name it
---
Shadow unit frames has a form of it. Reads most incoming heals.
---
Considering the OP is here in the first place asking about an interaction in a low level dungeon, I think it is safer to assume that they are likely ignorant of all the factors at play in the situation, unless you think they knew they weren't an asshole to begin with and just wanted affirmation from strangers.
---
To me, "little confused about why the soulstone was used" sounds like they don't know what the common reasons for someone not taking a soulstone res might be.
---
&gt;because I have good faith in people.
---
I guess, unless the person is the Priest in this case, who is not here to defend themselves.
---
The rogue class call is so toxic
---
Cat form doesn’t have a quest. It appears with the trainer as any other spell. Have a hard time believing it still.
---
Lmao does he really? I’ve barely been to un’goro after leveling.
---
Damn, woke up excited to play BGs. Would've thought a 15 year old game would have an easier time releasing a patch.
---
O.k, now this I am interested in. Following.
---
I assume you re playing on a PVP server right?
---
FYI, be careful of streamsnipers. That will probably be your biggest concern.
---
Shouldn't have to specify "personal" in this situation :/
---
Coffer keys will be stored there too :) Can't wait
---
If you are that lazy in creating content for reddit, you deserve some hate.
---
I don’t have a number, but av is somewhat fast. WSG on the other hand takes a long ass time.
---
Is 2 handed tanking for Wailing Caverns fine aside from maybe equipping a one hander and shield for Kresh, the druids that cast sleep (so I can shield bash if we have no one else to stop the spell) or that one giant elemental that hits really fucking hard?
---
Damn dude, you're fucked if you get sour over some text on an open forum littered with shitty fucking posts left and right. Also, I don't actually give a fuck about the no changes shit. Get off reddit dude, you're obviously in the wrong place. I think the blizzard forums are more what you're looking for.
---
Move them goalposts!
---
I wish I could give gold! This is the content I followed this sub for.
---
YAY!
---
I really don't think they could just put whatever they want out there and be successful. WoW/Blizzard defines the genre because they had *years* of success doing what they did, which wasn't ever a true sandbox game, not because people decided they just "did" define the genre, which is what I'm inferring from your post. 
---
Regarding classic being a different beast, sure, it is - the RP in MMORPG generally feels more impactful. But if you look at how people are pushing content, it's clear that even the WoW: Classic subscriber base has a significant contingent that wants content, not just sandbox game-play. And I'd argue that's been the case since vanilla.
---
Less boink boink more pew pew.
---
Pre-cata version. I've never run the post-cata version, but the door that you either need to pick or blow up has been there since the instance released in vanilla.
---
8 hours. Goddamn normies
---
It should be unaffected since I assume it uses your raid channel.
---
Pretty sure 99% of add-ons will be fine. I think it's basically only HonorSpy and ClassicLFG that are getting hit.
---
Considering the trash had time to respawn in the early dungeon, I would go with the SS having worn off.
---
&gt;Imagine thinking things can't be objectively bad
---
Except I didn't say this.
---
The rest of the trash you wrote isn't worth responding to.
---
idk, I downloaded it, and there were no groups.   Maybe I just used it wrong.
---
Also, I'm volunteering on letting someone powerlevel my mage without learning polymorph. Just pm me
---
Who in the fuck is cheating and playing WoW at the same time?
---
Seems like it's just Alliance rolling PVE as those servers are growing and getting more stacked with Alliance.
---
/ihavesex
---
But you don't know that. And we all don't know that, because we're missing way too much information.
---
I agree that re-releasing content is probably the option with the lowest costs. But profit is revenue minus costs, so maybe the projected revenues for a Classic+ outweigh the increased costs, depending on what exactly would be in a Classic+, how many players there are and how many of those would buy Classic+ at a certain price.
---
I don't mind dreaming a bit about Classic+ though, there's so many ideas out there that Blizzard had in mind for WoW but never got around to.

The gold gets split up between the raid members at the end. Run a few raids and you can start bidding on gear.

Why would you delete?  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

I believe they are correct, but I can't say for sure.
---
My priority is different because I tend to spam heroic strike when I'm dual wield tanking, since I've got almost infinite rage.
---
Yeah, they use the neutral AH to enact tolls. It's really brutal. 1 linen for 1g = 1 toll paid, they keep it managed
---
Thank fuck. It sucks being a leather wearer and having other classes that can either wear mail or plate also roll on your armor type. Cloth is exclusively intellect based so rogue can literally only roll on leather.
---
Anyone else’s first reaction was to try and whisper them? Lol
---
If druids can still be mana drained in forms, WSG is going to be a nightmare.

How is having 10k people on one realm instead of 2.5/3k the **EXACT** same system for vanilla? Do tell.
---
But their reason to change it was 
---
&gt; to prevent some addons from using communications channels in ways that are contrary to the spirit of the game.
---
I hope I never get like that.  It’s kind of sad in my opinion.
---
Pretty sure regions are just US vs. EU. Otherwise Brazil and Latin america would only have 1 server each. I expect every realm in the US launcher to be in the same BGs
---
You are insulting random people online. Who is the emotional baby? Get a life.

The next 'problem' up on the agenda will be premades in BG's ,and how its ruining classic. They'll cry until BWL's release date is pull forward or some stupid shit.
---
yea and you would be incorrect about both points in this post
---
I did play and cleared up to 4H and ground out R14, and no the wPVP zerg fest we saw did not happen like this in vanilla
---
Download BugSack 
---
It's an add-on that tells you which of your other add-ons are throwing errors.
---
Very useful.
---
Soon (TM)
---
Possibly affects GatherLite too, since that has a function which allows you to receive node locations from people on other servers who are also using the addon. Not in real time though, so...who knows.
---
I mean it really doesn't. I am alliance, I won't have queues. If alliance on other servers stop playing, it doesn't affect me. There is alway tons of horde.
---
Dude I'm in tears whenever one of our Orc tanks shows up with that sword and then they ask for funds for their epic mount. They don't even have edgemasters, it's hilarious. They are are clouded by thoughts of "big sword shiny" instead of just using an axe.
---
Until they have the balls to ban streamers and big profile abusers, this means nothing.
---
This sub is fine.  It goes through phases, no surprise there.
---
More like:
---
"Hey, maybe we should look into how honorable kills work to make the game more enjoyable for people. Maybe once you're level 60, only other 60s give honor?"
---
"Go play animal crossing, you pve casual!"
---
I am praying that getting into BRM should be easier today with BGs being released
---
Mankrik is pretty nice.  Good population, and a good faction balance (slightly favors horde, but hardly matters as a PvE server).  My ignore list only has 3 people on it.
---
Nice guild name haha!
---
I tried it and instant threesome. Can confirm
---
~60 Hours of AV is the figure I've seen thrown around for getting exalted in AV.
---
WSG is significantly more difficult, at least 590 wins to get to exalted.
---
Pretty sure it's the same as open world. 0 honor after the 5th kill and resets every 24 hours. It's supposed to be a 10% decay per kill in 1.12 but it looks like blizzard has left it at 25% decay per kill.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about and clearly put too little thought into this.
---
Everyone wants to be on a 50/50 server, sure.
---
Most players would prefer to be on a faction 90/10 in their favor vs. 60/40 against. That means more people to play with, more guilds raiding, more competition on recipes/patterns driving down prices, better control of resources, less getting ganked.
---
So what you see is people xfering from servers where they're in a slight minority to a server that is either a) slightly in their favor or b) heavily in their favor. In either case, the faction balance gets worse. As the faction balance gets worse, it puts pressure on the other faction to a) quit or b) transfer. Again, in either case the balance gets worse; and you've got a positive feedback loop.
---
You're implying that people would willingly and intentionally PAY MONEY to be on a WORSE server. No one will do that. People *want* a 50/50, but it's the prisoner's dilemma.
---

I get that this a meme but shit like this and whenever someone complains about 'wife aggro' I cringe into the abyss.
---
This has been happening all week on Mirage raceway. SS is just people standing around watching each other "duel" except they are not dueling. I was standing 1,2 and 3 previous weeks. This week I have done hardly anything because I refuse to join and when I try kill people I just get hate from Alliance members that are abusing it. The majority of the top few brackets people are doing this.
---
Have the rogue farm silithus rich thorium nodes and the shaman can watch.
---
Well you know Loot Council is throwing the errors so I would reach out to the developers for help
---
WTB a group of mages for ZF zombie runs, message me dudes, 2 60 mages would be dandy!
---
While the factions are relatively close to 50/50 when looking across all servers, the amount of active PvP players is not 50/50. Horde attracts PvP players due to racials. This is why PvP servers are horde leaning. Alliance attracts more PvE players which is why PvE servers are alliance leaning. As a percent of faction population horde will have more people queuing for battlegrounds at any given time. This will cause queue times for horde. It was true in retail and will be true again. I had instant pop alliance queues then a friend convinced me to faction change. Went to 20min queue times as horde. Hopefully this will cause people to faction change alliance. Instant pop queues is a good incentive to switch.

Watch out, if the druid hots before the pull, he will generate healing aggro, making untouched targets run strait to the druid.

actually sad here, took the day off to go to a few doctors appointments through the day and cant even play wow :(
---
Yeah I haven't heard of "+1" until today. Sure I get the concept and have been in pugs with the general rules, but unless RLs explain what +1 means then it's a shared blame. 
---
I'm not saying that the RL was or wasn't clear here, just that communication is a two way street.
---
After the first week hype wsg will be mostly alliance premade only, and some horde premades and a lot of horde pugs. Alliance pugs will be obliterated by both premades and pugs. (Not considering faction pride, I play alliance, but that will be the reality probably.
---
It probably was, but I was exalted on pservers and I never saw it myself. If it was known it certainly wasnt average knowledge. I always was alliance and don't remember ever dealing with that. 2 or 3 in our base was usually enough to defend any threat. But if they skip the bridge I'm not certain
---
You forgot the r
---
Damn that’s pretty cheap I feel. I’ll definitely do that when I get home. I’d be dropping leatherworking for it but outside of the devilsaur gear that seems incredibly lackluster.
---
Okay.
---
People will still kill you nonetheless :(
---
You get one when you're out of mana and HP is too low to life tap more.  Then you get a second one 1 second before the boss dies.  Haven't you ever played a lock before 😜
---
To this point, here's what I remember:
---
My cooldown timer was still running and had about 2 minutes left so I assumed the stone was still up and was waiting for him to rez himself.  By the time he ran back, all this happened and then I ran back, the timer had reset.  After the group disbanded, I /w the healer to ask about the soustone and he said he didn't know he had one on him.  He went so far as to tell me to make a macro that messages the party and the person that the soulstone was applied.  In all fairness, that was a great point and I've set one up to do that now.
---
It is probably an online relationship
---
I’ve been practicing the AoE trigger but my pet keeps getting smacked either by a melee or the fart cloud.
---
Less buttons to click on the screen.

Not just likely but absolutely https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b90UD4YUigU It just never made it in.
---
Gnomes are the best. 
---
Escape artist to get out of roots AND snares. (see a couple people mentioning things like frost nova, but getting rid of snares can be just as good)
---
Bonus engineering makes it faster, easier, and cheaper to level up engineering, which you will be doing probably twice to get gobbo and gnomisch schematics.
---
By far the most powerful and vexatious /laugh in the game on male gnomes. 
---
And perhaps the most powerful aspect is actually size. My laugh comment might make you think this is a joke, but not even. Gnome rogues can be hard to target when they're jumping around you and you have crippling poison on so you can't easily readjust your position. Especially if there's other actors in the fight.
---
I got a new position in the company that's a city away. I bought a house that's 20 mins away but it's still going through closing. Until then it's a bit over an hour commute each way.
---
&gt;You’ll never experience the battle for ore, farming spots
---
Playing on a balanced PvP server, the majority of my experience with competition was from my own faction.
---
This is a perfect example of a terrible change and a retail mindset. The difference between a level 55 and a level 60 isn’t that much. Two level 55’s should be able to kill a 60 outright.
---
This means that lower levels who are not nearly as disadvantaged in Classic as opposed to retail have a huge advantage over level 60s who essentially get nothing for fighting back.
---
There is already a solution for you and it’s called a PVE server, you literally choose if you want to PvP or not while in the world.
---
PvP takes a risk of getting ganked in any contested area. That’s what you sign up for. Instead of using already in game solutions to problems, instead players want Pappa Blizzard to change the game to turn PvP servers into pseudo PVE servers.
---
That's both directions, which is normal for almost every major city.
---
&gt; WoW is at heart a pve game modeled after other PvE games
---
If you prefer PVE that's fine, however....
---
This is absolutely not factual. The whole Warcraft franchise is based around factional conflict and those factions fighting against each other. This is evident even from the first instalment of the game. World PVP wasn't implemented at release of the game, because they were so far behind scheduled due to the mass amount of content in the game. This was the reason world PVP/The honour system is unpolished. But to say that the game was modelled after purely PVE games isn't correct. I mean, BG instances were present from release (just not accessible).
---
The best gold making profession is dungeon runs. You can make all the pots, charges, etc. but nothing wlil be raw gold from running specific dungeons. Hunters and Mara, etc. etc.
---
Old Blanchy is a PvE realm, so one account can have characters of both factions on it.
---
That's kinda exciting in a goofy way. Like I know I can check out his comics later lol
---
&gt; the only thing I read about nowadays is shitty memes and whines about how they get steamrolled in world PvP  
---
Of course because people who are happy about arent going to come on here and bitch.  You are just experiencing [complainer's bias](https://danpierce.org/2016/05/15/complainers-bias/)   
---
&gt;the social aspect is also nearly gone in classic,  
---
Huh?  Its almost exactly the same now as it was for me back in Vanilla.  I was in an end game raiding guild back then and am in one now and the social aspect is pretty much exactly the same.  I have no idea what you are talking about.   
---
Even questing in the world is the same in regards to the social aspect.    
---
&gt;layers changed in 15 years, you shouldn’t deny that.   
---
I dont disagree that players have changed but i havent noticed a social difference in-game on my server at all yet vs. vanilla.  I wouldnt deny it if it were true that it was different but its just not on my server anyway.
---
agreed!
---
See. It's a win win.
---
still doesn't explain the second discrepancy, but you're right.
---
&gt;The closest thing you'll find to the truth is the Wowhead server population article from a few months back.
---
No, no and no. There was zero control on the data uploaded. You even described the issues with it above!
---
I really hate that Wowhead pushed such article and did zero crosschecking.
---
For sure. They knocked it out of the park with the be soundtrack
---
clickerrrrrrrr
---
&gt; Cloth is exclusively intellect based so rogue can literally only roll on leather
---
eh, cloth wearers are in the same boat, many pieces are wanted by rdruids, rshams, as well as other cloth users
---
its actually true and can be confirmed, the downvoting of anyone not promoting the lie about there being so few alliance is petty.
---
I prefered the LFG channel.  Dont ask me why but i did, it was more personal.
---
"Gotta go bird is stuck on the roof sry"
---
Ah yes let me abandon the character I've put so much work into for a faction who's races I dislike the look of. You see your strawmans here?
---
checking honor spy's total pool on both factions of your server is a good indicator.
---
for example last night fairbanks alliance had about 2600 and 4000 horde meaning alliance had 2600/6600, about a 40/60 split.
---
I was more thinking on class balance and how some are way better at this game mode than others.
---
Yeah, the timing was pretty tight all around which I think added to the confusion.  When the others released and ran back they didn't hit any respawned mobs.  By the time I did, the first hallway had respawned and when the group tried to run back to get me the garden was repopping.  The timing related to the soulstone wearing off and the respawns was razor thin and I think contributed to the situation.
---
Yes, I am the one that's delusional.  :rolls eyes:
---
They didn’t have a backup of the data, which is quite believable. Source code was available but a lot of this stuff wasn’t stored in source code.
---
? It works precisely as he described in classic.
---
Honorspy has been working just fine since they switched to the new way of gathering and syncing data.  Nothing is going to change with the patch.  The patch is just to prevent any other addon from causing chat lag like HonorSpy did before its update.
---
i know I did, Climbed above IF too.   until i got ported back and given a stern warning.
---
This. See if anybody in your raid is logging them, or post your guild/character name and people here can check and look through some fights for you.
---
Yeah. I'd also be pissed if I was on a 55/45 server and got merged with an 80/20 server.
---
But what's so difficult about alt-tabbing? Seems a lot easier than fumbling to get my phone out.
---
in raids you'd be surprised as well, the enemies that don't really punish you for not having a taunt, yah crits hurt, but you'll survive if you pick up raw stats. You're way way way tankier than a dual wield fury warrior in that respect.
---
It's a weak aura bar. It makes a bar and estimates how much damage can be absorbed by for example a greater fire protection potion.
---
Even having people on voice and queuing with a countdown was relatively effective.
---
You mean I can't trust youtube with 100% accurate information? darn
---
That is a new one... At least he put some effort in
---
I suspect honor-hungry players will use it as often as they can, but it'll take coordination from a few individuals to pull off. I know when I was playing AV on retail me and four friends would just rush bunker GY at the start of every map, and it all but guaranteed victory every time.
---
First off out of the 7 or so people that don't understand how the reply function works i'm choosing your comment to reply to everyone. 
---
My calculation is of the total population of the game world yes, when you are fighting 2v1 i'm not counting 50% of a player.... I guess there was some confusion from my initial reading. I would hazard a guess to say most servers are around 60/40 and better.
---
Well congrats on the twins! Couldn't tell
---
It’s nowhere near r14 grind. Again I can’t give a perfect timetable but I got exalted before I got my first epic drop from mc. And I played decently casual in vanilla. I just liked pvp. So I was raiding side by side with the av grind and got exalted first. That’s a decent timetable in my opinion.
---
lol, take my upvote
---
I got lucky and found a guild that wanted a ret paladin so I'm lucky to get to play full ret 11/8/32. I'm even allowed to roll/be considered for onslaught, QSR, and flameguards. I lucked out :P
---
Yep. If you equip and use it during the Rend fight you can even summon Vael to help you out.
---
Ziqo was playing all of the CDL on Faerlina from Switzerland and he did just fine at top end pvp. I don't think it's a problem.
---
i know it isnt realistic thats why im asking here lol
---
Without CRBGs some people just wouldn't be able to do bgs because they would sit in queues. They're an absolute necessity.
---
Yeah your guild should have a tank&gt;warrior&gt;melee dps prio. I really hope you’re not giving to casters.
---
maybe you weren't in the LFG channel
---
I've never been addicted to it. Hell I canceled all my mmo subscriptions because I just don't have interest in mmo's anymore. I wanted to play Classic not because I thought classic was a better game. It's not, it's actually way worse than retail. Balance sucks and class design and gear design are trash. I wanted the classic experience, not the private server one. So the community drove me to quit. I don't like playing with all the private server guys going on and on about bis and optimal rotations and specs and shit. Classic isn't hard by any stretch of the means none of that is needed.
---
Now that is more believable haha
---
If everyone wants to be horde they should pay the price of que. It is only realistic to have ques when imbalance as the BGs are not XvX
---
Every UBRS run ever, I need drops from Drakkisath but half the raid leave after Rend...
---
True, which is why improved sprint is a must for kiting warriors.  Breaks those movement impairing effects plus makes moving in/out for hemo strikes easier.  It means passing on cold blood which is really not as useful as it sounds.  Imp sprint &gt; cold blood.
---
You could not. You could only queue a group of 5 for AV, trying to get more people into the same one required an addon or other methods of syncing your queue time with other groups.
---
Might be a daylight savings thing? Some places don't change the time anymore and it might've used that time. That or idk. Small indie company watcha gonna do haha.
---
Clear all raid content through Naxx
---
Do enough AV to get exalted and Rank 3 for discount
---
Hit exalted w/ Argent Dawn and all 4 home factions
---
Have enough money banked to buy both flying and epic flying if they release TBC before TBC drops
---
Leveling was rough I must admit. However I started having great sex the night before I raid so she’s nicer to me, the other day I washed her car... wow
---
Not all streamers are bad. It's the more popular ones who got there by being toxic. The lower viewer ones are literally you and me playing, while being recorded. It's always nice to look at it for a class perspective (if you wanted to roll that class, learn how to counter it with yours).
---
How can you even really tell if someone is win trading though? Thats what people here are missing. You cant just look at data and see people killing each other and say its trading because people can fighter over an area for a long time.  
---
Need a lot more proof than just that and then you have people looking for honorable fights who will let the enemy heal up before fighting. Is that win trading? No.  
---
You need to be able to prove intent, thats why you cant just start banning people.
---
Yep, your in game meter is wrong, the combat log is correct.
---
Does Twitch realize it's the Classic client and not Retail, though?
---
He isn’t not right.
---
Watch out boys, here comes another 500 paragraph post about why blizzard should change stuff.
---
Im not saying one faction is more toxic then the other. I am saying this sub specifically is extremely toxic towards anyone on the horde.
---
As a rogue main, I don't get the hype.
---
Wouldn’t mind a Classic+ &amp; book abilities would be cool. But personally I rather just play BC how it came out bc it was fun to me. I’m not a “no changes” type of person though. 1-60 then 60-70 was cool to me bc of the flying, the new world with new levels, &amp; the feeling of even more progression after finishing everything Vanilla had to offer. I’m not totally against adding to classic but if it was my choice I’d choose the xpac content how it was presented at the time.
---
Woah there’s bad players on both sides?
---
Actually their is money to be made with engi. Especially with all the try harder that want engi for PVP, they usually are lazy and willing to buy crafted ingeneer mats.
---
But it casts fast and sounds really cool...
---
ashenvale, thats where i hang out
---
I honestly fail to see why would alliance be obliterated. Alliance racials are much more better in PvP per individual basis.
---
That means you'd have to have a constant resurgence of new enemies throughout the day in BGs to get anything from it. That just doesn't seem right to me. Don't you get queued against people closer to your PvP rank also? Like a premade of rank 10+ would more likely face against 10+ enemies.
---
In Vanilla most of us were kids with no jobs, family, or responsibilities. I like WoW, but my real life will always come first since you know, that’s permanent and WoW isn’t.
---
Why no Toep? Also i would take the spell pen from 5pc t1 over extra stats from t2
---
Back in my day we lagged so bad Blizzard gave us credit.
---
This fix does not seem to work on Macs atm. (I know, who games on a mac, but c'est la vie)
---
You still had to message/talk to the group leader.
---
No one knows. It could be just random
---
Yea, I was expecting to spend 300g+ to get engineering up that high and was pleasantly surprised. Check the prices tonight, but be aware that they'll be cheaper if purchased on the weekend (usually). And there's not too much money to be made with Leatherworking in this phase, IMO. The Devilsaur set is the most common craft and I'd imagine most people that need it these days already has it.
---
ME AND THE BOYS
---
are we considering tight-knit communities singular guilds?  groups of like-minded guilds? the general populace of the server of that faction?  My playing of classic has been pretty casual.  tied to a single guild on a non-pvp rp server.  
---
While I agree I like the player base better on classic, I don't think this is 100% tied to being on the existence of servers.  I think it is more about the maturity and mindset of the player base.
---
For what it's worth, after this when I was talking directly to the priest, he said he had no idea the stone was applied to him and told me about making a macro that lets the group and target know I've applied the stone, which is a valid point.  But as I remember, my cooldown timer was still running around 2 minutes when the initial wipe happened hence my waiting for a rez.  I just assumed he'd pop it off and start rezzing...
---
wow as a single player game sucks
---
players, both allied and enemy, is what makes it fun
---
higher highs and lower lows is what makes a game popular and memorable
---
The must all work for Comcast.
---
Why don't you stop being a pansy and re-roll as alliance? Everyone knew horde was easy-mode before the faction imbalance issue and now your faction is on auto-pilot.
---
Yes...you actually are. Legit pity you.
---
No talent points in threat mitigation makes it even more fun for everyone when it crits!
---
Are you proud that half of the professional athletes playing your sport suffer brain damage or other neurological problems before they even turn 40?
---
Im sure they will get or it. 🤣
---
But its easy enough fix that its just easier to rename it.
---
Yeah dude, Feathermoon is on the wrong side. Just run from Thallanar to the DME entrance north of Mojache then die to mobs once inside and corpse run into DMT.
---
Jesus. Please don't attempt to correct anyone else's maths. 40:60 ratio means 50% more players for the dominant side.
---
There's really no "rotation" for warlocks. You put up your assigned curse, keep up corruption, and SB. He could be using more consumables than you, has more world buffs, better RNG, or a combination of all 3. Hard to tell without logs. Do you have logs?
---
As a rogue, I agree, but it's still better than the hunter class call.
---
A rock :'D
---
Its our best guess.  If you were forced to wager your lifesavings that is the number you should guess.  But if you were asked if you want to wager your lifesavings you should say no because it really is just a guess from randomish pollings.
---
OK Boomer!
---
True, but if you’ve ever tanked for trash shadowpriests you get a special feel looking at this.
---
Without wow returning I would still be playing on private servers
---
Hi all,
---
I'd like to ask your input on a skill set that I am currently considering to respec into.
---
First of all a little bit about me:
---
1. I created a warrior because I want a toon that hits monters with a 2h weapon while wearing the heaviest armor
---
* This means I will not wear anything but plate armor, BiS be damned
---
* I will not dual-wield, max. DPS be damned
---
1. If 1. did not make it obvious enough, I do not care to be the "best I can be" or "squeeze out ever last point of possible DPS"
---
* WoW is a game I enjoy for leisure not some competetive (e)sport I play to beat others
---
* I have de-installed the DPS-meter I only had because it was among the recommended "all around mod package"
---
That being said, my current spec is this:
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/053040203520105001-0505-0505](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/053040203520105001-0505-0505)
---
Classical arms-MS-spec with a little dip into protection for some extra survivability while farming.
---
I have a fix raid group and we're all doing just fine in MC, so there is no pressure on me to change. Nevertheless I have been thinking on whether I should maybe play by 2h warrior as furry instead of arms. To make it short, I am considering this:
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/05302020332-05050135005010051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/05302020332-05050135005010051)
---
To me this seems like a pretty good idea, but my introduction may have already given you the clue that I actually have no idea what I am talking about ;)
---
My expectation of what were to change if I would respec is basically that at the end of the day I would still be doing the same as I am doing now.
---
* I am still hammering at a 6s cooldown, 20 rage instant attack, doesn't really seem to matter whether this is mortal strike or blood thirst.
---
* I lose the added survivability from the little foray into protection, but gain the small heal after suffering a crititcal hit.
---
* I lose 2% general 2h damage increase and the potential proc from sword spec, but I gain the added extra damage every time I crit.
---
I don't remember this either. I started playing just before cross server BGs. 
---
I remember the only reason to go to the actual entrances was to buy the gear.
---
I even upgraded the gf to the wife and newborn child withoit thinking.  Don't recommend.
---
I don’t know what these people are talking about, but farming Mara is much easier than dmt solo runs. IMO Mara is a 4/10 difficulty, hunter epic quest 8/10, and dmt solo is 9/10.
---
Fair enough.  I'm really not trying to have anyone prove my case, I just want to understand what general consensus is given this is my first time playing through some of these dungeons.
---
undead racial is one of the most OP and most desired racials in the game
---
fears are literally everywhere, and no matter if your dps or heals, having an instant break on a relatively short CD is broken overpowered
---
&gt;There's nothing competitive or skillful about making the right decision when most of the information is given to you.
---
You should invest into some stocks
---
Fun fact our guild leader is a girl
---
Really? You think the difference between 58 and 59 is roughly the same as 59 and 60? You're trying to tell me that a 60 warrior in full epics has no chance against two 55s who have barely had a chance to start putting together pre raid bis?
---
Cmon man.
---
It's all a ploy to get you to check out BfA while Classic is updating.
---
Me explaining what I did isn't a complaint... Do you know how to read?
---
Well I have Retail installed so not sure I can just rename it like because I think that's Retails .exe already.
---
and if you taunt after his mindblast landed you'll have a huge threat lead on everybodyelse.
---
Lol, also how it feels to run a premade wsg vs a pug group.
---
idk why they didnt do smaller deathwing type events tbh and maybe have some kind of NPCs that could "look back in time" to show you what the world WAS like. Kinda sounds like they are doing something similar in shadowlands but I mean a much much smaller scale like.......  
---
Like how I guess the AQ40 gates was a big server wide event and everyone had to participate and it sort of change the world by opening the gates etc. Would have been cool to have those world events maybe like change a starter zone or something like maybe the alliance takes more lands or the horde based on real events in game or something.   
---
That way older zones would get refreshes to content, people could potential do old content through some kind of oracle type mechanic (\*Let me show you da past mon\*) and then the new events in those zones could be geared to mostly 60 players but find ways to have lowbies participate?   
---
Seemingly organic small world changing events I think would have been a better direction. Kinda sounds like how Pantheon wants to do some content tbh
---
You should try jumping puzzles in Guild Wars 2...I did that for years lol
---
I feel personally attacked here.
---
Level 60 for sure just like everyone here has mentioned. SP shouldn't matter too much though, will just make it faster. You would probably want at least 2.5-3k hp though as it will allow you more room for error. If Zevhrim gets a sacrifice cast off on you, you'll die if you don't have 2.5k health. Back whenever I was like half pre-bis I had a tough time learning how to run it without dieing. 3rd boss definitely requires more gear to down and the 4th boss even more so.
---
Been playing other games.
---
They don't use census, they use the data collected via the census. It's very different. They are inaccurate due to the lack of control on the uploads. The addon itself is fine to get representative samples.
---
"Not knowing he had one" is bullshit. If you die, the option comes up and you have to actively click no.
---
night elf warriors are actually great tanks. Maybe the best base stats of all the allys to tank(excluding weapon skills). Tallest too so easy to not LOS, my gnome warrrior when I tank gets LOS'd by 1-2 steps on a staircase. And like shadowmeld is an interesting ability, for a warrior or tank who lives a pull and needs to wait for a healer or something.
---
For rogues they're a terrible choice.
---
Yeah I live 15 minutes from my work when its not rush hour, but during rush hour it's over an hour.
---
I can't believe how gold this post is . And we can conclude that when the economy is good that everything turns out to be good aswell. That's a big slap on Blizzard face here , they are the one taking the good part of it and they had all the statistics of population provided to proceed on a way to fix the unbalanced issue. But they havn't reacted and that's a shame . Giving 'free' transfers was clearly not enough as a measured of balance and they knew it . Now by paid transfers they will revive those cancelled sub and cash out more. Today compagnies are aiming on every possible way of ripping money of players and that is why video games right now sucks. They should instead be dedicated to gives players a great game experience like they used to and im convinced they know how and ill stay positive that it will happen.
---
Are servers seriously down til 6 PM PST?
---
If the healer (Paladin/Priest/Shaman) has a SS, you wait for him to res you, if he releases, you run back as a group so the trash doesn't separate you.
---
In your specific case, IDK why the Priest didn't use the SS, maybe he thought he'd aggro and die again as he resed, but assuming he's intelligent enough not to die within range of enemies, he should've SSed and resed everyone up. There is no such thing as "wasting mana" when you're out of combat.
---
Pve elitism is just as bad, that's exactly what you're doing
---
&gt;bullshit ganking
---
Sounds pretty salty.
---
That’s what I have read a few places but players are getting 150k-200k a week on my server. Are the honor points we are seeing different than the ranking points you are talking about?
---
Volatile power isnt bis. You need 5pc t1 for the spell pen and 2 pc pvp gear
---
It's okay I understand that we have different likes. She used to hate that I smoke weed, now she's okay with it. I used to be a player in my youth so I think she finds comfort in knowing that I'm getting high and gaming in the safety of my home, rather than being out with my friends and her getting jealous acting as if every girl that sees me can't resist me or I lack the self control. Anyways I do it cause it makes her feel better and I don't mind it because I love smoking and gaming.
---
The way the old world lays out if absolutely perfect for Classic WoW to to a "Plus" Option. There are so many pockets you can open up and explore as fill them with high level enemies. There are tons of dungeon and raid areas you could create that fit in lore-wise. Hell, even areas already made could be retro-fit into the game. Kara, Grim Batol, Hyjal, Deepholme, Kezan, Tol'vir, Gilneas. So many legit options to expand a few more tiers. 
---
Obviously band-aids would have to applied to things like gearing to balance the game. I think a lot of gear would have to have Stamina tacked-on to increase player health pools so the game isn't a one-shot fest. You might even be better off balancing classes and pulling up some BC changes like Prot Pallies and the like to fix a few glaring balance issues. I'm not saying change the whole game, but...we're kind of changing the whole game when we do this. 
---
The real question is, do you trust people making this to do that? Are you willing to wait at Naxx for a long time to have this happen? Pandora's Box opens when you start doing this and you can't put it back.
---
8 hours according to Blizzard
---
But you can stabilize or, with time, reverse downward trends. Never happened in retail. Until they stopped sharing sub counts a few years ago, the game had been on a downward trend ever since Cata, and likely still is. Though, it would be hard to see now since subs for classic and retail are one in the same. In fact classic might lead to the first significant upward trend in a near decade.
---
Gehennas has a 65:35 H:A ratio. Run the census any evening on both sides and you will see it yourself.
---
WHAT!? They didn't use Ravenholdt for that? I'd bet the people in charge of development didn't even know about that place.
---
yea, i recent bought krol blade so i didnt have to grind dal rends so i could most raid log most of time. better balance for me, wife is happy with it.
---
its less dps but i cant imagine it matters much.
---
Or maybe you're just not very good at games?
---
lmao what? What happened with grobbulus and a congressman? 
---
I have a low level alt on Grob it's been hilarious most logins.
---
Yup, all the hardworking farmers of Westfall have been made obsolete, being replaced with automated machines. Too bad they don't have a universal basic income of 1000 silver a month to help them make ends meet in this time of strife. The kingdom of Stormwind takes 5% of AH profits but pays zero in taxes. Where does the money go? Not to the people of the Alliance, that's for sure.
---
An addon breaking chat for the server is contrary to the spirit of the game.
---
Transfer from PvP to PvE realm to level and gear up, transfer back to PvP realm when you are in a good spot will probably be the common plan of action
---
Ever heard of precasting?
---
...started my own business instead of putting it off for "the next weekend"
---
Right and faction tension is not the same as pvp.  
---
And no WoW was modeled after EQ, which is a super heavy pve focused game.  
---
As for your comment regarding the RTS's yes the campaigns are heavily focused on faction tension.  Which is guess what, pve.  All the pvp in those games doesn't care about faction tension.
---
So if you actually filter it to 60s only rather than including all the level 1s that dont count, there is more horde.
---
47% to 53%
---
fAcTs MaTtEr
---
It shouldn't, they actually are pretty low impact compared to some of the addons this is targetting.
---
K
---
Not in vanilla there isn't.  You could argue UBRS and Onxyia, but those are actual pieces of gear you wear, not keys.
---
Short of a huge slew of Relic Coffer Keys for gold-farming runs, I don't carry a single key on my Rogue.
---
FemDwarf squad represent. Best kick animation in game
---
Nah, you're supposed to queue it up as the tank is shooting/running up to the mob.
---
In their defense, they are a small Indie company. It's not like they have hundreds of millions to spend on things.
---
spinar reaper
---
Negative, classiclfg works on a global channel for data.
---
&gt; alliance can defend that spot pretty easily if they really bother to do.
---
Here's hoping.
---
Yea just like layering was not questionable and was the right move right?
---
Imagine servers having their own personality, and not all being watered down to the exact same thing...  you know, the trend that started retail into becoming what retail is now?
---
Despite what people used to say, herbalism is no where near as profitable as it used to be, likely because everyone was told it was a good money maker and now servers have too many, meaning a surplus in supply. On the other hand, less people have gone mining this time round and as a result its making a hell of a lot more gold (at least on my server).
---
I actually made a fortune just making Iron grenades and selling them on the AH. Way more than I ever did with herb.
---
yes, your honor merely contributes to the bracket you fall under, which is what desides how much Ranking points you will get per week. It takes almost 3 months AFAIK to get to r14 at the absolute fastest pace.
---
While it could last all 8 hours, their estimates are always super conservative.... 90% of the time the servers are back up much earlier than they predict.
---
Why are people excited for this?  This is a fucking awful idea!!!  This will ruin balance basically forever... Herod will turn into 80% horde to 20% Alliance and it's already at 60% horde to 40% Alliance.
---
Blown a lot of money of pointless things to pass the time
---
except for the fact that the servers are down
---
Most people were after the dungeon sets i'd wage, coupled with the fact that items in early iterations said things like "increases your spell damage by a little" no one was really certain what anything did. Random dungeon loot was seen as meh as people chased their iconic sets.  
---
I could be wrong but thats what myself and players around me did.
---
&gt; Giving 'free' transfers was clearly not enough as a measured of balance and they knew it 
---
It made it worse lol, they allowed the underdog faction on all servers to transfer, and so they did and left the servers worse off.
---
Those people also transfered to servers where their faction was already in the majority, and fuckd those servers up too.
---
Absolutely. I have 1000+ hours in FFXIV and the bots are essentially allowed to just run free, presumably because they pay a sub. It sucks. Its one of the things that made me want to come try this game.
---
I've been killing it as herb/alch and fishing
---
You wish. They need 8 hours to update on their end apparently.
---
A ploy to get people to log into BfA? Who knows
---
Oh man the dunning-kruger revolving around the stock market is great.
---
this is very much hyperbole
---
Oh I get it, I've hit too close to home. Well that was bound to happen.
---
Quick AV premade wins. Sub 10 mins ideally.
---
Hashtagnochanges
---
Well then I'm the asshole once again. Thanks a lot
---
If there are respawns and pats, it would more efficient and less time consuming for the healer to soulstone and res and continue and get mana back from drinking. The healer better not have this mentality when doing raids, you dont see people in MC all running back when healers have soulstones and anhks.
---
Then there is people who leave because you have to clear again, the healer in this instance caused the tank to leave by refusing to SS and res and continue.
---
It's negligible.
---
I does
---
normie
---
Druids are fucking awesome, you sophomoric peasant.
---
Please quote me exactly in this thread where I have complained about Alliance and griefing.
---
" 
---
The horde's behaviour was never about pvping or gaining honour. It was about taking out their awful mental issues on something. That something happened to be the other faction in WoW." - Bitching &amp; Complaining.
---
Not played a few hours a day for a couple of weeks and unsubbed at lvl 28.
---
It's not normal, but it's definitely normie.
---
You asked the question, why so defensive?
---
What it actually did was warp the economy and create a situation where servers were playing with way more resources than they would normally have.
---
Imagine blizzard just being willing to you know pay more for more servers.
---
YTA.  It is your sworn duty to protect your own faction.
---
If I'm not mistaken, in classic and even retail random BG's there is no 'MMR' or hidden number to position you with others around your skill or honor level. Totally random.
---
The alliance have DM on 24/7 lockdown.
---
No mercy.
---
The game doesn't stop you from ninja-looting, but there are social consequences in your actions. If you grief people excessively, instead of in moderation, you will eventually drive them away from the game. 
---
I fail to see how this is so hard to understand. We didn't have as many assholes back then, at this extreme degree. There's a difference to killing a lowbie every once in a while, and camping them for  hours, preventing them from leveling.
---
What other posibilitys do humans have besides the normal horse as a mount?
---
If everyone dies and spirit res you should too.
---
I don't think any class in the game can compete with the burst of Arms warrior on 2-3 targets with a good 2 hander. Sweeping strikes, whirlwind, and cleave is insanely strong.
---
happen to you often?
---
Oh wow you finished your rhokdelar, wow what an ultimate sign of skill, those demons can't be cheesed at all.  LOL
---
But that's where people Blizz did Classic WRONG. By 1.12 servers had ample time to establish themselves. Which is why people pushed instead of phases like they did to do patches instead. So we got changes as they came and not balance issues left and right because we have 1.12 class balance but launch raids. And PvP on servers would be a lot more developed with only being able to fight your own server.
---
Why would I take away some dudes chance to smack down a higher level ganker? That is honestly one of the single best feeling moments in this game. 
---
Too bad he lost, but if we intervene we automatically deny them the chance.
---
what the fuck, there is blood splash? can I turn it up
---
I'd still be playing Overwatch
---
Krol and mirahs when I simmer it last was between 10-15 dps less than dal rends. Up to you if it’s worth farming it or not based on that number. 
---
I personally didn’t because I got to around 100 runs without it and figured I’d get a raid sword soon (1 brutality blade and no viskags raiding since week 3 QQ). My dps wasn’t noticeably worse than any other rogues until they started getting raid weapons though, so as long as your playing properly, Krol + mirahs is fantastic, especially if it means not farming dal rends forever
---
Why does the honor system have anything to do with it.  For a level 60 no honor is involved.
---
It is not required that we spend our time refereeing or trying to fix disputes between other people.  Most of us have jobs, lives, etc... that limit our play time.  That is why I get involved in PVP when I feel like it and I have no assumptions that other people should help me fight if they are nearby.
---
If the OP was fishing or doing anything else for that matter it's not his obligation to get involved.  Period.  If he does get involved in this case - then next thing you know the Dwarf Priest calls in reinforcements and the OP ends up wasting 30-60 minutes of his time getting killed or trying to go find a new spot to fish, etc...  Basically could ruin whatever play time he has for the evening.
---
Everyone is so entitled thinking that every player has to drop whatever they are doing to come help and it's honestly annoying.  Highest level of these annoying people are the ones that start shit with the opposing faction (and usually with people well above their level) and when they get beat they expect everyone to form up an army to defend them... nope, not my problem to fix someone being stupid.
---
Bottom line ... OP's play time is his play time - he can choose to do with it what he wants.
---
well i did that. only that after 2 pulls i was oom due to shapeshifting.
---
so i just said fuck it and went full bear.
---
Imagine *not* when there’s like three drops.
---
Unless that mod from vanilla is still around are premades a thing for av?
---
Literally seeing it all the time from bads using spy addons thinking they are really skillful because they farm honor gud.
---
Dont worry guys, live is back within an hour. Let's all gO tO rEtAiL
---
No stealth?!?
---
cheap lotus lol
---
Retail was supposed to be up an hour ago. Classic is supposed to be down all day.
---
It's easier for you *now* because you practiced it. Take any lvl 60 hunter, have them do Tribute and Princess runs, and 99 times out of 100 they will complete princess quicker.
---
Having said that, it's worth practicing tribute because over the long run there is more profit/usefulness than princess runs.
---
#2 on dmg means nothing
---
I can see the truth and wisdom in your post and I agree with it. But, how would you go about those changes and new patches ? Would you trust this new team that handles Classic ?
---
Remember - it took three months for a keyring.
---
There's 9 paladins at our main raid(s)  and 6 in our alt/social raid.... Cant relate
---
They're down until 6 PM.
---
What are some ways that the non-loot drops from Raid are distributed/used? Items like Essence of Fire. They are currently going to a guild bank alt, but noone has really cared to mention what the plan for them is, so it is very easy without the guild bank of TBC to appear that they are just going to the private stash of the guild leader.
---
Why would you say negative, global channel data sharing is exactly the api function that's being gutted.
---
Try back in 6 hours according to the message
---
Idk personally but i did read that sword of zeal is better top end dps then krol blade. And i think my guild has 2 swords of zeal from ony
---
theres many bugs they didnt want in game, but they were still there.
---
Alright awesome, thanks for the help. Next stop raid weapons... much better for game + life balance.
---
I sure would, Cataclysm is by far the best state WoW was ever in.
---
Generally the latency is mild, and due to spell batching it really doesnt matter. Spell batching muddles that quite well, so being precise with ability usage on low latency get gimped by default.
---
Engineering as a money maker? How?
---
If you think tribute runs are easier than kiting princess you're doing them wrong.
---
You ever wonder why we're here?
---
I love all the SHUTUP BOOMER comments on the Twitter post.
---
In equal gear (which never happens) and in short fights, Druids will out DPS mages on laid bosses thanks to starfire and curse of shadow.
---
Sadly, gear and mana become major major issues.
---
Well if you wanna be the best druid leveler, I would recommend doing green quests as cat form. You'll never have to drink and you only stop to heal yourself every 3rd mob.
---
Because Classic is “new” to this generation.
---
The initial release for a ton of games are always packed at first. The true question of whether it’s nostalgia or if vanilla WoW was a “better” game will be Classic+ (whether they keep the soul of Classic alive or start to retailize it is another issue)
---
Until you hit 60 and you're stuck being Healer or GTFO. They're not as versatile as the description of the class makes you think in reality.
---
Re: human warrior with OEB, but I believe the hit cap is still worth going for, because the gear that gives it is still worth using
---
Ya the priest probably has shadowform from 40 which is a huge leap in powerlevel for a priest. So for sure unfair fight. 
---
I probably woulda send him a passive aggressive “thanks for the help bud” and corpse ran.
---
This is brilliant
---
... bought FIFA 20 (like I had the previous 3 years) and wasted my entire fall and winter playing online soccer matches.
---
I just got Metro actually. Hoping it’s as good as the books
---
Sometimes in my half hearted troll attempts it does, yes. 
---
Doesn't change the fact that you're still the asshole also tho. So we have something in common, we could be besties if you want I'll give you my aim id
---
well LK wasn't too bad either. it's just that two other raids were pure garbadge.
---
Alliance are bad at PvP and have had no experience pvping
---
Bro I had to pug MC last week cause I couldnt make my guilds weekly run and I had this exact problem, on literally every trash pull this fucking spriest pulled threat .1 seconds into the pull, I was actually so butt hurt lmao
---
Not all of them 😉
---
This is going to make ranking a lot harder.  Before people had an idea where they were and could stop.  Now with it being unknown, everyone will have to push more to be safe.
---
At least, yeah
---
&gt;oh, I'm not angry, and you haven't proven anything... but you are a dumb ass that's for sure.
---
["I'm not angry"](https://i.imgur.com/dTcAHZc.jpg)
---
&gt;Yea just like layering was not questionable and was the right move right?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Lol
---
Implying that's not the case lol. Layering absolutely was necessary for the initial rush or thousands of people would have given up in the first week.
---
NE and Ram Mounts once u get exalted with Darn and IF
---
Got to 60 ubrs runs without seeing the MH, saw the OH 11 times. I gave up because I got my guilds first viskag
---
Moral of the story is people who want to whine will whine. No one here has a gun to their head and has to play the game. But people want to whine will have a new topic to whine about.
---
I tank with a Gnome buddy - Its a fun duo - little and big together! I think it helps being a night elf. Easy for the raid to follow the towering tank. Helps to better coordinate the raid. "Stay behind me so you don't pull" is easier to follow when you can actually find the tank! - Either way I think any class can do just fine in any roll - Except being a dwarf priest is always the smart(est) decision!
---
RTS still have their own set of choreography, dont deceive yourself into thinking there isnt. Even Chess, which has thousands upon thousands of permutations has a dance to it.
---
I’d give you a passive aggressive “thanks for the help” and move on with my day.
---
That's pretty cool, I didn't know about the arcane resistance reduction on curse of shadow. Most MC bosses go down in like a minute, so a boomer would be decent with gear?
---
What’s the helmet called?
---
My buddy is a tank in a guild on another server, and said he lost Shoulders of might, the might chest piece, and the boots to a fury warrior who does OT for them on one fight. He was fuming, and I really can't blame him.
---
That sounds fucking painful my dude.
---
Our main tank has Perdition's but has pretty much stated that he wants Brutality so he can main tank fury with both.. not sure how I Feel.
---
Until you go hotw/ns and have 2 free bag slots cause the rest is filled with different gear sets...THANK GOD FOR THE KEYRING. Now im rolling with 7 free slots
---
the verdict is still out, although a lot of people are telling me im an asshole for not one shotting gray level players, so who knows, maybe ill join you
---
I thought it was 3pm EST?
---
Needs more hyperbole!
---
I was just explaining what I did, actually..
---
Come back and complain when you are downing Rag in the first phase and don't have to deal with the fire adds.  Until then any upgrade to gear to any member of your raid helps.
---
Imagine thinking that the benefit of layering actually helped the game when it messed up the economy and made progression even easier... lul
---
While I dont like CRBGs in theory... I'm horde on Stalagg, I NEED them.
---
I did the same and can only recommend it. Going from zero spelldmg to full shadoweave was a huge boost in killspeed and joy. The felcloth set, for its price, was only a small upgrade so I went straight for prebis after like 52 (soon as you can enter BRD)
---
As for your general question about what to do with the gold: save as much as you can so you can get your 100% mount asap
---
Your wife's a therapist that gets jealous if you go out with your friends?
---
Notice how you only see one kid on the court with him at a time? Thats because if there were two kids on the court he would stealth and hide under the docks.
---
The highest rag parse for a while (maybe still idk) was a horde 2h fury wielding bre.
---
Our guild bank (alt) bags/bank are weekly put up in screenshot on discord, where there is a channel that guild members can ask for stuff in it that benefits the guild (for example a tank crafting fire res stuff).
---
I completely agree with this post and have had the same experience.
---
So.
---
When we get him down in the first phase will that make the bad players better? What the fuck is this comment at all.
---
In that case you would be wrong. Even if we assume 1.12 itemization has 200 extra spell damage over early vanilla itemization, which is probably a way high estimate, it would only amount to about 30% extra damage for eg. mages — nowhere near "nearly double".
---
&gt;so many faction installations and bases around
---
?
---
There's one small horde outpost and an even smaller Alliance outpost.
---
So what exactly is the point of you posting here, on a sub for a game you don’t play. Do you want pity? You’ll get none, from either faction.
---
Ww only hits 4 targets, but a white swing would trigger 1 extra hit, and then yes ww would trigger 4 extra hits. Expending the buff
---
I think that was just going to connect to the tunnel between Felwood/Winterspring/Moonglade
---
GF costs a lot more than $15 a month, let me tell ya
---
Like I said, it's only a slight advantage. But when you're trying to fight 10 people in warsong gulch and they all look the same it's harder to prioritize targets. At the upper levels of competition it can mean the priest getting off 2 extra heals or the druid getting off a few moonfires before you figure out who is who in the backline.
---
I have all the respect in the world for you guys. I don't pick fights with y'all unless it's 1v1. Cannot imagine what you guys go through. I log in at Tanaris and see 9 Ally 1 Horde in Gadget. Crazy shit.
---
Ah thank you, I don't have twitter, and I misread the battle.net app. I thought it meant the realm was going to be down at 3pm. Not from 7am to 3pm. Thanks for the link I appreciate it.
---
Darn ! you got me!
---
that counterattack with a low-quality meme! Can't do anything about it!
---
I'll just keep being angry everytime I cross a zone and suffer through that non-existant hiccup!
---
you could atleast put some effort in your replies.
---
I’d be rotating between Apex, Halo MCC on PC, and Overwatch.
---
Friends list let's you make a note for each character you have on it which is handy.
---
Thanks for your feedback. Any reason why? 
---
Currently I am almost always in berserker stance, I only switch the battle stance after an enemy dodge to hit him with a skilled overpower (with a one button makro that automatically switches stance and casts overpower) and then immediately switch back to berserker.
---
With my current spec I can take 20 rage with me (and don't have anger management) and with the new version I would take only 10 with me (just enough to overpower and still have no anger management)
---
Let's hope it isnt like Classic where the servers will come up and proceed to crash multiple times for the remainder of the day.
---
Like I said, PVP it's situational but most of the time paladins will be better.
---
PVE I stand firm, onslaught got beat in their world fastest MC because of sloppiness not because of op pallys.
---
50k exp from a single quest is definitely a private server bug.
---
Option three, faction queue would be a great way to kill the game.
---
for both of them do you have high value recipes
---
Tailor would be like runecloth bags, mooncloth bags, fel cloth gear.
---
Enchanting would be stuff not learned from the trainers like +healing/spell power crusader etc.
---
If you dont have these high value recipes for both you will be fine to drop them you can always re level them later if needed with a day of grinding cloth for when ZG is out if you need that crafted gear.
---
I personally have Herb Tailor bc i can craft all fel cloth gear both bags and robes of winter night.
---
I consider it a big cost. You have to make a brand new keybind that's separate from your normal Whirlwind key (you definitely don't want to macro Berserker Rage to EVERY Whirlwind) and then keep that key in an easy-to-reach position so that you can hit it, then quickly go back to defensive stance and start stacking Sunders. 
---
Warriors have enough keybinds as is. It's not worth wasting one of your valuable easy-to-reach keybinds on a macro like that.
---
I use them to tip guildies for crafting work
---
Makes it harder to sneak around with all them keys jingling.
---
You can easily do Rotgrip as shadow if you have O.K gear. I used to do it with mostly dungeon blues and 3-5 AH greens. Haven't tried it as Disc/Holy but I don't think it'd work as well, if at all.
---
I’m getting 40gph, maybe a little less (without selling the ring) so assuming if I do some hours will bump up to 50-60. I don’t have professions (which I am rethinking hard right now) I had no idea this was possible on my priest, I would have done different profs.
---
I'm aware, but the community just isn't the same. The feel in general in the world isn't the same. Going to do a dungeon and nobody in the group knows anything about it and you just go anway. That was vanilla. Going to do a dungeon without knowing it now leads to a removal of the group.
---
I hate to agree with the other guy, but there really should only be 1 SM/Ruin lock per raid to keep the debuff slots open. If you cant cast corruption then you lose out on DPS
---
All of their gear should have been broken pretty quick then, there is no way I wouldn't "forget" to taunt of him, unless it was a core hound.
---
Hi, /u/Askburn
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8tpve/are_bgs_out_yet_on_eu/). 
---
&gt; if you whisper me asking permission to quickly let your dog out or something while I run back, that's fine and I'll happily rez you when I get back  
---
Did this last night when we all wiped and was a great opportunity to take the doggo out before he peed himself. Priest was super understanding :) gave him an extra couple stacks of the good good water when I got rezzed
---
Ah I see, I really wasn’t sure I just know the idea involving Hunter is to swap at some point during the fight between yourself and pet.
---
&gt; TBC and WotLK are widely seen as hugely positive additions to the game.
---
Yea by the people that joined wow during those xpacs. For those of us who started in vanilla and fell in love with it, tbc ruined the game and wotlk may as well be retail with worse graphics. 
---
I agree classic+ is a long shot. But I dont agree that pumping out tbc and wrath is a sure fire money maker. 
---
I honestly dont expect either. I think classic is an advertisement for shadowlands and once they realize no one is taking the bait they will shift the resources to other areas.
---
Weird how relatable this is
---
Herb will boost that considerably.
---
I ran into this issue as well. And came up with the same solution.   
---
Its to new a issue and no one had posted about it anywhere until   
---
I did a search here and was gonna post the "fix".
---
Paid transfers will just cause more empty servers instead of force alliance to fix themselves
---
The succubus is a lot higher DPS than your void, which will not be able to hold threat anyway, so if a mob is hitting you regardless, it might as well be the higher damage demon. 
---
You will be hitting a point eventually where mobs have a lot more health and deal a lot more damage, and corruption+immolate+wand won't cut it.
---
It has been on the launcher and character landing pages since Friday.  
---
Those who fail to read are no better off than those that can't read.
---
I’m not sure the exact answer, but i think you should be able to. i’ll check for a correct answer or i can even check myself when servers are back up and report back!
---
The dude was very much a pen y pincher. If he didnt need it he didnt train it. 
---
He use to make use buy the rez reagent. 
---
He saw other use kitty and bear and didnt care because he just healed. 
---
He didnt quest or grind. He logged on, we would party up 3-4 of us and then just heal us as we killed stuff. 
---
He got his epic mount and then would only log on to raid. We raided up to ZG cuz the guild stopped offering free consumables and then would just log on to update ingame add on invite calendar and peace out for the week. 
---
He came back for some of BC and trained the stuff he had skipped due to one of the other druids offering to lay for it. 
---
Believe it or not thats how he was.  Played on Gnomergone server back in vanilla and BC. Quite after BT because he didnt like to log on and farm/do much of anything else and guild leads were on him to help farm mats for mother sharaz.
---
Top guilds do around 1300 dps on their warriors.
---
Just FYI, the gap is even larger than you think.
---
When do you get stun in cat form?
---
Pro strats bro haha
---
I liked to think when I play my rogue having keys in the key ring bag meant I stole them mwahahaha. That's my head canon
---
You mean like Chromie in retail? She's basically Blizz's go-to deus-ex-machina for fixing all the story/timeline fractures and will be even moreso come Shadowlands.
---
I believe it's at level 32.
---
This. Extended downtime is blizzlike.
---
....though, are we going to get compensated with +1 day on our subscriptions?
---
I have some good patterns for tailoring, Not enchanting. I’m gonna drop it, thanks for the help that makes a lot of sense.
---
No honor gain for you to intervene, dick move to kill someone so much lower. I see no reason you should be obligated to intervene.  
---
It's a 5 level difference between those two in STV of all places. You know what you're signing up for when you go questing out there. Maybe if the hunter didn't waste time trying to run to you and fought the priest instead, he would've lived. Hunter sounds like a whiny betch.
---
Where do you run out (assuming you are using scepter)?  I've been using the alt party trick to reset, but sometimes if I don't have long to play I don't feel like bugging someone to help me make party.  I'm doing it on my 50 mage (snake/turtle farm).  So might not be possible without dying.
---
If you are already 300 on those professions, I wouldn't drop it. You don't need that much gold, and just by doing dungeons like Strat and Scholo you earn enough to sustain yourself. I have Alch/Tailoring for the global CDs (you need Mooncloth for Naxx, never too late to slowly stockpile them).  I mainly did group content and solo Mara farm, and I already have my Epic Mount, Hide of the Wild, +55 enchant, Benediction. I didn't go for Truefaith because I PvP heal a lot and I needed the stats, I'm still at +500 healing without deep holy talents... anyway. You don't need that much gold and plenty of time before you need gold for later raids.
---
If your server is so bad THEN TRANSFER. This isn’t hard to understand. I’m happy to give up $25 of my hard earned cash to transfer. There’s no other viable solution to this issue.
---
Go into your World of Warcraft\\\_classic\_ folder. Rename the patch 1.13.3. WOWCLASSIC.EXE to WOW.exe  
---
Then launch twitch and "refind" the game folder. Should fix the issue for now.
---
Only really for speed runs.
---
800 dps is top 1% of raid logs.
---
Oh no doubt, I just don't want to appear foolish or greedy. was really just curious what other guilds do so I can be better informed on pros/cons when I learn what our plan is.
---
Started leveling my first alt, a mage in order to farm more effeciently.  Right now I'm just a flower picker, was intending to go Tailoring for the robes at 60 but now I'm reconsidering and thinking about going Herb/Mining because it'll purely be a farming character.  How significant is the difference between the Archmage Robes and the next best? Is it a mistake to not go tailoring?  Keep in mind I don't really intend to use to character to raid, just get gear in 5mans then move toward farming full time.
---
Which one would you pick up tho. You think herb is best?
---
Not sure as I not a rogue that raided BWL. But I would hope so!  Would have to pop it just before the call when out as Live Action was not out yet.
---
I feel like a lot of those guys only wants a wife who they can fuck on their schedule and who will leave them alone basically all the time unless called upon. They only want a wife/gf who completely conforms to their lifestyle rather than a compromise in the middle.
---
We also do our guild meetings there.
---
That comment is about the fact that gear improves damage for everyone that gets...  if you funnel all the gear to the best DPS you might as well be trying to 30 man it.
---
Even the lowest DPS benefits from more spell power, more attack power, etc...
---
Either gear everyone in the raid up or go join a guild where everyone is apparently as good as you are... and if you are as good as you believe from the tone of your message that guild would be downing him in phase one.
---
Sorry, but completely disagree.
---
Mara is a difficuly kite, where one mistake gets you killed. Even compared to Rhok'delar Demons she is a tough kite.
---
Compare that to King Gordok which is literally; let boss get near pet, shoot boss and add, let boss get near you, FD, rinse and repeat.
---
I know which one I would rather do.
---
I've always found it amusing how people don't consider watching TV as an equivalent to playing games. They're both wastes of time lol  at least my time killer is engaging!
---
Who even OWNS a fax machine amirite??
---
That's not a problem with the addon though, but with the overall data collection. The census done in an appropriate timeslot will give you a very good sample of the faction balance. The census itself is not accurate, it's just a data collection tool that uses very basic functionalities. It just counts the people online and adds them to a library, then displays the results.
---
You can do better than that
---
If I can go to a pve server I might but after leaving Flamelash for a server with lower pop and a more balanced ratio everything is ok.
---
Is boat camping honestly any good for honour (alliance here, so obviously no experience since for some reason zepplins are allowed lvl 55 elite guards), or is it just for amusement? 
---
Personally I haven't been on a single boat since P2 dropped, just pay 1g for a darna portal and fly or HS back to IF. Much happier just flying and tabbing rather than semi-tabbing many times to navigate the boat. Everyone I know does this. Who (worth honour) is still taking boats so that it's worth 20 horde sitting on there partying away?
---
Hahahaha. Made my day. 😂😂
---
Stick with krol if you have it. I got lucky with brutality blade and was glad i still had mirahs till i got viskag.
---
My GM posts a picture of the guild bank on disc and we just ask. I figured most guilds did that.
---
My battlenet launcher has talked about the servers going down the last 3 days. 7am PST - 3PM PST. In both the battle.net launcher and on the login screen.
---
And the imp is no good? Any consumables I should be using often?
---
yeah i dont run out i set my hearth to Shadowprey for when my bags are full and farm with an alt on the same account so i add 2 min to every run for log out and party lead to swap over.
---
Yeah I just wish more allies felt that way. Mostly I fight people 1v1 in winterspring, kill 1 and suddenly half the dudes guild rolls up to camp me til I log or just afk for 20 mins and they leave.
---
Well, right now. Nothing is reliable. Blizzard even changed (renamed) the WoW Classic EXE. So my guess is all the addons are going to be fucked for the next couple of days.
---
But if you're using RCLC, then it should be the files from: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rclootcouncil-classic/
---
You can double check if you're using the Twitch App by clicking on the addon and going to the Version tab.
---
Why is it sad? If playing WoW makes him happier than having a girlfriend, he should do what makes him happy. Some people are single by choice, that's not sad.
---
Nope!
---
I'm a 55 ally mage on this realm. I stopped leveling my mage because I couldn't go 5m without being ganked by 3-5 horde. I spent 50% gametime corpserunning. Different experiences I suppose.
---
Wrath *is* retail with worse graphics. You wanna play wrath? Go ahead, its all there in the retail client. You can fly around on your mount, teleport all over the place, do daily quests, and lick *your own* asshole with the rest of the retail dudes.
---
Ignoring armour/crit, shield Slam is mega threat - ~750, whereas for Bloodthirst to be equivalent it needs ~1600 attack power without enrage up, or ~1300 attack power with enrage. Even then, bloodthirst costs 50% more rage. If you don't ignore crit/armour, maybe the attack power needed comes down a bit on average because Bloodthirst benefits entirely from crit while only the damage portion of Shield Slam benefits from crit. On the other hand, Shield Slam isn't affected as much by armour as Bloodthirst. Flurry also helps generate a bit more white damage and rage, which helps a bit.
---
So while it's not entirely clear cut from this analysis which is better, Deep Prot definitely is good for threat in dungeons, and more reliable than Fury/prot.
---
Paladins are truly a lot of fun and with the upcoming expansions and patches they only get better. I played one all throughout vanilla and played all 3 specs viably throughout wow. FUN! lots of interesting utility and beefy with plate :)
---
YOU LIED TO ME! !!!  !
---
Yup. Had this issue when they changed it to file path and sorting out addons for Retail and PTR.
---
BJs and raids my friend.......BJs and raids
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/PvP_flag
---
don’t update it. we still use the last patch, 1.6 or something. updating to the 2.0.5 required a data mitigation, and if you did it incorrectly you’re fucked.
---
You're still here on /r/classicwow so you haven't totally quit in your mind, yet.
---
The thing that most people overlook about ret paladins is how strong they make smite priests :P
---
My personal strategy. I have 2/2 pathfinding and max camera zoom out so that when she winds up a max range boulder I am well out of range of her and (with an autoshot timer) can get a shot off with an occasional arcane shot or multi. Also I have DBM telling me when her fart cloud is off CD. When that happens I send a pet in with dash and pull them back out as soon as they touch her to bait it out. When she is fart clouding you have time to perform max range auto, aimed shot, multi, auto.
---
Otherwise, just make sure you are kiting her around the edge of her mound. Trying to kite at a shallower angle will be harder.
---
Why do you need more than 40 gp/h? That's very decent. I wouldn't drop your current professions.
---
Some people just never do dungeons.
---
Kind of, yeah.
---
Doesn't make you any less of a twat
---
I dont understand joining a run that needs 8-10 people to do it when you could almost double your chance in a jed/red only run.
---
Yep, but in 1.8 it was just an open area...kind of like the Tainted Scar in Blasted Lands.
---
This is so true. People knew where the next T0 piece dropped. They didn't know anything else.
---
This made it so much easier to get groups, because everyone said, "Fuck it, maybe something good might drop if I join." Now, you can predict which classes don't get any BiS from a dungeon based on LFG posts.
---
Yes, I'll make a video and I will post it on Reddit
---
Im just going to patiently wait
---
You can't threaten me! I'm on a PVE server!
---
Same boat, 1 brut blade and 0 viskag since week 3 or 4.  Im probably just going to go daggers.
---
I agree with you - I love solo roaming and 1v1ing level 60s (not a rogue so its honourable). Phase 2 has been awful for this because its just groups of 3-5 crushing me. When they go to BGs to maximise honour, I look forward to it. 
---
Character xfers are a bit hit and miss - it's true people are no longer trapped on dying servers, but it guarentees their death. If I was on such a server I'd be so happy to escape and feel no remorse for what I left behind. And on all honesty, if you don't like the server you move to...you can just hop on to another. If its 15-20 euros/dollars it's not that much for players who spend 100s or 1000s of hours ingame. The only thing that strikes me as negative is that this whole situation is blizzard literally creating (or failing to fix) a problem and then selling a solution.
---
No, not phasing.
---
Bosses would only be tagged to spawn inside the instanced version of AQ. Basically like how it is in retail now; you can fly over AQ and it's just empty. But go in through the portal and suddenly there's mobs.
---
((My take would just have mobs in the non-instanced version too.))
---
If you updated, you can reinstall the older version on twitch, it worked for us.
---
Is that how you get the smaller world map? I have SexyMap but cant figure that part out
---
Noob
---
Sappers are BA, but let's be real: large copper bombs and mithril frag bombs for the win.
---
Scrap the normal/heroic versions thing and expand on Ulduar's concept of 'hard mode' triggers. A 'normal' way to do the encounter and a certain action that triggers the 'hard mode'.

How many hours a day does your wife keep your dick taped in between your legs
---
If the ally had banked him unprovoked then yes turban ass for not helping. However if the border player attacked the ally unprovoked then it’s up to you weather or not to get involved and shouldn’t feel bad about it. However we don’t know the full story as the ally could have been ganking the horde player for hours before that happened.
---
I can cross zones without hiccups too. It's when you cast spells that you notice it.
---
Here's a challenge: Mind vision somebody crossing a zone. Easy thing to do, if you don't have a priest, find one to mind vision you. Gyazo gif it. I'll paypal you $20 if it turns out you're right. If you're coming with an excuse now, I'll take it as you tried and failed.
---
IMO if it’s an alt I wouldn’t bother with the robes. There are comparable blues that have 40 frost dmg. 
---
Depends how much the recipe goes for on your server.
---
This has always been my take too. Which is why I'm really taken aback by the amount of people no-lifing the honor grind. I figured it'd be streamers and a few others, but there are far more than I anticipated.
---
You sound like a great time. ;)
---
The way they used it could be interpreted as either "a lower number of people" or "people who aren't as toxic" so that was an entirely unnecessary correction, because it wasn't even a correction.
---
What debuffs does mortal strike push off of the boss?  How can I figure out what debuffs have "priority" over others?  Is there a video or something on this?

You're in r/classicwow so you probably won't find an answer here. You'd have to ask people in the regular r/wow sub if you actually want an answer.
---
I don't trust my blind-self to navigate my way out of a paper bag. :(

Yeah but it would be worse if they did instant bans.  Plus it's costing them money in lost account subs.

Yeah. If you want to binge wow then don't have an SO. If you do have an SO then put them ahead of the game.
---
Step 1) Blizz makes a mess of the servers (probably unintentionally but still, a clusterfck).
---
Step 2) Offer server transfers for a cash grab to fix the problem they created in the first place
---
Step 3) Profit
---
Blizz should offer free server transfer for the mess they made, not look to exploit it.  Fck that.

It wasnt until your comment that I realized he hadnt written "a cool banana".
---
I would say it's mana management. Major mana/runes should always be your first go to, followed by healthstones (for longer fights, I'll sometimes use my imp HS and another locks regular), and bandages. He is probably just getting a few extra sbolts on you, or just getting lucky with nightfall procs.

Another thing is having a conversation with your healing leader or raid leader about being cautious for overhealing/always topping you off - if all of the warlocks burn through all of their mana and tap to 50%, they are all hitting it at the same time. Instead, we try to tap every 6th to 8th bolt to spread out the health suck on the healers. On more challenging fights (really only rag at this point where we are losing 10 people or so), the warlocks also spam a yell for a bandage tap, that way people don't get 2 ticks into their bandage and then receive a fat heal, negating the benefit of the bandage. 
---
Finally, I am running DS/ruin and another similarly geared lock in our guild is running sm/ruin. I honestly think that the damage winds up being damn near similar, enough that it doesn't really matter that much. I'm sure it reads out one way on paper, but if sm/ruin is essential to your play style and farming needs, don't worry about ds. I like DS/ruin because SM/ruin DM:E farming is more difficult for me somehow, even though it shouldn't be with the 10% damage boost and addition of siphon life.

Earthshaker EU.
---
Iono I had it happen just as often back then as it does now in my experience.  I think people now just leave cuz they feel like it whereas back in the day we were just clueless and people left out of frustration or boredom
---
Or just get an understanding girlfriend that is indepedant and capable of entertaining herself while you do you. Love is so much more than just serving each others needs 24/7
---
Sounds like a nonissue for a billion dollar company.
---
They want us to try retail!
---
Nope, I'd rather get shit done quick, I love the quick AoE meta. Learn to tank.
---
Because the current trend of "groups of levels 60s romping through tanaris slaughtering lvl 51s solo questing" is the coolest game mechanic that must be protected at all costs.
---
Probably with good gear, but it'll be hard and very inefficient if you're going for gold
---
Traditionally they may come back a little earlier than planned
---
2 hours since your first comment in this post. 5minutes. Lul
---
Are you looking at the top logs? Those are representative of very few runs. The Shadow Priest rotation can burn 6000 mana incredibly fast. At the end of the day their value is shadow weaving and if they have to choose between keeping 5 stacks up or maximizing dps a good Shadow Priest does their job and keeps shadow weaving up.
---
If they are playing wow while GF is there, imagine how much attention the wife must get....
---
Timelss Isle PTSD right there. Ask when Huolon was last up and get 30 different answers.
---
Save for mount, do Rend runs until your eyes bleed.
---
Hunter with mining/(herb/enchanting). 15min DM:E runs
---
The only way that would hold water for me is if you add the qualifier of early cata. The dungeons/heroics were great.
---
tbh i dont even know if the ally initiated, as i said i was fishing and i heard the troll death noise behind me, for all i know he couldve started attacking and then got his ass handed to him
---
You can always /dance
---
How large the community you interact with on your server is usually dictated by how much time you invest in to the game, and what you wish to accomplish.
---
The most important part is that all of our characters are tied to the server, and therefore our actions - and our reputations among peers as a result of said actions - matter. 
---
 If you are shitty to people, they will remember you.  They will tell their guildies about you and it will make it more difficult for you to accomplish tasks that require cooperation with other players (which there are a lot of).  Being held accountable plays a large part in making the classic community different to that of retail.
---
exactly, also it takes me around 1 nanosecond more to find another dps
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Thank you yes this will be super helpful! I only know how to get to the first spot in DM E solo. I've been tagging along with a lock otherwise
---
Casual.
---
Literally married with 3 kids and me and my wife play WoW for our downtime when not working and dealing with the kids. 
---
You have zero personal experience with sarcasm and jokes tho
---
Nope, BRE is better than all of those, the only clear replacement is Might of Menethil. Maybe you'd use Dark Edge of Insanity, more personal preference.
---
Lol,  googled to see if anyone else was having problems.  And I find you saying mageblade hasn't dropped even thought it had after about 3 runs...   My guild still has ZERO mageblade drops!  ZERO!
---
Awesome, final question I promise, if I have my succubus cast seduction on a mob, does she have to stay on that mob or can she help me burn down something else. What I mean, if there are two mobs, can I use seduction on mob 1, then when mob 2 runs at me I want to burn down as fast as possible including using succubus dps, does that work?
---
How many more classes do we have to get through for this overused meme to stop showing up on this sub every day?
---
That twitch app is some hot garbage imo.
---
Slowhoof.. so what?
---
The GF is WoW you dumbfuck
---
Yeah I guess the biggest factor is if your guild does MC in under an hour and you can hold all your buffs till Rag.
---
No we don’t want em stinking up Org either!
---
2 is incorrect. It is not a magic effect. Only magical effects can be dispelled by an enemy
---
👌
---
I know that cleave expends 2 SS charges so by extrapolation I'd expect whirlwind to expend 4 charges.
---
How dare you not know things and then politely ask others for clarification. You're scum!  
---
Which is something I didn't say.  All the guilds leaving in the past couple days being equal to "All the servers are empty" is one hell of a stretch for anyone who has English as a primary language. (Hint:  There's your escape clause.  All you gotta say is:  "English isn't my primary language." and it'll put everything into perspective.)  
---
You're drawing a conclusion based on your incorrect interpretation of what I said after mentally rearranging the letters and words around in your brain to mean something else.
---
My guildmates who run dungeons with me say I'm pretty cool too
---
32 key ring is still nice even if you don’t carry keys
---
It seems happy
---
Not that fun. Also, if you care about class fantasy, it doesnt exist for Paladins in terms of armor. Youll be healing most likely at end game, and youll be doing it in a dress.
---
It's a great setup, I used fishing to get my robe of winter night before level 52
---
BigBrainTanking
---
Isn't that against the user terms and agreements? That could get your banned.
---
Yeah, I wasn't trying to imply that exclusive cloth wearers don't have other classes trying to yoink their shit either, I was just saying rogues can literally only roll on leather gear and it sucks when other classes that can wear mail or plate ALSO want leather gear.
---
To fix Tauren hit hox issues, like sneaking past packs in DM trib runs.
---
Same here, but then again we haven't seen most of the big items from MC or Ony, our guild is cursed. We've been split running Ony for a very long time and haven't had a single weapon, then I join a PUG on my alt and Viskag drops lol.
---
servers are still down
---
If youre a dirty casual it is.
---
:p
---
If the priest had the SS available and did not use it, the priest cost more time, but once it was done, yes everyone should run back.    40 seconds plus drink for 4 rezzes, as opposed to an incomplete run.
---
Update: The song is  "Fortress Europe" by Dan Bodan
---
I mean.. anyone who's playing WoW 8+ hours a day is really unlikely to have a fulfilling or enjoyable life in general.  Not to say they're failures or anything like that, but the only reason to play that much WoW is if you need to forget about your life outside of WoW.
---
Are you implying that this sub is made up of self entitled people who expect to be able to put in half the effort and reap all the benefits? Are you saying that a majority of these people constantly go thru life with a "grass is always greener" outlook even though that mentality has hurt them dozens of times throughout their life and yet they still resort to the same mindset time and time again? Because you're right.
---
Sincerely, a casual who knows hell never achieve anything super significant in this game cause I dont play 60 hrs/week
---
It's definitely doable with DKP if you have a structured system in place with sanity checks for big ticket items.  Like prioritizing specific weapons for Rogues &amp; Warriors over Hunters who would use them as stat sticks.
---
So basically what this guy said. Don’t ignore your girl for wow. Manage time with both.
---
100 runs is pretty decent.  I've done 100+ solo DM:N clears on my Hunter and the book has a chance to drop from tomes and the boss.  Never seen one from a tome, but had one on my 32nd run from Gordok.  Not seen another since.  It now insists on giving me only Codex of Defence and the Bottom Half of Advanced Armorsmithing Volume 2.
---
&gt; There was internet, there were guides
---
Irrelevant, the guides were trash and the sites were just as bad. We have things like thottbot comment archive to see just how awful people were, you have access to archive.org to see "top quality" guides telling you horrible specs and terrible items were BiS. Todays min-maxing is worlds beyond anything back then, we didn't have raidlogs in MC and we didn't have simulation tools telling us exact gear power.
---
If you only need weaving, then a 31/0/20 build wouldn't be even better?
---
Some serious maintenance going on
---
Guild Wars 1 had a much better story than Guild Wars 2. I would have much prefeerred a proper sequel to the original Guild Wars, not the generic MMO with a Guild Wars reskin that GW2 ended up being.
---
They could at least showcas the percentiles.
---
Don't care. Please advertise elsewhere.
---
What's the name of the loot window addon?
---
I think it's the collector from Marvel?
---
Is the fury tank build viable at low 50s?
---
The gorilla warfare didn't tip you off, eh?
---
thank you for adding to our growing suspicions about how bad the average classic player is
---
no, you’re wrong.  they literally discussed this exact use of the api and how they’d likely disallow it, in pre-release interviews.  So you suck and should now shut the fuck up.
---
Lol I forgot about that. I’m on a “low” pop 50/50 server, but I could imagine it’s nearly impossible on high pop servers if you’re in the minority.
---
Its a no-win situation. Even if a server is balanced, people will just find another excuse for why they are getting ganked. Declare Horde are no-lifers or something. Meanwhile, if a server is even slightly imbalanced, people will latch onto it as why they are losing.
---
The basic issue is that people don't like being ganked and they don't really care about why its happening.
---
an extra 10g/hr would save  \~50 hours on gold grind if you were to try to grind out a sulfuras hammer by yourself
---
Fuck you I won't do what ya tell me
---
Woah woah woah, you’re supposed to say “gO BacK tO rETail”.
---
It's called a bang-maid
---
The only issue in my house is now I have my own office, so we're in separate rooms if she wants to watch TV and I want to play games.
---
We make compromises and adjust our time together based on our needs. Now, I usually get my own time from 8-10 or 11 after we eat dinner and watch an episode or two of whatever show we are on. Plus pretty much whenever during the weekends.
---
That, or she is perfectly content if I sit and play the switch next to her. Then we can still talk and interact while doing our own things.
---
Don't need alerts when you have 2 monitors with reddit open on one, and grinding virtual currency on the other.
---
5 a week is still excessive for a very boring first raid experience.  
---
How many alts do those turbo nerds have?
---
Link your logs?
---
Ah well DKP is fair game too, I thought we were talking about free roll guilds, my bad.
---
Tell the healer at the start that you're tanking 2handed for threat and to tell you if you start getting hard to heal, then have at it. With sword and board, you're going to lose threat to dps, which means more juggling and harder hits for the healer to deal with. Bosses aside, you shouldn't need a shield regularly until Ulda, and there are plenty of times when it's preferable to whirlwhind with a 2 hander on smaller/weak hitting non-elite packs if you don't have a mage deleting them before they can leave the blizzard (dogs in brd, skell packs in strat, etc.).
---
Everyone sucks here to varying different degrees. 
---
Yes, you should've swatted down that 40 spriest like a gnat. He was killing your fellow horde right next to you. 
---
The troll hunter is being a twat by getting salty after the fact.
---
Do you play horde on the Ashbringer eu realm? If not I’ve had the exact same experience! If so then I think I was the rogue in your run!
---
based. you should apply to be a moderator
---
I am way too excited about the key ring. Fuck AQ
---
Do you get reputation if you are back at your base when the enemy faction's general or captain are killed? Or do you have to be within a certain range of the kill?
---
I think its kind of personal preference. I perfer the succubus for both soloing and dungeons (I think she is the highest dps pet). That said though if I'm on the lower end of levels in the group ill use imp since my succ can tend to pull mobs from being a lower level then the tank.
---
I like to keep up well fed (but I have am alt with 300 cooking so its easy) as well as strong trolls blood potions (12 regen per 5 for 1 hr and a guildie makes em for me for mats (I'm herbalist))
---
Not a priest, but I do this run as a hunter. After killing goblin, I run over to the bridge over Rotgrip. I pull him from there, run towards the back of instance to maybe mine some mithril until he paths to me. I then kite him to princess while doing jump serpent stings and arcane shots, mixing in some stutter autos when safely ahead. He is almost dead by the time I reach princess where I summon my pet and tear him up. Then of course I kill princess. 
---
Would you say this is the best way to go? My second question is whether I should drop mining for disenchanting? A lot of the blues are barely worth more than a gold. Any thoughts?
---
As long as you aren’t terrible with inventory management and realize you don’t have to constantly carry gear for every possible situation on you at all times, bag space isn’t too bad.
---
The warriors and Druids complaining about bag space are just being incredibly dumb with their inventory.
---
It means 2nd most
---
I always thought of it as a pvp tank. You can deal powerful single target damage, root, and shift to heal. Those combine to make you a prime target for the opposing faction. The armor helps with that, but you still get wrecked by spell damage, so even with this justification it isnt the best, but I do love those ugly owls.
---
I prefer a good release over a botched one. So I'll wait till everything is ready.
---
Also, Demonic Runes apply shadow dmg so you can Shadow Ward then pop one for free mana. Also, they're more expensive but Rejuvenation Potions are insanely good for us on long fights when HP and Mana are low all around.
---
Big if true
---
What are you gonna do with any of those weapons. Auto attack and heroic strike? Twink warriors pre-40 are pointless. They're better off as rogues.
---
no one should be using doom in raid...
---
To add a suggestion, I believe the hinterlands cloak is Horde only so alliance can check out BRD for a cloak that has some int/Stam and spell dmg
---
plus you can get your tier sets before anyone else since nobody wants to play a druid, so I guess you got that going for you
---
Teleport: Moonglade, the class seller
---
The different census addons give very different results. 
---
So at least 2 of the 3 I know of are inaccurate.
---
&gt; You're a liar.
---
That is a lie.
---
Workin anyways, they should be up about the time I get home this evening.
---
The bank in org is to the left when you walk into the city. Almost directly across from the Innkeeper. Compared to its position in classic, it's been shoved up against the western wall with the entrance facing towards the eastern wall. Just like in Classic, you can ask a guard and he'll give you a little map marker showing you where it is.
---
The Thunder Bluff bank is where its always been.
---
The Undercity bank is where its always been.
---
???
---
Mara is indeed 4/10 IMO.
---
Hunter epic quest is not much harder at all.... and if you over prepare consumables can be much easier than Mara solo 
---
Hunter quest 5/10 IMO.
---
Solo DM north is for sure not harder in any way than hunter epic quest, it is just a long learning experience with many bugs and blizzard hotfix attempts to analyze.
---
DM north solo 6/10 IMO only for length of learning process.
---
Of course they don't. LFR is just a loot pinata. If you want to run the old stuff you need to actually build a group. Don't see how this ruins anything. Are you just complaining about retail because it is the cool thing to do now?
---
Ok so first off, drop the points in protection and get blood craze and then max Enrage. Drop one of the 2H specializations, you're wasting talent slots. Get anger management with those points, Extra points can be used where you like, improved BS probably a good place for them.  Hope this helps :) 
---
If you want to stay 2h and hit stuff hard then you should stay MS spec
---
I'm really enjoying Ashkandi
---
I apologize if I misunderstood you and didn't answer what you were wondering. Here goes:
---
Yor pet gains XP when you have it out and you are killing mobs that are green or higher to you (not green or higher to the pet). This means that if you are level 60 and you tame a pet that is level 10, you will need to kill level 48+ mobs for the pet to get XP.
---
You can teach a pet higher ranks of abilities without going past each lower rank first. If your hunter only knows Claw rank 8, you can still teach it to your pet. You will also spend the same amount of Training Points (TP) no matter whether you go straight to the last rank or you get new ranks as you go along. In other words, it will make no difference in terms of how much TP you spend whether you teach Claw 1, then Claw 2, then Claw 3, as opposed to just going straight to Claw 3.
---
Remember that you can buy up to 2 stable slots, where you can leave your pet. This is useful if you wanna keep your pet, but also want to go out to tame new pets just to learn their ability ranks. You can stable your Broken Tooth, go to STV to tame a pet, learn a new rank of Dash, then abandon the new pet and go back and bring back your BT.
---
Yeah I strafe with a &amp; d, it was a good move. I only move the camera with my mouse. Still get a kick out of seeing people take 4 seconds to do a full 360 degree turn.
---
I got the recipe on a world drop and fished for them whenever looking for a dungeon group. Had more than twice the amount of gold I needed for my mount at 40. I also like bringing a stack or so with me in dungeons and giving them out.
---
I hope this post isn't dead. I have been watching the youtube and reading about macros and I'm still not getting it. You guys aren't breaking blind, gouge, sap or cheapshot? I have zero macros on my rogue and clearly am missing out on it's full potential. Maybe you can direct me to another video or post that better explains how, when and why I would do these macros? Your post absolutely helped but I am still having some trouble figuring out how to do them, set them up and when to use them. Thank you for your post!
---
Isn't there a 15 day cooldown each time you use item restore?  So you can only restore a total of 1 item once per 15 days
---
Maybe for you
---
ok, thanks
---
Back in the day people took months if not years just to hit 60
---
I will probably get reamed for this, but this is one reason why I loved achievements when they launched. It gave a reason to do things and explore places outside of the usual grind, and didnt give items that made it a requirement.
---
I'm playing for the long game. Both lady and wow. Have to find that happy balance and then win at life and naxx.
---
should say, why would blizzard do this?
---
people raided MC plenty in 1.12, this game is designed for Naxx
---
Realistically how long will it take to find a a bg on a horde dominated server as a horde player? Will it be hours or what? I'm confused as to how this works. Thanks!
---
Is the Details! Tiny Threat plugin accurate?
---
Let a game being released in its previous form exist. If you don’t like it, why are you subjecting yourself to it? Are you masochistic? Move on.
---
Well you might not want to be in zerker stance for a few reasons. The enemy pops a cd and you want to disarm them (d stance), combat ends and you want to charge (b stance) for rage and swap to zerker stance and maintain the rage. Swapping to b stance to sweeping strikes etc. I think tact mastery is a MUST and so is anger management. The extra rage over time plus the reduced rage loss out of combat  really helps not getting rage starved. I would keep imp overpower, the (almost) guaranteed crit is huge and very good dmg per rage. You'll use it on rogues a lot and deep wounds will keep em out of stealth.
---
Will be the final nail in the coffin for a true classic experience 
---
Reputation won’t matter anymore, want r14? Pay to go to a less competitive server
---
without pulling aggro.
---
“Not as versatile”
---
Wut.
---
We have a feral Druid that tanks, has a set of offhealing gear for some fights/dispel duty, and also has taken #3 DPS overall for MC (which includes fights he tanks or off heals).  Imagine if he wasn’t diverse and stuck to dps!!  
---
Bad ferals give druids a bad name. There are insane tricks ferals can do to absolutely crush dps. (Gnomer hammer!!!!)
---
I’d call that pretty darn diverse. Now consider the pvp diversity. 
---
Flag carrier, flag retriever, ninja capper, one man AB cap defense, AV tower ninja, AV tank.....etc
---
Hybrid resto/balance has an entirely different playbook brining even more diversity.  
---
Druids are hands down the most diverse class in classic. They have probably one of the highest skill caps in the game and if played correctly, can outshine other classes. 
---
Any guild that says “resto or gtfo” also probably spends 2 hours farming world buffs before doing MC to save 20 minutes of raid time.  Yuck
---
There’s nothing that I love more than a group of lowbies holding it down. Shit like that is why Classic is great. A decked out 60 can still get worked by a small group of 40s with coordination
---
By your definition of a "fulfilling life" and "better path" maybe. 
---
Some people are really happy in relationships, some people are really happy single. Maybe this guy has loads of friends online, and enjoys himself immensely. Who are you to dictate that he's living his life in a sub-par way?
---
I’ve said wife aggro before, but only in a joking way.  Usually it means I sat down to play for a little and just lost track of time and don’t mind getting off.
---
jobs
---
you need jobs
---
this is never an issue for those of us who work
---
Maybe he likes the discussion and information surrounding the game?
---
Happens alot of "Jed Rend runs" where mages leave after Jed
---
It's called small children.
---
Yeah but watch them come to classic and struggle with a mob 3 lvls lower.
---
I seriously have played this game for 15 years and never really noticed that it takes up your entire screen like that
---
All dps classes without an aggro dump.
---
Wtf did they do to Tauren running/walking?!?!? Terrible animation in retail.
---
Yeah, it is only because I am going to level engineering anyway, my main is a miner so I have the materials. I was wondering if I should get helm with int or one with spell power, think I will try spell power as at 30 I can make a tailoring robe and have an extra 40+ spell power which should be noticeable at my level
---
/console violencelevel 5
---
My guild runs 5 MC's as well and has a week 2 rag kill. We have gotten 2 sulfuras's, 2 BRE's, and one spinal reaper.
---
his response made sense, not so sure about yours
---
Oh duh, was thinking hunters mark
---
Nobody mentioned Myzrael so I'll mention that the server drama level is so low that basically no one posts on the discord or reddit. It's always high pop though.
---
More than in the old days. No clue why.
---
But raiding with ret pala DDs, in raids &lt;40, with some &lt;lvl60 and all that as a PUG would have been unthinkable to most.
---
Today it's just a random raidnight
---
But in the case of Krol Blade, which may not be BiS, but is serviceable until you get an upgrade in a raid, I think the point above (especially at 51) is fair: that could very well end up being money well spent for a melee.
---
OB OG! lol
---
I’m running Classic on an 80gig hard drive. Couldn’t try if I wanted to
---
if you're going 30-39 might as well do 49 for MS
---
Source on this "infestation"? What metrics are you using? How are you getting those metrics? Why are you even using the word "objective"?
---
You're gonna have to provide evidence to support that claim. I don't think that's true man.
---
Imagine seeing this many hand of rags in vanilla on one server.
---
The quest for rhokdelar
---
By "random doodads" did you mean "these Gnomes in the Gnome starting area are actually working on gadgets/planes/other stuff and showing the player what it is to be a gnome instead of just standing there staring blankly ahead"?
---
Can't believe we've reached a point where "this zone has little details and isn't just one town surrounded by random hostile NPCs" is a complaint.
---
Funny thing, it's usually those type of guys that consider themselves as casuals
---
You are allowing it to fuck up your life. Why steep a toe into addiction when you know you're likely to fall head first. Stop playing.
---
Guessing y'all forgot about asking guards were things are? That's a thing that exists in Classic too
---
Sell? Its not like he got it
---
&gt; Are there other uses that I'm unaware of? 
---
Yarr
---
Crusader for more strength. Life stealing is good but not worth at 60 imo.
---
Unless you replace it with Dal'Rends, in which case you more or less just wasted ~350g.
---
apparently in my guild we've gotten 3 BREs and 2 have gone to people that either said they were gonna rank and arent right now or just don't play any more so...could always be worse lol
---
What's wrong with asking for proof? You're just sour that you didn't get upvotes? Grow up. Take the high road and be happy that you're correct. You're just acting trashy now.
---
I take back my thank you.
---
You have to ask why we are here. 
---
Players wanted a version of WoW as close to the OG as we could get. You start artificially buffing content to make it into something else or you start redesigning content or classes and then you have something other than Classic. 1.12 talents and gear were chosen for a reason, even amongst the private server community, because it was largely seen as the most overall balanced patch.
---
I think the vaaaaast majority of P2 WPvP whiners are PVE players who should be playing on a PVE realm because they have 12 jobs, 6 wives, 53 children while also being amateur astronauts who only have 6.33 minutes a day to play and they don’t want to spend it getting pvp’d. 
---
I mean I get it, it sucks to be camped and on Herod-US even though the Alliance are outnumbered they dominate current hotspots more often than Horde and are way more serious about PvP and being organized for it. Whereas most Horde on Herod-US care way more about PVE and it’s why you see a ghost run of 20+ ghosts any time you run from Thorium or DM back to your corpse.
---
My opinion is conservative, Classic should stay as close to classic as reasonably possible. Because the things I would like to see changed are different than everyone else’s.
---
Oh ya the undead look ridiculous too. They all do. I can't stand it. Oh well. Apparently some people like it?
---
That's not true. Still recognize people nowadays. I mean, mainly the people who are always in the same area, like, its that rogue in Theramore, or that rogue in IF, or that pair of rogues in menethil ...........
---
Dude your entire post history is just you being a toxic dumbass. Find a hobby.
---
Yes but I told her sundays 4:00-7:00 is raid time and no I don't want to skip it to go to your coworker's baby shower.
---
I wouldn't grind for Dal Rends if I buy Krol.
---
You didn't like Naxx??
---
If your view on the game is based on the community’s negativity then world of warcraft has never been a fun game.  
---
People have their own reasons/experiences to feel the way they do about certain features.  Cross realm bg will make shorter ques all around, but takes away from the server pvp a bit.  It was very fun to fight with and against similar faces back in the day.  Its far from game breaking but will take away from the community aspect of pvp and sense of server faction, but plenty of people probably don’t even care about that.
---
Transfer-wise I’m sure people don’t want to see their server implode, or act as a get out of jail free card for blacklisted players.  200+ hours of leveling is much more punishing for most people than paying 20$ or so.
---
He wasn't under attack when i saw him. He had low hp and a priest running in the some-what same direction as himself

That must've been pretty cool.
---
Dear god, so it's just an invite everyone situation. Quality not quantity my dude.
---
Personally I think theres gonna be a lot, every night I play my alts theres twink ganks squads rolling around.
---
I work! I'm working right now, and yet here I am
---
Why didn’t you pvp you pussy
---
Those keybinds
---
They could count on my subscription for another decade or two if they did the following:
---
Release classic as they have, let it run its course, release tbc-classic, same deal, release wotlk classic same deal. 
---
Then, and this is key, start over fresh with lessons learned. We all love classic, but few of us who are being honest with ourselves can say we love all of classic. The class balances are shit, the meta is too common knowledge, the PvP servers suffer from terrible imbalances... No end of griping possibilities. The honor system... Whoa. 
---
What I'd like to see is blizzard watch and learn from these 3 xpacs being re-released. I honestly think between the 3 of them you have the makings of the "perfect" MMO. I think they could keep us entertained for the rest of our lives. 
---
For instance one lesson learned I think would be to control the faction balance on PvP servers at launch. 
---
Idk, just musing here, I think I'll come back later when I have time to explore this idea some more.
---
why are you telling me this lmao. did my post say literally anything about anything you are talking about? no
---
I was more asking specifically about pendulum vs ravager because I plan on making a 39 enh shammy with either ravager or staff of jordan. relax there bucko.
---
This is it, if you prevent them from transferring they'll either re-roll of quit altogether.
---
Yes they need to man up with 16 hour POWER SESSIONS

"OMFG HOW DO I GET OUT OF ORGRIMMAR IVE BEEN LOST FOR HOURS" - Classic player who apparently doesnt know what the M key does, or what google is
---
Opening with "dumb fk" isn't the way either...
---
Vanos KoS addon. Set notes to alliance or horde and you can set notes for people on your faction under the "hatelist". It shows them on a window like Spy as well.
---
I tried to get into it, but it's just objectively speaking the worst experience in any role in any environment compared to any class. 
---
Tanking? You can do 5man dungeons great, but you'll never be raiding since a Paladin doesn't have a taunt which means the critical aspect of tank-swapping is impossible for you. Your rotation is absolutely boring too since it mostly comes down to just spamming Consecration every eight seconds. You can't even range pull on your own. 
---
Damage? Most of your damage comes from auto-attacking, but once every eight seconds (if you are talented for it) you can use Judgement to do a little extra damage or apply an effect with a Seal. Then it's back to auto-attacking. I am dead-fucking-serious, that is the entire extent of Paladin combat in 95% of content in PVP, world PVE, and raiding. The 5% left is when you fight the Undead, then you have two extra damage spells. 
---
Healing? This is where you shine, and it's still probably the worst healer experience in the game. Your mana efficiency is enormous, you can provide valuable buffs for the raid, and you can even make people invulnerable occasionally - but that's all you do. You will spam Flash of Light constantly, and pretty much do absolutely nothing else. You have no HOT, no AOE heal, no damage shields, no unique debuff removal, you probably won't even use Holy Light very often. 
---
By all means if any of this actually sounds good to you, then go for it, but it really is just painfully boring. I suppose PVP healing is actually pretty fun though since the combination of the speed that Flash of Light can be cast, and excellent durability from plate armour really lends itself well here, but that would be it.
---
It will be worse than the faction ratio
---
Most alliance are more pve oriented hence a small percentage of their players que for bgs than the horde.
---
Thank you for confirming the majority opinion about how defensive retail players are of their dying game
---
IF you replace it with Dal'Rends. Which is part of my point. It may be worth it just to skip that grind and just jump into MC once you can. Dal'Rends ain't easy to just fall into. That's 9 levels and however long it takes in MC to get an upgrade, doesn't seem half bad if you think you might want to make the purchase anyways. Plus those first few levels after purchasing it would be cake.
---
So when? Servers are up for me, didnt go down.
---
Firemaw, EU
---
Horde here, on my 39 horde lock and saw a orc warrior and alliance pally fighting it out at ness’s camp, they appeared pretty evenly matched.  I let them fight it out without any intervention from me.
---
The 60 dwarf hunter behind me felt differently and two shot me then killed the orc warrior.
---
No
---
Took 12 kills before are guild got a Spinal Reaper. We did get the dagger at the same time for the first time aswell.
---
Is that why there are no tanks?
---
Thanks, I think I'll definitely skip to the highest level of each ability I can train my pet with at this point then to save some time. I don't mind the travel time though, I'm not playing to min/max everything, I'm playing to just experience the game and while I do look for more info on specific things, I like being unfamiliar with the world and taking time to explore it myself.
---
it's fine on trash, but verboten on bosses.
---
&gt; Crafting IIRC was nice but idk waht it looks like now. I just remember liking their system for crafting back then. 
---
Didn't changed a lot, but every expansion and story pack unlock new recipes/patterns of stats combo and armor.
---
That's what is cool in GW : pretty much every endgame item is craftable, and the economy is strong. Unlike wow where professions are 95% useless gear-wise, in GW2, you can make the best gear with it.
---
You don't have to run a gear treadmill and do the same dungeons/raids for months only to ditch it when another come. You want X armor ? Well you can craft it. Or farm it in a dungeon. Or in pvp (pvp bring ton of rewards).Or in fractals. Or all at once, and never do the same thing twice.
---
You just described my plans for the week haha. Just hit 49 and Im gonna enjoy being top dog for a bit before I go back to leveling up.
---
Mograinne is one of the best pvp realms but it's still quite unplayable. If bgs don't improve it I will go to pve
---
Also works with ElvUI since the maintainer is also the Healcomm dev.
---
\^ what he said
---
if you're facing a premade for sure and you know you're gonna get stomped maybe go do the AV quests or some other stuff that is still beneficial. chances are that AV premade is gonna win in sub-10 minutes if they are decent, and you can still at least get something beneficial done + get some honor still (i think?)
---
I haven't seen what you described. So if you and those who have, why cant they be isolated instances? How do you end up with an infestation? Oh here is one for you. Name an mmo that had 0 botters in its life time. Go ahead, I will wait.
---
I'm minority faction on a pvp server and it was a f'ing cakewalk, mara farm was substantially harder than the epic quest.
---
Back in the day the game was just a game. The idea of max level was cool but you didn't have to be 60. Gamers in 2004 were different then 2019. 2004 had some bad eggs but toxicity was rare. Gaming back then wasn't mainstream and you were a nerd for liking it. 
---
So all the nerds played WoW and enjoyed it for what it was. You could be in your 30s for months and not care because your having fun. 
---
Now you just have min/max culture in literally everything. The spirit of the game is lost.
---
If people are often whispering you about the head you aren’t being clear at all
---
Part of the ship, part of the crew
---
Probably not, but you'll have to do it atleast a handful of times regardless for things like your Ony attunement so there's still a chance you'll get it.
---
Either way, I'd rather farm that instance and buy my epic mount instead of dropping ~350g on a Krol Blade, but to each their own.
---
Does spell pen matter at all for PvE? I haven't found anything solid on whether or not bosses have more resistance than Curse of Shadows/Elements remove, and I was wondering if I should grind immediately for Don Rodrigo's Band.
---
thats gotta suck but why not find a premade group/pvp group/join a good guild that does premades, at that point?
---
I’ve always felt it would be best to patch NA servers overnight, since most folks are asleep. But yeah a lot of people work times other than 10-3 on a Tuesday.
---
The difference in cost of living probably does not afford them that option.
---
I would love to, but barman's shanker is MH only. I know this ain't a good situation. That's why I'm trying to get literally any weapon ASAP.
---
I'll get Mirahs right now, thanks for the info!
---
That’s the risk you run playing on a PvP server.
---
I don’t like getting ganked over and over again on my way to do a Tribute run before raid but the Alliance has 30 players spread from the bridge outside Mojache all the way to DM norths door.
---
That’s the risk I took because I like playing in an environment where anything can happen and I have to keep panning my camera for the opposite faction.
---
Most players don’t want to be hassled while questing, don’t want to be hassled while running to a dungeon, only want to PvP when they feel like it. PVE servers exist for this very reason.
---
Same, all my ADDONS not registering through twitch. Files are still there
---
Yeah, I remember everyone talking to the battle master at the same time and trying to get the same queue pop, and when it did, it was "did you get AV 7?" and if everyone says yes we take it, but someone is ALWAYS afk, or missed it or whatever, so we never always got a full 40 man.  Even so, getting 20 people in was always fun.
---
Hospitals. It got grandfathered in as the one unsecured hippa-approved communications medium

You clearly didn’t read my post. 
---
Try again.
---
I was so excited to get a 4 day work week.
---
My weekday off day is Tuesday.
---
Fuck.
---
I don't see how any of that should matter to the consumer though.  The onus is on blizz to deal with the problem and keep the servers healthy, not shift it to the subscribers by charging them to transfer.  Paid transfers without server faction/pop constraints aren't foolproof anyway because similar problems may develop on the new server and people will just be pressured to pay again.  Where are all those flamelash horde gonna go for fresh blood?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but there aren't even solid realm stats available to make an informed decision as far as I know.  
---
Maybe allowing characters surnames would help with future merges.  Or, like I said, free transfers with faction/pop constraints until the ship gets righted. That means pvp to pve, whatever, and people can decide for themselves if their name is worth staying behind for on a dead server.  Whenever there's a crazy imbalance or dwindling pop, just do something like that.  Imagine how happy that would make tens of thousands of players right now and barely put a dent their profits.  I'd even come back.
---
But not even a serious attempt has been made or seems to be in the works.  It seems to be going from massive fuck up --&gt; paid transfers.
---
I pretty much started building a heal set as soon as possible during my leveling process and it has been so nice filling every roll while I played. I leveled up as feral dps which allowed me to solo level quickly or tank/dps a dungeon in addition to healing. 
---
With being level 60, I have like 2 and a half sets from full healing set, pure tanking set, and a PvP feral set.  It is such a flexible class that really made the leveling process smooth.
---
They removed like over 1/2 of ST in retail. I think BRD is exactly the same
---
even more. 95% of wow area are empty AND useless.
---
Not only GW areas aren't that empty, even as a high level, going back to a low level area actually bring you enough money/karma/mats to make it worthwile. Not as much as in a end-game area, but enough to not make you think "i'm just wasting my time"
---
So blizzard having dozens of bots infesting each leveling zone is ok because other mmos have had botters in their lifetime?
---
Do you see the koolaid you are drinking to justify this?
---
you're right, but playing devils advocate here:
---
we know literally nothing (at least, from what i've heard/know) about how the x-realm bg stuff might work. if its only a few servers in each, say 3, its not entirely crazy to have a whole WSG team of same server people. same guild however would clearly be a premade lol
---
They’re 1500g on my server
---
Not sure, only time will tell. If you're worried about it pve server might be better.
---
I’d say it can definitely net you an extra 10-15, Ghost Mushroom and Blindweed sell quite well: https://classicdb.ch/?object=142144 https://classicdb.ch/?object=142143

---
&gt; gain the small heal after suffering a critical hit
---
worthless, too small of a heal, use those points in improved cleave since we're losing sweeping strikes, or just improved execute.
---
Overall, good respec for PvE.  Your single target dps will suck, BUT you can top the charts by spamming cleave and whirlwind on multiple enemies.  For PvP this spec sucks.  Battlegrounds are here, you will want to stay with the Mortal Strike spec if you plan on doing lots of those.
---
Um. Girlfriends are like shirts but how often do you get a chance to be world/server first at anything.
---
no, spell pen doesn't do anything for PVE (outside of a few niche cases where the mobs give themselves some sort of resist buff)
---
That's very hard to say, given that it is not a "linear" system at all. It heavily depends on how much and how efficiently you PvP. Some people will never reach it because they just don't play enough to reach that rank.
---
is PVP feral the same as cat feral PVE gear? i can never find a good guide to PVP druid rotation and gear
---
&gt; I’m angry that I‘ll have less people to camp 
---
I know on my 80 pally I can solo through MC in about 40 mins, but can't do BWL due to not being able to dps Vael fast enough to avoid dying to the debuff. Also, Ony got re-tuned to level 80 difficulty apparently.

---
only 55ish to 60 is bad now. World pvp is going to happen but it won't be that bad
---
There are some guilds that organise RP events. But RP out in the wild is rare to find. If you're looking for RP, ask around for an RP guild during peak hours.
---
Flamelash server may be the worst of all for faction imbalance. I’m watching videos on you tube of Horde untouched in Ironforge. This is crazy.
---
entirely depends on what is the best honor
---
if AV continues to be the best honor even after grinding exalted expect the majority of people ranking/premades to be doing that
---
that said, if that happens and AV just turns into premade v premade, it might turn out so WSG is better and people who see that will go do premade WSGs, at least til it evens out across the board
---
basically, we won't know til its already out for a while lol
---
Things should be a lot better after todays patch

You’re quite a pugnacious one ain’t ya? They whisper as in surprised id be willing to give it away to random puggers, as in a happy surprise. Like as in they’re appreciative.

Yeah, they went all out and the quality is really bad. Some of them have so much factually wrong information or just poor choices.

There you go.

So? Ally domination mostly doesn’t matter since it’s PVE.
---
It cracked me up that classic is like five gigs.
---
No you can just kite it straight up to the area where princess is, for some reason rotgrip won't aggro anyone except for the hydras by getting to close. All you have to do as a hunter is throw serpent sting on, and hit him with an auto shot if you run too far away and the occasional arcane shot. There's no need to aggro swap with a pet. I assume you could do the same thing with a priest and SW:P, but I have not tried.
---
Browsing Reddit and be bored out of mind. Seriously. I haven't gamed in 5-6 years. So fun to be back!
---
Ayy Westfall, our economy is fucking ass backwards
---
I played from Vanilla up to WOTLK (right after launch so not deep into it). I decided to come back for MoP as they added panda's, I played all of 5 minutes and I just felt so stupid with the game not knowing what anything was and never logged back in.
---
Fast forward to another expansion, think it was cataclysm I decided to give WoW another go and I power leveled my hunter to 60 in days just basically doing nothing. I remember being in Eastern Plaglands soloing Scholomance and was like if I can do this in a few days I'm sorry but why am playing a game where bulk of the content is just being skipped. I was so disgusted that there was no point to play any of my favorite dungeons in the leveling process. I actually felt WoW was a shell of itself and said thats the last time I'm coming back to this game. I actually missed the hard gring and hardships of relying on guilds and friends to help get you levels and gear through the entire leveling process.
---
So happy that classic is out :) So sad that I can't play in the open world.
---
That's actually in the video! One of the Rogues was talking about taking off the headphones towards the end due to Screech. Although the pet tank was praised by the DPS for its ability to hold aggro and, despite the corpse run after the wipe, it only took us a combined total of 40 minutes to full clear.
---
&gt;Rule 4 Do not share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behaviour.
---
The reasons I prefer Classic to retail tend to focus around the community aspects of the game. I think the cross-realm bgs diminish the community by reducing server rivalries. Some guilds would get a reputation in bgs and it was fun seeing the top horde pvp guild face off with the top alliance guild. I understand there a a lot of problem in single server bgs though. I would prefer smaller battle-groups that consist of servers of opposite faction imbalances. Maybe that way they could have reduced some of the queue time issues without eliminating or diminishing the rivalries.
---
Buy krol rn
---
If your shadow priest is burning through 6k mana in 20-30 seconds there may be someone mana burning him.
---
So I say gf aggro, but I say that as a sort of "hey I'm going afk and I may or may not become *un-afk* and y'all will understand why.
---
But yeah if someone actually complains that they have to log to spend time with their SO they shouldn't be in a relationship.
---
It's just way too limiting in terms of design to be forced to have some gimmick that you can trigger within the boss encounter.
---
And even in Ulduar some bosses basically have a difficulty switch: Mimiron and Yogg Saron's hard modes are both triggered by toggles before the encounter starts.
---
Sure it's a bit more flavor that the toggle is in the game universe rather than a UI switch, but it would get old quickly.
---
Is that not much slower, though?
---
I don't think you know how classiclfg works AT ALL. It is a standard global channel that it SKIMS, not transmits over. These changes do NOTHING about reading global channels, it's about sending.
---
Comes down to luck/your level of server imbalance. I had many solo Solenor attempts ruined by Horde.
---
Heartseeker would both be on the dominant faction, and get instant queues. And on Heartseeker, they also have a larger population, which means more people leveling and doing dungeons.
---
On Heartseeker, the horde are in the opposite boat. They got dominated in phase 2 by the majority-faction alliance, and they'll get stuck with the same BG queue times as Stalagg and Skeram.
---
Paid transfers will almost always be from small to big, and from the dominated to the dominant. If there weren't CRBG's the opposite might have been the case.
---
replacing honor grind with an elo system that at least attempts to reward skill and doesn't require you to play so much.
---
The whole reason was for me and the other player joking around about our initial confusion. It's as deep as people are making it
---
Yea herb and almost a must here, the mouthful is whatever..
---
The most optimal way to farm mara and make 60+ and hour is to run straight to tinker (no wasting time when you start)
---
And kite him all the way to the bridge above rotgrip and kill him there. Pull rotgrip immediately after killing tinker and pull him all the way back up to the princess while applying as much dots as you can. 
---
He will be around 20-30 percent witch makes an easy kill once you get everything down, and will die right next to princess. 
---
There’s a really good orc/warlock video of him doing it with no audio and showing where to stand to farm the ring for people as well.

People are saying Edgemasters does not give any 2h weapon skill
---
Your WoW experience during the last month or so sounds like it's been a lot different from mine. Can't even do quests in high-level areas for all the gankage.
---
Edgemasters is just 1hers, however racial weapon skills (human for mace and sword, orc for axes) benefit both 1h and 2h.
---
I like both. Well, maybe not BFA but everything before that slog of an expansion.
---
While your most certainly right, I honestly don't care as long as this madness stops. It's been absolutely impossible with a 45 min chat delay to make groups, whisper people for portals/crafting/chatting or coordinating raids with loot/ready checks and boss timers spazzing out. 
---
Just want it fixed! And that's without any discussion as to whether HonorSpy is against the spirit of the game because it gives players too much knowledge and leads to behaviours of controlling the ranking system.
---
I see, thank you for the information!
---
Actually it was something I did search. The use of the words contribution points vs honor points got me questioning it. Didn’t know they were different since contributions points are hidden and not the numbers I’m looking at every day. So naturally I thought they were the same thing... I was clearly wrong. But because of that confusion I saw the “20k point is this rank and 25k points is this rank” thing and got even more confused because they didn’t line up. Then I saw the videos/comments/tutorials say it then goes to said % are grand marshals and so on. Which was confusing because the top 1% are rank 8. And people were saying all of the ranks weren’t out so I assumed, I know shame on me, that it was just a slow release on Blizzards part. 
---
So I clearly missed the key points in my research that these fine people above pointed out. 
---
Sorry I offended your awesomeness with my confusion to the point where you had to drop your big dick knowledge in here. 
---
The point of the reddit should be answering some confusion as well. Instead of comments like yours which just waste your time and the OPs time. 
---
Go flame the ones still posting pics of them fighting with quivers and the ones posting “Unpopular Opinion: blah blah blah” posts
---
Read and move along.
---
Cheers, kiddo
---
i dont think im looking for a "leveling" guild either. because im pretty close to level 60 and then ill be done leveling. i just want like a "normal" guild that does whatever. like has people who are leveling and doing dungeons together, but also max level people doing max level dungeons together. and maybe raiding every once in awhile as well
---
Do you know if there is a way to see the amount of rage gained per player?
---
If you know you're being camped just don't rez, go talk a walk for 5 minutes.  It's part of the game and was for a lot longer than vanilla.
---
i am a tank
---
Oh. So that's why I see the same person spamming LFG messages every 30 seconds, despite the chat being slow.
---
ESH
---
I play on thunderfury there a guild with the same name
---
I don't disagree.
---
no that is not at all what wep skill does.
---
Wep skill greatly increases the damage your auto attacks do to bosses.  It does (very very very slightly) increase hit and crit and some other things, but it does so at a rate that is essentially negligible.
---
Nah you’re just making stuff up. Your story is obviously changing. First he doesn’t know how to get cat form. You find out it doesn’t have a quest, so now he’s a penny pincher. Bet so. It’s 20 silver. You’re telling me he never used stealth? Haha sure.
---
15 minute patch. Rest ban wave.
---
It can push any debuff that isn’t high priority because there is a 16 debuff cap. So it could push off a curse or corruption or whatever.
---
I don’t have a list of high priority debuffs but I’m sure you can google it.
---
Don’t let that stop you, ask any random. Can make a group in no time.
---
Some people work different hours than you. Crazy how that is.
---
I like my guild, but I wouldn't say we're hardcore. We use mono dkp but an older version. I assume they take the time to do a hard version of dkp list but with how busy everyone is I don't fully believe there is. For us it's easier to use the old version. We did our first phase 1 rag kill last week
---
Calling out on a Tuesday is a classic rookie move
---
That sounds like a lame excuse. The design could be fixed by adding a couple of more spots to connect the "tiers" of the zone, so that you don't have to run around half the zone to get up a cliff, and by fixing up the shoreline slightly so that it's never so steep that you have to swim. Literally just a little bit of terrain brushing.
---
one of the features of classicLFG was that it would send data from the trade channel over a special channel for those outside of a city, so anyone looking for a group in trade chat would show up to all classicLFG users. that functionality won't work anymore. that's what people mean by classicLFG being somewhat affected by this change.
---
Yeah its awful
---
Got a buddy named Skrypture that I only can read as skyrupture
---
Any suggestions?
---
Correct. I just listed the numbers, but there's a reason why there are more Horde players in PVP servers than Alliance. The queues in retail also show the differences in queue, to the point that mercenary mode had to be implemented.
---
&gt; I want to know if I can learn the trainable ability from a pet by fighting grey mobs.
---
Yes, you can. All you need to do it to have the pet use the ability you want to learn until you learn it. It usually doesn't take very long.
---
Yeah I'm in the same boat. Curious where the ratio will land. Luckily we don't have to wait long to find out.  I just remember alliance having monster queues in vanilla, so I hope that they are instant here in classic. (or maybe become instant once the initial furor dies down.)
---
They are better than mage water and roasted quail, usable everywhere, but require honored with Frostwolf and you only get 5 for the 63s cost, not 20.
---
ya pretty much (:

I thought about it, but then realized the last expansion I purchased was WoD, so... yeah, not going back to what made me quit retail for good lol.
---
Just got my gf to play wow and now she's addicted too. Wich means i can play as long as I want but I didn't use a plate for food in the last weeks cause there's nobody who does the dishes.
---
Having a day off during the week kicks ass.
---
You can go shopping and the stores have far less traffic. You can knock out choirs, do laundry, clean the house, *DO THAT THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO*, and life just moves a little bit slower in town.
---
Seriously, time moves ESPECIALLY SLOW when your server is down - prolonging your day off.

Winter 2017

big "xD" guy energy in this screen
---
U dont even talk about paladins having a hug
---

It's so weird to me that people bash other gamers watching streams. Like, do you think people sit in front of their computer only listening to a stream? Also it seems hard to understand that some people don't find sports entertaining and would rather watch a podcast or w/e else they are in to.
---
Most of the times when I play a game I have something streaming on my second screen, AKA Twitch, Youtube or Netflix. 
---
And the way I see it, there's two types of streamers. The ones that are good at the game and are very vocal about how they play (Venruki) and there are the entertainers (Asmon). 
---
Now I might not like Asmon's style as much but to call him a "loser" when the guy makes millions is far fetched. The guy knows how to entertain his audience better than you ever will and his following is more than aware that he does weird shit that woudn't be accepted in a normal raiding environment but that's EXACTLY why they watch him. 
---
If he's not your cup of tea, I get that. But he's living a better life than most of us reddit plebs
---
Literally Unplayable
---
Was one if not the best spot for a while in P2.
---
Not really, because you're already 75% of the way down to where you pull rotgrip when you pull tinkerer, and then you're just running up to princess. So it's only a little bit longer than if you jumped down after princess.
---
The other big advantage is that you can build up all that aggro while running, and by time you're at mara he's usually at like 30% health already. For the last 25%, he's slow so you can basically shoot on CD while kiting, and once you're up there you can throw a cat at him with bite/claw auto and there's no way it'll pull aggro.
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 60 in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 60. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
I dreamed of being a night elf priest... my GM wouldn’t let me :(
---
Pool's open
---
Honestly, it was kind of neat seeing pre-cata thousand needles but god damn its better in retail.
---
I really want this to be true. So many people botting, honor trading, and buying gold. Let’s see who gets hit!
---
There’s no way people will be able to rush to do this except the AV tabard haha, WSG and Arathi will take months, and arathi isn’t even out
---
Flasks, mongoose, giants, free action pots (I have fishing), stonescale oils, all sell reasonably well.  I was making a killing on major Mana potions for a few weeks as well but the market crashed hard on those
---
Nobody believes me when I tell them my big Tauren body pulls more aggro than normal but damn it I know it's true.
---
Yeah that hellcaller/imp pack is tough without gear. You just have to make sure to absolutely right click the fireball to prevent the hellcaller from casting that instead of rain of fire immediately once you've enslaved him. Then dot each imp up, I usually do an agony and corruption on each one then go back around and start applying siphon life, but you may want to start with siphon life and corruption instead for more survivability.
---
As for the sacrifice cast you just can't take any chances or get greedy at all when you're fighting him. You have to immediately get behind the pillar when he starts casting, take your time and let your dots do the work. 
---
Also, make sure you have a major health pot, healthstone and death coil all up when you start a pull  and maybe even find a priest outside DM to give you fort before you start. Soulstone being up is also a given
---
sorry bud but unless you are on an RP server or something once you're level 60 people dont really run dungeons for fun, they'll be gearing alts or future raiders or something. just find a leveling guild i promise thats what you're looking for.
---
As a tank, I’d say just dive in. You will only learn by going through them. Most pugs will be helpful and give you directions or even mark pulls for you so you can learn them. Don’t be afraid!
---
As for guilds, look for guilds advertising getting their pre-bis and raiding. Even if you don’t sign up for raids they will be running lots of end game dungeons to gear up. And once you feel confident in gear and your guild, consider signing up for raids too.
---
Yeah I love seeing this joke over and over again. It's funny every time in every scenario and it never gets old ^/s
---
I used them after crafting my robes of the void. Something about the vomit shade of purple just really turned me off. Also, robes clip your mount while riding, and it is super irritating having my dreadsteed cut in half by my clothing. I'd much rather wear pants and a tunic, like any self respecting pirate would.
---
While that's a helluva commute, I agree with you. I probably get one/two dungeons a night in, maybe a quest or two as well. It's a coupla hours, and some days I have social engagements and don't do that.
---
And honestly, that's fine. Im 60 and decently geared, with one rep grind down. Considering the patch pacing, there is little need to marathon for 16 hours straight.
---
Kromkrush is not 80/20 hahah
---
My guild hasn't had any problems since we changed one thing for the Off Tank(s). Now, this will depend on how many people you have and how good your P2 dps is. But essentially, Tank #2 wants to be at a position on the threat meter where others will get fireballs during P2 and move him up the meter for the start of P3. In our runs, where P2 lasts maybe 30 seconds, that means he wants to be #5/6 on threat going into P2 and we have another tank trying to be #7/8 on threat. The fewer people/lower dps your run has, the lower down the list the tank wants to be as there will be more fireballs coming out.
---
A “leveling” guild is a “normal” one. Raid guilds only admit people who will be on their raiding teams, the hardcore ones anyway. Some guilds are split and have a raiding guild, and a feeder leveling guild where they pull their recruits from.
---
how do you find guilds like that?
---
CharacterNotes is the best choice for that.
---
I find princess incredibly easy to kite and get sub 4 min kills when using Barov trinket.  Only time I've ever had to FD princess was when pet got feared into giants.
---
DMT farm is much more difficult as a whole.  I can see the perspective that the mechanics of fighting king are relatively easy, but one bad FD fail and you're boned.  Not to mention getting to the king is a pain in the ass, requires an invis pot and charge, and is susceptible to RNG in a way that the Mara farm is not.  
---
I get 35ish gph doing Mara farm, and about 45 gph doing DMT with no deaths.  If you die in DMT, its about equal.  This is pure gold farm without selling loot.
---
Ah. Sounds exactly like what is going on in my city.
---
But then you have to clog your Friends list with pricks.
---
Never discount the amount of people that want to be pirates or ninjas. Also, did you ever wonder why it only drops in a horde zone? Hmn...
---
crazy you could not infer that i obviously meant daytime hour jobs
---
7.5 hours for coffee, cake and Christmas party, 30 mins for keyring!
---
I bought my Krol Blade at 54 for 215g, just stood in Org during peak time and spammed for 30 minutes. Someone was desperate for the last little bit for their epic mount.
---
Over thrash blade, it's a noticeable difference. It gave me the ability at 55 to solo farm BRD and kill plugger, giving me the ability to upgrade my chest on my own while waiting for a angerforge group.
---
That farming gave the the gold for devilsaur set and other boes.
---
During Vanilla and for a few expansions later, you could queue for AV as a group of 5, no more.
---
Hunter with herb must be pulling some 60+g/hour in Maraudon, thanks for explaining. DM Tribute has been quite frustrating so far but the upside is ridiculous once you can do it reliably.
---
Awesome! can't wait
---
Sometimes, but not always.
---
I totally agree, the extra effort for blizzard to create tattle groups would be much better. They could have also kept PvE servers in their own group so people cry less about playing with casual players (whether true or not people will still blame PvE players for their losses)
---
Russian Horde vs English Alliance, or English Horde vs French Alliance would be fine
---
Same
---
We just use a yell macro. There might be a better way, or some trickery using some unit frame addon, but the yell works fine. Just spam it a few times - we've never used comms for that. It may seem minor, but on longer fights like rag or ony, or even mana burn related fights where our healers are pressed.
---
Hey I'm a classic player. You're braindead if you can't get out of orgrimmar on retail. Bye.
---
They've been posted on the front page of mmo-champion for about 12 years now, most people on this sub are probably familiar with DLC.
---
If u like having lots of cds and learning how to use em
---
This is also kind of why I asked the question, to find both good and bad things to reflect upon my own habits. Hope you can find the help you need, if it is help that you want.
---
I also enjoy both :)
---
Most nameplate addons give you an option to color the plate by class.
---
I personally use ElvUI which has the option. It will also show on the tooltip when you hover over someone.
---
Lastly, spy shows classes. If you're pvping without spy you're doing it wrong. Despite how you feel about it, it is legal and it is in the game. Not using it based on some "higher morality" is just gimping yourself.
---
in my experience, pugs are the complete opposite of "helpful". they dont even let me set up pulls and start attacking before i even drop consecration. i dont think they would be able to help me with directions and marking
---
Yeah I know how to tank. Im sorry but if you have a warrior charge in and whirlwind immediately either you use a nade or they pull agro. They don't focus targets, they pull ahead of you and get multiple groups etc. its annoying and it puts more stress on the healer. The healer will spend more mana = more down time = slower runs. Sometimes they need to know their place in the spirit world.
---
Back in  vanilla on Illidan server we (horde) won AV like 98% before cross realm.
---
He is low on health, running away, and a priest is „somewhat near him“. Guess what, Sherlock, he was under attack. 
---
One has to be kind of mentally challenged to ask such question and then post this crap on reddit.
---
intrestin. seems like they blew their load then tried cashing in?
---
thanks for the post
---
&gt;taken #3 DPS overall for MC
---
You should /gkick every rogue and dps warrior if that is true
---
Stop telling people where my farm spot is! It’s so nice that no one goes here. Ugh.
---
I’m not sure where you’re getting your metrics for populations. Where’s this number that shows that individual Classic server pops are so much higher than Vanilla?
---
I actually played from the day of launch through the end of Cata before I took my first major break. My experience then was very similar to what’s happening now, complete with sever crashes due to massive meatgrinders in Hillsbrad, the Barrens (RIP Crossroads), Ashenvale, and Arathi Highlands. 
---
I distinctly remember multiple reports of Blackrock, especially UBRS and MC entrances, and later the entrance to ZG being impossible to get to without corpse hopping. 
---
Killing “for fun” in vanilla also took the form of raid groups assaulting capitals or skirmish teams destroying low level towns so lowbies couldn’t turn in quests. The honor system was partly in response to this, by implementing “honorless kills” in order to dissuade higher levels from camping low level towns and zones.
---
Then they implemented the ranking system in an attempt to get PvPers into the meat grinder of the BGs and relieve the pressure on world zones. 
---
Ultimately I really don’t think you’re remembering things correctly. Either that or you’re being completely dishonest about your supposed experience.
---
I purposefully take the boat at Menethil as a 60 priest. We have a particular rogue on our server thst always camps there. It's fun to go there for a fight.
---
Got jumped there by a druid yesterday, and I was nuking him down like crazy until the rogue jumped me so I turned to him. I ended up dying, because it's hard to be truly effective as a raid spec'd Holy priest in cobbled together dungeon blues I call "my pvp set". But I got to see the rogue die in the water under the docks like the coward rogues are. So that was fun.
---
The druid definitely won't jump me again without help. He was having his ass handed to him. It's fun to go to Menethil :)
---
It might sound a joke or a terrible idea, but I really dumped wife so I could enjoy.my lifestyle. Some women cant stand you on PC even a single hour straight.
---
Actual gf tried to commit my exwife mistake, tryna take me away from videogames. 
---
We had a few words. I told her "You might be happy lying on the sofa, watching TV crap and same movies over and over again. I dont enjoy that, I enjoy gaming, and theres nothing you can do to change that. Accept it or shut the door behind you when you leave"
---
I think that they're soul-crushingly boring, but to each their own.
---
They might be just your cup of tea.
---
If you aren't enjoying it early, though, and think to yourself "maybe it gets better"; no, it doesn't.
---
No it isn't. If you don't proc, it's objectively worse.
---
It's objectively worse for stamina regardless of procs. 
---
Even when it procs, it's arguably worse against warriors and shamans, who have enough armor that 1 proc doesn't make up for the damage, especially in later patches.
---
Wasn't MC also just bugged to hell for the first several months, too?
---
People couldn't even clear a single trash pack until they tuned it, IIRC.
---
Whatever a buyers willing to pay. If it were me, I’d spend about 5 dollars max.
---
Because BG, past 3-4 weeks downtime was less than 15mins lol
---
True, good tip!
---
In my opinion it's all about INFORMATION.
---
Way more sources of information out there today than we had fifteen years ago.  I remember fifteen years ago just running whatever instances people in my guild were running for the fun of it - and not because of the gear I needed.  Fast forward to today and everyone is armed with their BIS list and for the most part are only running instances that can provide that gear.  So everyone is better geared than they were back in the day.
---
In addition to the gear side of information - the other side is tactics.  Everyone knows the tactics inside and out and there are multiple guides for every boss.  So there is a lot less ambiguity around what people are doing and should be doing.
---
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no alliance; For healers are with me; Their rods and their staves, they comfort me.
---
The parents of people in their 30’s are actual boomers. It’s a weird insult.
---
Copy the YouTube link, paste the YouTube link.
---
yes
---
Got my SoZ for 100g, while Krols were going for 300g+. Got tired of farming UBRS for main hand Dals. Twice I've seen it drop and twice I've lost the roll to other rogue guild alts that barely logs on.
---
At this point you just want to get the last word in to make yourself feel more intelligent. 
---
Pro-redditor for sure. You’re around the same quality of internet persona as anyone who reviews on Yelp.
---
If you have sexymap installed and loaded, right click the minimap to open options and there is drop down box with presets. Select "simple square".
---
\+ There's 3 bank now in retail in org.
---
It's hard enough to really get a feel for your whole server, when you make the pool 10 to 20 times larger you really can't bet on seeing the same people twice
---
in MC true but it’s still not a great idea to develop bad habits
---
Meh. Your post is sillier than his. Onyxia's fireballs, when they hit two or more people, were only dropping threat on the oldest toons up until recently. You never know what archaic factors Blizzard's programmers used to determine "random" things.
---
Haven’t your parents taught you manners? That would explain why you’re in Alliance too lol
---
AHhh the true Vanilla experience, even the posts are the same. "I took the day off". So much nostalgia. Thank you.
---
As a hunter, track humanoids is very helpful for pvp, and I can see how that placement could be beneficial. Especially since you have to mouse over the enemy faction in order to see them on spy.
---
“Hey guys can we have the shadow priest ‘name’ not pull aggro please? I’ve noticed him pulling almost every time”
---
IMAGINE!
---
Just got Draenor Pathfinder today. Gave me a new appreciation for that expansion. The zone content especially was so good. And the raids. And the dungeons. Even Tanaan was decent. Just a teeeeensy bit too much Garisson (The ship based missions were too much for me).
---
Look out we got a badass over here
---
As a fisherman and a cook, thank you :) lol
---
^^^little ^^^thunder
---
as long as you have cheetah up you should be able to stay out of range of her and max range her boulders. I usually stop and auto shot once i have a big enough gap, and ALWAYS autoshot / arcane right after she tries to throw her boulder.
---
I also bait out dust clouds 3 or 4 times before my pet dies. Save rapid fire for one of those
---
Yeah like R14 gets me sick BiS weapons, a gf can't compete with that.
---
"2nd most in your raid" doesnt mean anything, could be 400 dps which is terrible
---
We have a ret pally gm with hand of rag and is very geared and I still dunk on him on the meters as a pre bis fury warrior with thrash and mirahs. I dont really care what specs anyone picks as long as we are clearing relatively quick enough but lets not pretend that a ret pally, even geared, can pull decent dps
---
Y'know that basically any question about modern WoW you might have can be answered just by using Google, right?  
---
But I guess this farms more karma than just putting a bit of effort...
---
That's the problem though.  Dont you see everyone wants to love off there un balanced server to balanced ones making it un balanced.  No one will move from dominant server to outnumbered server to even it out.
---
Yeah, the first thing you do is open the BG tab and see if the opposing faction is all from the same server. If so, you generally put a little more thought/strategy into "reacting" to how they play. When it looks like a pug or partial premade you can play like normal.
---
Yikes! 63s for 5? That's a little over 2.5g a stack. NOPE. Not better then mage water. You can get 120 mage water for what...? A 1g tip?
---
The people ignoring this part of your post are annoying the hell out of me.
---
There’s no way to save someone after they’re dead. You could have done nothing to help him. If he wanted help earlier he should have asked for it. 
---
You did nothing wrong.
---
Even if you had jumped in and saved him, he would have probably yelled at you for not letting him solo.
---
 [http://shadowpanther.net/weapons-pve.htm](http://shadowpanther.net/weapons-pve.htm) / Rogue discord. Search better
---
That's fair - letting them die IS the extreme. Sometimes it can't be avoided. And sometimes that comes with a sadistic satisfaction - I guess that's all I am saying.
---
Shadowpanther.net will get you started
---
[Shadow Panther has a list](https://shadowpanther.net/daggers-pvp.htm) Make a  decision based on what you are trying to do.
---
Can't let another Alliance in Org emote insult Thrall for three straight minutes with any other class, so yes.
---
&gt;or am I ruining the meme?
---
Such a boomer thing to say
---
At least someone lold
---
15 years of basement dwelling does not make anything good for your life, but it makes you into one hell of a force in classic wow.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who's encountered Forti more than a few times lol
---
&gt; but I took today off.
---
Yeah, this was a mistake. Take off the day after patch day in the future.
---
You’re also brain dead if you take the hyperbolic term “lost for hours” as literally being lost for hours
---
ya wife aggro means you like your spouse not the other way around lol
---
&gt; Class balance unequivocally improved after wow classic. Yes there were still some imbalanced class/specs, but at least it was a lot closer than it was in classic. Not to mention huge improvements on DR and cooldown timings.
---
Thats only true if you consider homogenization a good thing. If you like variety, and meaningful choice, the classic class design is better. 
---
The honor grind Im not defending, and dont want to defend. Its def. a better system in later patches. 
---
Arenas are tricky. In theory I think they are fine, and I had fun in them during Cata, but its the mindset that every class needs to be competitive in a 2v2 or 3v3 environment that ruined class balance for me.
---
You are able to get +550-600 healing in dungeon blues. This was never possible in vanilla when MC was first out because items were waaaay weaker than they are now.
---
I remember leveling in Classic and seeing a mage broadcast "lfg for BRD, 55 frost mage with 250 sp". Shit like that was not possible back in the day. You'd have be decked out to come anywhere close to those numbers.
---
Maybe join arena/anger/golem spams? I can’t imagine people will care that you’re leveling a pet
---
Captain Obvious to the justice league tower.  Paging captain obvious.
---
Nah I am a NEET who lives off the gov. This meme still sucks though
---
In a lot of big cities, especially if you work in the downtown area, moving closer to work could mean doubling your rent.
---
damn i was hoping they didn't im lev 19 and at 82%
---
Everyone here giving all these technical reasons and I just like being a ninja.
---
how is DM significantly easier? lol
---
Mara is a cake walk
---
I could consider it objectively correct, Cataclysm was near perfect for myself and my guild mates.
---
Paladin tanking is a blast, and entirely doable for any content short of MC and Onyxia.(Except you can tank Onyxia, no one will let you.)
---
Nor have I but that doesn't mean anything really since I played in one PuG. But since almost all PuGs run +1 (Gehennas EU) and most people know what it is.
---
Worked more.
---
If this destroys honorspy I'm going to be a sad panda.  Knowing how much I have to grind compared to others keeps the PVP grind sane.
---
it's the classic forum, so you'll probably get reamed for saying anything good about future expansions.
---
My guild is pretty active and I haven’t had any trouble finding any groups (with non-guildies) from 1-49 so far. 
---
Just saying, Alliance do outnumber us by a fair amount, but I wouldn’t go as far to say the Horde side is dead. Most of them are just not set up in Org.
---
That’s interesting. Do the healers know to expect this then? I can see this working, if it’s an established practice for them to be aware of. 
---
I like this, may try and bring it up. Whenever I lifetap and bandage I get 2 or 3 healers on me instead of them focusing on those that need it. 
---
But I can also see this backfiring, like if you get hit by a fireball at the same time when one of the heals would have saved you.
---
what is your struggle with princess? You just have to keep cheetah on and kite, its suuuper simple
---
DS ruin still should use corruption unless you have like 4+ warlocks. we usually have 3 in our raid and our DS ruin lock(s) use corruption.
---
That's a good way to put it, yeah---Especially since Legion was essentially a 2-in-1 expansion that contained a ton of the missing content from WoD on top of all of its own.
---
Like, I knew all the way back in 7.0.3 that whatever followed legion was going to suck no matter how good it might be, but man I was not prepared for BfA to just be "Legion except smaller and also complete dogshit"
---
&gt; Getting there  
---
&gt;A pit of lava known as the [Great Divide](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Great_Divide) has split the Barrens in two and separates this zone from the [Northern Barrens](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Northern_Barrens).  It cannot be crossed directly without a flying mount. However, there is  an area on the border between the Northern Barrens and [Stonetalon Mountains](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Stonetalon_Mountains)  that splits off and leads here. This is the normal method of getting  here since the questing experience has been designed to segue from  Stonetalon to the Southern Barrens. Low level Horde players can also  reach the Southern Barrens through the [Great Gate](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Great_Gate) at the [Mulgore](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Mulgore) border, but should be advised that this zone is a much higher level. Alliance players can run through [Dustwallow Marsh](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dustwallow_Marsh) (a series of bridges have been constructed and lead here directly from Theramore) or head down the coast from [Ratchet](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ratchet) to [Northwatch Hold](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Northwatch_Hold). 
---

---
Well a lot of people just don't like the responsibility. I've definitely seen my fair share of druids and warriors that don't want to tank, as well as paladins that hate healing. The "orb on reserve" thing is a side effect of tank gearing.
---
UBRS isn't even that long and there are only 2 bosses left after Rend. It's just really selfish to join an advertised full run and then making up reasons to bounce before it's done.
---
Tried it and wondered where the talent trees went, why I only had 6 skills, and why I never ran out of mana.
---
are you me? I also am stubborn about sticking with a 2H and plate armor despite suboptimal raid spec and worse dps than fury. 
---
My advice is remain arms. You're best for dungeons (dps or tanking) and pvp. You just have inferior raid dps but you have a guild setup where that is permissible. You're trading all of this for a higher dps spec, AND fury is gimped if you go 2H over DW. So you'd still not be getting the most out of the respec.
---
There's no point in switching to fury unless you go DW for max dps if raid dps is your priority. Otherwise you're giving up too much.
---
what’s a better threat meter?
---
If you're aoe leveling, probably.
---
Why is it on me to call out a dude who isn’t wiping the raid and only tilting me by precasting and pulling aggro? Seems like that would be far more on the ranks to call out or the raid lead or guild lead?????
---
They look cool doing it too!
---
Did you know, they now allow...gasp...Europeans to play this game?  Even Australians sometimes!
---
Tanks are 20% of groups for dungeons but only 5-10% of a raid.  Many just play DPS as that will be their main role in raids.  If you want to be a MT you either need to be an officer, or make your own guild due to the fact that gear gets funneled into you relatively quickly. Most guilds want someone committed for that role.
---
Imagine playing retail
---
Will Blizz not do anything about it? Even if you screenshot or record it?
---
&gt; You only think it's stupid because you tried it and it failed 
---
yes... I tried by saying 'no'. good one there.
---
­&gt;­In case you wish to know why your little experiment failed to gain you 3 hours of your McD salary with a quick gif
---
you sure seems to have issues with projections here.
---
&gt;It's sharding. A feature that wasn't in vanilla. It's not your PC being bad, it's something that happens to literally every player when they cross zones.
---
it's almost as if you came close to understanding what '' the whole word isn't loaded in your memory at once'', but they dropped your brain at the last minute.
---
Anyone actually in that situation know's you don't waste time typing that out to a bunch of random dudes online you start shoving that gf into a closet or something.
---
So, the NPCs near the Zepplins tell you where they go
---
And there's a portal in the Pandaria Shrines directly to Orgrimmar
---
So yeah good grief I just don't know
---
Trash respawns stupid quick in SM so I'd still say it's inconclusive
---
Dumb people like me? You guys can't even follow the rules of a simple subreddit and the mods can't even mod it correctly. Can't beat someone being toxic like yourself without being toxic myself because toxicity is the only thing you understand
---
Rend seems super popular, I'm surprised to hear that. I feel it's much more likely people drop after rend.
---
Literally nobody is saying the situation blizzard implemented isn't bad you moron. They're pointing out that someone chose to make the game unplayable and are now acting surprised when those players just leave, it's simple cause and effect. An idea which seems to go right over the head of dumbshits like you. 
---
I'm not even from a terribly unbalanced server but if you had any foresight whatsoever you'd realize that camping cities and making the game unplayable = mass migration, you're participating in that and you're also on reddit telling people they're crybabies for pointing out the problem and subsequently crying about it when you get backlash for acting like an asshole. 
---
You realize I can hate a shitty system and also the shitty people that exploit it right? Just because I think capitalism is a shit system doesn't mean I can't also hate people like Jeff Bezos for being an evil exploitative cocksucker. Again, think about the repercussions of your actions moron.
---
This is the main example that I've been giving the people in our server Discord. (who were **recorded** and publicly called out, and is actually the reason the tweet was posted. Mooky is one of ours.).

Resist
---
This is my first time playing any wow, I'm on a pvp server because my friends said it was fun, but so far I don't get it. I'd say it's less pvp and more like griefing. 
---
I honestly can't recall the last time a character around my lvl attacked me 1v1, when I wasn't already engaged in a pve fight. I'm told in retail you can 'disable' pvp so you can quest in peace, which sounds awesome.

Drill a hole from your gaming-chair directly into the sewer and just dump it all without getting up. Or do what they did in Idiocracy and make a toilet-chair!

Sharing is caring!

Imagine joining a dungeon group and asking for shared quests and some bloke goes out of his way to share his ooze tube as well!
---
People taking a day off to play content (BGs) that will be there when they get home, the next day, the next weekend, etc... is so stupid.  How about they calm down and just play it when they can instead of needing everything NOW NOW NOW.
---
Yeah 100% what Xuniasa and Perkinz said.  
---
I was getting wrecked completely by the mobs in a way that was so far from what the previous zones were like.
---
What WoD had was good there just wasn't nearly enough of it. And fuck the boomkin changes leading into legion
---
You don't really answer my point that it's wrong to say that changes ultimately make the game feels like retail.
---
Take a concrete example: 
---
* Levelling in Vanilla is harder and longer than in retail
---
* 1.12 makes levelling easier and faster
---
* I propose giving mobs 10% more health and damage
---
Can you really say that this type of changes would be a step toward retail? because I think it goes actually in the opposite direction. And what if people suggest things that are neither Vanilla nor Retail? it makes the game different and you can say you don't like it but you can't say: go retail if I suggest it.
---
The day that many servers perish or the game itself takes a massive hit due to preventable problem that Blizzard could have solved and players tried to bring awareness to... I wonder if you'll be still tired of seeing so many of those complaints?
---
Are we still posting this garbage? The only requirement for having a mount at 40-42 is a monitor and a keyboard. Please stop with the shitposts, you're not a special snowflake.
---
Save for very few servers, most of the servers had significantly less overall players than today's classic servers. that is a fact based on Blizzard stating so. Also the technology today allows Blizzard to do this now, it was not a good idea in 2004.
---
If you played at launch, you had quite a bit of time to get to 60 before the honor system arrived (at least in the US--not so in Europe though).
---
It's called Expressway. I use that same font across the entire UI.
---
No, and honestly unles you're wearing epics, the first time you try it in a dungeon, you're gonna have a bad time of it. In pre-bis and arms prot I went from getting guild invites with every pug, to apologizing to my group like I lost my boner on the first date.
---
How can I learn to Parse better in MC?
---
I am a mage, so my rotation is pretty straight forward, I also rarely stop casting, yet my parse is like 30-50 range.
---
Any guides or reading I can do to figure out where I M going wrong?
---
It's really not that bad.  This sub is just full of casual dad gamers who didnt realize what they were signing up for.
---
No it's not that bad.  The people who ACTUALLY wanted to PvP are enjoying realms where they are out numbered as ranking up is much easier.  The people who wanted PvP as long as ONLY their faction EVER won are the ones crying on Reddit.   
---
They can reroll, quit, xfer, etc.  It's just a bunch of entitled asshats believing that everything that happens including those own choice of server is blizzards fault and couldn't possibly be their own lack of foresight.
---
What your seeing is complaints from people who should have rolled on PVE servers, and circle jerking from people who literally believe their faction is "superior" in skill despite nearly every victory being a death ball numbers game.  I've never seen this many bad horde players, but man they talk mad shit when they outnumber the opposing faction like the fight was a measure of skill.  That's coming from a horde/alliance player both.    It's like all the shitters from alliance side PvP rerolled horde because "iTs A SuPeRiOr PlAyErS cHoIcE".
---
There is no tanks because the average player lacks the ability to take any responsibility for their actions and that is kind of the minimum requirement of tanking
---
As a tank and dps they are absolute garbage 
---
As healers they are avery good and fun too, and in pvp they are super OP when paired with others
---
based. you should apply to be a moderator!
---
any half decent DS/ruin lock still gonna be using corruption
---
and SM/ruin is only slightly worse baseline, but even on single target fights if you get any kind of nightfall proc luck at all you'll prob out dps a similarly geared/skilled DS/ruin lock, at least in my experience. any fight where you can get/keep 3-4 corruptions up (aka most MC fights) you should blow them out of the water as SM/ruin unless you get the worst RNG ever
---
I'm not sure if you meant to reply to my comment or Mr\_Meowser41  but I agree with you dude.
---
well yeah it doesn't quite live up to Thor's Hammer
---
can anyone verify the XP for 1st turn in then subsequent turn ins? For twinks it will limit how many you can ever turn in. Also if you don't turn them in can they be used for anything else?

Tbh honest I read this in Athene's voice.

So you left one overly farmed faction to join another overly farmed faction?

I don't think you know what "objectively" means.

You need the main Atlas mod and then the Atlas Classic module to get the dungeon maps

Ran BRD from start to finish the way you would in Classic if you didn't have the key yet and then got it after Bael'Gar.

I came back for Classic.  I do not intend to play BC.  I would almost certainly get excited and stick around for Classic+.  /shrug

No, I wooshed big time. I was writing up a story about bots not being banned on my server and then realized...

Forsaken not having shaman is going to suck, no means of poison dispel spells out a painful existence for bosses like princess huhu

(shoutout to Gormist from the Lovely Lads for creating this hellish weebery)

bro read the damn patch update
---
Not going to lie, it's fun to know that others feel this way. Reddit aint the best community for on-going discussion as a thread will spring up then quickly fade away. But having a common enemy brings us together.
---
And you know what? Modern WoW sucks. It's sucked for a long time. I'm not going to change my opinion just because everyone else is saying the same thing. Because it feels damn good to know I'm not alone in this.
---
I only play when my wife is working or in bed. Sooooo tired.
---
For combat mechanics, Blizzard still relies on the 1.12 Reference Client. That part of the game hasn't been intentionally altered yet.
---
Each city has a set of battlemasters you can queue at or you go to the appropriate instance entrance in Ashenvale or Alterac.
---
Personally I only pop 1 major mana per raid on rag, and otherwise I just use superiors if I really need more mana... First raid I went through like 15.
---
Awesome feeling! I can understand that feeling of class envy, I'm so glad you found something you love :)
---
Yeah sex is great and all but have you ever tried doing arena/angerforge/golem runs all night long?
---
You basically said it best in that the games built for difference audiences and I am personally not apart of that audience.  For me though the main factor that ruined any chance of me playing retail is I hate the direction class design went. It’s just not fun for me at all because of that factor alone. I’m also not a huge fan the direction PvP has taken. And am also indifferent to these new progression systems such as artifact power, azerite, and likely anima.

Let your instant cast DoTs do the work. Don't be greedy with immolates or non-nightfall shadowbolts. You can force him away from the pillar by barely being in the water and still behind the pillar. LoS him in a really narrow side to side range. The only time I ever have him in sight, outside of applying DoTs, is in cases where the pathing gets funky and he walks toward me in the water. I peak out just far enough to get him back out of the water and immediately go back. 
---
Also, don't try to get a shard off him until you are ***really*** confident he will die immediately. I've been doing this farm for weeks and still have cases where he's at 1-2% and I try to get a shard and he sacrifices me.  It doesn't kill me, but it adds time to your runs.
---
you have to go to the BG portal, que and then you can go do something else while you wait. (at least that is how I remember it worked).

"Is he attacking you?"

"YES HELP PLS"

It's actually elements of old patches, with new additions (cross realm) as well as account services..on a new-er client.

The extra time is likely to test stability. Multiple aspects.
---
Asahi is my favorite beer, grats
---
This is the correct outlook to have and you should be commended for it. Loot distribution is a communal process meant to reward players but more importantly help the guild progress.
---
Lots of addons kind of screw QoL for the people not using them. Like auction house addons that auto break up stacks before you post them to the AH. Its no biggie if everyone uses the AH addon, but for those that dont it just amounts to spam.
---
Well yeah, but blizzard doesn't give a fuck about it being broken. Else they'd need to improve their servers
---
If you did more damage than the locks then your locks aren't very good.
---
What are you even talking about?  They are down for an hour tops one day a week and today is 7 or 8 hours.
---
If you are match inclined that is 1 hour out of 168 hours in the week - or less than one percent of the time.  Add in today and you still would have only 10 hours of downtime for an entire month.  Do you have nothing going on outside the game that the less than one percent of normal downtime is adversely effecting your ability to level and get gear and have fun in the game? 
---
Get some perspective and maybe take a few hours break from the game once in a while?
---
As a poly guy, it took me a second to figure out what was wrong here.
---
&gt;new players that need to be told to not put bullshit like serpent sting on lmao
---
I can't remember if deep wounds compete with corruption, or god forbid people with weapon procs. Either way, I always found it to be just annoying to use corruption in raids, the spell also doesn't scale as well as shadowbolt so in the later tiers its literally only used to fish for Nightfall.
---
And yes, you are right about SM/Ruin having potentially higher damage output if you are fishing for Nightfall procs, and its probably great in MC as you said. But I am not its as good in BWL, where every boss is ultra threat sensitive and you can't even really use corruption that much, and getting a nightfall proc and accidentally bursting would probably wipe the raid.
---
This is a completely fresh take on the subject, thank you for your submission!
---
Yes, and classic sucks too in a lot of ways. Both games have pros and cons.
---
Classic is fun for a short while, but PvE is literally non-existent, and PvP is a mess because the rank 14 grind is objectively bad.
---
At least retail has longevity in the form of PvE. I don't know a thing about retail pvp, so I can't comment on it.
---
There was an lfg tool in vanilla, it was just a useless iteration of it. It changed many times.
---
Dude I was SHOCKED when then game was "playable" after 2mins downloading the content. Thought I was gonna have to wait hours.
---
Yes, but the items you made will be usable again once you hit the req level eng. Like the cloak and dragonlings you may have made. But Accurate Scope ect you have to relearn the recipe if you want to craft more after switching.
---
I saved my Goblin Land Mine schematic until I switched to learn, since I wanted to make those forever, but havent picked up Deepdive or dragonlings again since I had them and they aren't really something you need 2 of.
---
We've had three consecutive weeks of rogue legs + dagger, the rogues are very, VERY happy.
---
Flamelash should be turned into a pve server at this point. It's about the only way to stop the exodus
---
They give xp every turn in. Don’t turn them in if you want to stay in the bracket.
---
its crazy how RNG we are lmao this lock i know sent me a SS of his log from one fight some night and he had like 44% crits on his shadowbolt lmao
---
While that might fix Twitch, it may affect launching the game as battle.net launcher is probably going to look for wowclassic.exe
---
Might be more sensible to take a copy and rename that copy...
---
The first best time was at launch, the second best time is now. Don't worry about falling behind. New guilds will do old raids and stuff so you don't miss anything.
---
When will servers be up?
---
I appreciate the constructive critism. And tbh this is my first ever guild and i only started it cause some Pugs told me too after i tried raid leading my first MC pug about month or so ago. Here we are now and were almost a full guild MC Raid. Also that viskang rogue never got gloves, i gave them to our dagger specd rogue. Also its hard when we cant fill a full 40man raid and we have a guildies RL friend, the 57 rogue. Who wants to come, also he was sword spec but was planning to go daggers at 60 and now he has a reasom to.
---
Ya, no. That isn't the issue. The issue is the API changes made broke any addon that uses chat channels. Plus the keyring slot was added so, I would assume bag and UI addons need to be patched.
---
Oh so we are back to this game again i see.
---
this + a well timed PI = free 200 dps lol
---
75% of Horde guilds log and 50% of Alliance guilds log.

Source: the cavernous depths of your anus.

That, it you have high expectations for those parties
---
I don't know the number for sure, but I do know that people used mods to queue at the same time, or they would just do a count down on voip and hit queue at the same time. So definitely not raids :) sorry for not much info
---
I did and ranked.

---
Yeahhh most girls aren't like that
---
You have no idea what we're talking about then.
---
The part of classiclfg that skims the chat channels is unaffected.  It scans all, not just LFG.
---
However, it would also talk to other addon users over the custom channel, to share groups.  So, I could be in feralas and I would see someone LFG in the trade channel because another user was in orgrimmar.
---
That's what I meant by "somewhat" affected.
---
I mean whether something is objectively fun or not isn't really debatable. Fun for some, not fun for others.   
---
I love playing a Paladin. Tanked my way up to raids, got my pre-bis for tanking, then got my healing set together pretty quickly so I could raid heal. Leveling is slow, but no slower than a warrior, and you're fantastic when paired with anyone else.   
---
Paladins bring a certain amount of support that no other class can really match. In PvP you can enable your allies to essentially go nuts. And while people laugh at it, you have an option to "opt out" of unfair PvP, or spawn camping. Just bubble, hearth, and go onto something else.  
---
Raiding will have you in the healing position, just like every other class that can heal. (With a few exceptions like the occasional Shadow Priest or Druid off-tank.) I personally enjoy healing, it's similar to ranged DPS'ing, but you're responsible for more people than just yourself. And Paladins are great healers, and can make use of every best piece of healer gear in the game. Now I'm with a really steady guild, and since I'm really well geared for tanking I can also off-tank for certain bosses like Garr without any issue with threat.   
---
Dungeons essentially allow you to do any role if you have the gear for it. I've had no issue tanking all the way up to UBRS. Tanked while leveling, and continue to tank in-between raid schedules. Once you understand what tools you have, you can handle pretty much any dungeon boss, and your AoE threat is really unmatched. (Especially in dungeons like Scholomance and Stratholme where holy damage is king)  
---
As for DPS, that's the one thing I have the least experience in, since I just never wanted to spec into ret, as finding dungeons as a DPS is a pain. I know they can put out some fun numbers in PvP, but can't really raid DPS well. I've had them in my dungeons, and they do just fine.  
---
All-in-all, Paladin is my favorite class, and has been for 15 years. They have a strong class identity, the best looking tier gear, and an unmatched number of tools and solutions to problems that may arise for yourself and your allies. Definitely fun to play, in more ways than just healing.
---
Yeah I havent in about a year. Why cant you just rotate the screen, then when people receive the video and see its sideways they also just rotate their phone to view it normally? Honest question.
---
This is why mods have to remove memes. 99% of them are low effort unoriginal trash
---
They don't want us to be able to as easily tell where people are ranked in the brackets from week to week so it's harder to stack brackets. That's what they're on about when they say "contrary to the spirit of the game."
---
People haven't been very helpful to you but the two things to take away from this: 
---
1.) They estimate the duration of maintenance a few days ahead of time. That will be in the launcher and at https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/support/service-status/. 
---
2.) Probably never a good idea to take off work with expectation to play the day of a new release/patch. It's possible that the servers come online even later than current estimates.
---
Depends, the higher agi of evles is nice and all but that level of minmaxing isn't super necessary for PvP, or even PvE. It comes down to Escape artist (gnomes) vs +1 to stealth (elves).
---
Escape artist is more practical in general and against anyone who can root you as it means you don't need to blow sprint to get out of a bind, very good against mages, druids, etc.
---
\+1 stealth is good for rogue v. rogue... and that's about it. Keep in mind however there are alternatives to both escape artist and the +1 stealth which you can get, so honeslty the difference overall is a little marginal.
---
If it were me, and I wanted to minmax PvP; gnome.
---
If I wanted to minmax PvE, I'd go elf for the agi. Escape artist isn't super useful in current raid content and improved sprint is good enough.
---
Noted.
---
God, this meme is so stale
---
Or maybe given the right set of tools, feral can achieve more than what other people have been told they can do. The dps of the warriors and rouges is in the correct percentile for what gear we have. This feral is literally in the top 2% (last I checked) of feral dps because he knows the mechanics of his class.  He’s definitely min-maxing, but has managed to do 500dps on certain boss fights!  Considering there is zero feral gear right now and he is in mostly blues.....  Can’t argue with that!!
---
A shitton of people will resub to play TBC and Wrath again. There's a reason why those expansions increased the subscriber count every month instead of decreasing like future expansions.
---
wish I knew how to do that.  15 mins is way too long.
---
lol for real, jesus
---
It's 2019.
---
We are not using 2003 computers anymore.
---
If they can do the BFA prepatch in a few hours IDK why this would take so long.
---
There is absolutely no reason it should take this long.
---
Might be a better idea to take a copy and rename that as the battle.net launcher might be looking for wowclassic.exe
---
Back in my day you had to queue just to log off! /s
---
This is fucking genius. Except mine would be “sorry afk baby woke up or kid needs his butt wiped/water refilled/tucked back in bed: 1 min tops”

those potions are like, what, 6g for a couple or something!?! aint nobody got gold for dat!

Wait what, asking a question on reddit is directed at the people who know the answer. It’s not asking someone to google it for them.
---
If you see a question on reddit that someone else asked that you also don’t know and you go google it then that’s your own choice. I’m not going to tell you how to spend your time. And props if you found the answer. Not everyone will come to the same conclusion. 
---
So since we are literally both waiting on the servers to be up and arguing the use of reddit and the nature of the community, tell me about your life. Gimme the run down. Kids? Family? Schoolwork too much? Whatcha got.
---
Most mail gear has int and all plate gear has tank stats. Dont blame fury warriors for blizzards loot table design!
---
Myopic viewpoint ... Players that rolled on PVP servers had the expectation that there would be world PVP but that they would still be able to quest, progress, etc... with the occasional skirmish.
---
What has transpired is not that.  Level 48+ have been forced to level in dungeons only for the most part and even level 60s have been forced to spend 30-60 minutes prior to any run at Blackrock Mountain doing corpse runs to get there.   PVP try-hards act like this is what a PVP server experience should be like but that is not what Classic PVP servers were like and it will ultimately cause almost all servers to die if the BGs don't help alleviate the problem.
---
Most lilely a cache or WTF folder. Doubt that's affected as you save the data locally
---
&gt;Players that rolled on PVP servers had the expectation that there would be world PVP but that they would still be able to quest, progress, etc... with the occasional skirmish.
---
That is a naive expectation and the people who expected as much only have themselves to blame.  It was public knowledge long before classic launched that p2 would launch honor without battlegrounds.  Expecting to quest and farm under such conditions is ridiculous.
---
I just put them on the ignore list, no need for notes, if they’re on that list they’re on it for a reason and I don’t want to group with them.

---
If my Rogue's name is "PU$$&amp;SLAXER420" it must be true
---
&gt;  I am guessing the patching has to be done for the content
---
I'm guessing it's actually because they need to get new servers online, configured, checked, etc.
---
So yeah, you give people a lot of notice and let them pick where they go. And then the people that didn't chose where they go get sent to an algorithm that looks at your GM, if your GM went here then you go there. If you aren't in a guild you are thrown into a pool that is equally divided. 
---
Would people get separated? sure. But thats when I said you let the CS team deal with that for a couple weeks as a grace period and then you open up Paid character transfers. IF you dont choose where you want to go within 2-4 weeks then paid character transfers are for you!
---
I just do my fair share without being asked, so I never have to take an unexpected break.
---
Of course they're better, they restore the same amount of mana faster, and restore more mana total. They're not cheaper, but they're definitely *better.*
---
Lmao. Have you ever been to reddit before? This place is a catch all for depressed gamers. Unhealthily obsession with it
---
I'd reroll PvE. Except for the few balanced servers I would not say that Blizzard currently offers PvP servers. 
---
The hope is that BGs will ease things but, even if they do, significant damage to server balance has been done in the last four weeks. These imbalances have historically widened, not narrowed, and so I expect most servers to be 20/80 or worse six months from now.
---
Misleading. John Staats has confirmed that they *always* knew they were going to have expansions, right from the beginning of development.
---
Blizzard's development style was simply to start work on years of content in advance and then push back what wasn't needed or wasn't done satisfactorily to the expansion.
---
&gt; If you are amazing at PvP but care about getting rank 14 as fast as possible and are willing to break the rules, this is the way to do it
---
It's not min-maxxing if you break the rules of the game, it's just cheating.
---
&gt;It doesn't at all include admitting that you are bad at PvP or need to do it. 
---
It admits you need to cheat to reach that level, which means you are not good enough to do it alone.
---
&gt;That's like saying "if you do spellcleave you're basically admitting you could never do a dungeon the normal standard slow way." No, you're just trying to be efficient. Except in this case the efficiency is cheating
---
This is a false equivalency fallacy. 
---
Spellcleave is a valid, non cheating way that Blizzard intended the abilities to be used. Honor trading is not.  
---
If Spellcleaving was in some way against the ToS, and people did it, then yeah you'd be right.
---
I'm sorry I have to completely disagree. Princess is extremely easy to kite once you learn it, and it takes a couple tries at most to get it down pat.
---
Mara requires zero skill to get to princess, unlike DM where there's so many more chances for error with all the pat pulls and pet aggro FD jumping through packs. So all you need to learn is 1 pull.
---
Get a range addon, stay within 30 to proc boulder, run outside boulder range, shoot her, kite, pop a second shot if still outside 30. Cast arcane shot when you have mana, use your pet to charge in, get a bite, dash, call him back as soon as she starts farting. If you accidentally get too close and she throws a boulder, drop cheetah, if you fail to drop cheetah in time, FD and run away while she kills your pet.
---
Yeah, I make a lot of Superiors for guildies
---
Damn, figured it was more. I’ve considered Maraudon quite a bit but I have Mining and don’t really care to drop it now and don’t see that being as profitable as herb. I suppose you could yield a stack or two of solid stone which is about 4.5g per stack on my server atm. Trying to find a 50+ option outside of tribute considering how bad open world is. Perhaps everything will fix itself with BGs but I don’t think it will.
---
Thanks man! I didn’t mean for it to be such a rant, just kinda turned out that way 😂
---
Oh so classic mains are handicapped?
---
"Paid character transfers might make more than one server Alliance dominated. Its unacceptable more of them have the same experience as the Horde."
---
Tank priority in dungeon
---
1. keep the pack grouped/off the backline
---
2. keep aggro on the elites
---
You should be able to handle this with little difficulty. If a non-elite zooms for ranged dps, they should be able to handle it. If anything goes for the healer, you need to handle it. If something starts attacking a melee, they should have the armor/cooldowns to handle it (and that's one less thing to worry about going for the healer), otherwise you can start assisting them, or pool rage to hit taunt, sunder/heroic strike, which should lock aggro back on you. Don't be afraid to stun/taunt a mob that's about to die so you can focus setting up rage on the next target. If you're prot, avoid an early concussion blow, because you'd rather take the hits for rage. Charge, t-clap, defensive stance, demo/battleshout (battleshout first if you've already tagged all the mobs), then start rotating for threat, and you shouldn't have to worry.
---
If a melee isn't assisting, assist the melee. If a repeat offender keeps pulling aggro, pool rage for a

Well at least it's 3pm est, so it's only...

---
check back later today/tomorrow when alliance gets battlegrounds
---
It may have just been a bad night, but that run was a travesty.  We ended up resetting and getting new people since 4 people dropped after the first boss.
---
Reminds me of a time, back in Vanilla or TBC, where I had an experience that made me think "maybe I'm not that bad after all."  This is the story I tell anyone who says I spend too much time on video games:
---
I was trying to run Stockade.  There was just me, a rogue, and a level 60+ warrior who was bored and decided to run us through.  We had cleared 2 sides of the dungeon, when the warrior just goes AFK.  No warning or anything, middle of the fight, still has a few mobs attacking him.  Me and the rogue clean up the mobs, and then we wait.  It had to be 5 or 10 minutes.  We were just asking each other if we should cancel it or try and find a real group, when the warrior comes back.
---
"Sorry, my 2-year-old daughter sliced her hand open."
---
The rogue and I were like "yeah, that takes priority over WoW, we understand."
---
So the warrior finishes the run for us.  Then he says "okay, I'm off to take my daughter to the ER."
---
The rogue and I were both like "you should have just gone."  I mean, I would have appreciated a notification that's why he's leaving (so we're not standing around waiting), but don't finish the dungeon if your kid needs to go to the ER!
---
Really? I’ve never had a problem with them, or are your from the horde’s perspective and there I can understand it

True vanilla experience.

I cannot staaand people like you who run around spreading misinformation with no regard for fact checking. There are big threads on the front page of this subreddit every day explaining why that website is useless. You don't know a DAMN thing about the server if you unironically think there are only "300 horde." You clearly haven't even logged into that server a day in your life if you think Orgrimmar is empty during peak hours. Please just stay out of discussions you don't know much about rather than inserting yourself without anything useful to contribute.

Incendius
---
You seem fun.
---
Provide 3 arguments as to why his statement is Incorrect. Should be easy if there’s so many.
---
Are the pve servers alliance dominated?
---
Having just leveled a Druid to 60, this was NOT my experience at all. Cat was such an amazing leveling experience. You could kill 3-4 mobs before needing to heal, and after you do so you could kill another 3-4. It’s even smoother once you get innervate, since once you finally ran out of mana you just innervate yourself and get back to full.
---
I can understand your point of view. The best thing to do is get together with your officers to establish some fair loot rules so that people know this before they join the guild. By doing that you'll avoid ever running into an issue where someone wants to bring their RL friend. If it's clearly against the rules they'll just need to deal with it.
---
Some friendly advice: Make sure you are the face of your guild and are putting as much time as you can into running things. People are going to come and go and sometimes the people that go are players that will make others question whether they want to go too. By firmly establishing yourself as the GM and making yourself available people are going to want to stay as long as you are there.
---
Who says it has anything to do with gaming? You're just throwing around anecdotal evidence to fit your agenda. Be objective and rational. There's probably a shit-ton of depressed people on Reddit. A lot of people game, so a lot of people who game might be depressed.
---
This plus, let's not forget that some of these routes, safe spots, and skips were closely guarded secrets for a long time in vanilla. Guilds would discover a skip then use it as an advantage rather than just give it away.
---
I mean like alliance to horde ratios. Are any around 60:40/40:60?
---
I'm about 30k xp off level 50, anyone know any decent mobs I can farm for the last chunk of xp? I'm alliance.

You'll have the courtyard key for all of 2 minutes, so not really.
---
Being willing to cheat to get something doesn't require admitting you *have* to cheat to get that same thing. Your logic is bad
---
If I steal a dollar out of your wallet that doesn't mean I am admitting to being incapable of earning a dollar legitimately. Not sure how you could possibly have logic that bad
---
Imo they won’t fix everything but depending on queue times it should help a little bit. Serious honor grinders which usually are the “death squads” will be in bg’s at its way better honor.
---
But that being said I still believe that their will be death squads that either just don’t enjoy bgs or enjoy griefing.
---
But let’s just wait a few hours and then after bg’s come out you can see the result after a week or 2!
---
You also have innervate for the main healer, and you can revive that one guy who started blasting on Ony phase 1!
---
What aspects of old AV do you suspect you would not want to be the default, and why?
---
I/Melbuf will never recover
---
Yep.  Silversage is probably the only herb I could make more by selling stacks, but fuck is that hard to farm esp on pvp
---
Boob-trap you mean
---
I hope to god BFA is just a filler expansion, holy hell legion was so good. Everyone was overpowered as all hell but god damn it was satisfying
---
I have a level 27 human rogue that I was leveling as an alt before I shelved him for a month or so. I am full combat but i am wondering what it is about combat **swords** that are so great.
---
The reason I'm wondering is that I'm currently DW maces that had solid dps and agility on them (got them cheap on the AH a few levels ago).
---
What can swords do that maces can't when leveling w/ combat?
---
The first turn in gives a big amount of xp. But subsequent turn ins actually give decent xp that isn’t arbitrary. I basically leveled my druid by running wsg and dungeons. And most of it was wsg. (It was slow as fuck)
---
Leave him alone! He's just a wittle guy.

parses chat and gives  a little popup when someone is LFG for the dungeons you specify
---
Being opposed to paid transfers altogether because someone can theoretically ninja loot an item and then pay 25$ to transfer realms is so specific and such an outlier it's actually fucking ridiculous. 
---
Yeah, that's a way more important issue than people being trapped on unplayable PvP realms, transferring to a realm to join a guild with raid times that suit a change in their schedule, etc.
---
"My opinion about love servers"....fixed your title fer ya.
---
I’d rather them just ban people who use the add on for cheating. Cause it’s cheating.
---
again, that all changes tonight/tomorrow when alliance leave for battlegrounds.  most realms are about to have their ratio sway much more in favor of the horde.
---
Having to look at the same shoulders for the next 2 phases...
---
Yet you browse the “garbage” sub of a game that only entertained you for a few weeks and get triggered when someone disparages the shitshow that is retail
---
I don't know exactly what to get but I go for stamina if I can.
---
&gt; 5 years from now there may be regret. WoW will disappear someday, but a good SO can last a lifetime.
---
Exactly, so you can get a good SO when classic BFA is out.
---
The beach along Western Feralas, where the alliance dock is. Water elementals at level 48/9, you hardly see anyone there and they drop decent loot.
---
Lol cross battlegrounds were not in vanilla. And if they were, it was for a very small and insignificant amount of time during the “vanilla” time period.
---
No one takes “no changes” literally you hippopotamus. Obviously you change things that make the game better without materially changing the game. CBG, debatably, materially changes the game because it results in characters and serves losing their identity, which was what vanilla and older mmorpgs were all about.  
---
Yes I called you a hippopotamus.
---
They will for a while I think, because almost everyone will be sitting in AV all day for a few weeks until exalted (PvE and PvP players) and then it will settle down a lot.
---
A lot of people aren't that interested in PvP, and won't queue WSG/AB and thus those queue timers will probably be longer.
---
And what do people do while in queue timers? They hearthstone after quing and camp people in the open, accept queue when it pops. Re-queue hearthstone and repeat endlessly.
---
Blizzard also needs to have faction balance sorted by the Nightmare dragons + AQ opening patch, otherwise will be unplayable for the minority faction.
---
teach a man to fish
---
Because life is short and you may not live another day to do that and also you are wasting your time playing a video game. I know that because i waste mine playing all day.
---
How was the sex?
---
spy only shows players you mouseover or players that are right on top of you. it doesn't greatly impact gameplay anymore.
---
Made almost 100g in a few hours of fishing this week, love it
---
thats a big tinfoil hat you got there
---
Doesn't stack with cheetah, don't bother unless you want it for other things too.
---
If the death squads can get more honor/HK from battlegrounds, yes. But if queue times are long, players are on a losing streak, can't properly fill a premade- they'll go to roaming gankers.
---
You know there are min/maxxers out there who have lock alts to summon a raid back out into the open world after finishing a BG.
---
No it's not like a pre-meditated thing haha, there are just more horde able/willing to run around in the wild and thus they can form these big groups easier. They also work most of the time on the horde side so they don't you know... immediately give up after losing the first couple fights.
---
Min-max attitude is definitely toxic. Classic isn’t the animal that the min-max private server/vanilla think it is. 
---
Hand of rag was showing up all over the place a month in to classic. Not sure how long it took in vanilla for them to show up en mass, but I doubt it was anywhere close to 30 days.
---
Just apply the golden rule. If you were the hunter would you have wanted help?
---
What time does maintenance start at? 10 or 11 server?
---
Says the horde rogue on a pvp server lol. Why is he weird? Because he wants to be able to enjoy the open world and have access to critical zones like BRM without corpse running for 2 hours? I play ally on whitemane and as much fun as skirmishes in the Badlands are, thats an even footed battle. When its 3 horde raids positioned at strategic locations all along the path into the mountain, you're no longer playing wPvP its just a meat grinder for honor scraps. And though blizzard is mostly culpable, some of this lies on the player. Idk just seems silly to me to have to wait for an MC raid to roll out with you from Morgan's Vigil just to get into BRD while only dying a couple of times. I doubt you experience this being a rogue. Either because you're on a horde sided server, or you get to stealth past whatever you feel like.
---
I hardly ever intervene in 1 v 1 PvP for two similar level players. I will always help if my faction is outnumbered or dramatically outleveled. But helping someone kill another player their own level (when both are much lower than me) does not help them get better at PvP. They are a worse player for it.
---
corruption does plenty of damage
---
here is a multidot fight, golemagg:  [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/3Bv1f4QLYaTMhrHj/#fight=40&amp;type=damage-done&amp;source=2](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/3Bv1f4QLYaTMhrHj/#fight=40&amp;type=damage-done&amp;source=2)

---
obviously did more % damage ona multidot fight, but even on rag with sub-90% uptime it still did 17% of my damage. yes, shadowbolt is by far our primary damage dealer and will be moreso later, but corruption for any spec is still very important for DPS nightfall or not
---
and in terms of BWL/threat, thats on the tanks. i'm very very lucky and blessed to have some of the best tanks in the game (no joke) in my guild and I know not everyone is so lucky so I know my experience is different, but even a decent fury/prot warr with decent gear should have no problems building/keeping threat even after drops, even against a well geared warlock. sure the lock can hold off a sec or two on dps esp after threat drops if corr are ticking, but he shouldn't have to do any more than that.
---
Holy shit retail is that overturned? It takes my guild  two hours. How is it possible that a single character can essentially be more powerful than 40 60s?
---
Deployments are not as straightforward as you think they are, especially the way they worked 14 years ago.
---
Where can I get mine?
---
Oh, I'm speaking of errors since the API was changed, which should break Total RP and Musician; minor breaks from what I hear, but breaks none the less. Plus the Keyring was added, which should break things like Bagnon and Dominos since both 'touch' the keyring code.
---
I fucking hate retail so much
---
do the pve servers get matched with the pvp servers in cross realm BGs?
---
Travel form?
---
I've just heard fights could last for days. I don't know if I could do that more than a few times to be honest. Like I said though, I have no experience with it, so I'd like to at least get a chance to try it out.
---
you straight up have to be unemployed or you just dont sleep. Theres not enough time in a day to work full time and play wow 8 hrs a day lol
---
I will happily /w instead of /s if it means the end of that spy addon...
---
Nah I'm too busy reck bombing filthy UD rogues
---
I think that if you stick with the same guild throughout and consistently show up you shouldn't have a problem sticking with hunter. As long as they don't have a dumb amount of them. Having more than the 2-3 that are suggested isn't going to be a big deal.
---
I believe Kurinnaxxx is fairly even, roughly 55:45 horde from one census i saw.
---
without more context...
---
it was a pretty dumb question on your part.
---
Sometimes cheaper... or free... is better
---
You’re ok :) it’s hard to know right? They could’ve fallen asleep. Be proud you engaged, and know also that it’s a cluster with whomever you’re going to get. I feel nervous posting in guild or whatever, it’s hard to assess people’s tone and meaning in chat. Puns are great!
---
Fury warris with raid weapons can have more than double that dps. 90 isn't terrible though
---
Preach
---
But getting spriests through the gearing process is a fantastic idea, because you will need them for later raids. If you gear them up now,  you don't have to go back to old content later. You will need several MC's for Naxx at the very least.
---
You can personally livelog with warcraft logs, the uploader will parse your logs after every individual boss fight and trash pull.  It's not quite "realtime" but it's damn close.  
---
Obviously if you are running in a fast paced guild with small downtimes, you won't have much opportunity to look at them, but it's very comprehensive.
---
Razuvious will require 4 priest tanks. I don't remember if hit rating is a thing yet or not or if it applies to MC (I'm not in a position to start raiding as of yet) but a resisted MC could very quickly become a wipe. I know there are other fight strategies as well that have specific class requirements.
---
You can always drop us a note on Twitter if you have that setup. The account for EU English can be found here: [@BlizzardCSEU_EN](http://www.twitter.com/Blizzardcseu_en)
---
Nah it's because the average DPS player is a fucking moron that makes the tank's life far more difficult than it needs to be.
---
While DPS and Healers are competing against the mobs, Tanks are competing against their DPS and healers and its very easy for stupid DPS to make a tank's job impossible so if the DPS don't give them time to take aggro and generate a buffer before going HAM then there's nothing that a tank can do to fix things.
---
So you get people who're moving over from other roles already feeling like a fish out of water before they start and then a couple dungeons in they get Frostttyfreezeee the Mage, smashguud the Arms Warrior, and Beastyelite the Hunter spamming all their AoE nonstop, ignoring marks, pulling ahead, neglecting cc/interrupts, bodypulling extras, etc and they're put off tanking forever because they feel like a complete failure at it even though they were tab-sundering as much as they can while starved for rage and using taunt off cooldown to drag things off the DPS.
---
It's not a false equivalency lol it's exactly the same. You can just say "no" but your logic makes literally no sense?
---
Explain how doing something illegally proves that you are incapable of doing that same thing legitimately without just saying "that's what I think" lol. There is no logic backing that up whatsoever
---
Suggesting someone to read for information isn't a dickish move.
---
[Honestly, missed opportunity with the name.](https://i.imgur.com/1S2ndJw.jpg)
---
Used to do this in TBC with a buddy of mine on a different realm in the same battle group. Was surprisingly effective.
---
Good hunters are always needed. If you’re the apex hunter dont worry about the spot worry about your performance.
---
This may be a joke..but the whole "no changes" philosophy is so flawed. We are trying to "no change" a game that is played extremely different than it once was. There literally has to be changes.
---
You can recommend reading the notes and/or googling shot while being courteous.  We were all noobs once.
---
That’s when you force him to respec or kick his garbage ass out of the raid for a viable spec.
---
I've played Alliance on Thunderfury and Horde on Bigglesworth. Both great.
---
The servers aren't even up yet and you're already claiming this
---
if trash had time to respawn, the SS likely wore off or the priest died too close to mobs to use it.
---
i always twink 19 rogues, my personal favourite.
---
roll gnome though, escape artist is huge. With no crippling poison, you need escape artist to keep on top of any ranged dps.
---
Other than respec costs and the will to do it sure. Or that holding aggro is a pain when the DPS play like it's retail and you don't have the toolkit to deal with it.
---
This is a solid post.  It's not about prioritizing a game over your wife.  But being married doesn't mean you're no longer entitled to some personal time.  While your wife is a top priority in life, it doesn't mean she's the top priority *at any given moment*.  That'd be an unhealthy view of a relationship.  The rub is that sometimes wives don't see gaming as a legitimate hobby/recreation, so *everything*, no matter how trivial or non-urgent, is priority over you "playing games."
---
Nah. The default UI sucks.
---
There's no matchmaking system in vanilla like that. It just throws 10 random people/groups against eachother. Your bracket/rank has nothing to do with who you will play against. 
---
Unless they do something new in classic which did not exist in vanilla aka #changes
---
Its not cheating and calling it so is a disservice to actual cheating.

Care to provide some context? I don't know wtf is being said.

That and the opposing faction rezes in front of you, instead of behind you. Thus causing a stalemate

nice post. ive been running and uploading for weeks, we need more peopel doing it on each server to cover more of the day/time and whatnot

srsly

Morale booster. People get fired up when they see their pirate MT about to tank a boss.

Yeah that npc in Duskwood is totally making a "telescope". Not a doubt in my mind.

Bruh the only triggered one here is you lmao
---
Always amused by people letting their SO's be their moms
---
I don’t disagree but I was simply invited to a guilds run as a pug 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Are you using ep/gp ? Or dkp? Either way if someone has priority or more dkp complaining about them getting loot usually isn’t going to change the system go find a guild that plays as competently as you do.
---
Oh yeah for sure. I did mats runs without herb for a while and once I got it, i felt much better about running it.
---
But again you don't really answer my question.
---
If I suggest something, you totally have the right to say: "I don't think it would work and I'll tell you why" But what I cannot understand is why so many people says "it will make the game like retail" if the change is totally not in the direction of retail. 
---
To reuse your analogy: if I say "I'd like Vanilla to be more like Dark Souls" and instead of answering me that you don't think it's a good idea, you answer: "it will make the game like Animal Crossing" 
---
Basically I'm just stating that people use "retail" as some kind of discussion ender even when it doesn't make sense and refuse to think. For example if we were discussing whether or not sub-60 should give 0 honor, I'd like someone to explain me exactly what the problem would be and not "that's just the way it was"
---
i seriously lasted 10 mins and logged off lol. I dont know man, something feels off logging into current version.
---
Can you level up at Alterac Valley from 51 to 60?
---
wtf is mercenary mode and why does that intrigue me?
---
Thank you. You are right, it really is hard to know and assess. I wish I was brave enough to join a guild! I'll get there though. First step is actually doing a dungeon, lol. Thank you and glad to see some good tastes!
---
I actually remember it happening more in vanilla. Maybe I’ve just been lucky this time
---
It was probably pretty obvious he was being attacked and replied with "no fucking shit." Seems obvious to me that that's means yes.
---
We use tank&gt;physical DPS and it has worked out well... and by that I mean I won the roll this past ony clear (rogue).
---
Found one
---
Yeah if the queues are so long that you are incentivized to fly out into the open world and gank questing people and ppl trying to run dungeons then that will be a nightmare for everyone involved, agreed
---
You can ummm....get a cool hat from an old mind numbing raid you can 1 shot everything....there’s that I guess.
---
Logged in to retail during the ddos attacks and didn't have the energy to do anything or figure anything out. I just sat on my ony mount and waited for the ddos to stop.
---
Nah Incendius is terrible at level 60. Every entrance is a Horde dominated Hank fest.
---
It depends. I can agree that most "full ubrs runs" were actually rend runs in disguise when half the people left after rend.
---
ive done that a few times (although very very rarely) on people who refuse to release and wait for a rez (especially when they caused the wipe to begin with)
---
oh please go pretend to care about something else
---
Ok cool, looks like I'm approaching that point in the tree so I will keep that in mind.
---
the few in the charred vale? they are high enough to drop it?
---
heh. didn't knew.
---
i'll have to edit my comment to '' everything in stonetalon minus the charred vale'
---
Gotta get those loyalty stacks tho and do they have access to the same skills? I’m fairly new to hunter mechanics
---
Paid transfers were available in vanilla, I did one. It took close to two months for my guy to transfer to my friends server but it was an option available in vanilla.
---
I'm not sure why it hasn't been available since classic came out. I was sure it was just blizzard hoping faction imbalance would kill off wow classic so people would play shadowlands.
---
Oop! I struck a nerve.
---
Haha we found one boys.
---
Traditionally you’re correct but the meaning of the word in popular culture is changing to pretty much signify anyone who is older than the person speaking. I’m 24 and a lot of my friends are 23 and they call me a boomer. Along the same lines, a lot of people call those younger than them “zoomers”.
---
yeah u right
---
Cool, so even more likely it will come later than January.
---
Already on the later, and I have been considering microdosing lately. Thanks for lookin out!
---
Same, I'd be fine learning about new things and stats and such but it takes a lot of work to relearn combat mechanics and resources. I really want to get back to my Zeratul transmog but I can't even fight effectively!
---
Yah, I'm horde on Thunderfury. It feels overall balanced. Small horde majority but I see ally take over TP/Searing Gorge all the time.
---
What's more hard-mode, phase 2 PvP server or girlfriend? Both if you're really a masochist.
---
Solution: create a chat channel and whisper to whoever you want to join it. Then you can chat freely on your own channel.
---
I agree, but I still have mixed feelings about stuff like DBM and Decursive. They make the game *SO* much easier than it was intended to be.
---
Yeah, maybe
---
You'll get there! :)
---
Unrelated but what font is that??
---
And chat settings, looks so crisp
---
No exp in BGs in classic.
---
Looks to me like they would be happy to go to DKP, since they have a good majority of the items they already need. That's just less gear they have to spend DKP on, putting them at an advantage on other items.
---
A lot of my rolls did get lost to pugs early on though. I wish we would've just ran with 30 instead of filling the last 10 with pugs.
---
Why did you get two weapons?
---
&gt; It's not optimal if you're trying to sell to someone that wants 100 or 1000 if the same item and couldn't be fucked buying your single stacks. In that case you lose a (big) sale.
---
Im quite happy to even pay a little more. I make every reasonable effort to avoid buying from people who break up stacks like that.
---
Theres a mountain of middleground between 24/7 and playing a video game for 8 hours straight and flat out ignoring everything else.
---
Does the transmute have a CD?
---
Glad my manic over-thinking could bring a smile to someone's day! ;)
---
Hmm ok I’ll check it out, I have the atlas loot mod and I problems, but will check it out. Thanks
---
if they stop talking you win the conversation
---
I remember it happening A LOT in vanilla. Honestly, if someone says yes to a full run then bounces after their boss, put then in a blacklist.
---
I had use or lose leave and took it today. No big deal, I just finished binging The Boys...so damn good.
---
You see the world in a very binary way. There is a world of gray between the two extremes. You're on one extreme, nobody is on the other, and you're freaking out in the belief that everybody is on the other. Very strange stuff friend Goldensands. 
---
None of us are privy to the inner workings of the game's code and thus we do not know the criteria used to determine loot tables. It is possible, though unlikely, that day of raid matters.
---
Only exploiters and cheaters would say that.
---
This change was made in an earlier patch.  It's not related to the change in today's patch.
---
Yeah, I'd imagine whichever bosses have the best loot for the most classes becomes the unofficial final boss.
---
Underrated
---
Does DR work for kills in BGs as well?
---
hikikomori?
---
Sounds like a large guild with multiple raid teams.
---
I never really knew how long does /s reach and hardly use it anyway, so yeah.
---
DM has been ally controlled every time I've tried to go there. BRM is horde owned on reset nights for sure, but allies contest it regularly on other nights. Lights Hope seems to trade off regularly.
---
Stalagg is the most balanced! Go alliance on stalagg!!
---
I went 3 weeks passing Mc loot I had 4 pieces of t1 and shield and I’m an orc so I’m trying to keep myself inline to get ony weapon. Nothing made me happier than getting to see my OTs geek out over getting shoulders and shields etc. now they can tank just as good as me if needed.
---
with enough effort you could still get corpsecamped out of a zone even on low populated servers, i'd imagine the high ones are hell
---
If you log off you can never be corpse camped.
---
Does anyone know what addon this [drain soul icon](https://i.imgur.com/YSeZMZ5.png) is from? Really annoying
---
Lol most people dont care/know about the DR.  They want to ruin your night, make you never want to do WSG again.  They don't give a fuck about honor.  They're the same people killing you a dozen times on your way to MC "for the lulz"
---
Sex is great and all, but have you ever got hoj and sgc?
---
If this is the map:

then does ally taking iceblood gy mean that horde will ress at frostwolf gy? Or?

I think this is how heroin dealers get girls bruv

It's generally good etiquette to edit out names before you shame their behavior on Reddit...

1. You're entire argument is based on a slippy slope fallacy. Here's Wikipedia's definition;
---
&gt; A slippery slope argument (SSA), in logic, critical thinking, political rhetoric, and caselaw, is a logical fallacy[1] in which a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect.[2] The core of the slippery slope argument is that a specific decision under debate is likely to result in unintended consequences.

any balance changes that occur are not going to lead to the game coming out and being re-released in the exact same manner that it did previously. This idea is sheer lunacy to me. 
---
2. The next problem with this is the false equivalence. The things were asking for, and recommending change for, have *never been implemented*. At least not in this way. Blizzards way of fixing them came through expansion packs, and it fundamentally changed the game while adding these changes. NOONE is asking for TBC in order to fix these issues such as balancing BGs. They're asking to fix things.
---
3. There's also a slippy slope fallacy in the "If you change one thing, why not change everything else too?" an argument you didn't specifically make, but one that comes up a lot in the nochange community. It again is a fallacy that has no defensible reasoning.
---
4. Bonus, just cause yknow, I need people to understand how stupid this is, is the "go play retail argument". They are fundamentally different games, and while they do a lot of things poorly, there are a lot of quality of life updates that *are good* for the game. I'm not asking for retail. I'm asking for the QoL benefits that retail eventually added, to be brought to classic.
---
So there we have it friend.

Smolderweb my man

which will give you enough time to taunt again. or get hit -­ get rage -­ generate enough aggro as the following mindflay dont do much.
---
Sorry, the era where bad tanks can get away by QQ'ing all day long is gone. put up the TPS or GTFO.
---
Lots of wrong answers in here. Battlegrounds do give XP through Token turn in. You don't get XP for completing a BG but you get tokens after each match so you can lvl off BGs.
---
&gt;nd why is that? because everywhere is probably completely overfarmed to the point of making it unplayable for alliance.
---
right, which is a problem. but ganking in IF is neither a symptom nor a cause of that.
---
This guild is on Patchwerk
---
&gt; So they're missing out on a core part of why they chose that server in the first place and you don't see how that destroys the game for them?
---
I don’t get how you don’t see the absurdity of that, you don’t think the Alliance are missing out on that same thing? What’s more, they’re being punished for it. How is it any fun to farm people who have zero chance of fighting back? How is it fun for the people getting farmed? Unless you’re a chicken-shit bully, or you enjoy essential playing the game like a prisoner, there is zero fun to be had with world PVP in that scenario. The only viable solution is to let the oppressed faction leave, because it’d be impossible to get more Alliance over there. If nothing is done, they’ll either pay transfer or just stop playing. So the option is to either keep players or lose them to some toxic behavior. Not really hard to see why it was done. 
---
I mean, I’m open to hearing some fail-proof, SHORT TERM alternative, because the real solution seems to be a server rework, now that things died down. Otherwise, it’s working as intended, and the bullies have to suck it up that they can’t have fun ruining people’s time 24/7.
---
You say "easier", but the result feels more like half-assing something that requires barely any effort to begin with.   
---
Oh well.
---
Because he got me to write a 5 word reply? Your whole comment history is you picking fights with people, arguing with them and then you writing a cringey "Peace ♥" and bailing out. So lemme give it to you the same way.
---
Peace ♥
---
But I play on alliance and win flights?
---
I play on Sulfuras and Horde usually seems in higher numbers on the evenings. Maybe it's because it's the middle of a weekday?
---
Yeah, that's the case. As I posted somewhere else in this thread, I have offered to some people who were very confident in their opinions to run a simultaneous census for me. I'd even create a Discord server to facilitate communication. No one has taken up my offer.
---
I've got to admit that running a census is not fun. I usually put a video that makes a sound every 10 seconds and I just click when I hear it while I'm reading a book.
---
I've read that the plan was for it to become a world pvp zone but then yeah they ran out of time.
---
:o
---
Gurl
---
idk exact cost or mana/health regained but argent dawn also has a similar "hp/mana biscuit" thing i think is around 5 for 60-silver-ish. 
---
i typically just buy 60 food/60 water from a mage in org for 50s-1g when i log on but i always always always keep a stack of these around since sometimes i just cant get mage/food water and dont wanna go all the way back to org or UC to get some.
---
You're crazy. That add on was bullshit. Still is.
---
New patch looks hawt. Hate queue being in quick play, makes it hard to pickup a quick game that isn’t mystery hero’s.
---
&gt; if they over aggro you well then you screwed up
---
Oh got it. You have literally no idea how the game works.
---
I can live with that , I feel pretty free in the woods with nothing but my shorts
---
It reminded of getting it long ago and it was at least 5 CDs for the install, lol.
---
in pvp noot always. i'd rather pay the "premium" to regen hp and mana faster.
---
Yeah I think Alliance have it rough on Kurinnaxx. In my 50 some runs of BRD I can only count maybe a half dozen times where Alliance owned BRM for more than 15+ minutes. On the flip side I couldn't quest at all after the Honor drop as Alliance relentlessly corpse camp in zones and I've heard similar things from guildies and friends. Bg's should make it better for you though, I know a lot of the top Horde guilds have almost completely ignored wPvP to prep for BG's
---
If you want to look through a database for an extended period of time then yes they do need to be down to ban
---
For my server at least grenades/sappers, rocketboots, and the reflectors are all really good money atm
---
German alliance Rank 5
---
I think you should really [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-HFjHKJJ7E)
---
For sure thank you so much for all the help. And very good point! I was in a progression guild and they were opposite of transparent lol. So shady, a lot of convos behind closed doors and a lot of mutiny talk within the guild... we downed Rag twice but guild disbanded a few weeks later. Thats when i said fuck it im gonna go start my own MC Pug and do things the way I think is fair/best and also I get to pick the perfect raid times that are ideal for my schedule!
---
Again, your opinion, which is not always shared by others. 
---
Just to add to that, there are a lot of good 1h swords when you're leveling so there are generally better options. Plus as a human you have sword specialization.
---
There is a separate raid/guild/party *addon* channel
---
rag loot has its own +1 usually so people stay and its also not a feelsbad if you win some random might gear and can't roll on a rag weapon
---
Logging out was op first mistake....
---
Remember in the old days those 2gb patches too forever to download.
---
I used to pack up patches on 4.7gb dvds
---
10/10 plus ony
---
Just like in Classic, retails zep masters tell you where the zeps go. What a crybaby post, and it will gain traction no doubt, because this is a crybaby sub.
---
We have explored the zone behind Stratholme. HeelvsBabyFace made one of the best videos about exploring that place.
---
You are quite right... It was the timing and context that made it feel like I somehow offended multiple people at once; which I am not trying to do. I do also give a shit about the consequences of what others think, like in this case, the possibility of getting banned for something stupid. You are right, I should focus more on the fun.
---
it 100% is not useless lmao. it seems fine on fights where there isnt a threat drop, IE most of MC
---
it is more or less useless for ony tho, beyond p1.
---
Yeah, usually when I would queue with my buds we'd have leader and start spamming the strat to everybody. Once you do it a few times in the same day, all the pugs start doing it all day. You just need somebody to yell at the alliance to not touch iceblood tower/gy. Like 3 always ignore you and fight anyway, but if most listen, it works.
---
No, you can't. Blizzard launched with 3(!!!!) US East PvP realms, with no realms to support SA.
---
3 realms for everyone living East of Europe and West of the Mississippi River. That's not a player-caused problem.
---
This sub has fucking amnesia.
---
So OP I heard you're selling your GF?
---
I am on an Alliance-dominated PVE server. During world pvp, just as many Horde were in the honor pool as Alliance despite them having 50% more people on the server. Just because a lot of PVE servers are Alliance heavy does not mean those people have any desire to engage in PVP.
---
This is so so wrong. No tanks are going to hold aggro with casters insta cleaving mobs while tank is mid charge. Then they die or healer is oom after every pull and the whole run moves slow af. A lot of tanks are raid geared now so it's skewed but when that first wave was pushing to 60, I saw it constantly.
---
The irony...
---
Grobbulus server is dead, wouldn't recommend it.
---
Exactly
---
Agreed. Sulfuras seems super balanced with a still very active LFG channel.
---
&lt;3
---
its fine, and afaik there isn't a "better" one. its fine for most if not all MC fights, however it is useless for ony beyond phase 1 lol
---
Yeah, I can follow that logic. Tbh PvE players probably shouldn't have an opinion in pvp threads because they are not playing the same game we are. That in it if itself is not a flex, or boast but more of an observation. Like football and rugby. Two games with the same framework and vastly different playstyles.
---
Keep on keeping on man! Our ally finally just started to wake tf up and roll in larger counter raids.
---
I only played the new one once so I didn't really give it a chance. It was my favorite dungeon and that they gutted it down from eleven bosses to five really stung.
---
No, I'm alliance. But I've had generally a good PUG experience in wow classic, but the few jerks that have appeared always are a part of MATB. Then again, I'm generalizing. Could be coincidence - every guild has their bad apples, but I've heard similar stories from others about MATB.
---
Sometimes she needs me to open a jar while I'm playing, but in those cases she brings the jar to me
---
you just need holy priest with hit stuff. The problem on raz is raz himself, not his add. They can be tanked for few hit if a resist occurs. There is 4 add, you usually mc them 2 by 2 (I mean, you mc the 4, then 25s after 2 priest stop the mc, recast, and you got a nice rotation of mc, with 2 adds on each rotation, if one fail, the other is here).
---
SP are not usefull in vanilla. That's all.  
---
Why do you think they gave them vampiric touch in BC, who was mendatory to raid ? Cause they have no other real purpose on raid before that.
---
Hmm.  All you have to do is make an account, download the client and sign in to your account on it.  Then hit classic --&gt; live log --&gt; personal logs.  Find the path to your logs.  Should be your something like C:/World of Warcraft/_classic_/logs
---
Enter a description and hit start.  
---
Then in game just type:
---
    
---
    /combatlog
---
It should parse the logs for every fight automatically after they conclude.
---
Wait till he finds out about his wife’s boyfriend
---
You would think that would be the way it works yet if you check the Alliance AH on our server and the Horde AH, you will see Horde prices for everything are significantly higher due to lack of supply.
---
Yea, barrens won't get you to 30. Maybe 22-24 maybe, but not 30.
---
&gt;Why do these sell so well?
---
Cause it makes you look like a pirate or a ninja
---
There's battle masters in the main cities. Don't have to go to the portal
---
This might be the longest break some people have from classic since launch.  Crazy.
---
&gt;a bg on a horde dominated server as a horde player?
---
99.999% sure BGs will be x-realm. how big those "battlegroups" will be though, we wont know til later when they come out, maybe never. might be one big pool for all servers(like NA, EU, OCE different ofc), might be regions like EST, PST, etc..we just dont know atm.
---
&gt; YTA. It is your duty to protect your own faction.
---
Nah. 
---
&gt;(i didnt even notice the fight until i heard the troll death noise behind me lol).
---
If you still think hes the asshole.. then EVERY SINGLE TIME.
---
Someone asks for help because they're being ganked and you don't go help them?
---
Why are you on a PVP server? I don't care if it's your raid hours. or if you're chilling with friends to go to dire maul, and the person is calling for help from EPL, Nor is it an excuse you're about to go to bed. You must go help them. Even if it's him being ganked by 30 people, and you can only muster 2.
---
Who cares if you never seen it? Or never met the guy before? /s
---
People telling you no XP are wrong.  There are multiple quests in AV and the mobs, both of which give XP.
---
The zone is a pain even if you don't deal with the cliffs or the water. The shape of the zone means it has a low area but high travel times.
---
Yeah everyone seems to forget that Blizzard was all about expansions well before wow came out.
---
Tank: "Do you have a threat meter?"
---
boohoooo
---
rogues mad, less OP
---
I am 59 now still using ghost wolf on my at.
---
&gt;Who says it has anything to do with gaming? You're just throwing around anecdotal evidence to fit your agenda.
---
There are scientific studies to back up what he's saying though. The players who play unhealthy amounts and aim for the higher vanilla ranks are addicts; they require you to play for like an average of 10 hours/day. Playing games give you lots of dopamine, doing it in excess causes addiction. 
---
Obviously, there are far more harmful addictions to have, but gaming definitely isn't a good one, especially in a game like WoW where many might substitute their real life for their ingame character.
---
And believe me, because I used to be just like you &amp; think this is some boomer nonsense, but it seriously isn't.
---
I'm on an Alliance heavy PVE server and we had just as many people as them on Horde in the honor pool for the past few weeks despite them having 50% more people. Just because some PVE servers are Alliance heavy doesn't mean those people will queue for BGs.
---
I have been thinking of making this for a while, thank you for saving me the trouble!
---
everyone has the same UI
---
all same playing field
---
would be awesome
---
Deep Prot is more threat than fury Prot until around BWL levels of gear.
---
no difference at all. i'd go human cause eventually you'll want to try swords.
---
The game is 15 years old so we have to act accordingly, like 15 years olds :)
---
Why are you here?
---
How much FR should a maintank be looking to have in BWL? Never raided it in vanilla so no idea what to expect.
---
Lmao it’s almost as if fulfillment and “the better path” is different for each person.
---
There isn’t just some formula you follow to have a happy life. Also have a gf doesn’t just magically open some life pathways for you, and it’s pretty fucking cringe for you to believe so. 
---
If you want to spend your time and emotions to create something with someone because that’s what you want to do, then awesome! But nobody should feel like they have to have a relationship or be “unfulfilled”
---
I find your logic funny for two reasons
---
1) I direct a government research team irl as a day job and even I don't have such a hardline stance.
---
2) I'm on this sub pretty much every day, I've literally never seen a question like the one he asked. Maybe you should just learn to read better and also not act like a cunt online.
---
My (120 Balance druid)[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/emerald-dream/Tjoala) kills Onyxia in 1 Starfire.
---
- You can't miss.  
---
- You scale.  
---
- she has 2,100,000 HP, which again, when scaled for a 120 is nothing.  
---
In case you're confused, I've linked my druid which I stopped playing in February, for reference.  
---
No, I don't have one billion HP or 500,000 Spell power, I'm just scaled proportionately for a level "83" boss as a 120. Scaling in classic isn't the same whatsoever, but to kind of give you an idea just imagine your top geared level 60 rogue running into WC and facing any of the bosses there. For you, it's no different than popping a rat or squirrel on your way to a flightpath. It's braindead.
---
Decursive doesn't actually do anything special in Classic, it just shows when people have debuffs; you still have to manually target them and dispel.
---
DBM just shows timers, it can't play the game for you.
---
Did you also walk to and from school in snow uphill both ways?
---
Awww :,(. I guess that makes us all the assholes because we were all getting really punny with it!
---
52/48 in favor of horde. Pretty close to even for a pvp server. 
---
I also routinely see allies in small groups camping in front of the UC. That would never happen on an imbalanced server.
---
They didnt mention the battle masters in the patch notes (maybe I missed it( it sounded like you will only be able to que at their respective entrances.
---
Really? Because in your other comments you complain about “alliance noobs rolling horde” and say shit like “found the alliance player” so I find that hard to believe.
---
Just wait until you see Ashkandi for the first time.
---
man this shit is real
---
There’s lots of depressed married people too, wtf is your point?
---
My biggest pet peave in WoW is when Im getting my ass kicked and someone else from my faction is there watching me. Which is shitty because it seems like every time I'm trying to kill an alliance 5 more come out of the woodwork
---
I just won my first expensive BoE epic yesterday, a Krol blade.
---
What's the best way to go about selling items like this and getting the most gold possible? 
---
Should I hold it for a few days and use Trade chat? Or just put it on the AH several times?
---
On my server TSM says the market value is 350g, with the regional average being 380g. 
---
Anything else I should know like there will be an upgrade better than this coming out soon and I should sell it quickly? Looked on my server AH and the only other one was listed for 350g Buyout. Thanks!
---
A case study in the results of being raised by the Internet.
---
Sure, it being hard is fine and granted, this was when the game released so, quite some time ago, so I may be incorrect, but I don't recall there being a lot of a ramp up in difficulty but more of a jump between previous zones and this one.  
---
Also difficulty is one thing, but just mechanics that make the whole experience feel like crap is entirely different and I really didn't enjoy getting dragged around like a rag doll by every single mob within aggro range.  
---
Also the zone was just so bleak in a bland and super boring way. I just had no enjoyment there at all unfortunately.
---
The dual wield penalty is irrelevant because no sane dual wielder will try to get rid of that in favor of other stats. The yellow damage miss rate is much more important, and that rate is the same between 2h and dual wielder.
---
I use curseforge for my addons. Try there
---
Oh, well, then use /y, I guess.
---
That's why you just get an SO to play with you.. problem solved
---
You clearly know you are too sensitive. The thing to remember is that these interactions aren't that important to most people despite how important it seems to you. 
---
&gt;So, Am I the asshole for liking dirty puns and engaging in dirty puns or am I being too sensitive and over thinking all this? Because I want to hop back on and try engaging again but I am not interested in engaging with people who are going to ignore me while I try and overcome my fears because I don't treat the server like it is filled with 10 year olds (which it shouldn't be, there are other games for that age group).
---
In my opinion this is exactly what you need. You need to stop agonizing over every word and every interaction. Nowhere in life are interactions less meaningful than in a general chat of a video game, have at it. It sounds harsh but I mean it in a freeing way, nobody in that chat cares about you or what you say in a real way. You don't have an important reputation to protect or a long-term future to worry about, it's all just transient garbage on the internet.
---
Better than krol, slightly less dps than rends. I usually sit just below other rogues with rend and about the same t1 as me
---
Good infrastructure teams will have a read-only replica of the production database available for long-running queries.
---
WOW isn't about fun, it's about crushing the opposite faction until they transfer to another server. 
---
So, Imo, you are overthinking it. Most normal people don't think about these things, like, at all. It doesn't even register in their mind in the first place! They literally forget about such things in less than thirty seconds and move on with their. That is what I have learned an introverted worry wart myself.  
---
Like, have you ever performed some social faux pas that haunts you for days and days and when you finally apologize to the other person they don't even remember it? Happened to me a lot until I realized that the majority of people don't even notice these things.
---
Not with Blizzard throttling me down. I have gigabit so that should be about 119 MB/s, but I can only download from Blizzard at like 80 MB/s or less. That's like 700Mbps.
---
On Steam I can go take a shit and the game is finished.
---
For this reason, when it’s not raid night on my hunter he is parked at solonor in shadomeld just to grief horde
---
I didnt do it, but I saw people selling and buying it.
---
I'm struggling to level in the open world at 51 even as an undead rogue. Felwood and UnGoro are impossible. I even went to the Blasted Lands yesterday and ran into roving gank squads. I did /who and there were literally only 2 horde players in that zone and we were still being farmed. 
---
Phase 2 is just rough overall.
---
yeah not too sure on names of expansions. Just know MoP, Cataclysm and Battle of Azeroth. The expansion I'm talking about came out between MoP and BoA but not exactly sure when. It was literally a week of play in the last 3 years?
---
Agreed. I was just more thinking if i dual wielded the assassin's blade and did a backstab build (opportunity talent) a long with more procs from lifestealthing or fiery, that could compete?
---
If true, lmao he made his bed. What a fuckhead.
---
Where is this?
---
That's strange, I had problems with the last boss as DS/Ruin..but it was a cakewalk as SM/Ruin with siphon lifing the adds
---
Grandpa knows how to take horizontal recordings with the camera on the phone without the app.
---
And it's a Ram, the most ominous of the alliance mounts. Fits the oh shit scene perfectly.
---
Kurinaxx Horde here, it seems pretty even. both sides get ganked a lot. I'm so glad we rolled on this server (our first choice was Skeram). looking back, that would have been a really bad idea
---
Most nameplate and unitframe addons will allow you to color by class.

Jokes on them. My life is circling around the drain as I have to work during the downtime so I can support the family that I squirted into my wife.

Fuck me. That's what they do! As a holy priest god dam will I be dropping at least 20g tonight.

Pretty much, along with being able to filter out who you want to show and dispel.

You are being judgmental. I don't really mind about spy, what bothers me is people crying in forums/reddit and indirectly forcing their opinions on others. I have never complained about anything in any kind of forum or whatever and accept the game as it is. Hardly a "me me me" attitude.

All this non stop crying is getting annoying, is all.

That's why I only consider level 60s for my census info. I do have to run a full census to check what's a normal distribution between level 60s and non-60s.

I quit WoW to finish maxing my pure, and now I’m sidetracked by twisted league. Goddamn MMOs.
---
Nah, zergs lose the match in the 51-60 bracket, you have to play the strategy. And if I’m not mistaken only groups can queue for BGs, not raids, so you’re limited to a 5-man “premade” in any BG you queue for.
---
One big reason I am playing Classic is my rural internet and old PC can handle it just fine.

A guy that plays wow has a wife and girlfriend? I don't buy it

Korakk's Revenge, the anniversary AV event, rewards a full level worth of exp on a win, half a level on a loss, and around 22k exp every minute if you're over level 100. I haven't tried running it on any of my 60-90 toons, but I got a lvl 100 to 110 in about 4 games. I don't have level-applicable heirlooms either, but you can probably go even faster with all the exp buffs available in retail these days. Significantly less for lower level characters though - it's better to just dungeon queue if you're less than level 60. My lvl 45 got about 6 bars after a complete game.
---
You also get a grid that you can click to auto dispel that person, and you can set filters for who to prioritize and ignore.
---
for sure

In my guild, I've recently been given the responsibility/role of being an "Off-Tank". When it comes to gear/spec I'm not entirely sure what this means. My guild has a main tank and one other off-tank right now. We're still progressing in MC and haven't downed Rag yet but have done all others.
---
What should I be doing in MC encounters? Should I be DPS DW but have a shield at the ready? Do I need DPS Gear or Tank Gear? If the fight only requires 1 MT do I throw on all DPS Gear or should I be ready to take over just in case something happens?
---
Let me know. Thanks.

Hi! Human warrior level 52 here. I want to be able to contribute good enough DPS at some point to a raid and in current dungeons but I also want to be able to hold my own in wPVP/BG. Have any solid builds spec wise that can help me out with this? Not sure if the build would contain slam but if it does I would like an example of one that does not because idk how much of a fan I am I having to stand while casting :). Also I would prefer to use 2h because they look sweet but not opposed to duel wielding. And one more question; would any of these builds be rank viable? Sorry, kind of a lot of asks but this is my first time through classic and I am just trying to get a sense of what is out there. Thank you!!

I logged onto retail, ran a couple old raids to try and get mounts, saw my guild was still dead, and logged. That's been about my monthly retail experience, even when I'm not playing classic I'd rather just play other games on steam.

Filled the time with different games. AutoChess/Underlords, BotW, and RDR2 specifically.
---
Unless you like raiding, retail WoW is just a “collection/dress up” game now. 
---
Most shit you’ll do will be to collect transmogs or mounts or titles or toys. 
---
There’s Mythic+ raiding for masochists trying to get some Uber specific piece of gear that’s warforged and titanforged and penisforged and assblasted and all that whatnot, but is it really worth it when shadowlands will just make those useless anyways?
---
Nah. It's pretty well documented that Washed Up and Grizzly collude on multiple levels.  
---
They ran the devilsaur mafia for months before enough guilds banded together to finally crush it last month.  If you tried to get a devilsaur leather for yourself, within 15 minutes 50+ people would show up. Members of Washed Up would find you and give coordinates to the alliance over discord.  They would show up and corpse/GY camp until you logged.  Washed Up members would just sit there while you die and Grizzly would never target them.  I've heard many second-hand accounts of this, and the exact thing happened to me personally when we sent a group of 5 to Un'Goro to get some leather for devilsaur sets.  The same thing happened to many alliance guilds who tried to farm it, which is probably one of the reasons a large number of alliance guilds transferred off to heartseeker, which is exactly the type of comments you saw when north posted his shitty little videos to this subreddit about the "state of stalagg" when his guild is ironically one of the bigger causes of that "state," and probably the biggest offender of same faction griefing on our system.
---
Second, since the release of the Honor system.  I've literally witnessed HK trading between the two.  They sit in the GYs and trade 4 kills day.  We had a Washed Up alt in our guild (which we didn't know about at the time) and he would log on, a minute later, log to his main, repeat 4x.  Our GM tracked him down in azshara and found him kill trading in the GY with a dozen of members from both guilds there.  The member has since Gquit since he is going to R14 on his main.
---
Finally, ask literally any horde guild who has tried to do Kazz or Azurgos on Stalagg.  They all have level 1s parked in Blasted Lands and will endless run them into the Kazzak to prevent you from ever killing him.  For Azurgos they will communicate with Grizzly after you pull the boss and you have it down a decent bit, they'll tell them exactly when to charge in and wipe you, all while they stand by and do nothing.
---
There is a reason a lot of guilds on Stalagg fucking hate Grizzly and Washed Up.
---
Ah yes, testing on release day. I love it.
---
Edited rank to tank

Im glad to see posts like this.  I consider myself a casual player, but I have a 60, a 46, and a 24 currently.  I see everyone in my guild in a mad rush to get Ony MC done, and I just dont feel like running UBRS/LBRS/Strat every second that Im online.  I just want to enjoy playing and not feel like I have to rush.
---
I connect with this on a spiritual level
---
Check the other comment if you don't believe me,

&gt; It shows a grid with a box for each person that changes color when you can dispel them, you have to click on the right box and it dispels them like a mouseover macro.
---
I am horde on Stalagg
---
I would rather sell it sooner just because it's not that better BoEs coming out that drive the price down it's just there to sit as a rich buy in for pre bis that dont want to farm for dalrend and don't want sword of zeal or similar. Once people (and we may have already got there) get weapons from Ony and Rag and future raids the value goes down.
---
Yes trade chat bypasses the AH cut but you'll have to work for it by spamming

Yes, of course. Still, if you check this subreddit, some weren't that wise lol.

I’m an alliance warrior on Herod and I’ve been relying on mountain silver sage lately. I have the ability to play off peak hours tho. I know it’s shit during peak hours.

The Twitch client pulls from Curseforge, mate.
---
Go to the twitch client, find the Addons, and stare at it intently hoping the authors update them for you.
---
They literally do not.
---
I think that is what I will do.  THanks!
---
&gt; Also the zone was just so bleak in a bland and super boring way. I just had no enjoyment there at all unfortunately 
---
Oh, this i can totally understand. It was depressing to be there. Fitting, but not motivating.
---
Heart of the Thorns was way better because of this. The enormous and awesome primal jungle made the asskicking way more enjoyable.
---
Also, Path of Fire didn't had this issue, because we weren't fighting a all-powerful opponent dominating an entire country. I really encourage you to try back GW2 and jump back in Path of Fire. It's really an awesome experience and extension.
---
They said they want to avoid merge if possible.
---
Yesterday I spent 3 hours trying to push the ally out of SG and they wouldn't budge, no clue what you're talking about
---
Sure if you don't mind waiting for them to drink after every single pull. They have the uptime of a sweaty aoe mage.
---
Is that even legal?
---
Where do you up load them? I’d like to look at the data.
---
I feel like a excel spreadsheet locked with a password would be easiest option...  Maybe not? I don't know.
---
Technically yes, you do get XP from the mobs, but you would be getting the raid penalty for XP from the mobs you kill, so it would take a ton of kills.
---
I use VanasKoS for player notes, it is available on twitch.
---
Just steer clear of Good Intentions on ally and Yang Gang on Horde
---
Sorry, let me rephase:
---
I was more asking for the data from 
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity
---
Where I can compare current stats on my server vs another.
---
If you want something challenging you cant be talking about Classic, classic is not challenging it's time consuming. Wow as a game is not challenging
---
You should precast before the pull.  It's your tanks job to do more threat than you
---
I don’t know if I really want to play TBC or Wrath again, but maybe. I would definitely play classic plus tho
---
&gt; This is absolutely not factual. The whole Warcraft franchise is based around factional conflict and those factions fighting against each other. This is evident even from the first instalment of the game.
---
And even then in the first version of the game, there were orcs getting help from humans.
---
..And in warcraft 2's lore, with the whole schism there was a minor cease-fire for the horde to deal with the break off..
---
..And in warcraft 3, where hyjal happened.
---
All of these events if everyone just went pure "ENEMY = DIE" 
---
Warcraft would've been, game over on 3, do not collect WoW. do not play pvp servers.
---
well seeing how i havent missed a raid and i am pretty on par with the rogues around me im not too worried about this, but i can see that being an issue in a hardcore situation.
---
my guild is very very lenient so i should be good
---
It’s when I respond punilly after your punilly comment that prompted a pun from 2013 that common persons would pun in everyday life situations which led to punnning your way to the top of the corporate ladder and buy puts of INTC and AMD call to pun the pigs going short on growth.
---
TSM and Inventorian / Bagnon are broken
---
If you are unmounted, by the time the zerg materializes on your screen there is no time to mount up and flee. This is game-breaking. Even if you are mounted, it's unlikely you'll get away at the current render distance. This is something that desperately needs to be addressed and I'm surprised I don't see people making mention of this issue regularly here.
---
Poor horde. Def not used to being ganked lmao.
---
&gt;They can play any roll
---
Except for healing the problem is that they're not particularly good at tanking or DPS compared to the competition.  You have to put in more effort for basically lower results.  Ret is particularly bad because it's not very engaging, you're basically waiting for RNG and reapplying buffs
---
“Only twats call other people pussies.”
---
Both words are literal synonyms...
---
This is likely dependent on the weapon, as weapon speed may/will affect how many autoshots you can get in. 
---
What weapon are you using?
---
It works, we've given the leaf to a hunter that was in IF at the time the chest dropped.
---
My gf used to whine about this.  Then I knocked her up and she doesn't bother me anymore.  
---
The baby keeps her busy.
---
You'll still get ganked, probably a lot and still by bored lvl 60s with the best of everything,  that is just part of life on a pvp server.  Sometimes people will still choose to camp corpses and flight paths which is still just part of pvp server life.  What will change is the people who are doing it for honor will now be incentivized to do premade wsg instead.   The nolife grinding will now occur there which should offer some relief, however folks doing it because they like world pvp, are bored, or just griefing aren't going anywhere.
---
Man I wish wsg had been in since the opening w/o cross realm. It would have been a nice break from lvling and built realm community.
---
&gt;All this non stop crying is getting annoying
---
I find it ironic that you are complaining about others complaining.
---
While some outrage is over the top, don't pretend that all of it is unjustified. Spy misused data in the game for a purpose Blizzard never intended. Blizzard never wanted each player to have a GPS location of every other player. Most addon creators used this data for reason within blizzard's intent, which made everyone happy. DPS meters don't break the spirit of the game. Threat meters make everyone happy because it causes less wipes. 
---
Spy on the other hand, does fuck shit up. Players were never intended to be able to know someone ress'ed or stealth from across the map.
---
And it is a "me me me" attitude because since it benefits you, you are pretending to justify the idea that Spy doesn't go against what was intended.
---
&gt;Jesus, just play the damn game.
---
Exactly what we are all saying. It's Spy that does the opposite of just play the game. It abuses data for the benefit of people who don't want to "just play the game." They want a handicap over everyone else who is just playing the game. And it lead to this, with actually beneficial addons being broken so that Spy can't abuse game data.
---
Kurinnaxx was bad for a while, but is largely okay now. Tanaris and Searing Gorge aren't too bad, assuming you can get away from Gadgetzan and Thorium Point.
---
Meanwhile, I'm sitting on Pagle as a horde eagerly awaiting basically instant ques for BGs.

If you are into anime at all you may enjoy "welcome to the nhk." The series is about hikikomori and at one point MMOs come into play.

Agreed! Druid class super fun to play! I started a mage in vanilla and got bored by level 20. I took a blind leap and rerolled Druid and never looked back since. I'm a 60 Druid right now too!
---
It's cuz word got out we were a balanced server. Since Phase 2 it's swung to Horde Dominant and Alliance has lost some guilds.
---
Dude your reading comprehension is negative, so why are you still trying?

---
&gt; yeah i'm not even sure why they have world bosses on pve servers, sounds so fucking useless.
---
yeah i'm not even sure why they have battlegrounds on pvp servers, sounds so fucking useless.
---
Which means the dominant faction will continue to be so out in the world right? Since their queues will be considerably longer giving them more time to go out to the world and cause havoc whilst the opposite faction are all in the city with rolling queues.
---
I work Wednesday - Sunday :P
---
Wouldn't it be easier to hold BG's across servers rather than transform players of one faction to another.
---
All servers on US east will que up with each other, all servers on US west will que up together. That way no matter what server you are on you can que up for a BG and have it fill out quickly.
---
Are there area's in the world that only have one server?
---
Indeed but they do grant experience which was the question.
---
By god. The myths are true.

So I recently hit 60 on my Rogue and am now shopping around for the first alt I'd like to level up. I'm basically looking for an endgame farming option that would be different from my Rogue, that also has a way different play style. I'm between Hunter and Mage.
---
I was pretty sure I wanted to go with a Mage because ZF grave farming looks sweet as hell, but I just saw a Hunter DM Tribute farm video which seems like a really fun challenge.
---
I guess my question for those who have played either/both and have experience with these farming methods, which do you find more fun?
---
Oh for sure. It's pretty bullshit that alliance has to deal with redridge and shit head undead rogues that kill lowbies there cause they suck at real pvp, whereas the horde don't have to deal with any of that shit.
---
Do you have an estimate on the value per run, without selling tribute gear to other players? I've been looking to solo this just to vendor the loot and stock up on pots/food/drinks but somebody was telling me it's more efficient to mine and I feel like they're mistaken... 
---
Unfortunately I've only made it to the king a few times and have yet to actually kill him, though I do see some progress as before this week I couldn't even make it to the king.
---
Right but your main tank shouldnt really be fury prot if his 5 sunder opener is holding aggro just fine. Nor should he be stealing dps gear for threat.
---
Zug Zug me big mental capacity.
---
forsenCD nice
---
Level 18 🤪
---
You do realize it's not as easy as just merging complementary ratios right?
---
Server A has 7 alliance and 3 horde players
---
Server B has 300 alliance and 700 horde players
---
Merging those doesn't give you a 1:1 balance.
---
yesterday I had that urge to play my brewmaster monk tank again. Did some quests and a dungeon and I've had enough...
---
For pve, human.
---
For pvp, gnome or dwarf. 
---
For literally no reason as a rouge at all, ne.
---
I love them as a support class but the problem comes when they try to DPS *and* support, they just don't have the mana pool for it
---
Oh wow I had to completely relaunch my game to see the servers online!
---
How much XP will you get for 1 and 10 turn ins? And how much for turn ins after the first
---
Yes, I agree. 
---
The thing is, I used to be very social, maybe too social. Things happened and now I'm not. I remember what it was like, being her, that extroverted, open-minded, wild social butterfly, lol (cringe). I understood social cues and nuances as these things came naturally to me and with that so did recovery from faux pas. 
---
That woman is so much not a part of me anymore that it feels like she is another different and separate life. Like she is a made-up memory that I feel intensely. I can't use her/my skills anymore. It's all really messed up. I now get hung up on those faux pas for weeks and in some cases years. I try to get let go and get rid of it however it's like a nasty infection and comes back with a vengeance. I have issues, a lot of them. I'm on them 24/7 though.

Is this your first patch?

small indie gaming company still struggling with 15 year old game code, will the mystery ever be solved?

Rank 11 is 1.4% of the total population.

How is getting into top 1.4% easy ?
---
Nobodys making that with out bgs either once they´re out.
---
Bought it for 350g at the Auction House ( 100% drop rates )

Another change that should have happened is premade should be matched with premade
---
A lot of people I know rolled a race class combination they don’t like to minmax racials, and use this so they don’t have to stare at something ugly while they play.
---
Oooof.  What about Bartender?
---
Heard from a guildie on discord that servers are back up
---
It was made on purpose for people who grind outdated content for transmog/pets/mounts/etc. You do much more damage if you're at least 11 levels above the content (eg 71+ for classic raids, 81+ for TBC etc)l.
---
horde would say that :p. My fave is when some horde bish at 60 tries to attack a low level 50 and I step in. Pick on someone your own size coward!
---
Oh, absolutely. There will definitely be poor play in BGs. 
---
But if I can quest in relative peace, I'm totally okay with that.
---
I just don't get why the sides even care about the other? I don't go play halo 3 and then go "oh you play halo 2? You're a bitch." People like different things, get over it. Live and let live. They are clearly both amazing games.
---
What up dude, friendly neighborhood RL here. That designation likely means you are expected to farm tank gear in dungeons, in addition to farming your normal DPS pieces, as well as will be funneled tank epic pieces. If you have a MT and OT presently, you would probably be 3rd in line for might pieces that drop. Depending on what the guild asks of you, you might have to farm FR too if the MT/OT is sick that day and you're the man up to do Rag, but this is less likely. Talk to your officers.
---
In Onyxia, you might be expected to tank her phase 1 so the main tanks can grab her p3 when she lands and you've lost all threat.
---
In Molten Core, you might be expected to wear DPS gear during trash pulls, but if an extra surger/core hound/pack pulls, or a tank dies, you need to quick as hell put on your shield and taunt whatever extra mob(s) get loose. It's your job to watch for anything going wrong with trash pulls and help the MT/OT out. 
---
Also, for bosses, if your guild can't do most of the bosses with just 2 tanks (i'm guessing your guild cannot if you haven't downed Rag yet), then you might be expected to throw on some tank gear and:
---
Lucifron: Tank one of the 2 adds. Priests need to dispel you when MC'd.
---
Gehennas: Tank one of the 2 adds. Keep it away from the raid/other mobs cause they stun, unless you use a Free Action Potion.
---
Garr: Tank 1-2 of the adds, depending on how many warlocks/other warriors you have. You could also tank Garr himself if your guild uses a nuke Garr strategy, so the MT/OT can grab aoe tank the adds.
---
Shazzrah: Depending on your guild's tactics, you may be asked to pull or move Shazzrah away from the raid.
---
Golemagg: Again, if your OT can't tank both dogs, you may tank one of the dogs.
---
Sulfuron: Same deal, you may be asked to tank one of the adds and depending on the strategy your guild uses, kite that mob up a hill.
---
Domo: You will absolutely be tanking on this one. Listen to your raid leader about what he wants you to tank and when. People do this fight differently.
---
Rag: You will be in full DPS gear if there is a MT/OT in FR already on him.
---
I hope this helps. Anything I just said is second to whatever the raid leader tells you to do, but this is more or less standard practices.
---
Hello 10+ bag slots that can now host more gear for offspecs that I probably will not equip but carry anyways!
---
Might be the same issue I was having on my account. I was unable to log in from the start screen, only from the [b](https://b.net).net launcher.
---
I fixed it by putting in my log-in email in the top box instead of my username.
---
Most people don't prefer 1v2 however and leave the server. Suddenly you are in a 1v3 or 1v4 and then, I think you will agree, it's just unfun for everyone (except good mages I guess)
---
how are they an asshole for hot helping a fairly even fight?
---
Hmm I can’t see keyring...using dominos
---
i turned off all addons but my game is so fucking framey/laggy still oof
---
Full time job, 4 to 6h daily if I dont have other duties
---
This is a perfectly valid question. We are theoretically going to be content locked to Vanilla forever. Long after I have end game BiS there will need to be something other than battlegrounds and fruitless raids to keep me interested. I may not want to roleplay now but I might down the line. Additionally, roleplay communities tend to be the most passionate so it made sense for longevity's sake.
---
Kromkrush is really balanced. The server is around 55H and 45A but it feels like 50/50
---
You’ve no idea how ranking works clearly LOL, everyone can get rank 11 and be rank 11 same time wtf are you talking about. Most people are already rank 7-8
---
Yes, the dominant faction will have longer queues but we don't know how long they will be yet. I'd wager that anything longer than fifteen minutes and people will be leaving the battlemasters to go farm in the open world.

---
You can't do that "pvping less than 3 hours a day", sorry.
---
The guild I am in has just adopted it and have been struggling. I'm not an officer and am not directly involved, but apparently the addon is old and not designed for guilds with multiple raid teams. Something about having to manually sync databases between multiple people, and if not everybody is online then everybody ends up with slightly different copies of the database and this results in DKP values not matching across the board.
---
Yeah I cringe at this too. One of our guild officers was always complaining about wife aggro. On discord we could hear him yelling at his kids to leave him alone because he is “busy right now.”  It was really sad to listen to.
---
He hasn’t been online for a few weeks and apparently his wife is leaving him and CPS are involved. Wow is a large reason she is leaving.
---
Ban waves work.  They collect data on who's using them.  I'm guessing there will be a wave during this maintenance or soon to combat the bots in bgs.  Trust me when I tell you they have this down to a science.
---
Are you guys using the GUID trick with Rag?
---
Let's be honest, that shadow priest was casting that spell BEFORE the pull.
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world top mind blaster in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who can pre-cast and land a sub second mind blast after every single pull. Me, not you. The most mind blast casts ever. The top blaster. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
You are still being judgmental, I am not pretending anything, spy is unethical, I agree.
---
I use it, but I can live without it, so I don't really mind.
---
If Blizzard believes that spy is unethical, they should straight away ban it, but they don't have the guts to do so. 
---
And yes, I guess that's the only thing I have complained about, people complaining. lmao
---
There is no truth, only opinion
---
ya prob broken too cus key ring
---
That’s dope, they have their needs met and can spend their time how they want.  I’d still be surprised if they honestly felt like WoW was the best way to spend their free 8 hours though.  And that’s coming from someone who also plays quite a bit.  It’s just important to understand your motivation to do things or lack thereof.  I personally have trauma that makes confronting real life a drag sometimes.  Does that make me a bad person or somehow a failure for playing wow?  Of course not.  Is it probably a good idea for me to be aware of the reasons I spend so much time playing it?  Yes.  Always to each their own, but I don’t think people are drawn to sinking days and weeks and months into this type of game if they aren’t trying to fill some kind of existing void in their own life, with few exceptions.
---
Exwife or GF?
---
A small piece of advice I haven't seen yet, always try to end each fight with zero mana. 
---
If you are able to do that you can squeeze a couple more shadowbolts in per boss, since you minimize your time lifetapping. For short fights it's a big deal.
---
You are the best. I wasn’t even planning to try til 5 CST until you posted this on my other addiction apart from WoW.
---
I'm a level 60 warrior and I also stand zero chance against a shadown priest, probably even level 58 in all greens could take me, I don't cry about it, it's part of the game.
---
The OP kind of addressed this in that what's important is how the data is aggregated and filtered, and what kind of numbers you're trying to find.
---
Since you can only be logged on to one character at a time, it wouldn't change any given snapshot. If a census is taken and you're on your main, then you log onto your alt and another census is taken, the number of players of your faction hasn't changed between those two snapshots. This is assuming the census isn't filtering out low level players. Now if those two snapshots are added together, then it becomes inaccurate. But statistically it should only make a difference if one faction was a lot more prone to alt-making than another, otherwise you would expect it to balance out in a large enough sample size (i.e. people on the other faction also have alts being counted at about the same rate).
---
That being said I would think (and the OP alluded to this) that simply aggregating every player seen at different times and over a long period of time *wouldn't* give a good representation of the population. Ideally you would want to snapshot at around the same time of day for a few weeks in a row, and that would give you somewhat accurate numbers for that time of day. The players on at 7pm on a Saturday aren't going to be the same as 3pm on a Wednesday, and adding those two totals together doesn't give you an accurate figure of any real life experience.

this server is full of this crap :(
---
Same thing with logging in to game server when trying to load the game on pc.
---
Tested on my Mac, and there i couldn't even go online on battlenet.
---
Logging in would require installing BFA. 
---
I do not know if I can spare a single megabyte of my 2 TB of available drive space for such a thing... even if I will likely never use 1tb...

Phase II was a failure IMO.  Damage was down to the wow player base.
---
I remember those robes dropping off of rivendare and getting hyped and equipping them and just going "Oh..."
---
Quietly vendored them after the group. Still wearing a green waiting for my chance at elements chest piece
---
It doesn't. It's people's min/max mentality that they used to justify them not "just playing the game" like everyone else that makes them think having a near real time GPS tracker is good for the game.
---
I also main a rogue, but I have found leveling a hunter to be the most pleasant experience. It’s a far cry from the brutal solo leveling on rogue when the game first launched. I would recommend hunter based on the leveling (because it’s still such a big part of the game) and the farming potential later on.
---
I think I already addressed the sub-60 issue.
---
The difference between a lower level character like 55 or 58 or 59 to a level 60 isn’t that great. Two or three low level players can overpower a max level player pretty easily. Suddenly low level players give no honor so you see large groups of 59’s farming honor without the ability to give honor. So now just for “soft-locking” your character at 59 you farm honor without giving honor. It’s all reward and no risk. It fundamentally changes how WPvP functions.
---
The point is that one small change can quickly spiral into a lot of changes and if Blizz changed something for you then why not me?
---
That’s how retail became retail. That’s how LFD, a tool that was originally concepted to help low level players find other players for low level dungeons became, LFR, became cross server sharding. (You could actually take this back to Battlegroup BG queues).
---
Then you see the original implementation of LFD or LFR and how hard it was and how many bad players there were and what an awful experience it was. So that led to Blizzard nerfing the content even further so nearly any idiot could complete it.
---
You may think your suggestion is really great but there’s millions for players who also think their suggestion on changing the game is the right one.
---
Blizzard just ends up chasing their own tail trying to make everyone happy.
---
Was getting one once from my gf while raiding hyjal back in TBC and then my Guild leader said a joke on vent and we both started laughing and it totally ruined the moment, only time I ever got a raid bj and it was ruined.
---
Just because the data exists it doesn't mean that deploying it on a significant number of objects on every server and fixing the hundreds of synchronization issues that undoubtedly will occur will be instant.
---
You ever have to update one application on one server before? Shit 6 hours for this is impressive.
---
Haha ok thanks tho anyway
---
yes unironically. never played wow before. classic wow is my first time
---
Their anti cheat team does investigate bot reports.  They then figure out using Warden how the bot interacts with the game.  Then they start flagging accounts over time and ban in 1 big wave.  This is how they've done it for years, and it works.
---
have fun
---
New talent system is far better than the classic one. You have some choice on retail.
---
AV quests are prob 8k or 9k quests similar to a lot of high level elite quests.

Legion and BfA zone content pretty much the same. The dungeons became a bit stale but in 3-4 years people will post about how beautiful and thrilling BfA-dugeon-name is.
---
Holy paladins would like to talk to you about spell crit....
---
No you don’t LOL , you can get rank 11 with bracket 4 each week wtf r u on about
---
I seriously appreciate this. Thank you. I did actually go through DBT and still have my workbook and notes. I did private CBT and group DBT at the same time, spoke to multiple therapists, took meds, etc...  I've unfortunately exhausted the go-to options. I haven't given up though and keep trying. All ya'll on here are being huge motivators/morale boosters too and I can't thank you enough for it. Thank you! Also, I'm really sorry you that you went through what you did. Knowing you were really helped out gives me more hope, too. Thank you!
---
I think they fix clear and obvious bugs. Backdoor jump is a clear and obvious bug and not intended to be in the game.
---
This guy queries
---
Come on Charlie...
---
There was alot of posts sayi g average AV was 15 min.
---
Yeah it was fucking great, two avs in a row for alliance thus far.
---
Play what you would enjoy most looking at for 100s of hours. For me. Night elf female, no regrets full t1 rank 6
---
Rohk
---
It can definitely be optimized and luck is a factor. But the best part imo is that it is guaranteed gold without having to rely on e.g. The auction house, obstruction by the other faction, or competing for spawns.
---
How can I get player bars like this? I’m so tired of the default
---
It's so true man, and it's sad that r/CLASSICwow has just become r/WoW version 2.  Retail is trash, plain and simple a bad game.  People can like a bad game just fine, but when you tell them its a bad game they lose their shit.
---
Should just make prostitution legal. Best of both worlds.
---
if you really think you need a relationship to be happy then maybe yeah
---
Interesting. It's weird though that they would move around the Dark Portal when its location was already well-defined in the lore. I wonder if it's in any way similar to the disagreements about the "Scourge" playable race. Developers are only human after all.
---
It never did in vanilla either.  Those won't be the only items you find not going into the keyring either.
---
AP ret crusader, spelladin spellpower. Probably wouldn't drop the gold on crusader unless you got a sweet weapon though.
---
That's how I thought I remembered it too but the internet keeps telling me otherwise. I would prefer to level through BGs
---
Got a screenshot?
---
Naw classic was better, I hate being locked into a spec, hybrid class building made thing more interesting, plus there are a lot of abilities I wish they would bring back from classic, like shadow ward for locks.
---
man go to the gym or something you don't have to talk to people just please do not type this again
---
classic tree system is superior.  Just some specs require additional testing that other players have no time for.
---
You got that as a shadow priest? I think I’ve only seen mages with it so far
---
Nah, pussies are flexible and great. You're basically a gangrenous asshole if you do this.
---
Correct. The keyring that holds 12 keys but does not hold a necklace is in fact pointless.
---
are all servers up? including US-West? blauemeux specifically :)
---
I’m surprised it took that long.    All it is, is a race to capture that last graveyard.    Should of seen it on Pservers and a premade.   15 years later it’s refined and mastered.
---
How are horde queues like in US?
---
I didn't mind it being 100% i just wish we could use both whenever we wanted.
---
Not sure what that says about retail players then, even Blizzard thinks they're so stupid so they just give them epics and the best gear for no effort.
---
Ah yes, the classic “everyone that disagrees with me is just a hater/buttmad” 
---
Grow the fuck up and realize that people maybe disagree with you because you might be wrong
---
What part of “provides opportunity” means “need” you butthead?
---
No, not in this case. That's the case for automated detection. If people report bots that's manual detection. There is no merit to do this in waves as well.
---
I just downloaded update and my game feels 'laggy' even though I have low ping. It feels like the settings were to high to handle the game after the patch even. Any solutions ?
---
This just in, retail player doesn't know what satire is, thinks person is being serious!
---
Nop you don't just take some paper and a pen.
---
Its a 15 year old game. Talents have been tested, theres like 1/2 talent trees you cab use per spec or youre just not playing your spec effectively. But downvote because fuck retail
---
Early WoW was developed before WC 3. Check out John Staats' World of Warcraft Diary. Thats why that gate exists underwater.
---
I saw plenty of people who were under the impression it would. Just figured I would let people know!
---
Pretty sure if my husband complains I'll just divorce him bwahaha
---
Retail was dead for me not long after Kung Fu Panda Express. Completely jumped the shark and now when I watch people play it on Twitch, I see absolutely nothing that interests me whatsoever. Everyone lives forever. Everyone can heal. No real customization. It's all about mounts and transmog. LAME LAME LAME
---
yes, no pvp just kill the end boss.
---
Most AVs are going to be very fast.  This was the bullshit version of it.  Probably one of if not the worst editions of all variants of AV.  Why it was picked just blows my mind.
---
3k honor, 10 mins. Yes that is the norm.
---
Not really.  Usually alliance turtle if they think they'll lose
---
Oh, I enjoyed that style as well. But there are definitely some who will murder fun in the name of efficiency. Original AV started out with a good while of non rush play, but rushing became more and more popular as it went on, and more learned that this was the optimal path to loot.
---
I know battlegrounds have only been out for all of 30 minutes, but all 3 matches I've played so far have been \~10 minutes of just zerging. Were matches typically longer on pservers or is this standard?
---
It's a great analogy, What if all you run into are the same faction? Can't fight them, and they're taking your shit. and they arn't posting it up on the AH, You'll never reap the benefit of that node that way too, Same way with if it were on a PvE server. same faction might end up just not benefiting you in general. In WPVP terms, it's irrelevent. and BGs are around the corner so either way you'll never benefit from that node.
---
 Neither PvE or PVP has the option to kill everyone on the same faction. Your own faction is as much competition as the other, More so if you're on a realm that's favoring your faction.
---
It is frustrating to me also, skimming past pages of asshats posting single stacks to find pricing on a stack of 20. I dont buy singles in bulk, and I dont price off singles.
---
If it looks like a fair 1vs1, I will respect the duel.
---
This. I'm ally on Sulf.
---
for real
---
Hey they are adding in the framework for paid transfers in the current patch.
---
If you are re rolling, I’d just wait
---
Common tactic is to zerg the last boss. You have to wipe the zerg.
---
my setup is from following this guide, not sure exactly which addon does it but theres a list of the ones used in the desc  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K1bUAilgIg&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K1bUAilgIg&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
At least you can go to major cities without worrying about getting ganked constantly in retail.
---
So, you are still wrong, and spy works just fine, using it right now in AV. I think you were trying to sound smart about Honorspy? So, about those apologies?
---
This was obviously satire and a joke, but look at all the butthurt retail players you offended.  Maybe they'll go back to r/WoW where they belong.
---
But this is something blizz could change with no impact on other gameplay via an improved trade box that allows mats of the buyer to be used in a crafting.
---
It’s possible there aren’t many data submissions from horde side.  I ran my own census with two accounts recently and it showed 54/46 horde/alliance split for level 60s.
---
Same! I hand them out to people i quest with or run dungeons with or if i see someone out in the middle of nowhere questing. Same with potions and food.
---
Some of us had lots of vacation left over, threw it at the end due to the "use it or lose it" policies.
---
My last work day was last thursday.
---
On paper anyway. the 2 calls i had this morning say otherwise -\_-
---
Wrath is supposed to hit every target in melee range, traditionally. Currently it is bugged and only attacks a maximum of 3 targets with the lowest GUID. It's either a bug or a lazy implementation but we fully expect this to be fixed so we are continuing to do the fight the way we have since vanilla. Most of the time we manage to kill Rag before the submerge but sometimes we get bad breaks and must go a round killing the sons. We have never not had a full MC clear since week 2 or 3 so we're not really stressing it.
---
We've also been horrendously unlucky with melee weapon drops. Less than half of our melee have an epic weapon. Plenty of mage blades and SoDs to go around though.
---
Earthfury is pretty heavily Alliance right now. In the Discord, some of the latest census polls are suggestion upwards of 58:42 A:H.
---
It's funny because its true
---
My guess would be they also have QA play a full BG on every server, to make sure it doesn't fuck up. I could be wrong, but surely there is some internal testing of what just got patched onto the servers.
---
Well, you nailed the fuck retail part, anyway.
---
I self identify as a Tauren, and you can't take that away from me! I had a sweet little setup with Mankrick's wife. Well, before she told me to stop trying to leave the Barrens and stay there as a casual lowbie forever.
---
Again, changing the story. Did he not know where to go or not?
---
&gt;  Ally capping stonehearth
---
I don't get it :/ Isn't stonehearth ally to begin with? What am I missing?
---
Eh, it's messier than it looks. especially of you don't wanna do it exactly by the book.
---
Tried that, but got not much luck.
---
Ironforge.pro
---
Don't be ridiculous, we all have been Blizzard fans long enough to know that they won't do crud about this.  It's futile to hope otherwise, this is their cash fix.
---
exactly why this is fake
---
“It JuSt ReAdS tHe CoMbAt LoG”
---
Or have your mom change your bed pan while you and your homies are grinding boars.
---
&gt;*And you better believe they start casting before you're even in bear form*
---
Is that why some tanks will pull before the mage even sits down for a drink, so that they don't have mana to pull that shit?
---
&gt;I know battlegrounds have only been out for all of 30 minutes, but all 3 matches I've played so far have been \~10 minutes of just zerging. Were matches typically longer on pservers or is this standard?
---
10min of zerging? How is the game 10min long if you zerg
---
5 levels in classic is not what I would consider fair.
---
The issue is you're a druid.
---
&gt;The more effort you spend, the more I win.
---
Yikes.  You don’t lose the right to vent about a relationship just because you entered into it willingly.  
---
If you’re having a hard time understanding why that’s the case, consider whether you’d have the same objection to the wives’ complaining about their husbands’ gaming habits...
---
Fun indeed.
---
Yeah, nobody is playing AV the way its intended to be, especally not the 1.12.1 version (which is basically the same as retail version).
---
No mine layer, and its end 10 min.
---
No but my uncle does. Also works for nintendo and I got to play the n64 a year before it came out (because my uncle works there).
---
I wouldn't say "triggered"
---
just a bit tired of all the idiots screaming "retail bad" in the echo chamber that is /r/classicwow
---
I'm under the impression that if a warrior can't do enough damage to tank and succeed as fury, he's probably not good enough to hold aggro as prot.
---
Nah, people just turtle to piss people off.
---
They do not apparently. According to that guys post Customer Support said they could do nothing about it.
---
To a degree they had to, by the time of BC they literally couldn't fit anything else in Azeroth proper, that's why Silvermoon is in the BC realm and not Azeroth despite being on the Eastern Kingdom.
---
Matches were only 10-13 minutes long in vanilla. If they were longer it’s cause horde did some petty shit like turtle game galv.
---
It's not that fast at all. After checking, deja stats reports NE wisp movement speed at 150%, non NE is 125%.  
---
epic mount is 200% ground speed and travel form is 140%.
---
They aren't patching anything, all the Classic content exists already, they're likely doing some patching to fix/nerf the AddOn API, the display errors for honor, etc.
---
Because... I don't live in the US, and I don't do the same kind of programming they would do, and they would have to hire me, and... what does that have to do with what I said? Like, even remotely?
---
Seriously, I don't understand this subreddit. At all. My response is getting downvotes because people would rather believe that Blizzard is deliberately extending Classic maintenance to get people to play retail, even though they make $15 a month off you either way, than to acknowledge that there are probably a couple problems with taking a version of a game from 15 years ago and transplanting it to modern day. This entire subreddit has this bizarre combination of a superiority complex ('we're so much better than those retail babies') and a victim complex ('Blizzard hates us and is trying to make Classic fail!'). It makes me not really want to play Classic as much.
---
welcome to every wow patch ever.
---
It's more than just the combat log you see in your chat window. Each action you take in recorded in the game, even if you don't see it in your combat log. Accepting a rez is recorded data. You going stealth.
---
So now lets say there is a wall between me and you. You can't visually see me or target me through the wall. Aside from me physically existing in the realm, you'd have no idea I'm on the other side of you. You have no record of me in your visual combat log. Spy takes data from the world around you, and lets you bypass things like visual obstructions. I just rezzed on the ground floor of a tower while your at the top? Boom, you instantly know who I am and where I am even though you physically can't click or see me.
---
That is the entire issue of Spy. It allows you to do things you normally wouldn't be able to do because it abuses game data in a way that the data wasn't intended to be used.
---
Alliance Onyxia attunement is so much easier
---
*gtg pool's on fire*
---
There is no way to make 50/50 servers.
---
Absolutely no spelladins would dream of wasting the money on spellpower
---
The build revolves around MCPs, which are basically consumables. You just put the 3% speed increase on them because it's cheap and its actually significant at that point. 
---
The only use case I could see for spellpower is for a prot paladin.
---
I'm not sure i understand the question. Maybe we have different definitions of zerging but to me it's just a ball of players storming through the map to the objective and not using any real strategy. So each team is just going through their respective routes through AV not interacting with each other at all and see who can take the other keep the fastest like it is in retail. So the games are only 10 minutes because people don't bother fighting each other, they just zerg through the towers and to the keep.
---
Let's see what is Blizzard opinion on this.
---
People play AV for the free exalted rewards mostly. 
---
Another reason why Blizz should again have done the same as the pservers, and at least try to revert it so couldn't be powerfarmed as fast.
---
Yes, people could rush on the private servers, and that AV version is also trash, but at least it takes a bit longer.
---
What’s wrong with Bagnon? Seems alright on my tune no noticeable changes as far as I can tell.
---
Maybe but we aren’t dealing with the overpopulation issue so it’s not like the horde is emasculated like Alliance is on Skeram.
---
You didn't state anything for me to disagree with...just insults. 
---
I think you're confused lol. Consider books with pictures bud.
---
Which addon directly shows me the auction house price of an item? :)
---
Thanks for any help!
---
&gt;Yikes. You don’t lose the right to vent about a relationship just because you entered into it willingly.
---
Nor did I say that you do. You wrote all that and it wasn't even relevant to my comment.
---
yes.  pretty much having them raid test with shamans only came about when they allowed alliance to play shamans.  the first two years of wow were fucking wild lands for patch months.
---
&gt; I truly do not understand how people can play 8 hours a day unless they're teenagers or unemployed
---
I'm pretty used to working like 12+ hours a day, and only get around 6 hours of sleep a night. So now that I work straight 40 hours with minimal extra (maybe 5 hours a month) I found I have way more time on my hands than stuff to do. I mean, after cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc I still have a ton of free time to burn.
---
Very cool. Thank you. And then for raiding, is it pretty clear that duel wield fury is the best?
---
That's what a Google search told me. But I certainly did never try it myself.
---
I think this may be the first time I've seen someone say this.
---
&gt;I love strawmen
---
It’s provocative
---
I don't think there will be long AVs at all, it happened occasionally on the pservers because you died so easily to all the PvE content in there, and there was a mine-layer NPC that one-shot you if you ran off the main roads basically.
---
On the 1.12.1 version (the one on classic) long AVs will be ultra rare.
---
Awesome. Thanks again for the help! Looking forward to downing Rag tonight.
---
Retail is like that old flame that you were with on and off again for years only for it to burn out into bitterness. Classic is like going back to to the good times before the ugliness started when you couldn't get enough of each other.
---
Which is a product of losing
---
Yes that’s how av works.
---
My server is 75/25 to alliance just because noone from horde uploading data..
---
So census is totally innacurate and im not using it now.
---
Check ironforge.pro, it shows data based on rading guilds which now before pvp patch is a main power on server.
---
This data is more valid because its not based on random ppl uploads.
---
Preformed  AV Enabler was on of the most popular ones in Vanilla and TBC.
---
Two 55s can probably take a 60. But a 48 still gives honor to a 60, and that's a brutally unfair fight. Even 2v1, a geared 60 is probably going to wreck face. Particularly if the 60 is opening the fight while the 48s are leveling. Or murdering them at a flight point/as they respawn. 
---
There is room for a few changes to preserve the feel of classic. Maybe not "only 60s" give honor, but maybe the honorless target debuff should be applied in more circumstances(such as just after rezzing). 
---
Im okay with PvP, but I'm not overly fond of single faction servers, or being murdered non stop due to megaservers. PvP is one form of content. It isn't the only content.
---
No, mindblast does an insane ammount of threat compared to most abilities in the game
---
Aight man, so why are there so few tanks?
---
&gt;My second question is whether I should drop mining for disenchanting?
---
Absolutely not, the shards aren't worth anything either.
---
The server with the BIS name will always have people.
---
Druid is the master race. I have spoken
---
It's up!
---
Yeah pretty much. I start with R1 SWP &gt; R1 SWP&gt; SWP&gt; flay before starting to add in mind blast. 
---
After that I am usually hitting the X mob with R1 SWP to build up shadow weaving for when the locks switch DMG from skull.  Then repeat.
---
If your chasing the damage meter your not contributing to the raid as much as you could be. But in fairness 15% of each locks DMG resulted from you if you are making sure mobs are primed with the debuff. 
---
It's actually a pretty active spec if you are playing it right. Not just a 1 button masher.
---
Pvp gear isn't the absolute best though, it doesn't even cover all the slots. And for a lot of people in "competitive" guilds the stats helps them clear faster, get better parses, and just min-max their character more.
---
Good luck! What's the lowest percent you've gotten him to? And when/how are you wiping?
---
There's maybe a keyring window you have to turn on? I'm using dominos too, hopefully it won't just be hidden without an update.
---
People realized that these large scale skirmishes that lasted 10+ hours were a total waste of time. Remember fighting on the Ally bridge for hours, endlessly?
---
On pservers, the meta became a PvE race, not a PvP battle. Even if you're losing, it's better honor and rep. Often, players would ignore the opposing fashion, they'd just run right by one another.
---
No, I mean people get pissed off u start turtling. They would rather prefer you AFK and let the other faction win so they can re-que for another BG.
---
Stretched out BGs are usper inefficient.
---
Texas man rolls a PvE server and discovers the other faction can no longer steam roll him while questing! - Gankers hate him!
---
After reading a thread talking about the #nochanges movement preventing patch cycling, what would a patch to gameplay look like? Assuming it hit before BWL or before ZG, what balances would be made to 1.12 or what would everyone like to see?
---
What tweaks would be need to be made to each class to either buff or nerf them accordingly?
---
Would fury dps be nerfed? Hunters are in a good place DPS wise currently, but would a patch to be timed with the release of AQ try to address their drop off? Would warlocks get a % hit talent inline with other caster dps?
---
What does everyone think?
---
Seeking chill friends on **A-Fairbanks (PVP)** to casually roll through dungeons for that pre-BiS and just general grilling and chilling (you love to fish? I, too, love to fish!). Just looking for some more fellow casual players!
---
Classic wow really attracts the pussy hounds
---
Deployment team is working through the dev and test teams check lists with Dev and Test Leads watching over their shoulder.
---
Most people wouldve agreed back in mop/legion. Only when the current expansion is trash like WoD/BfA do people say it. You legit have so little choice in classic talent its a joke i get downvoted lol. But nothing else expected from this hypocrit community.
---
There are spider mobs that web, but no pets.
---
IBC?
---
You dont know what u talking about and for sure dont play spriest. Stop repeating what you hear from other clueless people on the internet.
---
Am I stupid, how do I queue up as a duo with my friend for AV? Leader has gone in separately
---
I'm with you here. There's a million mechanics I like about old WoW, totems are absolutely not one of them. A buffed that anchors you in place under the threat of eating more of your mana to recast if you move. If they do indeed come back mandatory as part of the retail "unpruning" in Shadowlands then my Shaman is getting shelved.
---
Semantics are up to interpretation I guess, but I don't think "better" is typically used as you're describing. If I asked you which was the better car, a Geo or a Ferrari, which would you think of? Anyway, doesn't matter, I'm sure people understand that AV biscuits are more effective despite their higher cost.
---
We have a ton of changes.
---
It's truly one of my favorite posts ever on pretty much anything. I found it during BC, when I was a teenager and I will never forget this post.
---
I agree and I think we agree lol. It was always so annoying trying to get through the turtle matches. Although if I kept getting steamrolled I might do the same
---
Yea, but it's better than "lol if someone pulls aggro you're a bad tank".
---
yes and the relic coffer keys as well
---
I’m not sure if you were being 100% serious here, but there’s nothing wrong with a partner who won’t play the game with you.
---
As long as your partner understands why you want to play and respects your decision to do it (and you don’t abuse your game time to the detriment of the relationship) she can still be a keeper.  My fiancé is amazing and try as I might, she just isn’t into it.  That didn’t stop her from supporting my decision to take some time off work for Classic launch and being incredibly supportive of my race to 60.  She doesn’t want me to play to the point where I’m neglecting her or other responsibilities, but those are reasonable objections.  
---
It’s only where you truly care about playing the game and your partner refuses to accept that or allow it that you’re probably in an unhealthy relationship or one that just isn’t likely to work out in the long run.  
---
People should be honest about their desire to play video games and not hide it from their partner.  We don’t need video games to be happy, but if you feel like your partner is standing in the way of you doing what you want you would like to do to decompress or have fun, you’ll eventually grow to resent them.
---
Some big boomer energy in this thread.
---
Bot programs are also nice and totally fair. It just takes things like clicking buttons and playing the game, and streamlines it into a program that takes the hassle out of things like farming. I can already click the buttons manually (people's justifications for an addon that scans everyone's combat logs at lightning speeds you can't manually achieve) and just does it for me. It's nice and convenient. We should all be allowed to download bot software that farms for us 24hrs a day. Totally ethical and cool.
---
That's it. Thanks
---
Benediction is literally 50/50 and as someone who plays on the server, it's quite even to an extent
---

---
I feel you, man. I think gaming and relationships can work you just need be aware how staring at a comp for several hours without looking up makes others feel and address it. Hopefully you take lessons learned from this one and do better next time.
---
I'm a paly and my bank is FILLED TO THE BRIM with gear. Gotta have the healing set, prot set and now working/finishing up my ret set...
---
Help me
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
He is right, so are you talking about your own irony?
---
yep all servers are up and av is live for NA at least
---
Maybe not quite to that level, but the horde are pretty heavily oppressed on Earthfury. It takes 45+ minutes to get to BRD or DM most nights and I know of plenty of horde that have struggled to get any questing done in the 40s and 50s. It's not good right now.
---
If I am not playing classic then I'm playing Destiny 2. Just contemplating retail saps my will to live.

Since TF was a day 2 server, we missed a lot of the hardcore Pserver crew that was already in on Herod, Stalagg, etc. and a lot of the people (my friend group included) who “just wanted to play” ended up here.
---
Aggro is totally in the tanks control. If they lose aggro then they're either lacking gear, have the wrong spec, playing bad. 
---
I see so many warriors using a shield and then losing aggro. Its not hard to see bad tanks
---
No kiddin. TIL
---
In a PvE server I cannot kill anyone therefor I compete with 100% of the population. In a PvP realm I can kill half ge population which means less competition. 
---
Here is a real life example. 3 saytr camps in Azshara with 3 alliance and 2 horde farming them. Instead of letting the two horde farm I invite the allies and we kick them out and split the 3 camps amongst ourselves.
---
When do EU BGs release?
---
Soooo.... it's a subjective term used to essentially describe a post that makes your head hurt? I really didn't understand that and it felt directed at somebody who is not me. I'm a nobody.
---
I know how it works,unfortunately you are probably right about the usage of spy and collateral damage. 
---
Banning spy would require them to make a rule, and developers would work around those rules.
---
And fyi, I just wait in my lane, I  don't switch all the time.(But yeah, legit point) 
---
Have a nice evening, going to log in wow.
---
Yes Believe someone said...
---
Not always though. Yesterday they were pretty pissed off and searing gorge was cancer. I had to go around the cauldron to get into BRM and i still got killed a few times.
---
I agree retail is a waste of time bcs all your progress is basically reset every patch and thats not fun besides I hate the gear rng in retail where you need to hit a 0.002% to get it to max titan forge as well as socket as well as get the correct tertiary stat.
---
I kinda agree with this. If you were playing wow and then met the one, you probably will drop a raid or wow completely to hang out with them. If they were there before wow, things can get rocky.
---
You're really following this dude around and posting screenshots of old conversations with him? Maybe you should take a break from the internet for awhile...

Yeah, so pvp happened on a pvp server

Is that true about Thunder Clap? I'm not the best tank in the world but I've been using it a lot and it makes tanking far easier for me. I did a quick check online to compare the threat values, unless I'm missing something Thunder Clap generates 180 threat at max rank per mob hit + damage done, and Demoralizing Shout generates 43 threat at max rank per mob hit. Even with the 20% reduction on Thunder Clap and the 30% increase on Demoralizing Shout that still only brings the numbers to 144 and 46 respectively and before damage. Wouldn't that mean that Thunder Clap is better to use unless you are fighting a ton of NPCs?
---
And people just keep throwing shit out there that is more and more wrong. Like how do people type some of these posts with a straight face.
---
It does work, but have not seen anyone use it.
---
TradeSkillMaster does this, however be warned it is a very complex addon that can do WAY more than this, and at first look it can be very confusing. I have heard good things about auctionator and auctioneer which seem simpler, although I've not used them. 
---
The thing with TradeSkillMaster though is that you have to perform a scan of the AH whenever you want recent data. If the last scan i performed was 2 weeks ago, the prices might currently be way different. So if you're going to use one of these addons you'd best update/scan regularly to have a good history built up of that item, as well as most currently available AH prices.

Stop talking you have no idea whats the job of a shadowpriest on each MC fights. Pick golemagg where a priest can freely dps and see what happens.

Yep, no effort for the best gear. Because Ragnaros is the apex of challenging game design compared to Mythic Azshara. Adds AND a dot, deep mechanics right there. Wait for Naxx, it'll be THREE whole mechanics per boss. Imagine having to tank an add, dispel a dot AND deal with a threat drop.

Its not ridiculous, its not hard to find someone in the world with meta gaming, you really dont need to stream snipe. Its not like asmongold hides in random caves all stream, he goes to known and popular locations becuase if he spent his whole stream hiding it would be boring.   
---
Also only two of his videos on youtube are focused on him ganking asmongold, most of them are of him exposing toxic gamplay that olympus and devilsaur mafia do or ganking olympus/affiliated guilds/players. He isnt making a channel around harassing asmongold, he is making a channel around ganking him in a game. You are aloud to make a channel around playing a game, and in game there are no rules around camping other players. Harassment does not apply to actions that are not against terms of service within a game, otherwise I could say Asmongold is guilty of theft for ninjaing loot, supports racketeering for his support of unbind. You cant just arbitrarily decide what advertise is doing is harassment because asmongold got his feelings hurt, thats completely unprincipled.

It doesn't take that long to figure out how to play most classes to be honest. If going to a target dummy and spamming skills until you figure out the rhythm doesn't work, 5 minutes on icy veins reading the quick summary on the class is more than enough.

Then use an auction addon. Auctionator is the best. Not sure why people torture themselves by using the default auction UI, it really sucks.

I've got a temporary solution for those who want to manage their keyring with UI/bag addons. Bagnon and possibly other UI/bag addons are incompatible with this method. I'm using Bartender4 and AdiBags.

Create a macro with the following line to open your keyring:

ok boomer

Just because you're making something doesn't mean it's inherently good and I hate this attitude that if you're against some addons you're a luddite living in a cave. Even in real world, you could be making something that makes the world better or Umbrella corp virus. Great many WoW addons are more like undead virus on the game than something positive.
---
Crossrealm friend, queue times are less than 5 minutes right now.
---
Dont they come out today?
---
yup have to maintain superiority over the casual forum complainers at all times. Hope my post made you feel all tingly in your panties.
---
Notice how he has over 10k hks? Because he gets very very little honour every kill because he’s pvping in a huge group. I’m only at 3200 hks because I always pvp solo or duo, likely getting over 10x the honour per kill they are because they are zerging. 
---
Just because your guild mates Zerg for 8 hours a day with 30 players doesn’t mean they will be gaining much honour.
---
It almost doesn't matter how bad Classic gets/is.
---
It's still better than retail.
---
Class fantasy is great, actual play style not so much
---
First version of AV sucked and only ended when one side got bored and afked out.
---
This is so wrong on so many levels. If dps draws agro its entirely on them.
---
&gt;  I will gladly hop into the instant queues for the first 2 weeks during the mad rush for honor gains.
---
I mean, it won't be instant, because you're going to have 300% the number of horde queuing than alliance. None of the alliance are returning for this pile of crap experience that classic has turned out to be.
---
The \#nochangers wanted 1.12.1, and they got it.
---
This is 1.12.1, people who actually played the game recently and didn't spout shit based entirely on vague 15 year old memories knew how the game would be played, and thus asked for Blizzard to make compromises like the private servers did for the more "authentic vanilla" experience, as oppose to pure 1.12.1
---
Imagine TBC in 2.4.3, is that the "authentic" TBC experience? Where all the dungeons are nerfed etc.
---
yep this is the 1.12 version of AV
---
its not PVP, its a pure PVE race for quick honor/rep gains
---
Holy shit, what a tool
---
I kept doing this after getting pathfinder. I'm also from what was once a PvP server, and I've never turned off War Mode. One time when I was getting camped pretty bad I actually logged out and played on an alt, then I realized later "Oh shit, I could have just turned off War Mode in a town."
---
&gt;In a PvE server I cannot kill anyone therefor I compete with 100% of the population. In a PvP realm I can kill half ge population which means less competition. 
---
It's good that you're on a 50/50 balanced server, Don't spread the word about it being balanced, or it'll skew, Most PvP servers arn't 50/50. So depending on faction imbalance.. You'll be competing with 60, 70, 80, 90% of the server, where with the higher it gets, the less competition you get to kill. Which means more competition. 
---
So keep that server name safe to keep that "Half the server is my enemies, and I can kill them freely."
---
&gt;Unless you're working in unison with someone of the opposing faction, or you have multiple accounts, this is usually the case.
---
Correct. It's possible to do on servers you don't play as you can just delete the characters, but in your main server, you got to find someone from the opposite faction which is willing to help.
---
Not sure.
---
Clay pigeon shooting, also known as clay target shooting, and formally known as Inanimate Bird Shooting, is the art of shooting a firearm at special flying targets, known as clay pigeons or clay targets.
---
The terminology commonly used by clay shooters often relates to times past, when live-pigeon competitions were held. Although such competitions were made illegal in the United Kingdom in 1921, a target may still be called a "bird", a hit may be referred to as a "kill", and a missed target as a "bird away"; the machine which projects the targets is still known as a "trap".
---
Yes my method doesnt backtrack and doesnt require you to logout and reset using an alt.
---
If you are swordspec or good geared you can kill the pyroseer. I personally don't because i still die to him often. Some people say you can kill his adds and reset with vanish, but i found this doesnt work. They always respawn.
---
Decided to level an UD Rogue alt. Might just be coincidence but I've noticed Alliance are way more hostile towards me than on my main Orc Hunter haha.
---
Its X realm, very few alliance will queue, you'll probably be waiting a solid hour per queue.
---
I thought it was all pvp or pve servers on the same group - as in the way they are separated on the log in screen (west coast, east coast, EU etc). I could be wrong though.
---
Full fury for MC/Ony for sure.  Just put on more plate than leather and get good at swapping to shield and taunting.
---
Loses a bit of community vibes but solves many issues. 
---
I don’t remember specifics but I can remember queuing into WSG and thinking ‘ah shit it’s x or y’s premade’. Nostalgia ehhh
---
phase 2 forum complainer spotted.
---
&gt; Well if that's the case, then to answer your question. LET HORDES TRANSFER AWAY AND ALLIANCE TRANSFER TO THE SERVER
---
That’s not an answer. You’re asking Horde to give up their advantage. It is NEVER going to happen. You gave zero incentive either, why should anyone do any of this, for your ambiguous idea of “balance”. At least I know where you’re coming from now. You’re just telling Blizzard to fix it by have no idea how.
---
&gt; How is it not fun to play against the odds? No one wants to be able to just walk around and do shit with no threat, that's boring as fuck
---
Answered above and by yourself. Clearly the Horde/you love having the advantage. The Horde on that server already walk around with zero threat, and at the expense of any Alliance player. Having odds stacked against you implies there is a CHANCE of victory. A 10:1 server balance where people are being camped in supposed safe zones is not stacked odds, it’s zero odds. If you think they have it so amazing, just go play there yourself as Alliance. Enjoy not being able to complete quests because of dead quest givers, and god help you if you step foot in a contested zone for half a second. 
---
People play PVP servers for the chance of hostile encounters and some world PVP. They don’t play it to get camped by Max level characters while trying to level or being assaulted by 40 man raids when the most they could muster is a 10 man raid in response. It doesn’t make any sense, and there is no better feasible answer than allowing people to play the game while it gets sorted out.
---
This is the neutered AV. So yeah, it’s normal. Bring back OG Vanilla AV
---
We need a dedicated sub just for people to post things like this.
---
Hehehe, good one. Fixed, thanks!
---
Yeah, but it wasn't a 5min farmfest at least. Even with backdoor it would still take a while, and you still had to take certain objectives regardless (mine layer in perticular)
---
It was annoying, but now Blizz is giving out free epics for 0 effort, as everyone will be exalted in a week.
---
this isnt unique to Pservers. its how it was at the end of vanilla as well

sucks that I'm at work and cant farm it on my lvl 52 rogue.
---
They posted in the patch notes that Xrealm is for teh entire region. So US is one big battlegroup and EU is one big battlegroup
---
Maybe, just maybe, it is because BG‘s JUST came out and ppl want to play them? :D
---
I‘m not saying you are wrong, but I think it is just not really comparable when they just released
---
Right, you can sit there and manually scan your combat log when there are 20+ players around you, hash it, make sense of it all and all while still physically playing the game. Astounding.
---
I guess you're in favor of bot programs that farm for you? I mean, you can physically click buttons and sit there farming for 24hrs a day, so having a program that does it all for you is justifiable because it's not doing anything you can't do yourself right? 
---
Because that is a horrible justification for why Spy doesn't bypass blizzard's intended use of game data. You can do what Spy does manually, but there is no way you can do it as fast and as effectively as Spy does.
---
Tell that to a resto-druid. Plenty of different specs.
---
I know there's no Totem Timer update on the curse client yet.  Haven't looked directly from the source yet
---
Piling on to all the right answers with my little anecdote.
---
From the WSG portal it was actually easy to get to the Warsong Lumber Camp (I think it was the name) so we used to queue at the WSG portal and head over there to PvP while waiting for the queue to pop.
---
It was definitely better to queue from cities though. There's only so much to do in the middle of ashenvale lol.
---
I will make it legal.
---
Unfortunately kinda happening in my guild now. Our raid tanks are basically as geared as possible for the phase and are now complaining we wont let them bid dkp on warrior dps gear so they have less incentive to show up. Nevermind that for about 6 weeks straight they got dibs on basically everything.
---
How are queue times for horde right now?
---
Just disable dominoes, put all your keys in your keyring, turn dominoes back on.
---
Probably less to do with undead and more to do with being a rogue. People are aggressive towards rogues because they don’t want to be questing and have them sneak up and gank them.
---
Before warcraft 2? Not saying they didn't have any other ideas just...seems strange unless someone else opened a portal somewhere.
---
They should at least try. I'm disappointed that Blizzard has so little care for faction balance in both retail and classic.
---
For Classic, they could have encouraged better faction balance by making week 1 queues to be faction-based, so fence-sitters could have maybe decided to play Alliance (or Horde for PVE).
---
in 2005 sure. This is 2019 the game has been figured out and there are builds that allow tanks to out threat every dps right now
---
tomorrow

Such a statement has never been more true

---
In that case, the best thing is to find someone from the other side to run a census. You can do it 2-3 times in a week (same time each ), takes 20-25 mins and share results via Discord. I can guarantee you that a census done on a few evenings a week will be the most accurate information you can get. However, it's bound to get outdated.  In example, I regret not having done more census before P2 dropped to see if Alliance is really playing less.
---
Yea, if you are Horde you can sure choose to roleplay a lame Tauren with PTSD because, being the majority faction, nobody messes with you (alliance are all dead or behind bars in IF).
---
If you are ALLIANCE however:

Dude, it's patch day.  Disable your add-ons and wait for them to be updated.  If you can't live without them, disable them all and re-enable one by one to find the culprits.  It's been like this since the dawn of time in game modding for multiplayer clients.
---
Yeah, it's perfect for people I want to remember in the future, but with whom I didn't connect to such an extent so as to add them to my friends list.
---
That's a race to the bottom, you shouldn't be forced into using some addon because addons keep spamming the chat and making any sort of communication in-game impossible. The solution is to break the addons not force everyone into buying in.

---
well we can't know now since bwl is not released. but yeah, if pservers were somewhat accurate bosses will be left with some armor in bwl, making bre better. if thats enough to offset the glancing blows remains to be seen. untamed blade will probably be better anyway then.
---
Actually the census addon has this functionality where you can just click anywhere and it will run the /who. So you could just set that option and level a character until level 3-4 and by the time you're there, the census will be probably done. I prefered the other method because I like reading books more than doing the initial zones over and over.

Plenty of time to walk while auto attacking

Pretty sure that's his alt you're responding to lol!

It also works with VuhDo which is fairly populalr from what I can tell. For it to work with the standard raidframes, you need ClassicHealPrediction *and* libhealcomm4.0 though - the latter on its own is just a library.
---
What are you on about now?
---
What you are doing is trying to justify what Spy does by saying it isn't doing anything you can't manually do, disregarding the fact that it does it at speeds you'll never be able to achieve.
---
for horde or alliance?
---
As someone who is in an open relationship, this is hilarious and also weirdly common.
---
Was aware of items like the Mara, Ubers ring etc (it is a KEYring afterall). 
---
I just saw plenty of people who assumed anything that was actually a key would fit! (I didn't know myself as I couldn't remember back in the day).
---
That's what the original Field of Strife was supposed to prevent. But crybabies complained too much. 
---
When people said #nochanges this is what they meant. They wanted the field of strife and the 12+ hour games. NOT this min/max garbage.
---
Gotta love IT.
---
Tauren here, it absolutely reduces the hitbox for melee attacks. Not sure about aggro radius though, it seems my non-cow party members body pull way more often than I do...
---
I dunno, I feel like people were dcing all the time in vanilla so i just don't remember post boss dcs because dcs were so much more common.

Someone going offline for 5-10 mins then popping back was common.

Ahhh ok. Cool, I'll get 30 SP on that and just run with it. Don't care about losing the SP from caster weapons, I've got pre BiS on every other item and raid BiS on others. Mageblade will be a while.
---
Completely new abilities and augments that change rotation or playstyle are generic, but that 5% crit chance? Now THAT was a flavourful talent.

You can bind "Interact with target" as a binding you can set in default wow. Couple that with a target macro and you're good to go.

"Most of you play like 16-24"

That's not something to aspire to.

It is, I think the people who are adamant about changing literally nothing had a flawed view.

they'll let us know when they get in a game
---
Recently it absolutely does not feel 50/50. The past week it's felt at least 60/40 in favor of Alliance.
---
I haven't said this in a while, but shut the FUCK up boomer nobody asked
---
1 stack or 100?
---
Thinking of grinding 58-60, if mobs I am grinding are 54-56 is there any benefit to me using either a sword or mace as a human. I know that +5 weapon skill is important for mobs higher in level to me, does it have any measurable effect on mobs lower than me?
---
Well so far that has been completely wrong.
---
To avoid the GY camping, just dont rez! Like NO ONE! Step aside from the gy, go on your desktop switch every then and now into the game and done. The campers dont get ANY honor and you dont waste your time cause you get camped... I dont get it why THIS should be a big problem, just outplay your enemy in that situation and move on, with crossbg´s they chance that you will get the same group 2 times in a row are so low, that you dont have to worry about it. And even if so, fuck it just dont rez!

You still have to test the live hardware/software after patching/performing maintenance....

Warmaster off rend are only slightly worse (2% dodge vs 1% crit, 2 str, 5 stam, 9 agi), and you are likely to pick them up over the many UBRS runs every tank ends up doing. You won't find many people looking to put in the effort for that small upgrade.
---
&gt; Because they're not doing it for balance, they're doing it to make the game more fun for themselves.
---
They still won’t, they want the advantage, nothing will change that. Just ask any of those Horde to go to a server with even a slight Alliance bias, it won’t happen. 
---
&gt; And blizzard took that away.
---
You can’t be this dense...It was gone BEFORE they allowed transfers, and would be gone soon even if they did nothing. People aren’t going to sign on to be city camped, you’re not even thinking. Short term=This works, quit bitching. Long term= Probably huge server merge that forcibly evens out populations, but real answer will take time.

You will be there on discord for 5+ hours wasting gold trying to get thru the raid. Everyone needs to remain calm and positive. Having drinks can make this easier. At least what I think. Still lets wait for an expert

Because fuck people stuck in low pop realms who want to play BGs, right?

You sound like an asshole.
---
So far, AV is a flop. Average match is about 5 minutes.
---
Really disappointed they didn't go for 1.5 AV and instead gave us 1.12
---
Everyone and their grandmother using game breaking addons is already a change. Very few people used addons in classic to any serious extent. That's in addition to other changes like massive server caps that heavily impact the gameplay, btw.
---
Wheres this from?
---
Summed it up nicely.  Especially like the point about complementary systems
---
Maybe if 100% of the player base played BGs and that’s all they did and did nothing else for eternity, then this post might make sense

So BWL refers to Blackwing Lair, a so called ***PvE*** Raid..

Yes, the requirements of rank for items was removed mid-vanilla. You can use rank 14 weapons even if you lose rank 14, and you can use the rank 11 mount, even if you lose rank 11.

As for the speed: Wowhead reports 100% speed, just like regular epic mounts.

Yep, rogues get some “prevenge” cause no one picks rogue on a pvp server to be the nice guy
---
Thanks
---
What private server......
---
This was the norm in vanilla aswell. Its just that most of the people that say they played vanilla never really did so they have no idea.
---
This isnt the original AV. This is the 1.12 version.
---
I would like to note that the overall percentages https://wowclassicpopulation.com/ are misleading. There is a Chinese server that has 10k alliance on it and like 0 horde, the other "horde dominated" Chinese servers have sub 100 horde recorded. To put this in perspective, that is equivalent to the number of alliance on Heartseeker. This suggests that the faction imbalance on NA and EU is likely a lot worse than the overall percentages suggest.
---
Okay, so are you going to finally link the fucking thing or just allude it all day?
---
They only break them up into smaller stacks if you want it to. Certain items don't sell in stacks of 20 and you need to break them up into smaller stacks to move them. For example, I don't know why but stacks of 20 steel ingots won't sell on my server, but stacks of 5 sell like hot cakes.
---
Ah, a true classic vanilla experience relived again.

Who ever thought there would be queues more than 2-5 minutes for horde lmao I get AV almost instantly
---
Of fuck off. People on this sub cry no matter what
---
I agree, and they were not a part of the vast majority of vanilla. You used to play in BGs vs the people on your server.
---
Congrats, now peole on dead servers are screwed. Vanilla BGs arent coming back, AV will still be a rush to the last boss like it is on retail. #nochanges got us into this P2 bullshit, just let it die so modern solutions can help more people
---
Bgs cross server format in my thoughts wouldn't factor in PvP vs PvE. Everyone is quing up for the same thing as long as ping isn't vastly effected.
---
So that 60-40 ratio that you speak of would work really well because not everyone will que up for bgs so it should be pretty even on both sides.
---
As long as you buy them while rank 11, you're good. They are not faster. I believe you still have to be exalted with a different race if you want to ride their mount (doesn't apply to your own race).

I'm on board

Yo can you link the shaman discord?

same problem, but can log in though. update doesn't install
---
You're right, I'd much rather go back to just getting camped through world PVP in every zone instead until I log off.
---
Hey whats up! I'm the guy in the pic :)
---
Which is not alliance exclusive
---
Fair enough. Gonna have to stock up I guess.
---
Us already released, EU on the 11th.
---
Im not, im seeing all my dead ally buddies and the horde camping my corpse xD
---
I'm on 57 Zevrim kills and have looted 23 tomes. Got 3 druid, 2 priest and a hunter. Nothing else.
---
They are because of the way addons propagate. They introduce powerful functionality that, generally intentionally, wasn't implemented by default by the devs heavily disadvantaging anyone that's not using it forcing people into using them. 
---
And they're also using it because WoW devs didn't kill classic, playerbase utterly and completely obsessed with min-maxing and efficiency killed classic spirit and eventually gave us BFA. With modern Classic playerbase everyone is using game breaking addons to the detriment of the overall game.
---
When I'm tanking,the only Mana bar that matters is my healer.
---
I didn’t make the argument. You misread the usernames/messages.
---
I don’t agree with everything you’ve said but I’m glad you actually took the time to formulate the arguments.
---
1. This one is quite clearly true.
---
2. It doesn’t matter where or when those changes came. Whether it is through expacs or patches is irrelevant. They don’t want these things to be fixed because they want a static as close to vanilla version of wow as possible. Every “fix” takes it further from that point.
---
3. when people say this they don’t actually expect you to play retail. The idea is that classic is supposed to be as close as possible to original vanilla and stay that way. The addition of QOL improvements is the exact reason why people wanted this game released. If you want these QOL improvements then you are showing that you do not want what the game is supposed to be. You’re the wrong audience. You’re trying to “fix” that which isn’t broken with respect to the purpose behind the release
---
4. I really haven’t seen anyone say this at all. If you actually believe that people think changes = expacs I think you’re just not understanding what people are saying. They do not want to changes at all. Not because they come in the form of expacs but because they want the old vanilla not a vanilla shell with updated mechanisms.
---
FYI I’m not a “no changer” per se. You just seem to misunderstand what people want and where their arguments are coming from.
---
Also it’s the slippery slope fallacy not slippy. And idk what you’re trying to say at the end with BGs and straw man fallacy because what you’ve shown is not a straw man fallacy.
---
Thunder Bluff if Horde
---
I find that impossible to believe
---
Are you dense or did you intentionally misunderstand what I was asking about?
---
TipsOut did a Feral Druid deep-dive with Skarm that was super interesting to me. Skarm has tanked everything in Vanilla as a druid, and only recommends a warrior tank 2 bosses instead of a druid, due to it being needlessly more difficult.
---
All addons besides DPS meters and healing addons should be permanently banned.
---
I hear that greatly increases your resting XP gain though.
---
If you were deaf would you still consider gnomes annoying?
---
Some people also do the tactic of selling odd numbers to sell super expensive single items Need 12 bars ? Well why don't you buy my 11 and super expensive single bar, thanks !
---
What do you do for work?
---
From my point of view, I thought the past week was the most balanced the server has been since the honor system was released.
---
One problem that I think people will have is I don't think you can pull them one by one anymore. Correct me if I'm wrong but that update that Blizzard did to make mobs that pull as a group not separately reset makes doing one at a time not possible.
---
We split our 40 man raid into 2 Onyxia's every lockout, and have for roughly 2 months, and just got our first Vis'kag, period, yesterday.  
---
You're honestly a lot more mathematically positioned to go daggers.

Is this an american joke that I'm not getting ?

---
I'm 52 and like the versatility between pvp, solo questing and tanking dungeons like BRD. The 2 big things I like is the 7 points in the arms tree is great synergy with improved intercept and improved revenge. Also you get to use Deathwish+Last Stand together if you want. Concussion blow is more for pvp.
---
Are you me?
---
TBH my knowledge of Warcraft lore outside of how it relates to WoW is like almost non-existent. I played lots of WC2, but I never payed much mind to the story. Didnt get to play WC3 at all, although Im excited to try the redone version coming out. 
---
But yea, the hows and whys I cant answer. I just know they've said thats why the gate exists underwater there. Potential Dark Portal spot.
---
Yeah, I play both as well, and I think both have merits, they're different games and thats ok imo.
---
Well, someone now has to google "gnome dick size" and "goblin dick size" to find out who fits in a bronze tube. Also has to google the shape cause look at [this fucker](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_gizmo_pipe_01.jpg)
---
This shit is happening to me too -_-
---
Not really tried to make money from the AH very hard, but from fishing alone, you can sell all the greens you fish up straight to vendors and still make profit. Blackmouth is now a great seller on all servers for the sake of free action potions, but it used to go into water breath potions, even with shaman around to buff people.
---
Better yet..  if the horde are so much better at PvP than ally as Reddit would have you believe, why don't they meet the alliance raid head on, crush them, then move on to the boss to win the fight every match?
---
Oh... That's right, they aren't.  It's the same across the board and alliance has a slight mechanical advantage in the BG.
---
Additionally, BWL is actually when feral druids start to get good loot, so that's just wrong.
---
72 runs in and I've still not even seen the OH drop, let alone the main hand.

&gt; Short term=This works

The fuck are you on about? You can't literally say in the same post that the game is actually ruined for people and saying that it works short term in the same sentence, who is the one not thinking?
---
Insane 4.0 speed with HUGE top end damage and an fucking nutty Chance on hit proc. It's insane. A staff of jordan is a very very very very good alternative if you cannot get a PoD. SoJ is actually sick for warriors as well believe it not.
---
Near the MC guy seems to flip flop throughout the week as different raids go in and people are waiting. On tuesdays, it's usually horde controlled though
---
Disabled all addons, no improvement, others reporting the same. Irregardless we shouldnt be fine with addons pre-patch and shafted post patch
---
I like it. I can farm solo in my pve spec
---
Uh, I’m gonna our you on the block list because you sound like a dumb bitch. But, first, literally spend 5 seconds googling classic server size vs. actual vanilla. I have an excellent memory and, unlike you, I was an adult at the time. YOUR memory is the wrong one. Also you’re ignorant as fuck and didn’t even bother to read or look up something before dropping completely baseless accusations. In short, as above, a dumb bitch.
---
Btw the server cap in 2004-2007 era was less than 3000. Now it is over 10000.

stop giving away the horde's best kept secret

While I was waiting for my classic server to empty on launch I tried playing a level 1 mage and it felt like I could cast spells on GCF and not have to drink at all until Outlands. You have so much Mana and it comes back so so so fast.
---
Enhanced Berserker’s Stance, different from the one Warriors know. They take more damage in it than the regular one

Not at all reliable, my server shows: 80% alliance - 20% horde, when in practice it is the opposite

Because she loves him and wants to spend time with him? Lmao some people have no clue.

Haven't seen any update, but about 5 minutes ago on Pyrewood Village my ping went from 40-50 -&gt; 942ms :/ def not normal.
---
I'd think a geo is usually better. Gas mileage, cheap up front cost, cheap repairs, cheap insurance. There's only a tiny, limited number of situations where a ferrari would be better.
---
If we're getting into semantics though, the word is often used that way. The best tool for the job is the one that's most practical.
---
My life would’ve been the same. First time playing ever, saw how into it my boyfriend was and decided to give it a shot. Now I see how addicting it is.
---
Now I’m a weird opposite catfish. Play the game (&amp; try my best to type like a dude/not say I’m a girl). So I guess I would not be a catfish if it didn’t return.

No it isn't but they do have a turtle advantage

I agree, it's nice since we're students however every time we go to a dungeon me and my friend with similar names get asked if we're married lmao

But, as 'excuses to get out of a run' go, you have to admit that this one delivers.

i noticed that wow is using on board graphics instead of my gpu after the patch. maybe the same with you. i'm attempting to fix it atm but haven't come up with anything.
---
I don’t like having to corpse run to DM either even though I’m on the dominate faction, but I knew that was a risk. I can’t help it that most Horde on Herod are PVE minded and it’s hypocritical of me to hate on other Horde when I’m just trying to do a tribute run myself.
---
We may even agree on things we think could improve the game, but to make wise reaching changes based off of a few weeks of content before BGs, could do more harm in the long run. It gets a lot easier to start making more changes once you make a few.
---
Very long winded rant below (not aimed at you):
---
The whole situation regarding mega-servers is much more complicated though. 
---
I think most players remember servers where there was a small player base and only one or two raiding Guilds per faction, per server. My guild is rank 103 on my server. There’s almost 150 Guilds that have cleared Rag on Herod. I don’t think any of the OG Vanilla servers had that level of guild progress back in the day, not on Illidan, Magtheridon, Area 52 or Kil’Jaeden.
---
For Blizzard to reproduce this you’d have to drop servers to incredibly small, and potentially unstable levels with a lot more servers and a lot more to clean up and merge as those servers died off.
---
We all know Classic content thrives on having a critical mass of players, enough so you can run content from 1-60.
---
I think Blizzard wanted to consolidate the largest number of players into the smallest number of servers possible to retain that critical mass.
---
One, issue I never heard asked or answered pre-Classic launch, “what was Blizzard plans for dead servers?” That question never being answered is why I chose Herod and convinced my friends to stay through the long queues. I didn’t want a dead server in 6 months.
---
That brings me to my next point. Peak Horde login is around 4,000 on Herod with peak Alliance login at 2,000. It only took about 25 Alliance to lock down DM last week, that’s about 0.0125% of the Alliance population.
---
So let’s say worst case scenario for Alliance at BRM and you have 40 Horde at Burning Steppes entrance, 40 Horde at Searing Gorge entrance, 40 Horde at MC/BRD entrance and 40 Horde at BRS entrance. A total and complete lockdown by 120 players. That’s only 0.03% of the population taking control of BRM. I just said that there are nearly 150 Guilds that have cleared Rag and it only takes 4 of them to lock down BRM.
---
You’d have to cut server populations by 80% to see any real “balancing” in WPVP. Theoretically cutting Herod by 80% would still leave 30 Guilds to have cleared Rag. It would still only take 4 of them to hold BRM hostage.
---
Hell it only takes 20 Alliance to take control of the MC/BRD entrance thanks to Bubble and sapper-charges.
---
It was an absolutely spot on correction
---
for some stuff yeah, cant farm a lot of stuff that SM/ruin or sm/ds
---
The nochangers wanted the older version
---
You got your answer but I'm pretty sure it's not worth the farm
---
BRE is still a better over weapon than OEB even without the skill, in later raids.
---
Right now, there isn't that much on the field that BRE can stack it's armor debuff on due to armor debuffs already zeroing most mobs.
---
This will change though in later raids with BRE being able to strip armor that the debuffs could not get rid of.  Not to mention, in the mean time BRE is an absolute monster in PvP when facing chars wearing leather and up, and look at that... BGs just released.
---
What level are you to be finding it unplayable?
---
This, and it’s pretty much the same for all BGs.
---
Alliance premades &gt; horde premades &gt; horde pugs &gt; alliance pugs. 
---
Shamans are way more effective than paladins in AV when the alliance team isn’t coordinated (windfury the boss down), and enh&gt;ele shamans &gt; prot/ret paladins in BGs.
---
Everyone says this as if they have any clue about how a business is run and it makes you sound like an arrogant buffoon.
---
Addons were in Vanilla, they aren't going anywhere. Use them or don't, it doesn't matter to me.
---
You don't get to dictate how I play, though.
---
But that is my concern, does +hit do anything on mobs that are 2 levels or more lower than me, where can I see what it does
---
my computer is using it's on board gpu instead of my card. i'm assuming its the same for you guys.
---
zooming all the way in usually gets me what I need
---
Not everyone has time for 6 hour matches
---
I've forgotten. What are we talking about?
---
Look at it this way -&gt; most tanks beg DPS to wait a few seconds while they get aggro. By the time the DPS is done drinking, you have had your few seconds, and they can open fire at will.
---
If you know your healer and know you can handle a few seconds with no heals, you can pull while they are drinking as well. Don't do this with randoms though, as bad things are guaranteed to happen.
---
Yea via bootybaygazette
---
Yeah its fucking awful. I was looking forward to bgs the most. Just canceled my sub and it only took 2 AVs and 1 WSG. How anyone liked classic pvp is beyond me. No skill at all lol. Way too simple. Only thing good about pvp in this game is duels and world pvp that is even. Bgs are awful. They made them way better in later expansions.
---
Was hoping for a little snappier reply, but I'll attempt to moderate my expectations like your parents have learned to do.
---
Shadowburn doesnt have "causes a high amount of aggro" in its tooltip like Mind Blast does
---
This reply was unnecessary. It’s irrelevant how the group of people are classed, as it’s ‘players’; plural, it’s fewer.
---
If you've been getting your add-ons from Curseforge and dropping the folder in the old-fashioned way, Twitch will still recognize your add-ons and offer to update them for you. That was nice to discover.
---
Pretty much
---
WSG and AB will be all premades too, which i'm ok with because i do premades but i imagine a lot will complain about.
---
Atiesh horde!!
---
Ty.
---
isnt it relative though? unless more alliance than horde players stop playing after hype
---
For me, that’s a cost worth it. Time lost on commute is more worth than the Numbers in my bank account. To each their own
---
Is that because of the armour pen proc? Obviously you don't put sunders and faerie fire on all mobs in a cleave fight?
---
I also don’t know shit about the government yet I vote
---
A wife, girlfriend AND a Classic WoW toon? Talk about multitasking
---
And a cash shop, no thank you.
---
They do, but any dps going balls out will pull threat off of a tank. Dual wielding as fury/prot doesn’t magically give you unlimited aoe like a mage.
---
Oh well that clears it up, thank you for taking the time to explain.
---
oh okay, I apologize then
---
Gonna get whiplash hearing this all over again 15 years later. Without cross-server BGs, queues would be ludicrous, and both faction-imbalanced and low-pop servers would suck to play on even more. What else do you expect?
---
I remember back in the EQ days, we were grouping with a guy from Texas (we're Aussies) and he went AFK telling us he thought he had rattlesnakes in the wall cavity and he went to check it out.  He never came back.  We did get a little worried when he timed out.
---
That's why we use inner focus for the first cast =p
---
I'm level 88 and I literally can't get my mana below 90% without spamming spell steal, no matter what I cast. What did you cast to have to drink in Outlands?
---
Gnomes are my primary kill on sight target. I let all other lowbies go.

---
The downhill began at cataclysm
---
time to buy a AV wolf.
---
&gt; You don't get to dictate how I play, though.
---
But you get to dictate how I play, that's the entire problem. Because addons break the game you fundamentally change my experience and how I play, that's the entire problem. 
---
And player culture is completely different, addons were available in vanilla and almost no one used them. Now the player culture is obsessed with efficiency.
---
The first weekend of pservers were all zergs (same with the AV weekends after).  However you have the occasional run where a few alliance extra would 'turtle' on the bridge.  When Horde couldn't quickly kill boss, they would recall and wipe the alliance.  Then you could get a round that lasted maybe about an hour.  Definitely wasn't common though.  Everyone currently just wants fast rep and fast honor, so I would expect zergs.
---
Idk that sounds kinda... sus
---
Actually he referred to the vets and used pronouns such as "they", so he clearly was not including himself.
---
Bro we *do* know that.
---
Anyone with a fucking brain can tell you that from a purely business money making analytical standpoint Burning Crusade is hugely safe and guaranteed to be profitable where Classic Plus is hugely risky and not guaranteed to profit at all.
---
If you didnt give two fucks about nerds and were running a business youd go with Burning Crusade too.
---
That's wild
---
Point is there are shitty people on both sides, but for some reason so many people are so ready to accept that somehow Classic players are better behaved.
---
But once the grind is over, only then are you free to play the game.
---
the game is unplayable :}
---
Depends on what patch. It was not uncommon to have 5+ hour AVs when it first released.
---
&lt;Their rods and their staves, they comfort me.&gt;
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Nah, those people go for AB or WSG where smaller teams let them stomp harder with gear.
---
As a Horde in vanilla I always back capped snowfall.  
---
Welcome to hell boys.
---
Hey I think I just fixed mine. Go to system, advanced, and at the last drop down arrow there’s an option to select graphics card. Cranked everything back up to best setting and still running better than before
---
I remember 10-20 minute matches or 6 hour+ matches and very very few in between haha.
---
&gt;Their rods and their staves, they comfort me.&gt;

Im right youre wrong.
---
#dealnwithit
---
(...obvs /s i dont give a fuck play what version you like best which for my vote is classic.)
---
LOL imagine having the point of a post go so far above your head.
---
Point is that there are shitty people in both versions and neither version is inherently better/worse than the other, just different.
---
Do yourself a huge favor man. Cancel your sub, uninstall the game, and go outside.

If you're anything like me you start putting together a shopping list "for classic" and pretty soon youre just trying to build the most capable machine you can afford.

Heres the fix, go to advanced video settings, graphics card dropdown menu, and select your graphics card.

Yup. Grind quick exalted then I don't have to go back and can spend time in the actual fund BGs.
---
I have never met a C-level with that level of insight.
---
i posted the fix above
---
With pre mades and sometimes with mixed groups yes but there was those groups that liked to turtle and defend to get HKs over grinding out rep in 10 min runs all day.    It’s definitely more common today then in vanilla to have 10min AVs
---
Paladins are the strongest support class by far and excel in team PvP.
---
They are very boring and bad at solo play.
---
World mobs yes.. Dungeon and raid mechanics, it depends.  Essentially retail lets you chose how hard of content you want to do and get gear scaled accordingly.. 
---
Normal UBRS harder than normal/heroic 120 dungeons? Yes. 
---
Normal UBRS harder than Mythic 10 dungeon? No.
---
On 1 discord someone said something about Shammy TotemTimers working, but I'm unfamiliar with the addon.  I clarified saying Samy doesn't seems to be working, and he was quite adamant that this one is different.  I haven't spent much time looking, but haven't found it.
---
Bro invoking fallacies is useless unless they’re accurate.
---
This reply was unnecessary and it seems you don’t understand. It’s irrelevant how the group of people are classed. As it’s ‘players’, plural, it’s ‘fewer’. 
---
If it was something that couldn’t be counted, wasn’t plural, it would be less. For example ‘he seemed less sad’.
---
WTF are you talking about?  Nothing of the older versions would change today's meta for AV.  As long as you can still race past each other and achieve high honor gains by base rushing, no other gameplay is going to happen.  If I get 3k honor in 15 minutes from base rushing and 5k from an hour long slog, which do you think the majority of players will pick?
---
Unpopular opinion I guess, they’re both good. I enjoy the polished retail that Blizzard has perfected for 15 years but I appreciate the nostalgic and simplicity of classic.
---
AV groups was not a thing, only WSG has the option for pure premades.
---
There will be addons that will queue everyone at teh same time for AVs however, which might increase the chance of ending up in the same, but not guaranteed.
---
But AV premades is not a thing.
---
I'm guessing the addons will need an update to display the keyring.
---
As a priest healer, is there any reason I shouldn't bubble a paladin tank? Like naturally warriors and bears like getting hit to build rage, but paladins are mana-based. Do thorns-like abilities not proc if you're shielded?
---
Not a direct question to you, we just all seemed to be discussing tanking down here and I figured someone would know.
---
We know.
---
FYI, it is instant right now for Horde.
---
We'll see how the queue times change later tonight.
---
Never worked for a small company?
---
No u?
---
On the internet!? NO WAY!
---
 #Nochanges is a levee, you start poking holes in that levee, well intentioned or not, and you end up with a much different product, even if you think you are improving it.
---
At that point, why shouldn’t I just go back to private servers to get the game I wanted from Blizzard?
---
Classic is a specific game with a specific audience. I hated seeing retail warped by players who seemingly hated playing the game and hated playing an MMO, so they kept petitioning Blizzard to cater to the solo-anti-social player. So now Retail exists in this area where 95% of its content is aimed at players who apparently can’t be bothered to play the game with a brain and ultra hardcores who only play the game 18 hours a day. There is virtually no balance to the game these days and the last aspects I enjoyed died with BfA.
---
Well to be fair 7/10 times an UBRS run is only intended to go to Rend but I hear you
---
Racing past each other was a little more difficult with all the mine fields in the old version of AV. If you even slightly strayed off the path you'd get blown up.
---
Most of us adults do. And then we laugh at them when they’re not looking. 
---
“OMEGALUL”
---
You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Sorry I was referring to solo play. As dungeon dps, you are correct. Otherwise, I would disagree. If you're just questing, and you want to fight 2 mobs at once, you're just hurting your survivability if you stay in berserker stance longer than necessary. If WW is on CD, you're better off in battle stance until it's back up again.
---
I'm getting 2-3 minute queues right now so...

Same boat.  Didn't go on a vacation this year and didn't get sick (pretty lucky), use it or lose it.  My last day this year was Friday.

Can you give me an example?

+RFC, lowest dungeon in game in Org.
---
&gt; Shield is actually good despite having +int on it. Lots of armor and block.
---
Oh its got fantastic stats its just looks like trash from SFK.
---
Did you bring back snacks? :D
---
"end" being the key word here. Game isn't even a year old.
---
I cant imagine wanting to play this game over hanging out with any close people, unless I really want space.
---
Is classic wow *so* good?
---
I play classic wow to fill the space between fun. My own battle is being distracted by fun games when there's less fun work that should get done.
---
I'd say gnome is the most worth it for their godlike pvp racial
---
It’s totally not bad, I’m on incendius which is basically even horde/ally and it’s so fun actually playing for more than just 15 year old gear but struggling at war with the other faction like the game was truly intended IMO.  Sucks that some people rolled on imbalanced servers.  Rerolled from PVE, never looking back!
---
Elvui is toast atm.
---
That's completely false. They started character creation with that number of servers. By launch there were dozens more.
---
I am happy to hear that Census is back on the menu and I've already reinstalled it. 
---
However IMHO a much faster way to check only the faction balance is: scaning the AH with an AddOn like TradeSkillMaster.
---
So i.e. if one faction has 20K active auctions and the other one 10K only, the realm is for sure heavily unbalanced. 
---
I used to crosscheck both - auctions and Census (before it was broken) -  and the results were almost matching.
---
Of course, Census gives you a much deeper insight of the realm population, so I will again use it.
---
Bruh give it at least 24 hrs before you jump on that high horse.

Let them have long ass queue times, That’s the trade off of being dominate and having a lot more advantages over ally :/

Do you have any 3d portraits on?

We aren't getting things that were "a part of the vast majority of vanilla".  You want them to leave out Nax because it wasn't there for "the vast majority of vanilla"?
---
Wait till they find out about the portal room xD
---
There are hundreds of replenished mines that blow up for 3k, and mine layer elite minibosses that relay the mines so you cant suicide with front 10 people to get the rest in.  It created real chokes at TP and IWB, where a couple players could stop a raid
---
&gt; -same subreddit filled with posts about how bad phase 2 is
---
It's a different kind of bad.
---
Phase two on a populated world is like being punched in the face every ten minutes, playing retail is like finding out somebody tried to make a dog-lizard hybrid with your family pet using only a machete and a sowing needle.
---
0 to do w/addons, disable them all, same issue. Also there is 10+ other threads discussing this, feel free to contribute to them instead of starting your own.
---
Ah yes. Moldy food all over your desk is just letting a room get dirty. 
---
I forgot I was in the classic WoW sub. Different standards I guess. 
---
You're problem is that you think you can only compare the most extreme of 2 people. 
---
Stop letting fanboy logic cloud your judgement. 
---
Ive been subbed to asmon for over a year and have no problems saying he isn't a great person.
---
We had cross-realm bgs in vanilla too and it wasn't the death of community.
---
I have two 60s and a third is 30.  Many in my guild have two 60s or at least a 2nd high lvl.
---
same
---
They should increase combat log range in instanced content. After the nerf I was like "oh shit i'm top DPS on Rag", then realized I was out of range from my guildies
---
I been playing both (just returned to retail after a 9 year absense) and honestly, playing with old friends and doing the newer content has been fun.  The classes are a lot more interesting to play than they are in classic. 
---
Level cap is pretty quick to get to if you just do the current Alterac Valley event. 
---
There's also an in game guild recruitment now so finding a guild isn't super bad.
---
I was reading here last week about a German player referring to what we call turtling as zerging. Likely just regional confusion here.
---
As long as it says "Alliance wins" at the top then yeah, it's pretty accurate.
---
A few thoughts on your post:
---
1. I totally agree about how you say Classic is more like life than retail. Your progress can spike when you get lucky but also through dedication, which is fun. You aren’t just rewarded for showing up. That’s life.
---
2. I did an r13 grind back in Vanilla and it was hell. But like you mentioned it was about the journey and the accomplishment itself was more rewarding than any of the gear I got. I will never forget the day I logged in to see I achieved my goal. I would pick achieving r13 as a turning point in my life - it taught me that anything is possible with perseverance, dedication and commitment to your goal. I was unfocused prior to r13 and after I learned and put into practice the lessons it taught me, I enjoyed a lot of success in my personal life. I still reflect on this achievement as my greatest achievement (and I’ve since graduated from an Ivy League law school and was the first in my family to earn a college degree).
---
3. Separately, and perhaps an unpopular opinion, Classic is more like a capitalist system and retail is more like a communist one. People don’t like retail because the incentives to achieve big things are all gone - just log in and do your weeklys and you’ll be given the same things as everyone else. Not for me. I’m a casual these days and my rank grinding is over (currently r1), but I still like knowing that if I choose to take some vacation time and just go crazy on Classic I can significantly advance my character to be more powerful than others. 
---
Discuss.
---
Addiction is a real thing !!
---
Skip to the max lvl. I literally only bothered getting the LBRS wolf cuz he has bite and howl. Don't need anything else.
---
I think more people are using the addon again
---
I agree with most of this except the packs of 60’s.
---
I’m not in a large guild, most weeks we clear MC with 35 ppl, but running around in 15-20m raids hunting down and hopefully looking for opposing raids is a lot of fun out in EPL, or WS.
---
Killing a small 5 man group running to Strat can bring a rival raid to you.
---
Or helping a smaller raid of Horde vs a larger raid of Alliance and collapsing on them to win out.
---
You want as much mp5 as you need to make it to the end of a fight.
---
Imo crescent staff is the singular most valuable weapon in vanilla.
---
No other weapon in the game is as valuable to as many classes as it, as powerful relative to other items of its level, as easy to get, and lasts you for as long.
---
AV used to drop loot like this back in the day.  I thought it was removed a long ass time ago though.
---
That's why I went Mograine at launch
---
By AQ40 Warriors are all plate.
---
Pallies are still largely in leather and cloth.
---
The Horde are still at work.
---
Another limitation of the site is that it does not provide a clear way to compare two-hand weapons vs one-hand + off-hand, so you'll have to look at those options more carefully, but other than that it's an amazing site. Great way to see what's an upgrade even if it's not bis.
---
Wait really? that sucks! Download friendsinfo add on right now. You can right click on people and add notes to them. I have a list full of such shitters. There is always some one that whispers you on your next runs 1000%.  You invite them and when you have a full raid you  embarrass them  by telling something like „uhhh wasn’t you the one that left ubrs run last week?“ n then you kick them.
---
Oh hey look, another long winded post that nobody wanted,  talking about the same stupid shit
---
Addons have to be updated for changes in game code. Addons can absolutely cause problems after updates, hence why they update the addons. However, if you're still having issues after the addons have been disabled, then yea, something's f\*cked. Hope it gets resolved :)
---
Can you give a little more info on what broke?
---
You, you aren’t thinking. The game isn’t ruined for Horde because of what Blizzard did. The population drop ruined it, sorry. If your enjoyment of the game is solely based around camping a tiny minority of players, and is “destroyed” by allowing them to finally play the game again, you’re an entitled, sadistic man-baby.
---
The game was unplayable for Alliance, it is still very playable for Horde, minus one aspect. How do you not get that being playable is better than being literally unplayable? They fix now allows EVERYONE to play, while they address it long term, yet I should be outraged that little shits can’t no-life grief people in groups. Oh, how sad...
---
The thing with classic is that yes you basically are set to a specific route and build with little variation if you wanna be the best. But classics tree just feels so much more rewarding. I'm still only level 35. But to me the journey is the game in classic and I spend more time initiating and finding same level PvP skirmishes or 1v1s and crafting. I average a few levels per week(maybe) and immensely enjoy it, whereas in retail I get booted straight to 120 and then have to sit in a queue or run LFR etc and that just doesnt suffice.
---
My poor, sweet summer child.
---
How immature do you have to be to care that much about how someone expresses emotion over text lmao.
---
Thanks this worked!!!!!!!!
---
I will start calling them coffee keys from now on, thanks.
---
No?  changes to the UI (key ring) and LUA will fuck most addons.  you always have to update addons after a patch
---
Yeah plugger can be soloed at like 54 with some good LoSing. Having reasonable gear should allow you to kill him every time.
---
Maybe if the honor gain from losing was a pitiful small amount then people would not want to lose.
---
I have a mystery week off after Christmas and before April. Who knows when it happens?
---
I work in retail where they expect you to make holiday plans over 10 months in advance but hate time being booked off before 6 weeks and it's highly competitive. It's one of those "I tried hard but you made it hard. Have fun legally compelled to work out where my spare annual leave goes."
---
Yes, but if you're not a healer, you will be harassed. Nearly the entire playerbase acts like they're tryhards when raiding.
---
AV is retail Zerg fest for maximum honor , all of my wins have been sub 10 mins.
---
No one said we were expecting it to be uninterrupted ... there is a big difference between uninterrupted and "not able to do it at all".
---
Everyone can act now like they had 20/20 hindsight but no one looked at the phase calendar and was able to predict every way this game was going to play out.  That's a min/max mentality that players when choosing to roll PvE or PvP were going to study the phase rollout and make vast predictions to inform their decision.  Most just said "Eh, yeah I was still able to get stuff done in Vanilla on a PVP server so let's do it".
---
I'm not upset I rolled on a PVP server and it was still the right choice - I just wish it was not as anti-progress as it is right now.
---
I think the takeaway is that maybe WoW as a whole contains a lot of shitters, probably because it has a lot of players, because classic is full of zoomer and "Never go full retail" memes as well. 
---
There's always going to be people that take other peoples personal preference as some type of personal attack because they're afraid maybe they made the wrong choice...when in reality, there isn't a wrong choice if you just play what you want to play.
---
[look at all the peepo ](https://i.imgur.com/QShxZAj.jpg)
---
According to ironforge.pro it is about 50/50 but it feels Horde heavy
---
AV premades were done through on addon that queued everyone simultaneously. I think it was deliberately broken at some stage though.
---
Can I have a TLDR for the TLDR
---
AV was a world PVP zone in an instance.  You didn't need to be there for the whole game.  You just entered when you wanted, helped as long as you could, and left.  No one had any problems with people leaving AV.  You didn't feel shitty because you left.  You went to be part of a huge war.
---
\#getoffmylawn
---
I’ve had a ton of even and rewarding PvP encounters, I think you’re just taking a lot of complaints by the vocal minority in this sub to heart or using your own experiences and are biased.  If you’ve only played on your server it’s hard to say how everyone else experiences it.
---
It was only a joke haha. You think I'd play retail for 60 levels?
---
No they didn't.
---
15 years ago and it still works. It's a quality game.
---
" Its a video game, no one is gonna suck your dick for your fine tastes in 1's and 0's. "
---
Not sure what point you're trying to make. Blizzard did a great job with this one.
---
I actually haven't had this happen to me yet. Even if it did, there are so many people in this game compared to vanilla that you just find someone else. Blacklisting is also nice and works well.
---
Congrats he padded on the dogs. Mage did more ST to Golemagg.
---
About  350-400 rep for losing. Per game
---
If you're going to bring a token shadow don't bring the moron.  There are many that aren't this stupid.
---
Idk they are both preeettttyyyy dumb looking here
---
the keyring is bag -2? Then which one is -1?
---
1.5 AV or 1.12 AV doesn't matter. This is what happens when you take a PvE BG balanced around a mix of lvl 51s to 60s and you do it with full lvl 60s in raid gear. Who needs to do the lvl 54 PvE sidequests? Your average modern player is not casual enough to make it work properly anymore.
---
Server hasn't been up an hour and people are already bitching.
---
I get it... I am fine with 1v1 and even 2v1 - current state of world PVP however is 10+ and even 20+ member gank squads.  Unless you just luckily happen on a group of the same size every encounter is just a ROFLSTOMP which isn't fun to me at all.
---
If you are the minority you get smoked before you can even get out of CC half the time and if you are in the large group you get one or two attacks off tops before the target dies.  No strategy needed - just a pure numbers game.
---
Cross-realm BGs are an excuse to avoid addressing all the issues you just mentioned.
---
We should've had realm-specific BGs *at least for a little while* because it really does build community even if you don't want to admit it.
---
I would try to change as few things as possible, like one or two spells/talents per class. For example for priests, I'd increase the % shadow damage talent and the coefficient of swpain. Just little things that don't affect leveling or other specs.
---
What do you think they'll do to bring back alliance players after they were bullied into quitting?
---
unlucky
---
I will check it out when I log on next then
---
&gt;It's actually better that bots aren't banned instantly because if they were then the makers of said bots would easily work out what they did that was causing detection.
---
Yes, that's better in the case of bots being banned by automated detection. But waiting to ban bots based on player reports serves no purpose. There's nothing to "work out what caused detection" there.
---
In Germany zerging has always been to just constantly battle other players instead of going for objectives. Not trying to get flags in wsg was also always called zerging.
---
Jump runs in dme?
---
Yes, this is the shitty 1.12 AV that we get that we've been bitching about for months.
---
Not sure what private servers have to do with anything.
---
I agree with you. Both have their merits that make them good games  and both have issues that weigh them down. Personally, retail's biggest problem is that its BfA and the BfA systems like Azerite and Essences are not fun to play with.
---
Did you know when you go to the store when you're off work, those employees are actually working at that time? Super weird concept. Some people even work on the weekends! How horrifying!
---
Lol omfg
---
hahahahah
---
Wouldn't be so bad if other game updates weren't later in the week.
---
They're not an excuse, they are the answer. Community doesn't mean anything if you can't play the game.
---
Wanna know how we can tell it doesn't work? Because bots exist. If it worked botting wouldn't be profitable and if it wasn't profitable people would stop botting. Blizzard has been fighting bots forever and the only thing that worked well was when they started selling gold in the form of wow tokens.
---
Could you share some of your statistics? especially big servers like Firemaw/Gehennas
---
They need a few gates, where you need to kill a certain number of NPCs to pass
---
It was awesome.  Stop implying anyone who disagrees with you is ignorant.
---
As 60 with like 1/2 pre raid BiS, I just wait for ghim to cast shadowbolt, get combo points ten LOS him. I hide when he casts immolate or else im in trouble
---
I think this is what I needed to hear.    Now I need to pick a server.   I'm a long time vet, was in wow first beta, was in classic beta.    Don't have any really real raid experience aside from doing them myself years later to try and get mounts
---
I'm not worth it, seriously.
---
As a bear spec druid I feel this big time.  I am mostly BIS for bear tanking, and showed up to every raid and always tried to contribute.  We have two prot warriors who are the main tanks for MC, but there are several fights where several tanks are needed, so I would get called on to pick up a core hound, or an add on Garr.  The problem arose when the guild started calling on fury specced DPS warriors to "throw on a shield" and tank something before they called on me.  I spoke to the raid leader about it, and ended up convincing him to call on me first to do the thing I am supposed to do.
---
Now I tank Onyxia phase one for our main raid, and am essentially the first off-tank.  It took some work to show people in the guild that they shouldn't be afraid of a bear tanking, and I get to do the thing.
---
I'd say have a discussion about it with them if it's at all possible.  If you can nail down the FR gear and get the rest of your kit filled out, it's possible you could be called on to main tank a second raid, which is my hope.
---
there was a charm to afking out and entering the same AV a day later, id have to wait 2+ hrs in queue to get into a game 
---
before the meta set in, my vanilla server used to organize rep turn ins where everyone would turn in their assorted horde body parts for rep all in one game. is think the rep from turn ins were raid wide?
---
You can get to outlands in 6-7 hours just solo questing if you play efficiently, so I didn't think it was too farfetched.
---
R14 and cleared Naxx on the first day too I'll bet.
---
Alternatively, turn on friendly nameplates (I believe default is shift-v) and then you can right click on the battlemaster's nameplate.
---
"stabthesnitches" snitching on people...so do I stab you?
---
If the game is dead please go ahead and quit. The community will be better off without this type of bitching.
---
Those issues exist because of the nature of the game, and the way it was implemented. I don't believe they are fixable without significantly altering the game in a way that is not going to happen.
---
Truthfully I don't think it would build community. You are surely entitled to your opinion. I just don't see how it would help anybody.
---
Oh hey look, another short hand comment that nobody asked for.
---
This is a lot of WoW players for some reason. You'll say "LFM Rend run, have Jed ID, need tank" and you'll get a Mage asking you if you have a Jed ID and if you're going to Drakkisath before asking for an invite despite you only needing a tank.
---
FAKE NEWS
---
Not everyone enjoys 10min base races mandatory to get BiS gear either. Silly argument there mate. I for one dont believe this is what people were hyped for
---
Changing ranks does not seem something possible since they are tied to good items, but i'd atleast like a real matchmaking Q to get interesting BGs, but I guess it clearly wasnt the aim of their matchmaking. 
---
I'm honestly fine with it, my only fear is that i'll never care about pvp when it's supported by such bad systems.
---
TSM. Cannot open AH or Profession Craft Menus.
---
what you don't like the PvE with extra steps version of AV?   
---
cuz i don't either
---
Hate to break it to you but people are individuals
---
Agree to disagree. FL was the worst boss of Ulduar but I didn't actually dislike it. Only demos mattered for the most part except when you needed to interrupt steam vents. Being in a bike meant you were afk.
---
there is no more community, it died today
---
Bruh, I even bolded the sentence for you... " **There is just more Horde level 60s than there are Alliance overall, which means that if both sides queued on similar rates, the Horde will have a significantly longer queue than Alliance. By how much? I don't know.** "
---
The point is there are very few servers that are alliance-dominated, and those that are don't have the same magnitude of people playing as horde-dominated PVP servers in general. That means that even if they ignore PVE and PVP tags, there are significantly more horde players in the entire classic realm, which would lead to longer queue times..
---
Yep. Think of it as a day care for the tryhards so the rest of us can play in the world
---
Nah, the community is fine. But please, go ahead and quit.
---
I never trust sarcastic posts like these.
---
&gt; nightfall bot
---
the only reason I ever got to join the first string raid as ret back in the day
---
(once they nerfed OOC rezing)
---
Swatter literally breaks my inventory when I move an item in combat - had to uninstall Auctionator/Auctioneer because of it.
---
(This has been happening since release of Classic).
---
If you had made friends in your own realm to play with, they’d be in there with you!
---
You can easily delay the game by getting your team to turtle. Takes both teams to do a baserace
---
Sure, they give a lot of really underserved epics nowadays but the best gear is still from Mythic Raiding.
---
If you want the game to last longer then cap snowfall gy.
---
Unless you have stats of how many concurrent AVs are going on at the same time your logic in the game being dead just because you don't see people from your server is a bit half-baked.
---
Sounds like you might just be looking for a reason to leave or quit... bye.
---
Devs are working on it like right now :)  [https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic/commits/development](https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic/commits/development)
---
Download dev build if you want it fixed right away.
---
Where'd ya get that judgement robe? That shit is DOPE.
---
Are you trying to argue that early AV wasn't significantly longer than the newer version in the later patches? It was extremely common to sit in queue for AV for several hours, have it pop, go play for a couple hours, leave for raid, then rejoin the same AV after raid. They lasted for a long time.
---
Gotta go fast.
---
Polyamory problems!  Mfw my gf plays wow but the wife doesn't
---
that can be done on retail too.  not the same thing at all.
---
Not going to lie the pvp faction rep items are fantastic.
---
OEB is the bis 2h for PVE
---
Maybe 1.12 vanilla wow but early AV took hours or even days to complete.
---
It's "regardless"
---
Yes, every private server player expected this when they unfortunately announced 1.12 AV.  The biggest culprit is no mine layer, there used to be hundreds of mines across the run through the enemy faction territory that blew up for 3k.  They were replenished by a respawning miniboss called the Mine Layer.  These mines were literally everywhere except on the road, forcing people into tight chokes that allowed a group of 5 players to literally hold a raid back, along with forcing people to deal with not just the elite mine layer, but all of the elite lieutenants that were around the mine layer.  In a perfect AV premade, you could still 15 minute games, but it was much, much harder on private servers than here.  Mostly because the randos would try to run straight south, and all get blown up every time.
---
Forcing people on the roads chokes forced fights next to towers, where the archers actually did appreciable damage.  A notable point was Tower Point, where it is super hard to break through if there is an opposition of even just 10 horde.  This also promoted turning in armor scraps, and the 3rd rank archers would whop players.
---
&gt; Because... I don't live in the US
---
Thank God.  Your whining is incessant.
---
More like 3 hours
---
Fair enough. Get that spell power and rock your saber! Worst case its not going to change the glow at all, but you get some decent stats making it more reasonable than using it without any enchant.
---
*laughs in Radeon*
---
sorry you're not on my server, xrealm battlegrounds not xrealm trading
---
He was actually my healing partner for a couple weeks while we got everyone more gear but right now we 8 heal MC so he can be ret
---
Just from a pure numbers point of view you’re redundant. 40 raid slots, 3 maybe 4 tanks needed at best? You’re better off spec’ing DPS and rolling on tank gear that gets passed up by the current tanks. At some point your guild will need another tank either due to attrition or absence and the best thing you can do if you like your guild is be ready for that time.
---
&gt; private servers were creating a product that people thoroughly enjoyed.
---
They didn't create anything. They just poorly copied what Blizzard created.
---
OP, you probably need to edit your post. Just because it’s a large sample doesn’t make it statistically valid for purposes of estimating server population metrics. The samples that users take with this addon, are, by definition, biased.
---
Vanilla BGs have always been cross realm.
---
Play AV all day, go to sleep, wake up, rejoin the same AV still raging.
---
How can you? Last time I played seriously was in MoP. A little bit of Legion and WoD. No BfA, didn't get to max level even.
---
Coming back to Retail from Classic I'm now lost most of the time. None of the spells make any fucking sense. They even sound and look different, which buggers me a bit. What's up with these weird caster animations? Why are there weird melee animations that look like they were taken from some F2P asian game? Why isn't anyone talking (not to be mistaken for trash talking, I've seen plenty of that). How is it fun to pull 20 mobs and not be in any danger of dying?
---
Nothing feels right in Retail :-(
---
It's still worth it for some simple QoL, you just won't see the potential fully recognized until you max out furor and go full powershift kitty.
---
You guys heal gnomes?
---
I use it because I want easy management for KOS. I never cared about the automatic detection.
---
I saw the Edit, but yeah for sure as Horde do 2H now.
---
no they were not.
---
Same.  It's funny to hear everyone bitch in chat when you cap it too.
---
The problem is that if you do objectives and the other team doesn't, they win. 
---
Game should be over before any tower caps anyway.
---
I bet you're super fun at parties.
---
Hoping it comes back...but AV doesn't seem too great either... rip
---
I thought about trying the current game.
---
I thought about it.
---
Ally confirmed.
---
it's been 15 years since the game has had realm-based communities, it's understandable you don't know what that means
---
probably sex?
---
I agree except when you  say they have perfected the game for 15 years... they have made plenty of mistakes in the past few years which have been far worse features than what weve ever had in the game.
---
They openly admitted that flying was a mistake and they also referred to Legion legendaries being badly designed in terms of acquisition methods (which pretty much everyone agrees with) along with how the AP-system turned out. Both were good on paper but horrible in reality and didnt make the game better in the least.... legendaries made too big of a difference if  you got a good one versus a bad one and AP-grind ended up being worse grind than anything weve had in the game so far, as a raider the meta would require you to login everyday to do every world quest and daily dungeon for AP to be able to keep up with others or be left behind and become a liability in raids for not being as powerful. (its why i quit... it felt more like a job doing chores just to be able to raid, instead of doing what i want and show up and be prepared for raids as a scheduled group event. AP-grind felt like neverending preparation.)  
---
Otherwise the game sure is "perfected" in many ways.... theres significant amount of content to choose from and do, aswell as many different classes and races to pick from. Lots of cool armor you can get  for transmogs and really look the way you want to.
---
Purchasing lots of eu4 dlcs. At last,i can play current version of the game.
---
Well give it time, blizzard is a company, if they can see a profit to make it, they will
---
LOL.... literally a few hours in and calling for change.  This community sometimes...
---
You're a mage? Just defend at stoneheart pass or iceblood, depending on which side you play.
---
I’m not pretending.  The anonymous disrespect that’a all too common online really isn’t helping anyone at all .   Thank you for saying please, btw.
---
And the other guy clearly doesn't lol
---
Wow classic pvp is not for everyone.
---
Except that isn't true and both Ally and Horde can get it...
---
No, this is how AV is on this version of WoW. This is not temporary, this so how people play the game. There aren’t going to be 3 day AV’s in Classic.
---
Pretty sure the keyring is only for keys that aren't consumed on use
---
Drat!
---
As a casual with little hope of getting Naxx gear... Yea you can leave it out its ok with me haha.
---
I agree.  Which is why I'm rank 2 (or 3, haven't checked yet).  I'm just enjoying the ride and playing how I want.  I'm going to grind rep for AV but not honor until I have time to push to R10/11.
---
As a healer, I have a feeling, the game will play out very similarly, whether it's a zerg fest to the captain or skirmishes with players.  Just heal the guy with the lowest health and try to remain protected by your allies.
---
So go attack the opposition, nothing is stopping you.  you might even get free reign if they try and ignore you and focus the boss.
---
&gt;piece of shit game
---
Its not the game its the players, and that definitely includes you.
---
Since really drilling into people to stop ANY dots at around 45% we haven't really had this issue anymore.
---
Oh god, I forgot about premade steam rolls. 
---
Oh god.
---
It's gonna piss some people off haha, but it's crossrealm so who cares what those guys from the other servers think ;)
---
Same rule applies since you should already be taking that mana into account. With questions like these though it's more about risk management. How much faith do you have in your raid for things to go right? Low faith, get more regen.
---
I zoom in all the way, and walk inside him.
---
If you are horde just cap snowfall gy.
---
You must not pug high level stuff or solo quest often.
---
"guys just keep waiting, it'll get better eventually" - everyone 3 months ago
---
Can you imagine if this guy's girlfriend ever saw this? It would feel really shitty to see that your boyfriend considers playing a video game for 8 hours straight to be more important than spending any amount of time with you. And he even says "I'd rather be alone than stop playing WoW", so why are you even in a relationship then? I bet he's just waiting around for his girlfriend to break up with him so he can be like "SHE WAS TOO CLINGY AND WOULDN'T LET ME PLAY VIDEO GAMES" and completely blame her for it.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8xs9h/psa_having_trouble_entering_bgs_because_of_addon/). 
---
Oh no, we can definitely call them failures.
---
The problem with the twitch client is you have to use the EXACT name of the addon or it won't find it.
---
“But I don’t like and I need to tell you all! Wow classic is bad, change so I like it....”
---
As I said before, classic is not for everyone.
---
classic wow IS dead.  go check out the world, it's completely empty everywhere.
---
now there's retail 1.12 in its place, grinding 3 minute AVs with a bunch of randoms.
---
Looks like an ally win? Yea, 95% win rate
---
How depressing.
---
40 druids for all the druid loot
---
Given the nature of WPVP and class balance it's nearly impossible tho. As i said i doubt it's possible to salvage ranks but they can probably give us a better matchmaking without too much effort.
---
Wooosh!
---
I carry a sledgehammer on my KEYring.
---
Lately, the healers have been complaining about hunters pulling aggro with Aimed Shot at the start of fights.
---
All rogues know is sinister strike costs 45 energy and paydays friday
---
Well done.
---
Drink alcohol and you won't care
---
I don't think we can make this claim with a ton of confidence. We have no idea if armor values are going to continue to scale higher as raid content progresses. As it stands there are 3 armor values in MC: 3009, 3732, and ~4650. Gehennas, Lucifron and Shaz have 3009 armor. Faerie Fire, Curse of Recklessness and Sunder is 3,405 worth of armor reduction alone, crystal yield is another 200 and Annihilator can get you up to 600.
---
This means serious guilds can easily get paladin and mage class bosses down to 0 armor and the tankiest bosses down to 400ish armor (keeping three stacks of Annihilator up is admittedly tough). Either way BRE is likely only gaining benefit on its first stack of debuff against the absolute tankiest of bosses. OEB may be better through all content for non-humans. This is especially true for horde side where a much larger % of your damage is from white swings due to windfury.
---
You basically have to read OEB as if it has these two effects.
---
-3% chance to hit.
---
Passive: Causes 40% of white swings to do 30% reduced damage.
---
Damn I mean this happens on my server too but it just trades off between factions so no one is really to blame or is excessively ganking...  allies will occasionally be in org killing people at the auction house I mean it’s all part of the game 😭
---
&gt;it shows the world that when we (the consumer) demand something, we’re just children who can’t be trusted to know what they want.
---
Fucking hit the nail on the head right here. This community will bitch incessantly about literally anything. There is absolutely no way to please them.
---
This is a persisting misconception.  Blaumeux is not balanced, it's about 60:40 H:A.
---
Not to mention most all guards will not only tell you where to go, but will mark the map too!
---
This screenshot is either staged, or these two are utterly braindead
---
I don't really remember 8 minute AVs.
---
In 1.12 on vanilla is was more like 20-40 minute matches in my experience.
---
But yeah I guess add today's culture to that and the fact people now know how to win and don't just derp fight in empty space and you get 8 minute matches.
---
Of course this person is horde
---
just wanted to say your three comments have gave me a good laugh and cheered my day up, genuinely thank you for the laugh!
---
Vanilla WoW happened on your server
---
Yes.  Before the race, when it felt like a war, it was a lot of fun.
---
I have a bottle opener on it.
---
Very bad
---
agghhhhh oooahhhh
---
Lol, they’re not that long. On average they last an hour. An hour of some of the most intense back and forth fighting you’ll encounter, if teams are mostly balanced.
---
You people that zerg are missing a ton of fun, and playing the game like it’s a spreadsheet. Classic is forever, why do people act like it’s ending next week?
---
I'm going to force turtles every chance I get.
---
this guy clicks
---
How did you make the money? currently sat at 200g with a 60% mount...
---
Meta changed after 15 years.
---
You can also like classic AND BfA, but still prefer one over the other! Imagine that!
---
The API changes have broke totem dismissing addons as well. Macro doesn't even work. Good while it lasted I guess.
---
That's my point.  It's not a game changer when everyone has it.
---
Are you Horde or Alliance?
---
BLIZZARD WE NEED BGS
---
BLIZZARD BGS NEED TO CHANGE
---
If you really want to spice things up find your favorite plunger and some lube while u afk.
---
No you're just misrembering wrong
---
if you're looking to optimize, then IMO you should take all of those points from enhancement and put them in elemental and play an Ele-resto spec.  Are you planning to be a worse feral druid as a flag carrier with this build?
---
Classic wow is only dead to the absolute worst parts of the community (aka you) who were ALWAYS going to find a reason to declare it dead. 
---
Just quit and be quiet. Unsubscribe from the game and the sub, and go play another game you can claim is dead in a few months.
---
Good job community/hardcore players xD
---
If you want to be a twink worth anything it's like 400g on my server. I guess a non 60 could get that but...to each their own.
---
Isn't it great?
---
Dark runes/major mana potions exists?
---
We’ve known what version we would get before classic even released mate
---
Horde one pls
---
I don't think that works the way you think it does....your post just makes you look like you don't know what you are talking about.
---
unlikely
---
No? She likes spending time close to each other. She spends plenty of time alone, but I also know that that is what she likes and appreciates (her "love language" I think is what it would be called), so I spend some time close to her. 
---
It isn't an inconvenience to me. It's part of being in a relationship: give and take, compromise, and communication.
---
Incredible, I feel like it’s even worse this time around. In the original 1.12 AV you still had a lot of people that didn’t know Zerg rush was the best strategy or just used to the old way of doing things so it at least still lasted a bit longer as people were off doing random things.
---
Have to go my dog is on fire
---
I would have played more osrs.
---
I would sleep earlier.
---
Probably drink less but maybe not. (Its too easy to stay up late with a beer and wow. With other games I get bored and tired go to bed.)
---
Trying to cut back on all the above.
---
Lolno. Anyone who says AV was always a race came to the party late. Bunch of weebs.
---
Yeah. It's tiresome. Thanks for reading the whole thing btw
---
Alliance
---
Yes, anything that is BoE.
---
I bounced on my boys dick to this comment.
---
I'd drop the 8 points that boost healing wave and put them in 10% +healing and 3% mana reduc. LHW and occasionally chain heal is the way to pvp heal.
---
ele resto is better
---
I guess I'd just find it more fun showing progress on a character, but if you're having more fun with the twink on twink fights more power to you! No judgement here.
---
Hi, /u/NothernMini

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8xumy/is_this_av_some_kind_of_sick_joke/). 
---
FACTION CHANGE, i regret being horde i want to be ally, but refuse to leave my 35 days /played character behind
---
It's really scummy to enter into a relationship with someone just for sex. Casual sex is a thing that women will agree to without you needing to trick them into thinking you care about them and want a relationship with them.
---
"So I started blasting" Meme fused with the joke that lonely guys only ever finish in a sock. 
---
Not exactly sure where the sock thing started, but I do know leaving a sock in the door is/was a sign of "do not disturb, getting laid" in dorms in America. 
---
I didn't find it funny, but felt I would try to explain.
---
No it's not. Only people who came late to the party say this.
---
Could of at least changed the pic to say "Maintenance" instead of "DDoS Attacks" :(
---
Believe it or not it was 2 dudes that both said this at the same time. Then im pretty sure they alt+f4ed the game
---
I'm not, no. Being from a first world country I studied something useful. But since you're such a polite fellow I'd love to hear how I failed so that I can improve in the future.
---
&gt;If you want to look through a database for an extended period of time then yes they do need to be down to ban
---
...
---
Play a lot.
---
No mercy!
---
Are you talking about the 5 minute AV Matches?
---
I can help you with some answers: That totally depends on the job. I did not have any experience working as an developer but I could show to something I had made and I had to use shitloads of time to learn it. Was a small startup company and they tend to be more chill. Also depends what field of web, this was WordPress development but I work full stack now. Figure out languages and what they do and learn them as best as you can. Get to show the results to someone in need. Sincerely, from someone who asked these questions before.
---
Didn't you hear me? NO SHREDDING MACHINES!... This is an outrage!
---
It's the cliiiiiiiiimb!
---
what's so horrible about wanting to make connections with the people i'm playing an mmo with?  
---
if i want anti-classic no matter what i'd just jump on the bandwagons, like last week everybody was crying about wpvp, which i've only supported.  wpvp was the best thing this game had going for it.
---
Thank youu so much! I didn't realize they changed my settings for it!
---
If you are looking for raw stats, yeah bre is worse. But that's like saying crusader is a worse enchant than 20 str (not in yet). Or even HOJ is worse than counter attack lodestone. If you want raw stats consistently, then yeah those are better.  But you look at the weapon as a whole and how it helps you over the course of multiple fights. The armor pen is always better. You can look at the exponential value gain of armor pen. It's why in season 3, season 4 and 6 arena, everyone chased armor pen items. The more you get the better it is.
---
You do realize that the no changes people wanted an earlier version of AV, right?
---
Does no one like winning fast or somethin?
---
I don’t know why, I truely don’t. It’s the exact thing I’m wondering about myself.
---
Lmao "veteran"
---
how much you want to bet this dude started playing in like December 2006
---
Classic is the first time I'm playing WoW in like 9 years and man the playerbase sure has changed a lot. Back then there would at least be some PvP when zerging.
---
Lol there people who ironicunironically think its ok to be married and neglect your wife for wow.
---
Grow up losers.
---
One of the worst specs I've seem
---
I(undead) eat all gnomes.
---
Once they learn the jump horde will start winning.
---
Cool, it doesn't support the biggest, most used addon repository so no thanks.
---
If it's a mutual thing, I guess, still seems kinda sad though. But if it's not a mutual thing and is one sided, definitely scummy.
---
Bored devs.
---
Can you have another tailor make you fel cloth gloves since it requires demonic runes or do you have to have the recipe yourself?
---
Then he got banned and disappaired
---
I think you could both choose the same numbered AV, but I don't know how long it would take to get in.
---
You're a shit tank then who can't hold aggro. Threat is your responsibility not the dps.
---
If nobody understand the joke it’s not a woosh lol
---
Yikes 
---
How does a level one stop the kill?
---
Retail it's just weekly maintenance this week.
---
Classic it's a substantial update...
---
Comparing the two downtimes is pointless.
---
Maybe he grinded NPCs? I can't remember if they gave exp or not
---
Been saying BG queues are going to be crap for horde for weeks. People have been rallying against it saying its cross realm.
---
Yeah its cross realm using the ironforge.pro website for census data there Is nearly 12k more horde total and nearly 20k more on pvp servers.
---
50k alliance to 70k horde. That's 40% more horde across all PVP servers.
---
So to all the people who think horde will have am instant queue. You will not, I do not know what it will be, but it will not be 'good.'
---
Alright, that makes sense. Thank you so much for that clarification. 
---
You do indeed sound very clear headed about it all. You did not come across as condescending at all. On the contrary, you came across as respectful, sincere and thoughtful. Thank you for that.
---
I chuckled when you said "try not to sweat it". lol. 
---
I am on it. Negative comments on here don't tend to bother me much like that. Being ignored when I am making the effort that I am, does though. How do I take my baby steps to improvement if I am being ignored for making an honest attempt and being myself, ya know?  
---
You seem to get it. And it really does help to communicate with someone with some level of understanding. Thank you for your generous offer. I may take you up on that sometime. I'm not much good at it with these things however, the same to you! And I hope things improve for you too!
---
Is it fast reputation tho?
---
That was the rallying cry.  "10 minute win and play the game after we get our gear!"
---
But this time I cant leave azeroth.
---
All leading up to taking on one of WoWs greatest challenges
---
Achieving level 60 and not pissing off the people in a dungeon with me.
---
Because it’s already 400% of your movement speed, and every little thing that speeds things up even further makes the world seem that much smaller. If you want changes, go to retail. Retail is what happens when they listen to everyone and implement everything they want changed. 
---
And it’s boring as hell with zero sense of community. I can play either version with my sub, yet I haven’t logged onto a single one of my retail toons since resubscribing.
---
Because theres plenty of changes that have been made and this one is pretty meh.
---
Is this giving good reputation?
---
Congratulations! I never was able to afford an epic mount in vanilla so hoping to change things this time around :)
---
To be brutally honest, this guy's just a shitty tank making excuses, which is why so many people are replying with criticism/tanking advice. Why I care about dynamite and why he cares about dynamite are likely for different reasons. 
---
OP probably wants the numbers for the sake of numbers. Dense dynamite will do numbers for low cost per unit. If I were a rogue, I would want dense dynamite.
---
As a tank, I want an oh shit button; I want utility and control. Sapper charge is expensive and lacks a stun, but it's high damage and most importantly, instant. No GCD opportunity cost. When instant threat from max damage matters, there is no substitute. 
---
If I have to use something with a cast timer, I want it to be meaningful: Mithril Frag Bombs and The Big One have huge 8 and 10 yard radii, respectively -- if multiple groups get pulled in the room between the Beast and Drak, I can cover 1/3rd of that room with a gouge effect that prevents thousands of damage to the raid, even if it lasts only a moment. That's worth so much more than 200 extra damage. Mithril frag bomb's my favorite for low cost, middle damage, and awesome range for oh shit moments. For pure cost, sacrificing damage altogether (and gouge duration, although realistically few groups will let that gouge last more than a second), if you collect the coarse blasting powder off engineering vendors, large copper bombs cost about 3 silver each to make, and big bronze bombs and big iron bombs are similarly cheap -- you can use them always and never worry about the cost of doing so. Run through a whole dungeon aoe interrupting casts
---
Down voted for showing anything related to this douche.
---
It is, you're just dumb.
---
Who cares if he’s being judgmental or not (I’m not reading it that way). The fact remains that if you didn’t use SPY before the range change, you were at a massive disadvantage against someone who did use it. This is terrible for the game even if some people describe it as “convenient”.
---
I’d go as far as comparing it to using a wall hack in Cs:Go and brushing it off as just being “convenient” because you benefit by seeing people through walls. Everyone considers it cheating. Blizzard should simply consider this addon a cheat and ban its use if possible.
---
I'm sure you can type all about while you're dead, homie.
---
I think I know what you are up too! I may be joining in with a little here soon.
---
No disagreements here! If you're gonna complain about a relationship affecting your WoW time, then just break up and enjoy yourself in game
---
I had a guy do this and someone in the party whispered his guild leader.  He was kicked in an instant (probably wasn't the best guild member anyways if they let him go so quick, but your actions have consequences!)
---
Or, at the very least, multi-hour. Turning in blood and gnome molars and dwarf spleens and whatever else, the front lines, sneaking round to disrupt graveyards, last ditch tower defense...
---
Is that even possible, though, when it seems most people want to get the reward, not play the game?
---
...suggested no one anywhere.
---
We were running that for the mount.. I think one thing is a lot of people are using it for leveling in their heirloom gear.. My friend and I were cutting swaths through people...
---
No you fucking idiot, letting food mold in your own home is not the same as literally breaking furniture and walls in a rental property. One is someone causing themselves grief, the other is causing the landlord grief and damaging things that don't actually belong to you. How fucking stupid do you have to be to not understand this? Are you just like 15 and don't understand how renting works?
---
Wake up, that's not reality.
---
You can join AV bg in OG? I thought you hd to be in Alterac Valley
---
Is it good/fast reputation tho?
---
"My grandma is on fire."
---
Just out of a game defending and the enemy was so focused on the pve objectives that they didn't even bother fighting back. I must have backstabbed my way through a half dozen people, lol. I don't know if we won or lost, but damn it was fun :D
---
hi, I really enjoy reading census data, and really any positive contribution like yours, but I doubt Ashbringer has 30% more horde players. I play on it as alliance and have been nolife roam pvping as rank 6 now, and the horde side feels rather empty, or less in numbers than the alliance. Of course I may be wrong. Thanks for all the information, I will download the addon in the future and try it out myself!
---
Lmao fucking what? Are you serious?
---
We tried this (both queued for AV 5) but it put us both in different ones (306 and 77)
---
That's strange, could be a hardware issue in that case.
---
It's 1.12 AV, man. It exists only to give you Don Julio's, The Unstoppable Force and Lobotomizer.
---
They are as long as they're handled properly. It's just a matter of doing this to the number of servers they're managing and then running through their tests before giving them the go-ahead. Our team usually builds scripts to do most of the upgrades and we test them ahead of time on servers that mirror production. 
---
On the other hand, it's hard to upgrade 50 servers with a team of 5 dedicated to Classic. 😉
---
How do you get this open with ElvUI
---
&gt; Another reason why Blizz should have done the same as the pservers
---
Or you know, the same as RETAIL RIGHT NOW which has a 3 month event featuring the 1.6 version of AV.
---
I have to type /rl after every queue pop to be able to join.
---
They "perfected" WoD from 10million subs to 5million in a few months.
---
I wonder how "perfected" BFA is.
---
Any Horde race can ride it, no training required.  Just get exalted with Frostwolf Clan and buy it for 640g.
---
lmao, just a avg horde player.
---
That's no fun at all.  Have you checked the forums to see if anyone has mentioned a way to get around it?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#smzm0zJ89cV0mVm9m87n
---
Go nuts my dude
---
Step-sister*
---
No rushing.
---
Uhhh what?
---
I hate AV so I love this
---
The gloves are BoE so you can have someone else make them.
---
Lol what ?
---
or they could just do some very, very small changes to make it so you actually play AV...
---
you go back to retail, because apparently game design is really hard for you
---
We’ve known this AV was coming since beta. It’s 1.12 AV, aka the version of the game we are in.
---
I am having lots of fun doing it thank you very much.
---
Woosh*
---
Master cylinder!
---
grody
---
iirc, it was intended to come out \~4hours ago (20cest), but they moved it to server reset
---
I agree with you but we have known for months this was what we were getting, it’s 1.12
---
Ah, I was expecting to see your actual character, not the outfit maker, nevermind
---
I thought the no changes were wanting the earlier AV
---
Lol, then you drop queue and requeue. Wait until you both pop with the same AV number. And yes, you can queue for BGs with up to a 5 man party
---
While leveling I did lots of dungeons and followed the wowclassic.live guide and didn’t skip any quests.
---
So once I was 60 I had 4-5 zones that were totally untouched.   Questing at 60 is easy money.  The company reward gets turned into gold.  So some quests will be 4-8g and a vendors reward.
---
Questing, skinning, and just running dungeons.
---
I’m not here to give numbers, it was just an example and I’m just saying that if I were to suggest an idea like this, you can argue on numbers or explain why you prefer easy PvE content but cannot tell me it will change the game into retail because (a) it actually goes against retail philosophy and (b) 1.12 made the game easier and making it harder would actually make the game feels more like Vanilla.
---
Where you can summon Ivus  to help out.
---
How can you tell if someone rolled on a pvp server? Don't worry, they'll tell you about how blizzard ruined the classic experience and how they got ganked for 14 hours straight
---
Try making sure your gpu is properly selected in the advanced options, it took a couple tries but it works now.
---
At this point it's just put on.
---
I thought you had to go to Alterac Valley to join the BG, but you can just join in cities?
---
That's wild. This has never happened to me. Maybe once in LBRS but he was a shadow priest that was trash anywyas lol.
---
pics or gtfo
---
My wife and I went back to retail after the Classic Stress Test rather than waste the playtime we bought so we could play the stress test. The first day was a whole load of wtfing. We only have MoP so we didn't see a lot of people generally, if any. We started off just fishing but then decided to level our toons. It took maybe 4 or 5 days to go from 85 to 100 or whatever the cap is when you only have MoP.
---
The portal room threw me. I had a hard time getting around until I remembered you could talk to guards. Even though I raided in Cata I couldn't remember how to get around Org except vague portions. When I came back to classic for the stress test I knew where everything was, where to find things, etc, without even asking a guard, for the most part.
---
I don't know what pservers you've been playing on, OH WAIT! I KNOW! Not a single one of them by the way you're talking. Several of them had HORRIBLE faction balance. On some launches, loads of guilds would go horde, other launches lots would go ally and the faction balance would be permafucked.
---
Got any links?
---
Yeah I've known a few people who would play WoW for 16 hours straight and then complain because their partners wouldn't "let them relax".
---
Dude. You just spent 2/3 of a day playing a game. That is your time to relax, get the fuck up and help around the house/pay attention to your partner etc. Or be alone I guess.
---
This is not a good representation of the original Av, which, I get some people are frustrated by. I only want don julios, so I am beyond happy personally. But I totally get nostalgi driven players complaints
---
Thank you for your mistaken response. I will store it in my salt box.
---
Are you upset you thought you discovered something but didn't?
---
That'd be amazing. Hard to convince anyone to take "fun" over "efficiency" though...
---
you've got a buggy addon. Update them all. If it still happens, disable 1 at a time until you find the culprit.
---
Back in TBC, had a guildie leave due to "The garden is on fire"
---
How dare they have put fun ahead of other peoples efficency fetish? /s
---
1600 rep in 6-7min
---
No, I'd like to see because I obviously missed something!
---
Is this the cinematic for crafting it? This is epic af!
---
So are you going to auto attack people with dps gear or heal? You cant do both, they share global swing timer cooldowns
---
Dude wtf are you talking about, even with the buffed AV in Nostalrius it was pretty much the exact same thing.
---
People rushed on every private server because guess what...no matter how strong shit was it is still the most optimal way to play the BG and the only thing that changes that is if one team turtles.
---
Nah
---
Tfw the version of classic AV people want is currently in retail
---
Totem Timer :(
---
Fuck dude, I have ony in a few hours. Now I’m gonna be thinking of math the whole time.
---
Because AV itself is not enjoyable to many players in either incarnation. Players want to spend as little time as possible getting the best items, so that they can have fun in the parts of the game that they enjoy. How is that hard to understand?
---
As alliance, defend stonehearth pass (next to the bunker). If overwhelmed, fall back to the bridge.
---
As horde, defend iceblood approach/ramp.
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one with down time when shit gets slow...I usually have a B.S. query setup in a database that is not connected to anything..when I don't have much to do I trigger the query and let it process...it takes a couple of hours Haha.
---
go back to classic boomer
---
0.5% hit. It's pretty much a non-factor. If you're Arms, weapon specialization is a much bigger deal.
---
Horde whining when they face fair fights.
---
&gt; You don’t have to do it every day
---
Good lord yes you do... come on people, this stuff needs to be done every day so do it every day. I mean you're describing chores you give to children, forget looking after an entire household. 
---
Do your share, your full share, of whatever domestic duties you have. Then spend time with your partner. *Then* you can play WoW all night.
---
The jump from horde to Alliance. The reroll worth it.
---
No multi-day AVs have nothing to do with the game being "solved".  AV was changed late in Vanilla (1.12 iirc) and that's the version we get in Classic.
---
9 minute AVs instead of 15 might be a game "solved" issue, but that's a separate issue.
---
There is a number of quests available outside the instance of AV (North of Southshore) and a few within the instance.
---
If you complete the quests, they're a quick rep gain on top of grinding AV.
---
Mine says "Baby aggro, BRB!"
---
do you remember nost AV? lol
---
&gt; make a premade and turn the tide 
---
If only we could make premades for AV, ours doesn't even have the option to queue as group.
---
It's been talked about all the time here, eventually the gates will open anyway but yes it will take a long time.
---
NO NO NO NO NO DONT
---
Not remotely close to good for you as a warlock. Someone will explain it well for you, but DO NOT BUY THAT
---
brb fish drowning.
---
Tank slots are competitive as fuck regardless of your level of play, you need to be 10x better than others to obtain and retain your spot within a guild.
---
Use annihilator to add damage to the raid, craft a nightfall in p3 so when you're not MT'ing the boss you're increasing the damage of the raid at large.
---
Pull your weight by being the sharpest tool in the shed. As a Raid leader, I've had 15 or so tank applications to the guild I just turned away because I can't be bothered with any more tanks especially if they're not willing to go 300%.
---
Hahaha, true!
---
Guess that makes everyone dumb
---
Nah man 10 min AV PVE runs straight to the general is where the real PVP is at. Also CLASSIC&gt;RETAIL HURDURRRR.
---
Would it have killed them to implement both an older version and the current, so you could just pick what version you wanted to do?
---
9% with no weapon skill.
---
6% with +5 weapon skill.

You can go nude into BG as a lock if you go SL and still body people. The PvP gear on a warlock is amazing cuz killing you will be a god damn chore.
---
They’re having a laugh mate that’s a Druid tank staff
---
the no changes people DID want the old AV, i made a thread calling this shit 6 months ago. Anyone could have told you that AV would be terrible without all the shit stopping people from rushin to the end
---
Sure, thats probably true to some extent. Servers before battlegroups had a very varied Av style though. I played at 60 on 3 servers total, 1 horde and 1 ally. And the ally server, Genjuros and much later Dragonblight EU, were both more objective oriented than horde, lightnings blade which was much more of a grindfest. Then xrealm bgs came and it was all zerg, which sucks kinda. But this time, I only care for av exalted, not at all pvp, so I guess it's good for me :p
---
\+25% chance to crit
---
Dude old AV wouldn't matter either. Stop with this bullshit.
---
Even on private servers with older AV stuff people STILL RUSHED THE BASE.
---
It is the most optimal way to play the battleground. The only thing that stopped the rush was one group turtling and playing like an idiot and wasting everyone's time.
---
Stop with this crap. You want something back that CAN NEVER COME BACK. People know how to play the battleground now. It doesn't matter which version it is. 
---
T. DOES. NOT. MATTER.
---
Rushing is the optimal strat and buffed NPCs don't change that or stop that.
---
Out of curiosity which one is the biggest? I thought curse was.
---
Really? Man I hated the Wod lunar bar legion Boomie is my favorite.
---
People didn't listen?
---
We knew before launch we were getting this version, we knew before launch there wouldn't be multi day AVs.
---
Vanilla didn't even multi day AV's the whole day through.
---
Here we go...
---
Fellow Horde players. You did not see this. 
---
I have spoken.
---
They absolutely do. If this was brand new, no one would have a clue even with this patch. I'm just pointing out that people thought otherwise. Several guild members that played in Vanilla were stoked for it.
---
Hunter here, I've soloed DM N tribute 5-6 times? Unless you are very lucky or very good, I don't think it's possible to reliably clear it more than 2 times an hour. But it is a pretty fun challenge. (Note, I'm not very good at this game, however).
---
So I've kitted myself in 2x TE rings, barb blade, chest, etc but haven't really got into farming it for selling the drops to other people.  I'm not sure how much money it will make if I got into doing that. Probably depends on the server. But at least it's a lot less mind-numbing than farming low greens/greys mage style.
---
To stomp non twinks.
---
are you implying AV is a fair fight?
---
I am in his guild---he is bugged.
---
&gt; What's easier to avoid, 2k people hunting or 7k? You literally cant hide from the PVPers, so much so that they are moving into cities to hunt.
---
As a human you are programmed to attempt to find patterns in data. Your brain is looking for what's different between Classic and Vanilla and the easiest difference to spot is population cap. You've then decided that THIS must be the reason and have ignored all other logic to the contrary. 
---
This is the point I am making. ***You're fucked either way.***
---
There's only like, what, three max level zones that matter right now? Winterspring, Searing Gorge, and Burning Steppes for the sake of argument.
---
7K people is a lot. 2K people ***IS STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE***. That would mean that there's ~666 people in each fucking zone above using the same math you just used. It wouldn't MAATTTTTTTTEEEEEEERR what the population cap would be at, you'd have the same problem. 
---
Honestly, the behavior we are seeing people engage in now is likely what killed wpvp after Vanilla. Faction imbalance. Organized groups vs non-organized groups. Players giving up via Learned Helplessness, etc etc.
---
I've been in a few AVs where horde rushed faster than Ally even though we all went straight to Drek with epic mounts and carrot + enchants.. anything to this ?
---
Yeah this has little to do with player attitudes and everything to do with removing 90% of the NPCs from the 1.5 version.
---
Aside from the first 2 or 3 tanks a guild starts with most tanks become a tank out of necessity, not choice.
---
Tanks are by far the most vital role of any raid team. When progressing content missing a main tank can basically nullify any chances of attempting a boss.
---
This means that tanks need to be people who leadership knows is going to have absolutely impeccable attendance and commitment. Losing a tank can be a massive setback and having a tank with inconsistent raid attendance can make planning content and raid nights considerably harder. This is why it's so rare for guilds to let fresh warriors come in take over a taking role. They'd much rather have a high performing fury with great attendance step into the role as they are familiar with their level of play and commitment.
---
Any warrior who is joining an established guild now wanting to tank is best served by farming pre-BiS fury and prot gear, showing up consistently and expressing an interest in wanting to tank. Be the first to taunt loose mobs and put on a shield. Offer to tank core hounds, Garr adds, Sulfuron adds, Domo adds etc.
---
Prove you're breliable enough to be a tank and you'll eventually become one.
---
Yep, you and me man, too damn old I guess. I'll stick with my actually playing the game and will continue to pvp and drag out AVs as long as I can.
---
I wonder what went through your head when you typed this. Did you honestly think "Hah, that'll show him who's boss"?
---
Clearly the first two hours after the launch of battlegrounds is representative of how queues will be for the duration of Classic.
---
Idk I gave up WoW for 7 years because my boyfriend turned husband didn't like me wasting so much time on games. Granted, everything that needed to get done, got done, he just couldn't understand it was a hobby I enjoyed. 
---
Divorced now, find someone you can play games with and you'll never play alone. You may have to fight them for loot sometimes, but you won't play alone.
---
Overwhelmingly they did but reddit likes to blame everything on #nochanges.
---
PVP on retail wow now isn't about the rank/the gear. It's about just having fun.
---
PvP in classic is all about the honor grind and the rank. (Also people have fun, but first comes the R14 grind, then the fun comes after.)
---
Yes this is the way because it is the only horde choke point that's actually worth/possible defending. Alliance have a way more dangerous and cramped base whereas frostwolf keep is wide open.  
---
If it is rush vs. rush, horde will lose the vast majority of games.
---
I don't know what you mean. How will a realm balance itself by removing cross server BGs?
---
Honestly, the thing that bothers me the most is the changes they made to starfall... i can't even really remember what the hell it was like beyond it was better. And progging on heroic whats his face, the pitlord and being an absolute god because of the mass imps
---
There were multi day battles on release in Vanilla because no one has a clue. I was in a couple myself before it got boring.
---
&gt; I don't understand the hate from blizzard for convenient dungeon forming.
---
It has nothing to do with some supposed hate for the LFG addon. It is a response to honorspy spamming the chat servers. Basically every person with the honorspy addon would send data to every other person (within the same faction?) with the honorspy addon on a damn near continuous basis. If there are 500 people with the honorspy addon on a server, and it updates every 10 seconds, that's 500^2 (250,000) messages every 10 seconds that the chat server has to send out. People on high pop servers were sending and/or receiving an extra 1MB/s with the honorspy addon enabled. Now imagine the load on the chat server.
---
From a software design perspective, you simply can't leave what is essentially a deniable of service vulnerability like that.
---
And the best pvp shield drops in raid. Backwards loot 😄
---
Almost all of my addons seem to be broken now, I was only able to update a few to be working. Am I stuck with 90% of my addons broken until each one is updated for the interface changes?
---
 : (
---
I mean most people who twink play endgame content as well..
---
Org/IF. Military ward in IF. I forget name of it in org but it's in the room left of Bank of I remember correctly.
---
The "Enter Battle" button for BGs doesn't seem to play nicely with a lot of addons due to it apparently being a new function? Every time I the queue pops a different addon breaks and I need to manually disable them or nothing happens when I press the button.
---
Yea, had about 10 games like that and already honored. At this rate I'll be exalted this week with time to spare.
---
I believe it’s 3% hit for pvp as well? Can anyone confirm
---
I only play 3-4 hrs, so I'm less than a normie...
---
I played WoW since the beta, and I'm mostly surprised people have such good memories lol
---
I've forgotten so damn much. The moment I saw Ice Barbed Spear again I just got super nostalgic.
---
Your just mad your bad. Big rip. Sucks getting checked hey.
---
Id say mage, it has so many potental farms it can do. You can even make some money standing around in capitals. 
---
Im lvling a mage, plan to AOE grind my way to 60 with rested only
---
Tell them you’re going to buy it but that you’re short of gold and could they please help out a little.
---
Why couldn't there be new abilities?
---
Dude this is how you gotta do it. At the beginning of each match, you gotta recruit some help. Start talking up the base defense, lots of hks when you wipe the allys, then recap everything and work back towards the enemy base.
---
I've been getting 5 or 6 guys each game to come back and help wipe/recap and it's a fucking blast. Usually even numbers and its your base so you can run away and let the archers help. Lots of good 1v1 2v2 3v3s.
---
Im having a freaking blast
---
based
---
Well you answered it yourself.
---
Some people like the twink play style because it's simple and more RNG based. Match ups are often decided outside of skill, such as who has the better items or who got the bigger crit
---
When you have limited toolkits there's only so much you can do
---
May need to disable bag add-ons to get ring to show up.
---
1) To stomp non twinks
---
2) For those of us that don't have the time or schedule to get max geared lvl 60s, it's nice to have a character that can enter a structured PVP engagement without always being at a significant disadvantage
---
Those are my 2 reasons

what druid loot?
---
it's all warrior and lock loot
---
It was actually mixed recieved. It was a fun way to kill time and people have no problem afking and coming back to it later when they got bored. Hence why you can easily have both.
---
This is how av was in the summer of 2006. Everyone saying it’s too fast are retail babies who never played vanilla.
---
You thought you wanted it...
---
Yes, but not all of them are as coordinated about it as some others. Without coordination the rushes are less successful and less likely to happen. Also not all are as geared or specced for it as others.  
---
With worse gear and less coordination the rush strat is also much easier to counter. Right now it is also in barely anyone's interest to counter the rush strategies because everyone just wants exalted for the gear. Once they are exalted, people will be more likely to force AVs into longer matches by defending and capping certain graveyards.
---
The whole "raiders reach exalted and stop queuing AV" has happened on private servers before. It results in a general slow down of matches and more turtles.
---
They need to get rid of spy. Joke of a addon.
---
I logged into retail, was stuck somewhere in pandaria, couldn't find my way to SW. Ran/flied around for 30 min. Then logged out.
---
This is how av was in 2006. So far it’s accurate and no changes.
---
Or the fact caut band is +healing in classic...?
---
Standard ettiquite is if theres a wipe or healer dies you run as well
---
Can we just cuddle in field of strife?
---
i pretty much only make twinks to BG.
---
1) Time - I don't have the time to play end game, I only have 2-4 hours a day of free time. Hardcore players at 60 are no-lifers who play 8+ hours a day.
---
2) Gear - I don't enjoy raiding, which of course is where the best gear is to start PvP, until you gain honour to buy PvP gear. Which in turn goes to my number 1 point. I don't have time to grind ranks and unlock all the pvp gear to be competitive. I enjoy the low level gearing aspect. Plus plenty of twink gear is BoE, so i can just buy it.
---
3) Enjoyment - I enjoy the simple aspect of lower level PvP. Level 60 you need to be aware of everyone and how every single race and spec is played to be competitive. Again, that goes back to point 1 with time. Not enough time for me to learn again all the specs played.
---
Essentially, end game PvP is just max level twinks. If you can play hardcore and have the best ranked gear and top raid gear, you're going to shit on most people. Twinking allows me to do that, just with less time played.
---

It supports curseforge, isn't that the largest and what the twitch app exposes as well?
---
A command line tool seems like a reasonable way of avoiding bloat, this guy's use case is clearly just simple installs and it does it accomplishes it pretty well

Ahh shit, that's right. oQueue. I remember now....

They screw with immersion and lower the prices on some things, but they're not really...in the way so to speak.
---
Bots in classic steal nodes, so I want them burned at the stake.
---
I hit #1 caster dps in alot of the fights ;) like he said we require consumables to make it work. We are probably the most consumable heavy class to combat the mana problems. Also in total trash damage I hit #1 as well

I remember late in vanilla (during my pvp grind)    there was an addon that would help my group of 15 AB members queue Into the same AV
---
It’s like he watched JokerDs stream or something.
---
Tanking is only as hard as your DPS make it for you.
---
I really wish blizzard would allow server transfers and a switch from horde-&gt;ally
---
right click the icon  on your minimap and hit enter battle there.
---
FUCK BLIZZARD FREE HONG KO-wait i have MC tonight.
---
How much do you think I care? lmao
---
Quality ^
---
I log onto my paladin and I'm in some place with a bunch of other paladins and have a quest log full. Don't even. Recognize the zones the quests want me to go to. I just log off.
---
You can queue up in all major cities actually. IF, SW and Darnassus for alliance, and UC, ORG and TB for horde. For the exact location, ask a guard.
---
How many AV recap screenshots have to make their way to the top of the page before it's okay to call this sub a joke?
---
Imagine calling a much more polished game the inferior version
---
As soon as I hear the words “topping metres” in a healer discussion I'm out. If you are that stupid to think healing is about topping metres then nothing coming out of your mouth is of interest to me.
---
Why do people use the best items for them? I don't get it, the game is much more complex and interesting if you don't use good gear.
---
I’m sure there are quite a few people who feel like this. They discovered that they don’t have time for Classic and retail just fits into their live better. No big deal imo
---
no problem, glad i could help!
---
It’s gonna be a disaster dude. This version of AV is not compatible with the vanilla honor system. Very very very very quickly people are going to start optimizing how they can afk/bot  through AV.
---
The sky isn't blue though.
---
Yeah, I work retail and I hate it
---
Guessing those people didn't know there would be cross realm?
---
a minute or so for AV, under 10 minutes for WSG.  
---
Seem pretty good right now, but will no doubt get longer over time.
---
The number of bots I see wandering around just destroys my spirit to play the game. On my server (Netherwind) I'd say at least 50% of players found in open world are bots. Probably higher.
---
One of the reason I once heard is that it limits you in what you can accomplish so you have to be more careful and creative. I call bullshit on that though, it is way more challening on level 60 to do that, so they probably want to xelee stomp some underequipped milk boiz ,cuz they can't 1v1 on 60.
---
All UD listen to nickleback
---
What whining would that be?
---
Other people don't need the app for you to see their groups... ClassicLFG takes acronyms like "BRD" (= Black Rock Depths) from messages in various channels, and sorts them into groups for you.
---
Horde here on Herod - My que times are maybe 45 seconds at most.
---
I’ve been doing AV all day and have not ran in to this once .. I’ve had a great time during bgs and overall phase 2 pvp. There is always someone unhappy with the game somehow idk why people can’t just enjoy the game
---
I don't know how it's for the horde, but for the alliance is instant invite
---
I don't understand where this "everyone told me av would take multiple days and it took 5 minutes" meme is coming from though, as soon as we knew what version AV we were getting everyone knew it would be quick matches right?
---
Yes.  The results of the addon are only as accurate as the submissions.  So if you have nobody running the addon on a faction on a server, it will show as 0 people, no matter how many people there actually are.
---
The Web page has an "activity" tab.  Check on that: if there are a lot of data points for both factions over the last week, the overall data for that server is probably decent.  If only one faction has data points... well...
---
Yep this bum rush is ass. I was having fun with world PvP and this is just....boring. 
---
I’m alliance btw. Solo player.
---
I'm usually honest, I wasn't paying attention to what time it was.
---
If I wanna bail because the group is hopeless I'll just say I'm leaving because the group isn't succeeding.
---
WSG for the occasional PVP to refresh yourself, or see how you do with the new upgrades you got, AV for the honor grind.
---
Are we playing the same game? The mobs in endgame dungeons hit crazy hard. You need a tank for them.
---
I'm sure of it. Probably a "finally I can just fucking tank stress-free" type of moment for them.
---
It will be anything from a damage meter to a healcom library, depending on how it is coded.
---
we've known this version of av was going to be shit for months now
---
F Ä H N R I C H
---
so some idiot from alliance is answering because they want to pretend they were right?
---
&gt;Former bigglesworth alliance here. Maybe I had a bad experience but I found it impossible to quest after p2. I couldn't do anything without repeatedly getting ganked over and over wherever I went. Maybe it's gotten better but I switched to Rattlegore and it feels way more balanced.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8uxx8/most_balanced_us_pvp_server/faethfo/?context=3
---
Problem is if AV is good honor, not enough people are going to play wsg.
---
Wait...EVERY piece of armor or weapons in your possession takes durability damage, not just the ones equipped?!
---
Because, just like the tarren mill vs. southshore zerg, people would play it for one or two days and then instead do the thing that actually gets them gear through honor and reputation.
---
I've done strat with a stack of sapper charges and strat holy waters, and it's fun, but I wouldn't worry about the skell packs that much, 'cause that gets expensive fast. A mage with blizzard helps, but those things are just sorta controlled chaos. Try to tank the elites, and do your best with the rest.
---
Why will it be different? Unless one faction has more people stopping than the other, I don't see why it would change?
---
Had a 52-minute AV earlier. I'm pretty hardcore but I'm also a new player. It was some of the most fun I've had since starting the game, with a bunch of epic 30v30s, clutch general defenses, and a really balanced comp on both sides.
---
Hi j Allen brack
---
Step sister blackmailed into sex by nerdy brother #creampie #blackmail #teen #worldofporncraft
---
IMHO, I think this is a really bad idea. We all pay the same to play the game. We shouldn’t get different priorities.
---
Sorry, but you're wrong and kind of missing the point.
---
I absolutely agree with you that if the game wasn't "solved" that AV would be taking significantly longer than 10 minutes.
---
However, two things changed with AV.  One is player knowledge, as you're noting and we're agreeing.  The other, which you are currently ignoring, is that AV was changed in 1.12.  This "new" AV never took anything even *remotely* close to multiple days to complete, even when it was brand new and players knew nothing about it.  You can't just ignore such a major factor when you're trying to make an argument.
---
Did they give us the free upgrade to BFA for getting a classic 60 character or was that fake News?
---
False
---
I'm pretty sure that absolutely nobody is using the ingame voice.
---
I can type about it because I'm a maintank who never has to ask my DPS to throttle their gameplay because I refuse to properly play my spec.
---
Passed my exams.
---
I would love to have a wife that never wants to see me!
---
Impossibru
---
This is the TBC version of AV. You can rush the real AV, and people certainly did. But this version is almost nothing except a rush.
---
I just tried it about 30 minutes into my most recent AV match after alliance started turtling and people started splintering off to quest.
---
It works, 100%
---
It's kinda finnicky and the alliance inside the base were visibly shocked and confused about how a lone undead mage managed to walk up to the stables.
---
Really? I know it used to be that way, but they implemented that in classic?
---
Thanks I will look into this! I know there are some cool things it can do but I have had no clue how to begin!
---
But why werent you doing jed/rend runs instead. Could even join ones with MH reserved
---
Yup, it's kind of easy to tell who the cata babies are because they didn't see this coming.  Everyone else has been shitting on this decision since it was announced.
---
Most people on Earthshaker migrated from Gehennas/Firemaw etc, with thousands of ppl in queue.
---
What gear or dps do you have that you think this. You have hunters soloing dm, 2 man dme runs, 2 man BRD. 
---
Really the only dungeons you could really argue are scholo and strath but as said living can be soloed with good battle mage rng and only the first 3 rooms of school really matter
---
I mean, I have three gfs, so it isn't impossible. Raids don't take long currently. 
---
But I don't think I'll be hitting r14 or anything like that because of real life priorities.
---
Both times I was super heavy into wow my relationships ended
---
Blizzard clearly doesn't care about classic. Pack it up
---
There an appeal process?
---
Why the fuck does everything need to be an asmongold reaction video.
---
That's not ideal, as the ratio between 60's and non-60's was quite different on the PvP server I ran the addon on than it was on the PvE server I regularly play.
---
There are, by the way, still a significant number of people I know on my PvE server who do not have 60's yet.
---
Ahhh advertise, the biggest hypocrite in wow.  Hes already faked evidence of RMT to get someone else in trouble, so why not this?
---
I guess hes just mad that he cant ride his golden goose anymore for free subs so hes resorting to anything that will still keep his moron base coming back.
---
You wait till AFTER the release of it to complain  about it? 
---
Dude, the time to complain about this was months ago. The knowledge of this version of AV being put into Classic was a known thing for a long time.
---
I have yet to hear anyone using in game voice
---
It’s not out till BWL lmfao
---
It's back in the day!
---
I agree with you on all points. I'm moreso referencing all the people I've heard say they can't wait for multi day battles in AV.
---
Oh yes they definitely said...
---
I'm trying not to shit on any decisions and just trying to enjoy the fact we have classic at all.
---
&gt;outing yourself as a mobile user

---
Yeah I know. I just prayed otherwise I guess lol. I think it makes it worse having the other version on retail at the same time
---
&gt; However my favor post ever about this I will repost below and most classic pallies should recognize this post. 
---
I don't even need to look at the following post to know what it is. One of the best copypastas in WoW history IMO.
---
How were you not wintrading though? It's clearly a banable offence - whether you wanna come at it as manipulating ingame systems, collusion across factions or whatever.
---
Under a minute for everything so far in the US.
---
It's not about how big the difference is. It's about either being faster than the other guy or not.
---
I mean, nothing beats the speed of just mara farming/lasher farming where you just sell vendor trash. And those are both better gold/hour
---
So dumb we got the nerfed av. Already miss Nost.
---
This kid goes around being condescending to other people. Pretty funny going through your comment history.
---
Great, blow all of your CDs because the purple guy couldn’t keep it in his pants for 2 seconds. If a warrior gets a WF proc, he dies now.
---
its pretty easy to defend against though. You can defend it with a mage or two
---
Deleted post AND user within 7 minutes of posting, lmao.
---
Lmao. First time I actually tried wow was in classic launch. I think it helped me understand the quality of life things once I started playing retail as my main. I made a big mistake joining a pvp server as my first time, so I couldnt lvl comfortably once I hit my lvl 30s and got into contested zone, pvp ain't my thing at all. But it was a good learning experience and was fun nonetheless. Just googled alot of things and installed add ons. I still get lost on some quests in retail, so that hasn't changed.
---
Oh look another thread where you're being a dumb asshole. You're so funny kid.
---
Right, Im sure Blizzard issues bans based off Youtube videos and no other context.
---
Shut up and take your punishment. Stop acting like Blizzard banned you for...8 days? weird but ok... because of a youtube video lol.
---
Not even that, twinking is just more fun. You take longer to OOM and don't die as fast, twink v twink fights are more drawn out, you don't die in a PoM Pyro or one shadow priest dot, one rogue stunlock combo... etc. I enjoy my 19 druid more than my mageblade mostly BiS 60 mage.
---
They ran from insane queues, just like most of Earthshakers pop did.
---
No changes wanted the earlier version...
---
I'm playing PvP to PvP. I'd take 5 hour matches any day.
---
Mid 600s
---
Lol wait, the very first thing that website shows when I pulled it up is the *overall* balance is 52/48 in favor of the alliance.
---
There goes that narrative.
---
*Oh no.*
---
You can have an enjoyable life while playing a lot of hours on a game. Not everyone needs to lock themselves in to marriage and socials norms your parents indoctrinated into you. There are a lot of different things you can do in life while having fun.
---
Fuck you, you piece of shit
---
(Gotta balance out the vibe)
---
Gordok shackle keys don't work either
---
yay a stalker, Youre pretty pathetic even trying after deleting the comments like a bitch.
---
Try swapping the two lines around?
---
Priorities am i right?
---
\&gt;why isn't this mode that was added into the game in patch 8.2.0 not in the server running patch 1.12?
---
Golly jee, what a mystery.
---
If it's new and everyone is trying to play, then queues will be longer lol
---
So far I've encountered this issue with Details, ClassicAuraDurations, Farmlog, and ClassicCastBars. I don't think it's a specific bug with these addons, just that something was added that generally stopped them from working. You can just re-enable them once you are inside the BG.
---
This is true, but I imagine it'll be bis strategy for a few weeks until enough alliance know about iit.
---
This basically.
---
Hours suck but 0 HKs is worse
---
Thanks ha. It also wasnt a super valuable item either just gold. I'm usually also more disappointed than angry when a bigger ninja happens. But I can understand the frustration for sure. Watching the rogue die and him having to walk back and me not res him I felt was enough justice haha.
---
He didnt win the roll anyways
---
Yeah and that's fucking awful and no fun for anyone.  Play ab and wsg for pvp.  AV is a pve race.  There's no fun in a 40v40 pvp standoff. Especially for melee.
---
Those people are ill informed because Blizzard has been clear for about 2 years now that we would not be getting the multi-day AV version of the BG. They've always stated that it would be the faster version introduced later in vanilla.
---
That explains why my queues are instant on alliance. We lost every wsg, but at least I don't have to wait long.
---
Anyway, how's your sex life?
---
Shadowlands is a year away, so, yeah?
---
You're welcome kid.
---
So you can get smashed by a premade because Blizzard made the absolutely genius decision to allow premades to match with pugs. It's fuckin shit and there is NO reason not to change it just because that's how it was in Vanilla. #Nochanges is going to ruin this game because sweaty nerds were so elitist and angry about the smallest changes to a 15 year old video game even though it's objectively better for the game.
---
Yeah this is how it was in my battle group. I’m ally now but in vanilla and tbc we ran straight to aid station flag and capped, skipping fw gy to defend bridge instead of attack into it.
---
I play an elemental shaman. There’s nothing more fun to me then standing in a line and spamming chain lightning and lightning bolt while I watch boy meets world reruns on Disney+
---
are you using elvui?
---
The helmet and shoulders are BIS I think.
---
I would open up with auto shot regardless to get more damage in your rotation
---
i would try 
---
/cast Arcane Shot
---
Sorry if this was already asked. I just logged on after the update and my frame rate is garbage, anyone have similar issues?
---
Just fyi, these may sound ridiculous alot of the times but they are true sumtimes, but i had to leave an ubrs run just after jed as we where about to pull rend as my dog started sneezing blood (Yes i am i caster, though i already had the reed). 95% sure a few people didnt believe me
---
thank you for the useful information. great work.
---
it's hard to understand because 95% of the game is prepping to have fun later
---
Hopefully. I am on PvE and don’t want to wait for BGs.
---
It's been very rare for me to have such bad DPS that I can't tank well people on this sub over exaggerate and act like it happens every run. I think what happens is people try to tank 1 run and it goes badly since they don't know what they're doing and then go rage about it on reddit and blame their DPS and then never try to tank again.
---
I got sick of ZF and nobody wants me for gy runs I'm not a priest mage or lock.
---
The exp was crap when I did it once at 50 (full run).
---
No, it means both sides are playing them. If the less PVP faction stops, queues go back up.
---
Their site has an activity tab which shows you the number of people online when reports were made.
---
That can (depending on how many reports have actually been submitted for that server) give you a decent idea of how many actual accounts are being played.
---
“Grind”
---
Tribute is a lot more money, but I don't see in which world it's easier. Mara farm is my go-to if I'm multi-tasking while playing WoW. Once you get the hang of it, there's no thought process involved, whereas you can never stop being precise during a tribute run.
---
Same, gonna try get people to fight in the middle.
---
absolute chad with TWO killing blows, a true hero of the alliance
---
No, but I think the hardcore PvPers are mostly doing WSG so I'd say stick to AV for now if solo
---
Not if there's 40 horde running through. Once this becomes meta, horde will have a disgustingly good winrate. When people figured this out on pservers, horde could easily win in less than 5 minutes.
---

---
Is this a meme post?
---
Exactly. Most of the community (what I like to think was the majority) warned that the newer version of AV would be done in minutes and then just ignored for the rest of classic because people would farm their reputation in a matter of days, but Blizzard still went with this version of AV so what can you do..
---
The community made them increase the amount of phases, remove loot being tradable for 2h in dungeons, etc etc. But hey, what do we know.
---
"People are quitting the game, release BGS or the game will die"
---
"People are quitting the game, change the BGs that have been set for months or else the game will die"
---
Why would you wait till AFTER the release of the BG to complain about the way it works? We KNEW for months about what versions we were getting.
---
Just logged on and I am having frame rate issues as well.  Have seen a few people say delete cache folder, will report back

---
Right, but the whole point of "longer queues" was because of imbalance.
---
If there was a big imbalance, then queue times would be higher for horde irrespective of the age of the content
---
What you're suggesting is that X% of alliance will stop queuing in a few days whilst the horde will remain consistent. Why would that happen?
---
People knew that, its just horde outnumber the alliance when it comes to total numbers.
---
COWARD!!!!!!
---
Huge ! How are the ques to log in ? I get out of work soon and hoping to not wait 3 hours  to play
---
Find some friends to go to war with
---
Fair enough, people would still roll human for EMFH (if that’s still a thing, I haven’t played BFA).
---
I was having an issue where I couldn't search any addons and then I realized that twitch defaults to addons you already have and the search function is for those. You have to change tabs to be able to search new stuff. Maybe that isn't your issue but it caught me and a friend up so I thought I'd share.
---
PVP will slowly come back as more and more people hit R14.
---
Someone in my guild said if i was a returning player i could get bfa for free, is that a thing? Cause im not paying the 70 something dollars it seems like they want for it but i want to play
---
Damn, not a single comment where you don't insult someone. You must have some kind of inferiority complex huh?
---
Even funnier due to it being high threat.
---
Same here. I've gotten a few people to help and it is fairly easy to wipe people when they are on the boss. Then it turns into a 30 minute bloodbath of awesomeness!
---
You get no durability penalty from from rezzing at your corpse.
---
You take 10% to your equipped gear from *dying,*
---
And ***another*** 25% to all of your equipped and unequiped gear in your bags from rezzing at the healer.
---
Sounds like a complete waste of resources
---
Did you really make a meme by taking a picture of your monitor?
---
&gt;  Stop implying anyone who disagrees with you is ignorant.
---
How you gathered that from him pointing out time-frames of people's perspectives is a little crazy.
---
1-300 engineering takes a bit of work (although it's always worth it if you care about min-maxing pvp) but 1-200 is extremely accessible.
---
&gt;I like to imagine a world where Blizzard released this out of gratitude and respect to their loyal and longstanding playerbase.
---
God this playerbase is so cancer. We asked for this game. Stop acting like they are the bad guys when WE made this situation, not them.
---
Ze table\*
---
I only have 6
---
Change server
---
Not at the expense of fun. I want to PLAY, not mindlessly honor/rep farm!
---
I deleted my cache and its a little better but still way worse than this morning
---
Spirit Rez still hurts your equipped gear.
---
Awesome thanks! This cleared it up. Time to play naked lol
---
av or ws?
---
A lot of it probably boils down to the carrot dangling in front of player's faces, or lack thereof. 
---
In retail, there are two mayor reasons to play AV right now. XP and the mount. Although the horde wins more often and thus gains more progression for the mount, the Alliance has shorter que times so it balances itself out, sort of. There's no rush to get the mount, nor any challenge. KR isn't about trying, no matter what Blizzard intended originally. One way or another, you'll get your mount eventually - and a lot of levels in the process. Why hurry? 
---
Classic has the honor system and the associated Min/maxing. Though I believe that everyone would love to see some huge epic zergs at the field of strife, it makes more sense to get your honor and get out. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people think that they'll take their time with AV once they gained a high enough rank. I hope that those people are aware of the time needed to both gain and keep said ranks.
---
I mean what did we expect? Especially the first month or so?
---
Once everyone is exalted it will probably change a bit, but for now, everyone is going to rush as fast as humanly possible to exalted
---
I dont know why I've never thought about a potion macro. Have so many cancel form and such macros lol I feel dumb.
---
And thank you very much for your input! I've never heard of a hard cap for armor before. Very insightful response!
---
All those people are there, but I haven’t waited longer than 5 minutes. Most queues pop in around a minute
---
You masochist
---
&gt; No, it wasn't, it is now, but it wasn't before.
---
Alliance wasn’t able to quest or turn in quests, and the population was too small to do much raid content if they could. The game was unplayable. Now they are on servers that allow them to play. How is it not playable now for them, you make zero sense?
---
&gt; You're literally saying what they're doing isn't fun unless you're a bully who should go back to minecraft. How is that not ruining the game?
---
Because there are tons of other things to do besides camp the same people in cities 24/7. Things they can do that Alliance couldn’t on that server. Why are you so insistent that people willingly torture themselves to appease honor farmers? They would stop playing or transfer anyway, but you just wanna bitch because someone ruined your bullying.
---
Found the horde
---
I think I sold mine by accident a while ago. Is there any way to get it again?
---
Exactly what I was trying to say!!  You had no chance of killing the bosses with the ads still up.  We even skipped Belinda, which is wrong on every level.
---
It's a novelty thing. Logging off for a while, queuing up, and it being the same AV was cool in a way. That said, the people clamoring about it as if that's how "AV is supposed to be" are exaggerating just how fun it is, which is a common theme across classic. A lot of things *can* be fun, but people always refer to their one or two times it was enjoyable and braindump all the times they just wanted it to finish.
---
WSG blows too though. Entire CTF format is ruined by movespeed classes like Druids and Rogues that get a free pass with the flag. Zero skill involved whatsoever.
---
Rogues can open every door inside and outside of Dire Maul except the one guarded in DM-North with the huge courtyard... but the key to it is right there in the chest.
---
True (that it is false)
---
I use the BuffWatch addon for 5-mans using the 5 minute buffs and Pally Power for raids where I’m using the 15 min buffs. BuffWatch lets you track buffs on you party members and allows you to click the buff icon next to their name in the addon UI to recast it. By default it shows all buffs, but I modified the settings to only show buffs I cast so I just go down the line and click everyone’s blessing icon in the addon UI to rebuff every 5 minutes. PallyPower is similar but only tracks paladin buffs in your raid group.
---
no shit?
---
#NoChanges is mostly about keeping the game in parity with vanilla up to Naxx.
---
When Naxx comes out and people get it on farm, it will be kind of a "what now?" moment. Then it will be either TBC or Classic+, and nobody will be saying #NoChanges.
---
#NoChanges doesn't mean "never change the game ever" it just means "don't change it before the game has run its natural course"
---
apparently its switching peoples video card to their onboard, you have to reselect your actual graphics card in the settings
---
To defy the laws of tradition.
---
Yes, as long as you're not opposed to it evolving into a snuggle.
---
apparently its switching peoples video card to their onboard by default, you have to reselect your actual graphics card in the settings
---
You do know that this version of AV has been known for months right? Why would you wait till after it gets released on Live to cry about it?
---
The time to complain was months ago dude.
---
Yes more people need to be submitting which is a large issue it's not super accurate but can be
---
Damn I honestly thought we'd get a few days of ppl not bitching but here we are already 😂
---
This is normal yes, but (most) private servers didn't use 1.12 AV for this very reason.
---
European here, I know your pain
---
Coffer keys do not fill this, as it is considered a consumable. BS keys, i am not sure. (if you dont believe just try it lmfao)
---
Is that the Japanese beer?  Maybe I'm uncultured but it tasted weird to me.  There was another Japanese beer I had though that I liked, Sapporo or something?
---
I'm sorry if it appeared like that's what I'm trying to say. It's not. I'm not saying this is anybodies fault in particular: nobody knows what's going to happen in the future. What I'm trying to say is this is where the OP is, as a classic wow fan, I don't want anybody to have this experience. In life it's often not the problem we face but how we choose to deal with it, and in this sense it's the options I presented to OP.
---
Apologies for any offence caused.
---
Nost had old AV, and it was likely even more buffed than old AV in retail vanilla, as that was the trend on pservers, while people got held hostage from time to time, most games was over just as quick as these ones. The version of AV they use doesn't mean anything. What made long AV matches common back in the day was just lack of knowledge, nothing else.
---
Personally, I don't mind either way. One way is more fun, and the other way is more efficient.
---
True, last week everyone made 230g
---
What are the best ways to force turtle for both factions?
---
At least now you can rez in Ironforge without getting camped.
---
you sound mad, are you mad?
---
Either that or the priest miss clicked. For some reason "use soulstone" is on the opposite side of "accept resurrect". If you play on autopilot you can accidentally release instead. It's silly but it may have happened to me as well.
---
I already talk to support, they got some evidence from the video, but its mainly the army of spergs. You're stupid.
---
Damn that's some serious cringe
---
Cant really say for others but Holy paladins differ a lot from each other.
---
How is it broken if you need the full riding set to get the +9%? You posted the carrot, carrot alone makes little difference in epic mounts, I got full riding set and dudes with no carrot or enchants in the raid easily catch up, anyways. Far from that big of a difference.
---
&gt; BG queues are short only because it's new.
---
BG queues are short because not everyone and their mother are R14.
---
I'm afraid you watch too much porn
---
Well that's completely your opinion. I think the new models, animations and spell reflects are a huge improvement. And while I think BFA has horrible class gameplay, it is still light years ahead of classic gameplay IMO.
---
Someone's seething
---
How weird! Thanks for the info. Ended up just completely deleting everything and and reinstalling and it fixed it!
---
10 minute seems faster than i remember, but yeah 20-30 minutes wasn't unusual and you'd have people in AVs that went longer yelling at all the people who weren't zerging that they were wasting everyones time and getting less honor.
---
It sucks, but everyone said that if we got the 1.12 version of AV it was gonna be a PvE rush event. Blizzard decided to still go with it. Don't like it? don't play it.
---
i knew it was dumb. i didn't know it was even dumber than retail.
---
The army of spegs got you banned? How the fuck do they have anything to do with it when support looked into it?
---
"Well sir, you didnt do anything wrong, but you had a lot of people report you, so heres an 8 day ban"
---
Keep making shit up.
---
My best princess kill with a blue wep is 6 mins and that was a very optimal run with perfect sandstorm RNG. I am in blues and greens so I think kill time is highly dependent on gear if you got a 2:45 kill
---
You wanted Classic, be happy its not 12-24h downtime.
---
Level 59 priest Dis/Holy, started to raid and do dungeons for good gear. Is there a website which tells me all BiS for every slot?
---
NA Horde is already waiting 10-15 minutes at least. I guess we will see like 20-30 minutes in EU.
---
They’re awesome tanks, gtfo.
---
You must not have read any info in the past few months. We’ve known the version of AV were would get and how fast it was going to be farmed.
---
if they saw you shooting a video vertically I'm sure they would have camped your ass
---
Use the item restoration function on the support site.
---
Dude... all your post are you complaining about WoW lol. Maybe take a break or something.
---
...why is a match only 10 min in AV? I remember it being hours long before. So help me gods if it isn't the original BG I'm straight up canceling my sub.
---
it does
---
and the command line isn't as scary as you think kek
---
We also used an addon to coordinate our guild getting into 40 man av and we had coordinated tanks and healers and we would rush to Van and kill him and be out of the AV in 8 minutes.
---
+10 mp5 = +30 healing
---
Asking for a 1v1 on stream isn't wintrading, player collusion at best.
---
so his mom is home and he has to hide his porn.
---
Combat daggers is better dps anyway, and then you can also 1 shot clothies in pvp
---
You immediately contradicted yourself.  "It really was" "Cross-realm BG's do not kill communities"
---
It's just not true.  There are several definitely several factors that did it, but CRBG had no effect from my personal experience.  Through Vanilla, BC and Wrath everyone on server knew each other.  I even knew more than a few alliance.  Everyone knew the allinace guilds and horde guilds on both sides.  This persisted through to Wrath.  
---
Things changed such as the pvp system a few times, as well as less incentive to wpvp.  We got more things to do, such as dailies.  The factors go on and on.  But CRBG was not the cause, nor do I believe it was a factor.
---
Just like it was in the good ol days...lol
---
Several pservers has had the old version of AV, and when pserver devs didn't know the exact value of something, they overcompensated and made it significantly stronger. People have been zerging an overbuffed version of old AV for years. The version they gave us has nothing to do with how we clear AV today. People just lacked info in retail vanilla.
---
Icy veins
---
This was it! Thanks dude, you da real mvp
---
Same :(
---
my pal twink cost me about 300, about 100 on enchants lol, and i got 2 costly missing, the ones from DM, just got my lifestealing.
---
I wouldn't wanna bet against you.
---
Blizzard trying to funnel players to retail.
---
same, i abandoned my ally priest after my friends quit to play with a different group on horde, but if horde has 10min+ queues which seems to be the case for some streamers already then i rather  change my horde chars to ally and transfer them to my priests realm.
---
not losing my horde progress and less time spend in queue are easily worth the money.
---
I would love epic hours long battles in AV. Some of my fondest memories from Vanilla are of that time.
---
A case of wow making a guy a better husband everyone!
---
omg thank you! that was it for sure.
---
