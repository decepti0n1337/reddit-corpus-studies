You need good officers if your MTing and GM.. but in terms of authority nothing really beats a MT+GM leader imo.. the best raiding experience I had was following a MT+GM... didn’t mess around though and def would be considered “hardcore” .. if you dont know if you’ll have good officers to help you out during raids etc.. could be difficult and lead to “slow” raids
---
---
---
Ah yes, truly unquestionable logic all around.
---
I didn't say it was needed or necessary, I just it's pretty obvious why he might be in prot. Totally looking forward to your assessment later tonight, don't let me down.
---
a lvl 40 dungeon while lvl 30
---
According to what? Sketchy private server scripts and a 15 year old memory?
---

---
Nobody knows what the "lesser" specs are going to be capable of until full release. There were already tons of ret pallies on private servers putting up decent numbers and thats with the bugged skills.
---
&gt; tedious
---
just like watching this stream, jesus
---
If only there was some way to test these issues
---
BALD
---
I remember my first sm armory run
---
....
---
I haven't gotten that enveloped by a stream ever.  Asmon is in his PRIME right now. Gotta give it to him, super cool.
---
The level cap is 30. Noone cleared the lvl 35-40~ instance on beta yet. Its 'technically' a World First since classic.
---
[removed]
---
It was very fun to watch
---
Asmongold is really bad though, he got hit by blades of light more than 6 times, if the damage were to be insane they would have wiped without a chance to try again.
---
Still a world first. Why so salty?
---
Agreed.
---
Reading this raised my blood pressure.
---
Hard to watch is an understatement.  He is 14 year old content maker.  As an older person, he just isn't for me.  I get he is trying to act retarded, but it is just being 100% retarded for trying to act retarded..
---
Imagine not mentioning the greatest paladin in the world, Mcconnellret for being a great coach to the team.
---
Esfand coming for you luuuuul
---
Yeah... Auto-run's been a thing the entire time.
---
People who hate on Asmon just have small dicks and are jealous of his big dick abilities. Real talk
---
Funny enough my Guild took weeks to down raz but after that we breezed through to Nef. After a few BWL runs was pretty much on farm mode, same with AQ40 (excluding Cthun). Naxx and the looming introduction to TBC killed my guild.
---
You just listed all the things (in hindsight) that I love about it. 
---
BFA has been dumbed down so much it’s like you aren’t even playing a game anymore. It’s literally guiding you everywhere you need to go so you can click a few buttons and have it guide you to the next quest.  There is no challenge. 
---
I want to rely on reading quest text and using my map for clues on where to go to complete a quest.
---
Ah look another person talking out of their ass
---
Hey everyone I'm back with another simplified gearing guide for phase 1 of WoW Classic.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Since I've already covered casters and healy priests, I thought it'd be cool to step out of my comfort zone a bit and look at a class that I barely touched back in the day. So, after spending hours upon hours looking up items and where to get them, I finally whittled it down to this - my 4 step guide on how to get decently geared as a rogue in the beginning of WoW Classic as quickly as possible before raiding.
---
Also, this is NOT a pre-raid best-in-slot list, since there's like a million of those around the internet for every class, but rather a simplified gearing guide for people like me who don't want to, or can't, run the same dungeon over and over to try and get one particular drop.
---
Enjoy! And let me know what you think! :)
---
Hey! It's me! &lt;3 Was super fun guys
---
You felt erroneously.
---
No because Classic good current WoW bad.
---
How do you know they're from another server?
---
Guild disbanding 1 boss into BWL lol... didn’t know people were that bad.
---
Imagine how much easier that run would have been if asmon actually could tank.
---
&gt;level 1moebacaScore hidden · 31 minutes ago · edited 2 minutes agoThis instance run was definitely fun to watch. The stakes were so high. Definitely miss Classic, 3 months is a long time for us non-beta users to wait.Hi Esfand
---
Hi! :)
---
Only a person with no endgame experience would say that.
---
It is tuned right. When you do your first end game dungeon and you wipe, you will understand.
---
That's interesting. Emerald Dream has always been one of the highest pop servers since it's inception and it's an rp-pvp server.
---
You kind of saw part of it with the hunter pulling aggro, but he kind of sucked at executing it. 
---
Basically you have a boss that very frequently stops and spins, and you have an arena with a dropoff that he can't follow. So you pull aggro on him from above, he charges up, you jump straight off the ledge. Now he has to walk around to get to you. He gets back down ground level, starts spinning you run back up to the top, repeat. 
---
Hunters can solo him, probably other RDPS too but the pet makes it easier.
---
i have no idea what was happening but i was excited
---
it was an honor to be a part of this
---
Why does that surprise you? They are a solid class and S tier in pvp and will be S tier in pve
---
Edge of my seat!!
---
someone has a bad memory, look up you did say  a thing.  derp
---
 ranged either hits or not, no glancing blows or parries. melee can hit at the same rate, but might get reduced damage due to glancing blow or parry
---
On the stress test I noticed it pop up before I trained affliction spells and the only ones that were listed were destruction and demonology.
---
Yea sure. Clickbait.
---
Can I play smite priest too? Im a melee hunter so rolling on CTS okay? Your personal preference does not take precedent over everything else.
---
I get where you're coming from, but maybe you're not making an honest effort to get where those people (myself included) are coming from.
---
How much better is Holy and Prot?
---
Well shimmering flats is in 1k needles, and exactly so that land should be both gnome and goblin. 
---
Just like all the druid areas should be tauren and nelda.
---
Ha! Of course it was from an RPG sourcebook. Classic.^1
---
Same thing happened with Star Wars, incidentally. Lucas was the one created the broad strokes of the setting, to be sure, but it was the folks at West End Games really fleshed it following the success of the original trilogy.
---
^1 ^Pun ^*fully* ^intended.
---
Two different perspectives, interesting. /u/UbiGeofram raises a good point though - staying humble when you get showered both in items and praise as guildlead would be tough. 
---
If I can manage that though, and find decent officers, I reckon it'll be fine. I do not intend on founding a hardcore guild, more among the "regular" dudes that play decently, do their research and clear raids at a decent pace without being elitist as all hell, so I hope to be able to find some decent officers while leveling or via recruiting.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
&gt; p2w=buying **advantage** with $$  
---
simple as that 
---
&gt; irrelevant, its still **locked content** behind paywall in a skill driven game 
---
So which is it? Is p2w content or advantage? Cuz you are kinda moving the goalposts here.
---
I don't even play the game for the record, I just think it's silly to call it P2W because you definitely can't spend money to win.  LoL chose an avenue to support itself, you might not agree with it but it's definitely nowhere near as sleezy as shit like content in LOOTBOXES. Hell Retail WoW is more p2w with wow tokens (buying gold is a much huger advantage than a champion, has magnitudes more of an effect) than league is. LoL isn't some massive p2w scam, and trying to imply that just makes you seem jaded. 
---
Runes and a bunch of other things they've implemented were definitely predatory, but it was also a new time in gaming. Riot really defined the whole "sell cosmetics to support your game" model, and they stumbled in some other areas but it's nowhere near as p2w as you are trying to make it. All those games you named came a few years after LoL and were able to perfect the f2p model, LoL had staying power/large market share and had no reason to change after that.
---
I kept those shoulders for quite some time
---
I second this. I ran a few Guilds in WoW, then one in Wildstar. I don't have the time or the energy to play babysitter to a bunch of gamers.
---
Cakemix here! What an amazing journey we had. Also, Karl, Protector of the Realm will be forever in my memory.
---
I mean, I'll just point out every mechanical mistake.
---
Weird thing is that he did a couple times, but for some reason didn't continue. Same with the bandages.
---
Should have been subscribed since 2004.
---
... and? I'm still not understanding why this is reddit post material.
---
I guarantee you the top guilds in retail will be more excited about killing the final mythic boss than these guys here :P
---
Nice
---
Is the video not "Asmon and company" killing Herod? Do you know what clickbait is?
---
This is a repost. XD
---
God damn I knew I wasn’t the only one who went blind when looking glow effects, such as Rich Thorium veins.
---
&gt; goober
---
^ Real? LOOOOL
---
I'm saying you're a dumbass and "wooshed" someone who was being sarcastic and not actually taking your title seriously.
---
In conclusion - you're stupid as shit
---
Alright nice armchair take, what should he have done?  
---
I don't watch tips and I didn't play private servers and duel 24/7, educate me.
---
I started playing on Lights Hope to get an idea for what I'd want to play between a warrior and paladin.
---
If you already know what you want to play then I'd say wait so you don't need to worry about burning out.
---
Imagine being so butthurt over a bunch of WoW enthusiasts being annoyed because they can't even get in to a limited stress test realm whilst having to watch every streamer and their mother not only get into the BETA but also successfully logging in to said stress test that you have to create a post about it on reddit...
---
I am pretty sure that vanilla didn't have exp for old at max level.
---
Im assuming you killed it on hc or even normal? Because if you had done it on mythic youd understand the feeling. And since you said sargeras im assuming you also didnt pay attention very well during the expac either
---
Not talking shit about this clip, i love classic just as much as you toxic shits in here, but the one saving grace retail has had the last years has been mythic raiding
---
I hope you're right but the game today just isn't the same as it was then.
---
Really cool Adventure guys, Karl is life, Karl is love!
---
Im talking about when you go into your skills tab (when you open up your character screen) where you see weapon skills, etc.  I was showing all 3 there maxed out.
---
I appreciate the upvote, but apparently someone wants to keep it at zero.  Oh well.
---
It's AI.. bots.. fake players.  I've seen it myself playing the 1-20 retail demo a few months ago - people sharding in like that, stop, have some random conversation that doesn't even make sense, then phase back out again.  I don't know the video, but they have spoke about using advanced AI in the game.  
---
This is a deal breaker for me..
---
"Booohooo I didn't get access to the classic servers. Blizzard wasn't being honest booohooo." Seriously that is what you sound like. It's a test for a reason. Just be patient, everyone will get access in August.
---
Fair enough, I agree. I guess the most difficult part is the patience to do it! Generally, classic instanced mechanics and threat are not too difficult now that the average player in classic knows what they are pr has someone in their group to explain it. Though it has nothing to do with this encounter, I like that classic has the mechanic (and the mechanic existing is harder than it not existing, even when its simple enough).
---
Was this today?  Time stamp?  I need to watch this...
---
Its almost like you don't trust people to be able to get the joke.
---
How do you know this?
---
This was a question I've been asking myself for the last few days.  I stopped playing WoW long ago but started watching Twitch streamers play Vanilla WoW.  I've noticed many of the top streamers (in terms of viewers) acted like aggressive, bad mannered idiots, including Asmongold.
---
I kept asking myself, is he really a huge dick?  Or is he just playing to the audience?
---
&gt; He's engaging chat more than he's playing the game in most cases.
---
This is why people love to watch him, he has 20k+ viewers most of the time and although you are just .005% of his viewers it still feels like he is interacting with you as an individual viewer, he knows how to connect with his audience and give a mega stream a personal feeling.
---
Digital vibrance is a curse and a blessing
---
nah i probably wont play it
---
Ranged attacks can't glance and can't be blocked, dodged or parried.
---
That's a good point, thank you. I'll keep it in mind, I presume that this while often occuring isn't predetermined to happen and I have seen many guilds work fine with a Tank and Guild Lead who was a level headed and decent guy, but again that wasn't in Classic so this will probably be a different story.
---
If I notice that this won't work out I might just try and find a guildleader  and become Raid Lead for a guild with my friends. Thank you for the honesty and have a nice day.
---
The mobs were absolutely not doing insane damage at all. Healer was tanking multiple mobs for a bit on several occasions...if this was an M+ or something he would have been blown up instantly lol. It was a battle of attrition. 
---
The only times they were in trouble is when the healer was oom. The healer's mana management is by far the most important aspect of a run like this.
---
Brah, they're literally arguing for genocide and cannibalism.
---
Hard to BiS at 30 because of BoEs (river pride choker)

Tipsout is fucking trash and an insult to PvP warriors everywhere.
---
They're solid for sure just not played a lot in the versions we've had up until now. Low pop in Classic, Low pop on private servers. Looks like things are going to be different come classic. I know a lot of people picked them for the Raid slot traditionally on top of their solid PvE and PvP abilities.
---
Healing is boring as shit, that's not going to make her want to keep playing. It's wackamole with green bars and mouse over macros in Vanilla WoW.
---
I’m hoping my hard work pays off!
---
You think you do, but you don’t.

Came here to post this.
---
This post stinks of baiting people to be toxic so they can point and call people toxic.
---
is this your alt mcconnell?
---
Which version of census+ did you use ? I would be interested in running this on the beta
---
Thank you. 
---
I don’t remember vanilla being this ‘glowly’
---
&gt; 95 days until we get an official, ~~bug-free~~ classic experience 
---
FTFY
---
It's been a blast watching asmon, mccool, and esfand playing classic! Keep it up boys!
---
You need to be part of the mafia to get leather, it's crossfac 2 top tier guilds making sure no one but them gets it. 24/7 camp.
---
You could snipe a leather here and there if you are a pvp god with rocket helm etc and time your blind/helm etc to skin it quickly before the guys who kill it do, assuming enemy faction.
---
Yup, and even then people like asmongold manage to be terrible at it, rolling their faces on the keyboard at the wrong times
---
I would say at least 5
---
Orc female says "it's not easy being green".
---
Can you people fucking knock it off, no one wants a day to day update on this crap.
---
It's like 15 year old content mate
---
They've already described how layering will work.
---
I honestly think he isn't the brightest bulb to begin with.  If you listen to some of the stories about him and his father, I think he is legit a shut in.  If you look at his background of his stream room, he doesn't take care of it.  If you look at him and his hygiene, he doesn't take care of that either.  I think he is just some 25-30 year old closet shut in who lucked into fame on Twitch and has not progressed since that point.
---
You turn that T-1000 water down NOW, dammit! Vanilla water or get back in your van!!
---
He's a little overrated around here but he's definitely good. He's no Marm lol. But also keep in mind warrior counters rogue.
---
My guild started investing progressively more time as we got into the later stage raids.  Tuesday started at 7pm and we'd usually have to call it quits at 2am.  We'd go back on Thursdays for at least another 5 hours, and often on Saturdays starting at 1pm until we didn't have enough folks any longer.
---
So, probably as much as 20 hours/week at times.
---
No "technicallt" beta kill will ever be a world first
---
You are probably on a different layer because layering is cool
---
Where is the template for this? I’ve been trying to find it for a while!
---
Prot pally was plenty fun from what I remember, but I only started one in BC. I thiiink they should be able to AoE tank at around 30-40, which makes them a blast.
---
Razorgore is a Raid Leader check and Vael is a Guild Master check.  If you can't kill Razorgore then your raid is an unorganized mess, and if you can't kill Vael, your guild is.
---
get out of defensive stance and use a 2 hander, take sunder off your bar
---
His job is being entertaining, not playing flawlessly.
---
Asmon and Esfand together had 80k people watching this run. They had 110k between both streams when they did Deadmines last week. When Asmon did the day 1 BoD and CoS earlier this year he had like 40k and then 25k or something.
---
this but unironically
---
I loved tanking in Vanilla because of threat management and also managing the mob positions had more of an art to it. You're absolutely right that there's an added element to the game with that...you just don't really see it much in dungeons. 
---
There are definitely fights in the raids where aggro management is huge, and lots of shitty players couldn't handle them back in the day. 
---
Vael is a perfect example of a boss where threat management was too hard for a lot of people at the time. It's hard to believe now, but it was known as a guildkiller boss in the early days of BWL. Very little margin for error if there's a mistake with the threat on that fight.
---
So excited to see this is still possible! Exploration was one of my favorite memories of classic
---
Same here. I don't usually do Twitch but I want to play Classic so bad and Esfand is my favorite of the streamers. Let's me use my Twitch Prime sub too that usually just rots.
---
That was fun though he acknowledged this post on his stream and replied. I'm going to clip it, but the whole Twitch concept is really interesting to me. I really want to see someone do a "Twilight Zone" take on Twitch, because the concept is still so strange to me.
---
lol yeah no thats not how it works.
---
it's already been tested, it's called sharding
---
Hey Esfand! Love watching you and Asmon stream, you guys are very entertaining.
---
What does that have to do with getting excited about killing bosses?
---
Incorrect.
---
Can you link where you are extrapolating this from?
---
That sounds like the worst gold making strategy I’ve ever heard. Farm herbs/ore for an hour
---
In many world pvp and bg situations this works very often. Not every mage you fight will be a great player. Obviously duels is a different story.
---
Hi company!
---
Asmongold is so full of himself, it's hard to watch him
---
Something's been lost here, then. I posted what I did in response to someone who posted that they were reducing the beta invites. I hadn't seen the info yet, and responded to him about that. You then responded to me. When I say 'the other guy', I was talking about him.
---
And saying it 'turned into a hoax in less than 24 hours' is a bit disingenuous. Many of us hadn't seen the real blue post about beta invites, and I would imagine many of those people had also seen the satirical one (which, as we agree, a lot of folks took seriously, for some strange reason). 
---
People like me didn't turn a blue post into a hoax. We hadn't seen it at all.
---
That's the default thing, didn't saw anything special in the settings... although things do change between mode 4 and 7 (this is from 7).
---
I'm not sure if you know how twitch works... The only thing you pay to watch someone stream is for your internet service, which you're going to have either way.  Is it really an issue if I like to watch streams while at work where I can't actually play a game?  Or should I be watching youtube videos of people doing stupid shit?
---
That shouldnt work in classic tho ?
---
I´m pretty sure they added xp to gold somewhere in tbc.

Recruiting for Safe Haven!  An environment built around Casual gameplay, Social interaction, Family/Friend oriented atmosphere &amp; the ability to play when you want; how you want.
---
Safe Haven, a place of safety or refuge.  “And thus it gives the impression of being a safe haven to which we may retreat from the unpredictability and limitlessness of experience.”  That’s the mantra.  To be able to log-in and have fun in a toxic free, mature, adult environment.
---
About the guild - Safe Haven is a newly formed Casual/Social guild that will be created when Classic launches.  The guild will be catered to the older, mature crowd &amp; working adults with real life commitments.  It will be small, but meaningful as I believe great friendships and cooperation will be formed over time.  This will not be a raiding guild, however I am not opposed to collaborating with another small guild to attempt raids as I’ve done throughout my 14 years playing WoW.  
---
I was searching different recruitment forums for a guild that fit what I needed, and couldn’t find one so I decided I would create my own in the vision of how I want to revisit my Vanilla experience.  I know for a fact there are a huge amount of Vanilla veterans who want to experience the game just like me because I had an entire guild of you all back in the day and it was awesome 😊. There is nothing like logging in and running dungeons and questing or doing PVP with a group of friends.  We had sons, daughters , husbands &amp; wives, senior citizens...it was great.  Chat was lively and there was no drama.  It made logging in every day a truly memorable experience.
---
What we will do - We’ll help others through quests, dungeons or crafting.  We’ll provide a place where no question is a dumb question.  A place that will act like a home away from home.  If you want to be a part of the guild but still raid with other guilds or pug groups , then that’s fine as well; I often pug raids when I feel like raiding.  The bottom line is enjoy yourself.  This guild will be what it is:  Casual &amp; Social and everything we do after that will be a huge plus.
---
Server type/Faction - Either PVE or RP-PVE and the faction will be Horde.
---
Time zone - NA/Eastern ( I hope to have players online all day and night)
---
About me - Retired military, married, 46 years old and Old school WoW player and former GM of 2 guilds in Vanilla that we’re both Casual.  Both guilds ended due to people losing interest in the game and the direction it was going.  I’m very proud to say that my guild did clear Naxx as a Casual guild, but not the 40 man version.  I honestly didn’t desire to be a GM again but I saw a need for this type of guild and said why not.  
---
Environment- No racism, bigotry, or hate filled rhetoric will be tolerated.  Period.
---
Recruitment- Open to any class &amp; any spec.  I put more stock in the person behind the keyboard then the character/class you are playing.  Some of my most memorable dungeon runs were with people whose specs weren’t considered optimal.  Also, although I am forming this guild to cater to the graybeards and elder stateswomen of WoW, everyone who is interested will be considered if they fit the mold, and their family members. No huge application process, just a conversation.
---
I’m sure I have forgot to mention something so if you are interested or have any questions, please feel free to ask.  It’s been awhile since I’ve done this.  You can reach me on Reddit.  If I get enough interested people, I will create a discord channel and update this post.  I look forward to playing with you on launch day!
---
Its not vague. You just dont seem to understand what a stress test is. Its the opposite of vague - its a definable term.
---
I raided mythic up until the end of Uldir and got top 50 throughout Legion and Uldir, so I am in no way discrediting top guilds and their achievements, and I also won’t deny that mythic raiding is the current saving grace for most people. I also think calling me a “toxic shit” is pointless since I in no way intended to incite toxicity. Your final paragraph on the other hand...
---
It's fucking ghost rider man!!
---
I thought it might be something like that but to get there u must have taken a lot of corpse runs...I don't doubt that it's possible, though. I've seen very low level characters in Everlook, always just assumed they got summoned there.
---
Thanks for your concern.  I’d rather have a few high pop servers over a bunch of dead servers that can’t even complete the aq event.  There’s no fix that can 100% change these situations.  Layering, imo, provides the best outcome MOST of the time.  
---
The reality is there are going to be dead servers and high pop servers.  Layering allows them to create less servers so the chance of there being dead servers goes down.  The chance of there being over populated servers goes up, a problem that you pointed out only can happen with layering.  I’d rather have to worry about a few over populated servers rather than a bunch of dead servers.
---
I used to preemptively BoP warriors on Vaelestrasz because they didn't understand that just because you CAN execute, doesn't mean you SHOULD execute.
---
Lordaeron is a bit weird. Should really mark the Scourge, Forsaken, and Scarlet Crusade as their own realms. 
---
Or if you are going for some sort of de jure claim map, Gilneas, Alterac, Dalaran, and Stromgarde were all city-states in the Kingdom of Lordaeron, no?
---
Lol, C'thun, remember [this shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBAwS7BOrIg)?
---
My favorite forum post is about how the streamers ruined leveling opportunities in the stress test. People were really shooting for that level 5 moon.
---
Ahh thanks for clarifying it then. I assumed it wrong then
---
He's saying you need evidence of it not being present in vanilla.
---
Gee it’s almost like people can play retail themselves but no one has access to classic so they have to watch streams...

100%. You said it in a much more concise way :)
---
Blue post yesterday.
---
Oh, I read the first part and immediately replied. Since he mentioned wallwalking the first time around, said nothing about it, then only commented the second time. Just my head for some reason didn't wrap around it right.
---
Crazy... you just opened up my eyes on a new perspective. Thanks fellow cult member!
---
That's me, Britta! The top of the A!
---
ty!
---
I just res subbed just for the sliver of a chance to say beta lol
---
I'm the troll on the B, is this what it's like to be famous?
---
I highly doubt you can be top dps for end bosses in mythic, without running DBM or Bigwigs with weakaura's when your entire raid will be. I'm down to see some logs that prove me wrong though.
---
If people know what they are doing, and the core (like 20/40) is spending a couple of hours every day getting FR gear, consumables and upgrades.. you'll get half way for a couple of weeks, but after a month a bunch of try-harders will be able to clear it if they use every option they have. dont underestimate getting FR/lvl 55+ rares from dungeons and crafting. It takes a lot of time to get an item, but if like-minded individuals focus up you can gear up FAST.
---
I logged in and ran around for half an hour.  I didn't manage to kill any quest mobs because the zone was so packed but I didn't mind.  It was really cool to see so many people doing the same thing.  General chat chat was buzzing and I didn't see a single troll.  I can't wait until August.
---
Asmon is about to rake it in with how long he's discussed classic WoW and all the things he's going to be doing with it.
---
I'm the undead at the bottom of the B :D
---
Was fun! Upper B part here!
---
Only proving that humans are incapable of working together for a common goal.
---
I think we can both agree, though, that this place can be a little nuts!
---
Lol'd at Perplexity being the best 1v1 rogue in the world lol. He's a good Rogue no doubt, but not even close to the best. Marm would fucking destroy that guy.
---
Nobody cares what rat-man did.
---
It could be where the server you normally play on is located.
---
I forgot all about this place...so many fun hours
---
I honestly don't even know if I want to play classic now...
---
I expect there are going to be a lot of players who haven't played private servers.
---
If you've in a guild of private server veterans this will be very easy, absolutely. If you're a guild of people who are returning to WoW after X years, or splitting their time between Live and Classic, there are going to be people who don't know what they're doing.
---
[Here you go big dog](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/250/799/9c7.jpg)
---
Didnt mean to call you specifically toxic, just everybody in here in general. Im honestly surprised you didnt enjoy raiding. To each his own i suppose
---
You can actually climb on top of the door on the back-side of the mountain and get in.
---
&gt; Well shimmering flats is in 1k needles
---
I only made a distinction because you did. And the area isn't controlled by any specific goblin faction. It's simply controlled by a group composed of goblins and gnomes.

I actually like to use the Gunnar style type lenses that reduce the blue light waves for eye strain. It adds a slightly warmer hue to the color but will still look brighter and with the added color vibrancy. Its seemed to work great for me with fast pace and high fps shooters when I’m playing long sessions. Eye strain/fatigue is real and more noticeable with age lol it definitely can slow your reaction time. A lot of newer gaming monitors have low blue light adjustments which does a similar effect with to the colors for the same reason. But I’ve gotten used to the lenses and prefer them. If you have an nvidia gpu they have color vibrancy built into the control panel now. If you didn’t know about this setting before you should try it. i love having mine turned up high it makes the colors pop more but sometimes makes it seem very bright and can be straining on the eyes after too long.
---
This is some low hanging fruit.
---
lol u noob dalaran is in broken isles xD
---
I'll have to remember this for august.
---
Nah, I think the new models look like ass.  None of them have the same feel to me, everything looks off or had more muscle added.
---
Top of the E, I WAS THERE
---
Link? I can say whatever I want came from a blue post :p
---
True classic gnomes gave the best head.
---
As far as clear time goes, about 5-6 hours if on farm and like 16 hours(4 Days of 4 hours = harcore at our age) of wiping and going again. If you're spending that entire timing with max buffs then you'll spend either about 50 bucks per week on gold, or another 10 hours per week on farming gold.
---
and doing what? hamstring, run, hamstring run? and let the ranged/casters do the rest? or get rekt in the crowd?
---
I see the necessity for it, but when we get to opening the gates of AQ what happens then? Will they bring it back for something like that or will it just be tough luck and long queues?
---
It was tough and it was long
---
I would think it's more clickbaity if I included everyone's name. I just didn't want a giant title.
---
If you are wanting to heal you might want to consider Paladin. Priests are great but be prepared to get stomped by rogues and UD players if you go alliance - if you are used to TBC/WOTLK disc you will be disappointed becsuse you are a LOT easier to kill in vanilla.
---
Stuff that happens in beta is def not world first
---
Reddit in charge of understanding mitigation.
---
Agreed. I could listen to hours and hours of this in depth classic raiding on a podcast.
---
Because the level of viewership correlates with the level of excitement in seeing the goal accomplished. Numbers don't lie, more people were interested in watching Asmongold kill Van Cleef than Un'unat. 
---
You can point out that Method pulls huge numbers on their world first race or that people could go and kill Un'unat themselves and they can't do that with VC yet, but the main point of my comment was to respond to your general negativity that you have pushed throughout this whole thread. I don't know whether it's because you don't like Classic, you don't like streamers, or you don't like Asmon/Esfand in particular, but whatever it is take it down a couple notches and just enjoy that Classic is coming.
---
I'm tired of seeing streamers doing these pointless things on the top of this reddit....
---
Not to be a whiny bitch but I really don't understand why it seems like every core legion mechanic seems to have been forgotten about when making classic.  Like did they even go through their old patch notes and try to undo some of the changes?  ie: character height, chat settings, swimming up, etc.  It's kind of frustrating.
---
Lol, welcome to Vanilla Hunter. You don't get a pet until lvl 10 and then you have to go tame other pets to get all the ranks for it's abilities, raise it's loyalty, and raise it's level to yours.
---
I use dbm, weakauras and recount for raiding sorry i wasnt more clear with my post but i also do not do mythic raiding due to time and not in a core raiding guild
---
I'm on bottom on B :D
---
I don't think you're going to make anyone "feel better" with this post... I really doubt anyone cares about that inconvenience, or wouldn't take this as a trade for getting in. If it's not complaining, then it's just another "I got into the beta!!!1!" post, as far as I can tell.
---
It was a big achievement
---
Calling classic beta clears world first like like claiming you’re the first person to ever have sex.
---
World first for them. There will be more “world first” when it goes live too
---
Both are wanted in pvp and pve for different reasons.
---
Gearing pala for pvp is a bit more difficult because early on there is a lack of healing mail/plate so you are not yet the immortal cleanse/healbot you are meant to be.
---
I'd say pala, their buffs are just op.
---
Like does this turn up rain? I'm all for it if it does.
---
I think you just pass through it, it doesn't TP you or anything.  I could be wrong though.
---
Dude -- you're not going to stay married very long if you don't let her pick a class that appeals to her. Any duo will be fine.
---
honourus here ;) was fun!
---
Yes that's what i was saying, the mobs where doing so much damage that it was very stresful and a race for healer's mana
---
I saw them killing the mobs just before the tank was about to die multiple time
---
Is that a Russian keyboard?
---
Yep, intergers are 0, 1, 2, and 3.  3 is the highest, 0 the lowest.

Carried by streamer priority of course /s

Epic.
---
Well people did stupid stuff more often I'm vanilla. Also less competition.
---
"To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account."
---
Direct quote... I'm pretty sure "participants will also need to have an active subscription" means yes, you have to pay $15.
---
ah that's fair, i can believe it then. I thought you meant you weren't running them and it was pretty sketch.
---
cringe
---
We have much more appropriate tools available today to ascertain quickly and pinpointedly who the idiots are in your raid long before your standing in front of Vael. We have logs and meters and different approaches to how we evaluate performance.
---
There are going to be millions of people playing this, its not going to be difficult to curate your raid enough to at least be void of morons.
---
True, but it's not uncommon for guilds to recruit Druids last. The demand is there, but the supply isnt crazy
---
Is threat operating properly vs. actual classic?
---
What I have read suggests the non-boss elite mobs are where damage seems too low, more commonly.
---
I for one am glad I’m not playing beta, I feel like it’ll just tarnish the actual release. Then again, this is coming from a pserver player (which I am abstaining from currently)
---
RemindMe! 96 days
---
Weapon swapping doesn’t trigger GCD in the beta. I do it a lot on my UD warrior.
---
At least its less hostile then other subs i frequent. And you can have some discussion without people having a complete meltdown which is a nice thing. 
---
Have a nice day whereevery you are man =)
---
Shieldblock always only takes off 5% ish damage, the amount of damage you block extra is not the reason, it's the crushing blow reduction. (I don't actually think you could block crits, that was based on defense rating AFAIK)
---
I remember tanking zul gurub on my warrior back in vanilla for the first time and I was wondering wtf I was doing wrong because hakkar was destroying me even with pretty decent gear. Later on I figured out why, turns out I was getting hit with a crushing blow all the time.
---
However I don't know if this bss were just marked as boss level (which has 15% chance to crushing blow you) or if he was level 40 (which would mean 50% chance for a crushing blow). Eitherway shield block would shave off 12.5% or 30% respectively.
---
Can just as easily spin that "it's almost like nobody gives a shit about BfA anymore while a ton of people are excited for Classic"
---
If you aren't satisfied with a Classic to BfA comparison, how about 8.0 to present day? What's your explanation for the across the board (Twitch, YT, etc) drop in viewership of retail-WoW based content since about Nov/Dec of last year? Most 8.2 based YT videos did worse than 8.1 videos from the same creators, despite 8.2 being a far more extensive update.
---
You don’t have to say retail anymore. You can just call it WoW
---
Don’t wanna bug you man, I’m sure people bug you with stuff all day long. 
---
I started in WoD but I’m very excited for Classic! I wanna roll Paladin based off the “pick your class” videos I’ve watched, but I’m curious if Paladins can tank 5 mans or not? 
---
I’ve heard lots of different answers and I know you play Ret, so thought you might have a good answer. 
---
Thanks for your time! I’ll def be sure to drop by your stream!
---
Yeah and if you go into the resto tree and reduce cast time your rank one will only be a 1 second cast making it perfect for spamming while leveling.
---
Both of them are being ported.
---
They really should reuse/remake these to advertise the launch of Classic.
---
&gt; Like did they even go through their old patch notes and try to undo some of the changes? i
---
Yes. People asked them to. Not being jokey or snippy... this sub a few months back was an... interesting place.  There was a lively debate about whether or not the debuff limit should have been removed.
---
Before beta was released I was dead set on hunter, most likely orc. Now that I’ve been watching the beta I’m starting to lean toward my first main. Undead warlock. Nothing compares to the tirisfal glades/silver pine aesthetic for me, and I love the Undercity and forsaken as a race.
---
But knowing me I’ll end up going Tauren shaman or something because that’s what will feel right in the heat of the moment.
---
&gt; RemindMe! 96 days "do this"

BLIZZARD PLEASE GIVE ALL 5 THE TABARD AS A TROPHY
---
OMAR PLS
---

---
Oh they're performing *something* alright.
---
Nothing screams maturity like calling people retards
---
I'm not gonna jump on the easy tips is bad. But really at this level gear doesn't matter, warriors can be kited easily all throughout vanilla but at his level especially. I would regularly beat level 60 fully geared warriors on my 49 frost mage twink in vanilla times. It's just their biggest weakness, being kited and they have no where near enough abilities/items to help with that. 
---
BIG warning to anyone wanting to roll warrior and do pvp in classic. You will get kited like ALL the time and it will SUCK.
---
Right, this. They get such a bad rap since everyone thinks they are low tier, but they'll always be brought to raids regardless for gear splitting/innervate/brez. Hunters and druids get brought about equally to raids, but there's far fewer druid players in comparison.
---
I actually think like the guy on the right. I didn't renew my subscription based on a small chance that I could get in the beta, and I'm genuinely happy that it doesn't come out until August so I get most of the summer to do outdoors stuff I like before spending my weekends glued to my computer. I think that makes me only a little better than the streamers.
---
Probably half of a druids best gear pre raid is cloth
---
&gt; Not only that, but you can abuse the layering system to 'refresh' your farm spots for some juicy new rich thorium veins or black lotus spawns.
---
Yes. Cause nobody is farming those veins on the other layer. Nope. Never.
---
I’ll be on Horde otherwise I’d be Pally. My alliance toon will be Pally
---
Remindme! 95 days
---
This is exactly what I thought when I saw it. Maybe some interracial shit happening and Gnomes are alpha.
---
It won't reflect real game stats at launch. The class spread nearly never changes from original Classic through pservers.
---
You'd need a sample size of over 100k on that poll to likely be reasonably accurate and likely only once the majority of players actually have playing experience.
---
If a GM sent all 5 of them the tabard in the mail as a trophy, that would be the best ever
---
I dont think reddit is representative for the whole classic community. Warlocks will probably go down a bit, druid/pala will go up imo (and warrior btw  #1 by a large margin)
---
Don't you try to get out of this conversation. I was enjoying myself!
---
Yes they will. It spreads via Guild. Eventually players like this end up on several Guild blacklists and finding a group becomes suddenly difficult.
---
You're right that random people in General may be less interested in one-off incidents like "swiping a chest" but you're wrong to say it has no impact.
---
Well have fun outdoors :P i will be sitting here searching for a good game to play .. like the for a few years now.. any day now
---
 RemindMe! 96 days
---
Cringe shit. Put down the tide pods and walk away...
---
Yeah totally man,  Imagine being able to express your opinion on the internet and watch whatever you like. ..Oh wait
---
Wow that makes the fight so trivial haha. Glad they patched that out.
---
it's a fucking beta
---
You could always try [searching](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bor1kn/ion_explain_layering_and_duration_best/).
---
Well we can cont tomorrow :D its 2:30 am here in germany and i have to be at work in 8 and a half hours
---
Yeah, that's why I take all the surveys on here with a huge grain of salt. There's a huge sample bias compared to the 90% of people who will be play all the way to 60 but aren't on here.
---
MC should take about 2 hours max if on farm. 30min-hour if your guild is good. The first attempt will probably take about 6-7 hours just cuz of aqual quints shenanigans. After the first couple of clears I would say bad guilds will clear in about 4-6 hours. If your guild is taking that long then you should probably find a different one because it won't survive.
---
How do you get a name reservation? It's not like there's a pre-order for Classic WoW.
---
there's no way you are this retarded.
---
Shamans and paladins can both tank 5 man content reasonably well. They struggle in the later content due to a lack of taunts, which are necessary for tank swaps.
---
I’ll try with my limited knowledge to address your points in order. 
---
1- yes he had Aggro but with the hunter doing so much damage asmon had to really work to keep it, I assume this means having to eat the extra auto from parries to maintain rage and threat generation. 
---
2- sounds right, if the hunters goal was to kite and get more autos out jumping down seems to be the smart thing to do. 
---
3- on the trash clearing up to the final boss asmon was having a hard time with even keeping sunders up on the trash, I don’t think hamstring kiting under the circumstances of this run would have permitted for this to work. 
---
I really think being so under leveled and how that effected the run makes a lot of the common sense stuff you said not very viable. If they could rely on cc working or having a more reliable threat source I would expect the run working out as you suggested it should have.
---
Tell you what.  I will adjust my post, just to make you feel better about it.
---
Awesome, I was stuck on the other layer where absolutely nothing happened.
---
To be fair, i believe 100% of the skill in this was elsewhere in the party, not asmon lol. I laughed after he said "after every whirlwind im going to bandage," then immediately forgets.
---
Yup. Instead of sitting in trade chat using it as a glorified IRC channel or complaining about one thing or another it's been one he'll of a ride to see how far these guys push beyond the barrier to generate hype and interest yet folks who don't see this benefit are still salty.
---
gotta ride the classic &gt; retail karma train while its hot my dude.
---
pretty sure theres a hidden strength buff for men thats only noticable at that level, vice versa hidden intellect buff for  women. OP, do the same shit with a caster class and see what happens
---
I hate the new models. The old models should not be compromised at all. If you want changes you are welcome to play bfa this wasn't intended for you. I hate all the new models with a passion think they make all the races look cute and cuddly.
---
You're a good man esfand. Your stream is always wholesome and sweet. never change &lt;3
---
Remind me! 100 days
---
Sweet. I came all the way from Mulgore for that raid. Good times. Glad you got it on video. :)
---
Which I’m okay with! I know I’ll be healing/buffing in raids. Thanks for the response!
---
lol at this thread and the privileged generation.
---
Depends if the want beta testers in raids or not.
---
We need Twisting-Nether back.
---
Blood Plague?
---
Layering is going to kill the economy, drones are incapable of doing anything but quests in starter zone on launch. explore xp, fishing or grinding mobs outside in a group are unheard of for them.
---
Watch them cry about a ruined economy soon after.
---
Arcane crystal and black lotus here i come!
---
Hey, he graduated from his mom's uterus. That has to count for something.
---
Ah, thanks for the info. One more question though, if you don't mind. Doesn't your swing timer reset when you switch weapons?
---
That isn't a source that is a lawfirm advertisement. A source is case law, or at least law textbooks sources. You are completely out of your depth and should go back to the kiddie pool. This isn't something you can solve with a short google search and posting the first link you find. You are the "reddit white knight lawyer" you are whining about.
---
Blizzard is not at risk to losing their copyright if they don't send a CnD to every single pserver. That doesn't happen anymore, you are at risk of losing your TRADEMARK but again that would only apply to things that are under trademark, running a server isn't solely a trademark issue. So as long as we aren't refering to playing the game as "world of warcrafting" or "WoWing" that isn't going to be an issue either.
---
You can lose your copyrighted work in 3 ways. By selling or transferring it, by being a freelancer (which can't apply here), or by the holder dying and 70 years expiring. None of those are happening with pservers so no risk of loss of IP. 
---
Stop spreading misinformation bullshit about a topic you clearly being a "reddit white knight lawyer"
---
Wonder why when you google ["If you don't defend your copyright you lose it"](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=If+you+don%27t+defend+your+copyright+you+lose+it) that it is only filled with links saying how that phrase is fucking bullshit? Because it actually is.
---
Unfortunately I just tossed mine in the recycle about 6 months ago
---
Making alts for the sole purpose of farming gold is a complete waste of time.
---
I googled this yesterday when I got into the stress test. I was like it’s fine I’ll put up with the blur. 10 minutes later - to the Internet!
---
I mean even I'd rather play classic than retail right now (as evidenced by the fact that my retail guild isn't raiding tonight and I'm playing classic beta) but that's not enough for the people on this sub. 
---
It's like North Korea or some shit...either the dear leader is infallible or people start questioning your loyalty and wondering if you're a dirty retail sympathizer. 
---
I don't tie my self-worth to a 15-year old game. It's not going to take you back in time, sorry guys.
---
Probably - I’m not good enuff to care haha. I just weapon swap instantly if some filthy alliance physical dealer comes at me
---
Good thing you’re there to report broken shit then eh?
---
Isn’t layering supposed to be limited to starting zones and limited to a few weeks from launch anyway.
---
your description of the vanilla BWL is percicely on point. my ow  guild died on the floors of Razorgore's Room.
---
However, I think your assessment of classic BWL is wrong. I did BWL on a blizzlike Private Server, and we oneshotted both bosses (actual hard fight was Firemaw). A lot of Meta has developed in the last decade, and no matter what actual armor/dmg values the Bosses get, they are not as hard anymore.
---
One good example for that is from a Podcast (Countdown to classic I think). The tale is about a Huild clled "Guards of Honor", who progressed through AQ40 until they got stuck at Princess Huhuran. after wiping again and again for months, the guild decided to require every player to pop Flask of Titans, which promptly gave the Guild the desired kill. However, this behavior of stacking everything was so unheard of and bewildering to the rest of the server's raiding community, that the guild got called "Flask of Honor" from that point forward. People don't play the way they used to 14 years ago.
---
However, due to a lot more Guilds surviving BWL, the new Guildkillers are Twins (being stuck on twins when many guilds clear AQ40 makes players leave), C'thun (due to lack of wipe resilience) and Naxx (high consumables requirements that - unlike previous raids - don't really get lower)
---
Most guilds I see do 2x a week 3 hr sessions, with some doing 1x a week 3-4.5 hour sessions if they are more casual; and in both cases there's usually an extra optional day for alt raids/farming lower tiers. 
---
Depending on your class/role you might also need to put in a little extra work to farm gold/consumables, unless you already have everything you need.
---
How did they get up there? The only method I know of is climbing up the corner of that pillar which I thought would be a form of walljumping (and therefore wouldn't work).
---
Yes, but a drastic disproportional amount of streamers got in over those who have actually played in vanilla/paid for the demo/ supported the game for years.
---
stop shitposting, this wont work once it launches, obviously.
---
Unclecreepy here, your favorite uncle always &lt;3
---
For real I wish it'd be Esfand though. Imo he's really the one who pulled Asmon into the Classic conversation and he's just overall more entertaining. 
---
Asmon's entertainment value is basically a result of his already large following, meaning interesting content just gravitates to him because he provides an audience. Also Asmon whines about everything, it's exhausting.
---
Healing Vael was a total joke (priest here). I ended up just spamming holy nova so I could keep healing while doing some damage.
---
Have a sub
---
For the most part they have less weapon damage iirc.
---
Something like this, with variation depending on situation. Take rogue opener with 1h and shield. Switch to 2hander when opening appears. Land hamstring and rend to prevent kite and to set up charge. When kited don’t chase, back off and either bandage or get range to charge immediately when combat drops (rend keeps rogue from stealthing for this charge). Use bandage early in fight to have it off CD when rogue vanishes or blinds to use his bandage. Store rage for finishing move of white-hit/overpower, Grenade, strafe, intercept, white-hit, execute (or hamstring until executable).

It was always so interesting to see people who NEVER pvp'd in raids. The total pve'rs were just a totally alien concept to me. Was also fun to trash them in duels tho to show them flashy gear isnt everything. :P
---
&gt; Isn’t layering supposed to be limited to starting zones  
---
that was sharding, which they disregarded.
---
BfA has issues, but it's still an overall better game. Leveling is the only reason I'm looking forward to classic, I dislike the Cataclysm quests. After reaching level 60, I'll might run each 5 man and UBRS once. But I'm not interested in any endgame content.
---
To be fair we really have to stop calling these beta runs world first's. That'd be like giving the retail world first's to whichever guide down it on the PTR first. Just silly
---
This could easily ruin the economy of the entire game within the span of a week.
---
Of course you wont hear much about this from influencers, because layering is awesome doods! Thx for the twitchbitchprime!
---
With modern strats and knowledge of optimized buffs, mats, armor sets - BWL is actually pretty easy.
---
that's the beauty of chatting, all the things you see as negative are all a matter of your own perspective about whatever and all it takes is someone else to say "hey, that's not that bad because 'x' and 'y'!" 
---
suddenly you start looking at it differently. atleast that's my experience!
---
if you need another wall to bounce some ideas off, i would be happy to listen! 
---
be well and have a nice day
---
LIES. But also, thanks for the chit chat.
---
Vanilla Brain Activated
---
Nobody around him.. I don't see why it would need to go to another "layer."  This is all PR bullshit.  It looks more like sharding than how they described "layering."
---
Join the Mobile Login Server Test and save the world. Service guarantees Beta citizenship.

wish that was me ;(
---
how is that obvious?
---
Source? I looked last night and found no information
---
&gt; This could easily ruin the economy of the entire game within the span of a week. 
---
how?
---
Transmog would literally nullify the entire point of your characters visual progression.
---
You just literally type in chat commands like he wrote above.
---
/who c-"Death Knight" l-"70-79"
---
All Death Knights between levels 70-79 inclusive.
---
/who z-Icecrown
---
Everyone in Icecrown.
---
You can save these as macros and press them any time you want if you have some common queries.
---
v a n i l l a =/= w o t l k\\
---
moron.
---
To 60, I agree with you, but there's also level 35 Prof alts which pay off with a lot less investment. When you consider that you can get 2 daily CD mats and have access to all the professions you want, for maybe 2 days /played e.a., they pay themselves off in less than a year and are a lot more passive than spending 48 hours of grinding.
---
we raided 4 times a week and didn't kill Razorgore. on current pserver, we cleared BWL in 1 evening from the first week onwards
---
How so? 
---
Being able to park an alt at a farming spot instead of having to run your main there after events is beneficial. Even more so if your main is less efficient in it's PVP/Raid spec and needs to respec before farming.
---
They are all in another Layer. Come on Blizzard!
---
So as Methods mythic progression has higher views, it gives more excitement, by your logic? Numbers don't lie
---
Hey I know that move it’s called layering!
---
You da man 🙌🏾🙏🏾
---
How?!
---
LMAO
---
I see myself in the screenshots :D  
---
  
---
Was fun, but then asmon logged on with tons of people, me and some others crashed and empty layer after =(
---
Honestly they aren't going to make much of a difference, the difficulty was coordination, competence and execution. If you don't realize you're about to blow up and kill half your raid, talents and itemization aren't going to help you. If you can't kite a dragonkin properly, talents and itemization aren't going to help you. If you don't know your rotations or how to play your character talents and itemization won't help.
---
Yes in cases where what's wiping you was a slight lack of dps or healing, but that's not what usually caused wipes
---
Nah that doesn't add up, there's way more attention on asmon right now because of classic, plus this was a world first and one of The most exciting moments in the beta, which again has so much hype built around it already, the number in this case don't directly correlate.
---
They never explicitly promised it would just be that.  They said they would *like* to do it that way, but they never said that would be the way they were going to go. I wish people would stop spreading this falsehood
---
No, it's actually nothing like that. Try again.
---
How is it obvious? What the fuck are you on?
---
Where is it obvious? Why would you even say that?
---
cause they said so, research please!!! layers are sticky, you cant just solo relog and spawn in a different layer, thats not how they want it.
---
Vael is a tank fight honestly. If your tanks do good threat, then dps can go all out. Guilds back in the day used multiple tanks, so all the dps would have to be behind those tanks on ktm. If all these tanks are sword and board + deep prot their threat is gonna be ass thus youll have low dps.
---
Seemingly you're able to have them proc if you time it right. Esfand made a video about it recently.
---
username checks out
---
You don't use the launcher in game do you?
---
Nope.
---
I was gonna roll priest, nice to see I'll be in demand :)
---
Shield block and Shield Wall is not the same thing
---
Tipsout felt in overconfidence and did the Great mistake on internet of claiming to be something Great without evidence.
---
He looks Like a nice guy tho, atleast after how much he pushed for Classic in his yt videos.
---
they are aware of the issue, its beta test and launch is three months away.
---
Heres to hoping they will fix of course.
---
RemindMe! 26 days “fix wow client”
---
No tide pods? My disappointment is immeasurable
---
What everyone forgets is that the reason Warriors had such a shit time leveling back in the day was because their talents were super janky. 1.12.1 Warrior talents are excellent, making warriors very powerful all the way to 60.
---
1. My point is that he almost fucked the run over by trying to get aggro, when Herod isn’t that big of a problem for a ranged DPS since they can kite him for a long time, especially a Hunter if he just jumped down. Herod doesn’t have that long of a time auto-stacking between Bladestorming.
---
2. It definitely was the plan to kite since the Hunter was too slow st jumping but still did it and once just ran about being dazed, just running without jumping down.
---
3. He was having trouble keeping Sunders off, but generally he had decent aggro. During the last rooms on the big pulls, aggro wasn’t really the issue. Hamstring kiting would have ensured he took less damage and whoever got aggro had a chance of kiting.
---
My point is exactly that nothing changes from the level 40 group doing this. Except you take more damage and have trouble gaining reliable aggro. You just have to take it slower and you can’t double pull. You don’t have to do some sick shit which the level 40 group would’t do.
---
don't you know it dog.
---
\&gt; but it's still an overall better game 
---
good to know i dont need to continue this conversation any further. We are going to simply disagree on too many details to come to some understanding about the relative hype or quality of each game. I guess I'm glad for you that BfA exists so you can play the game you like better, but I very strongly disagree with your assessment. Have a good one.
---
Holy shit this post brings back memories. Every word you said, 100% accurate.
---
Yeah I can confirm this. My guild was stuck on Vael for up to six months, my friends can never agree on how long it actually was. We lost probably a dozen or more people and had to recruit throughout. Thankfully we were fairly well managed; with the biggest click, about twelve people, my friends and I, being mostly low drama guys. 
---
From what I recall, we were the third guild to beat Vael, but we were probably the 10th or more to get to and attempt him. This was early days, well before AQ dropped. When we got him most of the rest of the dungeon fell into place. Honestly, I love that dungeon more than any other in Vanilla.
---
No they decided to layer the entire world.
---
I just started replaying Ocarina of Time, great fun!
---
I mean, if you have the choice of grouping with someone cool, someone you don't know, and someone you know ninjas, which is gonna be bottom of the list?
---
Why would you think that? Private server stats are always going to be a much better reference than random polls.

Play factorio
---
The old client has the glow effect too..
---
As an alternative to speed runs, I think underleveling challenges are a cool idea. Like, have everyone in your grp be level 13 for Deadmines, 16 for SFK, yada yada. It would be cool to see people really taking the dungeons serious as possible, and it’s like a built in heroic difficulty.
---
did Vanilla pugs during TBC as well. we did about 3-4 of those :D
---
Of course it is. The tech is obviously the exact same as sharding, they just renamed it and tweaked it a bit to make people happy.
---
you dont seem to know how layering works :)
---
This shit made me laugh too hard. Lol reminds me of the muffler attachments of the vags that get blown out when they rev the engines haha. Man too funny.
---
Yeah, I noticed this too... it bothers me quite a bit.
---
But to be honest, I don't think there is any chance they will fix it, I think I remember them saying something like "don't expect pixel to pixel accuracy" or whatever, they will probably just focus on the game breaking stuff from now on. A pity.
---
It's still the wrong thing to do even if it works vs bad players, you should assume they're good and do the correct plays
---
Asmons streams of day 1 BfA are a perfectly reasonable thing to compare his current Classic streams to. Provide another point of evidence to compare if you disagree.
---
Imagine getting triggered by world first meme lol
---
We were the 3rd guild through BWL on Blackhand. I was the paladin class leader. It was an incredible experience that won’t soon be duplicated. Oddly for us, the hardest chokepoint was not Vael but the Chrome puppy, til Blizzard fixed his spells.  Princess Huhuran to me was wayyyyy worse, farming nature resistance gear 30 levels below 60 in maraudon- kill me.
---
Yeah but think about the possibility now, twice the keyboard, twice the keybinds.
---
🎺🎺🎺... 🎺  🎺  🎺  🎺🎺....
---
Because I'm not 12.
---
What about joining groups? If I'm on layer 1 and my friend is on layer two. He can just invite me to his group and boom: I just switched layers. That's not a bug.
---
[There's a new, evolving meta for DPS paladins.](https://forum.classicwow.live/topic/314/spelladin-raid-dps-pre-bis-and-p3-bis-new-meta) - there's still work in progess, testing, etc. But early looks says it's got a spot in any raid. Low gear competition means more gear for other raiders, so better guild progress. Solid DPS. Looks to be fun as fuck.
---
And for the naysayers: !remindme 5 months when Spelladins are big D deeps.
---
I must be looking at dead space?
---
That pocket between SW, Dun Morogh and Searing Gorge and the N and S of Iron and Dwarvs?
---
Playing WoW is a complete waste of time. What's your point?
---
I’d consider you in the minority then.
---
it does get forgotten often when looking back at vanilla (especially EU vanilla, which suffered months of constant lags because of shit server architecture), but it isn't the same gatekeeper now anymore.
---
He could cast water-breathing and detect invisibility 0.5 seconds faster than the pleb with one keyboard.
---
Suppose there are 4 layers, that's quadruple the resources.
---
There are more than a handful people here you know.
---
Because they are going to bring their viewers/community to that server. If they are toxic they will bring that toxicity to that server. At least this is what I gather from it. Streamers have been known to cause havoc to the server when they plan an event and their viewers all show up. I personally don't care one way or another, I'm going to pick whatever serve I feel fits me best. The sad thing is that the Horde popularity seems to be carrying over to Classic, it would be nice to have balanced faction numbers.
---
How was BWL a guild killer lol? Naxx was the real challenge bc of all the movement and coordination it required. Real shame that Naxx came out so close to the end b4 the expansion. 
---
BWL was a fucking blast. We sold loot to other people on our server who wouldn't get to experience it otherwise.
---
I like to look at as many of them as possible and cross-reference them with others. I also like looking at the census of private servers and then seeing how the polls stack up. If you look at census and polls dating back to Nost. There is a steady uptick of Warlocks and correlating depopulation of Hunters and shamans. I have no idea what will happen when the general population joins the mix but I think a lot of the people staying long term will be the parts of the community that participate in the associated reddit pages, streams, discord channels etc. Just a theory. I could be totally off-base though.
---
I realized we're having a silly argument anyway, these guys are talking about the player's excitement in killing the bosses not the viewers
---
Tips is a trashcan

If your server pop is so high that it needs 4 layers, then the server economy needs 4x resources.
---
How is that any different to the end users?
---
Huhuran was absolutely horrendous. By the time we hit the Twin Emps we were relatively fine again.
---
This is an amazing pic! Rag looks so much better out of molten core. He looks incredible here
---
You’re making a lot of assumptions that I could argue on the other side. “I’d rather have to worry about a few low pop servers rather than a bunch of over populated servers”
---
Dead servers and over populated servers have both advantages and disadvantages. Some prefer one to the other. I just think layering is a way to not deal with merging servers. If they offer free transfers off, I’ll have no issue. If I’m stuck on a 10k pop server, it’s going to be a nightmare for everybody
---
Tested myself on a priest and a mage, the damage increased on both characters when I levelled on the stress test server
---
yeah, hope they will restrict that a bit aswell
---
Yeah, relatively speaking vanilla bosses are stupid easy compared to modern bosses. The singular issue I see will be getting full 40 mans. People are horrendously over exaggerating how difficult the game really is.
---
Hi, /u/WarpedSt
---
actually on our (shitty) server, doing MC in several evenings was normal. and clearing BWL in 1h nowadays is also normal. but I played on a 2nd generation EU server, so we had a lot less classic time than US servers did
---
I think these kind of realizations are incredibly important on a personal level. People can and do change, for the better and worse. It sounds like you have changed for the better, and that is something to celebrate, despite the person you may have been in the past. 
---
You can't change the past, what matters is what you make of it. Use it as a catalyst to be a better person, which is what it sounds like you are doing!
---
Wish I had more pictures but this is the only picture of my old rogue from back when I played vanilla.  I've cleared everything in vanilla up to 4 horseman in Naxx before TBC got released and got all the way up to a few bosses in Black Temple before I quit.
---
I also got up to the Commander rank soloing the Battlegrounds.
---
Stop making fun of Megan Fox. She's got feelings too.
---
Vael was very good at finding people with bad latency or crappy computers.
---
He also had a magical ability to make a player who didn't normally have connection or computer issues to suddenly start having them
---
+!00!
---
Pretty sure all they have that low is devo. So theres no reason to have it off
---
If Classic Wow even comes close to making this game as good as OSRS has done over the years i'll be happy.
---
They've added so much original content that fits in pretty good, excited to see the same here
---
They likely won't.
---
These statements are not mutually exclusive.  SOMEONE clearing and literally every guild who ever tries always killing it are not the same thing.  Yes it will be cleared very quick, by the guilds he is not referring to, there will still be these guilds regardless of how quick others do it.
---
If anything it will make them happen more bc now you'll have the "LOOK AT ALL THESE FOLKS DOING IT WHY CANT YOU" mentality.
---

---
I always loved this blog and saved it when it was shared after the Classic announcement - [https://eightyearsinazeroth.blogspot.com/2012/03/1-1.html](https://eightyearsinazeroth.blogspot.com/2012/03/1-1.html) 
---
It's so good.
---
Was the pillar thing patched out or something? I remember in Wrath to get in to Hyjal you had to delete your hearthstone and unstuck through invisible walls or get a mob into a certain place to shadowstep through the wall as Rogue.
---
I will remember him with you, brudda
---
I think it’s fair to consider the average player is better than back then as well. So running out with whatever on you is expected.
---
On top of that, I don’t agree with talents and better itemization won’t make much of a difference. The entire point of my post is that better gear and talents gives people more leeway in fucking up in certain situations where it isn’t a auto wipe, but where proper healing, CC’ing and tanking is needed to not wipe. Where gear can pull the terrible/mediocre people through.
---
People also tend to forget that the average current player is also bad and will be running garbage specs with bad gear.
---
Yes good/top players will clear content quickly, but good/top players cleared content in Vanilla quickly. BWL was cleared (except a bugged nef) the first week it launched in Vanilla despite having no idea how to do the encounters.
---
Enjoy those twin emps. Sweet Jesus.
---
Garrick Padfoot is gunna be so hard to tag.
---
Two months? You could wait two days and be far enough behind the tidal wave
---
obviously there are infinite layers, you know if you repeat this 10 times you'll see 10 different veins in the same spot. /s       
---
in all seriousness being able to switch characters and log back in onto a different layer seems like a bug, assuming (hoping) it's not intended
---
Damn! I am doing pve (at least on my main), my playtime will be limited and ganking will kill my leveling time.
---
Don't yuck someone else's yum.
---
it wasn't tough in my opinion
---
Once it's on farm it shouldn't take more than 3 hours to clear both for the average guild.
---
I still consider Thise clear times being part of the minority on private servers.
---
Fair enough. I just accepted a job offer today, but would have been able to play quite a lot the past two months. The timing is pretty bad for me for the actual launch because I'll be very busy with the new job, so beta would have been a good time for me to have a blast with no other big commitments. Oh well, some things just never work out.
---
Hahaha get it
---
We don’t know anything about number or name of servers.
---
This song is so stupid... I LOVE IT
---
Looks great on Asmons stream, so many people!
---
yeah we have 1.12 Itemization (including 1.12 PvP gear), 1.12 Talents, modern internet connectivity, modern server infrastructure (remember months of EU lag), and 14 years of Meta development (e.g. Engineer being **the** standard profession for Warriors nowadays), and ofc we know exactly what the bosses do
---
Hi, /u/fant_azia
---
There will be 13 na, 15eu and 2 oce. Source: uncle’s podiatrist works at blizzard.
---
&gt; Everything was longer, based on farm and harder
---
Sounds great to me.
---
We let a pally off tank supression room. We never made it any further. Then i took over as tank druid. We got all the way to chrom. Needed better tanks and healers. Druids just get one shot so easy if your healers arent ready for those crushing blows. Warriors can shield block druids cant. And pallys cant taunt so they arent welcome really.
---
I kindly disagree. Layering is theoretically applied to the entire continent not just the local area. So it doesn't matter if he is alone, but rather what matters is the current player count on the layer in which he presides. 
---
I agree with your sentiment though, characters should be locked to a single layer or something.
---
This doesn't make sense. Sure you can use layer hopping to get an advantage as an individual, but you're doing nothing to mess with the economy. The number of resources scales with the population of your server. If your server pop is high enough to need 4 layers, then the server economy needs 4x the resources of a single-layer population.
---
on our private server, all guilds and pugs do it in 1 evening, except maybe 1-2 semi-pug guilds...
---
[deleted]
---
I mean... they aggroed other mobs and made it without any real issue as well. It was pretty cool to watch though.
---
To be fair browse new in any subreddit will give you near a lethal dose but yeah im doing it for the same reason
---
Remindme! 97 days
---
I did have a much more complicated map with 4 times as many factions, with small sections for like frostmane trolls and defias brotherhood, and changing the colour of the ring from black to grey if the town was lost, way more small circles for  lone cabins and farms and mines
---
you can see kind of what i mean here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/abnl95/times_change_lets_take_a_look_back/
---
but if you face people with too much info, most people just get confused and move on, this post already has twice as many thumbs as the that one
---
Depends on what you're trying to do.  
---
At PvP?  Not much better.  Holy heals more attacks less.  Prot has no place in PvP except for reckoning bombs.  
---
for PvE Prot can tank dungeons and whatnot and there's always more involved in tanking.  But for raiding Prot will never be more than an OT and most don't want a prot OT either. 
---
Holy is good at healing in PvE, but they mostly spam 1 spell, multiple ranks, until they get enough crit then they just spam max rank.
---
They also only had one shot at it. A wipe would have meant all the trash respawning and having to start over. Was actually pretty fucking tense.
---
Yeah looks like you're right, the staves stay equal with the other two-handers during levelling but past ilvl 60 the weapon damage falls behind.
---
I hope streamers keep there server choice private.
---
The beta is not indicative of how it actually plays out on live servers. 
---
1: this is Soda, everyone wants to kill Soda because he's a big streamer
---
2: Everyone in this beta is a special boy just for being in the beta. They all want to do cool shit for their streams.
---
3: There isn't a lot to do once you're level 30 and have BiS. You can either PvP or do Dungeons well outside your level range.
---
In reality, most of the time sadly people just watch you die because they need to farm/gather as much as possible. Or they're on their way to a raid and the guild leader will be pissed if they're late.
---
Wait this is actually good
---
Layering is world wide and will last a couple of months.
---
Why did I expect a hentai rag with titties or somethn
---
How was that a catastrophe? I got stuck in queue for a couple hours, but that's what a stress test is.
---
I was able to get to Thousand Needles later :D Good stuff, Blizz!
---
I'm just messing with you. But if you want vanilla water just set liquid detail to lowest setting.
---
Just imagine how rich the devilsaur mafia will be on launch with layer hop.
---
A good compromise to the issue is a 20-30m cd before you can change layer again.
---
Pepe memes.  Cool...
---
The only big named dragon I remember that you controlled in the Warcraft 3 campaigns was Sapphiron as a frost Wyrm.
---
Uh... less dwarves than gnomes? You people need help.
---
lol I like that
---
The guild I was in, we never got stuck on vael.  
---
Vael killed guilds guilds, but Hardcore guilds breezed through vael and ran headfirst into firemaw's bugged ass.
---
Hi &amp;Company! Its nice to see you. Love your streams dude &lt;3
---
I FORGOT ABOUT AUBERDINE AND FORGOT TO VISIT IT 
---
oh god many early afternoons after school drinking microwaved coffee and playing in auberdine so many years ago
---
You aren't wrong.
---
Now that’s a bad ass picture
---
all linked aside from goblin, most likely.
---
Ohh yeah duhh obviously /s
---
Horde or Alliance? I don’t remember that name.
---
Hi, /u/oorskadu
---
Get this to the top. It needs more upvotes. We seriously need to keep talking about layering.
---
Ra ra oh la la la
---
I want your bad Scholomance
---
If it makes you feel better, as a Horde main I'm most likely going to roll Night Elf Druid, because of how their PvP armor looks.
---
I don't imagine WoW is going to have a massive problem of people rolling on servers for streamers. Leveling to 60 is a fuckin' investment, man. 240 hours.
---
That sucks. I hope they let us know before it actually launches.
---
Sounds legit.
---
I love how annoyed Asmon gets with Esfand talking nonstop. You can hear him tempering his anger. (just shut up and listen)
---
Have you bug reported it? This might be a low priority that won't get fixed, but it's worth trying all the same.
---
So is wow.
---
In Retail, you are a "hero" doing errands
---
In Classic, you are a common man doing heroic things.
---
Most likely All Alliance Linked and then All Horde Linked both faction specific. 
---
Goblin auction house will only be at booty bay and be cross faction
---
Then why are there so few Warlocks on the beta.
---
Even 1000s of years ago people worshiped kings and royalty so it isn't exactly new. Even roman gladiators had tons of groupies.
---
Yikes
---
I hate that as someone rushing 60 I'm forced to do this to stay competitive.  I'd rather have one set of devilsaurs to pvp over not 4.
---
I always leave Census running in the background on PServers. I've noticed a rise over the years on both Horde and Alliance also a slight decrease in hunter shaman and rogue. The closer to launch we get the more people are starting to participate in the community so we're seeing even more changes in intended class populations. This poll came from a warrior stream and Warlocks landed in top 3 makes me think we could see a lot of people that are just joining the community roll caster dps and since Ele and Balance are not viable for raiding in classic. The other options will fill up a lot more this go around. Just my crazy theory though.
---
Classic servers for free have been around for years idk why people need WoW classic to play classic.
---
Don’t worry. It’s there. I’m in Beta now and it’s outstanding.
---
He actually hasn't even started yet
---
Wow, awesome work OP.
---
I dont get why people are downvoting this. It clearly shows how exploitable laying can be.
---
There is a huge discord already.
---
I was in a different layer :(
---
girlfriend is a bad thing? my dude
---
&gt;  ele shamans healing.
---

During the god old days I was playing a pale, sadly heal (wanted retribution but it was impossible) 
---
In my memory the first bosses weren’t so special. There was one hardcore boss, Which troubled us quite a lot was the one in which I needed just to dispell. This was very intense at least in my memory. 
---
However my guild in that time was really something else. It was the first guild I went for raiding and it was really good coordinated and lead by amazing people. I can’t remember a lot of social groups, maybe just the guild officers. 
---
I was lucky enough of being invited, despite being just 16 years old during the time. I remember the first time in ts, trying to sound more old. :)
---
THEY HAD ANOTHER STRESS TEST!?
---
Mother.. fucker.
---
I never quested in Hinterlands in vanilla and I always regretted it. I discovered the zone years later and always thought it looked like such a beautiful zone and I wondered what the quest lines there could of been.
---
The server I'm on just has a bunch of people bitching about how Blizzard will screw it up. It's exhausting.
---
Theoretically, could the MT also be the GM and delegate the people management to a Master of Minions, for example?
---
Too bad WSG isn’t in beta
---
Yeah, I think it's for the best. I'm sure some people will find ways to abuse it for node and rare spawn farming, but overall I think the benefits far outweigh the negatives.
---
&gt; take that over never getting a spawn anyday.
---
This is not what this system is for.
---
Of course.  I should of said, in blizzards mind, that is the lesser of the two evils.  Because I feel that is definitely what their thinking, hence layering over the other options.  And I tend to agree as well.  
---
Either way we both agree on free transfers and it is something that will need to happen whether it is low or over pop servers.  They did in vanilla at least once (low pop since over pop wasn’t an issue).
---
Hm yes. If only they wrote a blog post about their plans for beta. Maybe they would let us reserve name names for 3 characters 2 weeks before launch which means we could organise which realms to roll on then.  
---
Oh well, not much we can do about it I guess.
---
I did a similar post a few days ago with many pre alpha maps  if you are interested 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqd5zw/here\_are\_some\_early\_alphaconcept\_maps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqd5zw/here_are_some_early_alphaconcept_maps/)
---
same one, realms stayed up for 26 hours
---
Right in the feels
---
Eh, we don't need to pretend
---
Haha thanks bloodfang was always my favorite tier set.
---
&gt; but if he has just some plate items from 60, his armour should be at least as high.
---
Are you sure about that? At level 60 in T1-level **full plate** Warriors will barely be pushing 4000 armor without a shield. For comparison, the random assortment of "requires level 30" mail gear (so this doesn't include quest rewards and likely isn't BiS) I just picked off of Wowhead has 2112 armor unbuffed when wearing a shield. On top of this Asmongold has Elixir of Greater Defense (+250 armor) and Devotion Aura rank 4 (390 armor), which adds up to 2752 armor. If he's Protection spec with 5/5 Toughness he's going to be pushing 3000 armor. On top of this he's in Defensive Stance for an extra 10% mitigation on top of what his armor is already providing (42% against a level 40 target assuming he doesn't have Toughness).
---
I'm not going to bother trying to figure out what junk the guy in that video is wearing, but there's obviously at least some leather pieces mixed in it, and it's almost certainly pre-raid stuff considering he's using the Blackhand Doomsaw from UBRS.
---
In other words, the Warrior in that video probably barely has 2500 armor. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if he had less than 2500 armor. Leather has shit for armor compared to even mail: **the Rogue T3 set has less armor (1456) than Asmongold had when tanking Deadmines at level 19.** It's plausible that Asmongold actually has *more* armor than the Warrior in your video by a significant margin.
---
Y'all need to learn about mitigation.
---
but i didn't get to test my class at level 5, fucking streamer privileges. REEEEEEEEEEEEEE. ^^^/s
---
Siiiip* yep MC was a good raid
---
Did they increase party size? the hell?
---
thanks for admiting your post is pointless
---
https://i.imgur.com/Jix2l1T.jpg
---
At least with a beta you're contributing data to Blizzard to help us all have a smooth launch.
---
Classic is a relic of its time, when MMOs were grindy time-sinks. WoW was actually the casual man's MMO when it was released, compared to its competitors.
---
You're right that a lot of it boils down to just being more grindy and slower paced, but that's part of the fun for some of us. There are some RPG elements like the wonky class balance that allowed classes to be truly unique, and leveling weapon skill, they were clunky but they were there, you know, in the game. You needed some reagents to cast certain spells. You had to feed your pets or it would get pissed and run away.
---
My experience playing WoW from 2005-2016 is that you'll find more to do in vanilla WoW than you are likely to find in BFA content. You still have a lot of old past content to chew through, too, so plenty to keep you busy. But for some of us who have played all that old content, I can't help but notice the amount of content added with each expansion is less and less and less and less every time.
---
For what it's worth, the classic quests and storylines were either heavily altered or removed completely with the Cataclysm expansion, so it's worth leveling a character on each faction just to get the original story alone.
---
Mobs are moving backwards when you stand over them, I’m pretty sure this didn’t happen in vanilla? https://imgur.com/gallery/SSjuif7
---
No, it isnt.
---
&gt;4) what i the best race an faction for druids? i think alliance will have more druids so should i roll horde ?
---
Everyone else already answered the other questions really well, so I'm going to touch on this one a bit more.
---
You are right. Alliance usually has slightly more Druids than Horde because Night Elves are more popular. If you decide "i'm not playing a cow ever" you're never going to be a Druid; obviously. 
---
Tauren have Warstomp which is useful in PvP and some extra health. NE have 1% extra dodge, which is better than the extra health for Tanking PvE. They also have Shadowmeld which is useful for drinking/eatting on PvP servers.
---
If you plan to go Feral DPS to raid, Night Elves are just better 100%. Blessings from Paladins actually help you as a Feral Druid, totems don't.
---
Wait till the next expac when no one buys it, sales are shit but subs are still high for classic.
---
Interesting, but this is fairly well known from what I've seen. I've seen this so often since Classic was announced. The very fact that we know this, know how to raid, and already know the ideal strategy will trivialize this boss and many others. Just it being 1.12 will make most raids before Naxx much easier, plus all the bug fixes and nerfs will be in as well. What made this boss difficult then will not make them difficult now.
---
Those are his responsibilities. Not necessarily bad things, my dude.
---
You should specify race or at least faction. Preists are special and have different racial abilities. For instance, troll has a mortal strike type ability you can easily spam rank one and it has a shield like thing that can combine with early shadow tree to stun attackers. Dwarf has fear ward.
---
No, it isnt. You cant phase if there are no layers/shards.
---
It matters, I've seen it matter and I've seen others dish out justice through withholding.
---
Slideshow is accurate. No one was running WoW on a decent machine lol
---
I'm sure they have some PR on this to not kill the hype.  Why would they not?
---
My first thought too.
---
Say it ain't so!
---
I can't recall ever seeing it on the vanilla realm I played on back in the day (although I know it happened) but when I re-rolled on a small, backwater PvP realm in TBC (Karazhan EU &lt;3) it was really entrenched and happened all the time.  Logging a bank alt to see 3-4 duels going and all the QQ and trashtalk competing with players hawking overpriced enchants on the bridge really added to the charm and ambience of the place! 
---
Here's a video filmed on the realm back in 2008 by Smitty just showing that it was a thing:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BfPkQJFwr8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BfPkQJFwr8) 
---
Gz Serkuss!
---
People don't want to hear this answer, they want to feel good about themselves when they inevitably clear BWL in one night.
---
Raids are going to be cleared in the same day they are dropped 100%. Vanilla mechanics are embarrassing compared to todays Mythic Raids.
---
How is this a shitpost? It presents a clear problem laying can cause
---
Honestly, I would love an introduction dungeon quest after you reach level 5 which gives you your first green/level 5 blue weapon. It could be utilized as a tutorial for newer players to show them the way of classic and a way to help with the burden of mass players on launch.
---
good shit it was reported then, isn't that the point of a beta?
---
Never forget original Scholomance, which to this day I consider the hardest dungeon I ever did.
---
Copy paste:
---
&gt;We have just wrapped up the first stress test for WoW Classic and while we understand the concerns that a number of you have mentioned, it helped us in many ways. Testing the login process is certainly an aspect that is very important for us to explore and we did gather some valuable data yesterday, so we appreciate everybody who logged in or even attempted to do so during the testing window – you have helped us prepare WoW Classic for release.
---
That said, because of some of the issues that were encountered, we were not able to test other aspects that we’d planned for. As a result, we will be doing another stress test on Wednesday, May 29 from 2-4pm PDT. The stress test realm will become available at 2pm PDT and the level cap will be increased to 10. For access, we will be including everybody who was invited to the test on May 22. Similar to last time, the stress test realm will continue to be available until 4pm PDT on Thursday, May 30 so there is additional time to check out the starting experiences.
---
Please keep in mind that while more issues could impact the play experience, it is very important to perform these tests so we can learn about and fix as many of them as possible before the release on August 27. We thank you for your continued support and we’ll see you back on the WoW Classic stress test realm very soon.
---
Hogger also sends his regards…
---
his face doesn't look very happy to me, kinda bad if the girlfriend is part of it.
---
It will take you like 4 weeks to hit 60. You can wait. Do fun stuff in real life and video game on your own time after.
---
The beauty of classic is out won't go anywhere.
---
Yeah, I guess you can say that the highly advertised and anticipated Method world first mythic progression of brand new content provides more excitement than Asmongold's impromptu dungeon run of 15 year old content. Call that a win, if you'd like.
---
But again, that was not the point of my comment. If you'd like to actually compare apples to apples, look at Asmongold's classic content versus his BfA content from earlier this year. Guess what, his classic content is smashing his BfA content. Similarly for Method's progression viewership numbers. From Wowhead, they hit peak concurrent viewers of 263k during Uldir progression and only 191k for Jaina. The trend is clear. 
---
For the group that is most likely to just care about World of Warcraft as a whole (Asmon's viewers), the preference for Classic is clear, and then even for the group that is most likely to care about high-end raiding and retail, there is a clear decline in engagement. What's your explanation for that?
---
The OP made a statement that was clearly a personal opinion and smuckers responded as though the YT clips of world firsts from WoD, Legion, and BfA were some sort of objective refutation that OP's opinion was wrong. If you can't see any sort of "magic" (as OP referred to) in 110K people tuning in to watch a fucking Deadmines run, then it's probably just not your thing - that's okay though.

&gt;  Layering is theoretically applied to the entire continent not just the local area.   
---
How is that any different to the end user?  It's not.  If it changes my surroundings, people, nodes, all the time.. that's exactly how sharding works.
---
So you're a head trauma specialist and worked in a mental health facility while also going to school for data analysis and still found time to get a wife and play WoW since Vanilla? What an interesting life you must live.
---
These guys are idiots - especially Asmongold. Why are you idolizing them?
---
Asmon stood in about 8 cleaves, didn't use ranged bow to get aggro or do damage. And he was telling Esfand how to play..smh
---
You'd just cheese the classes. For instance this run would be very easy and straightforward with 3 hunters instead of a ret pally and warlock who are 100% useless against high level mobs.
---
Of course I reported it, just wanted to throw it here to give it more exposure (hopefully).
---
All we know is that they want to keep the realms to a minimum and that there will not be an RP-PvP server on launch. We don't know how many servers there will be, or the distribution of PvE/PvP. 
---
The original vanilla servers were a 50/50 split as far as I can tell. So I imagine we can expect to see about that again. But no one knows.
---
Was there also goblin AH at Tanaris, Wintering, or Ratchet? I guess not, but I feel like there was a second one.
---
Yeah.  Or you get some new high profile raider (We got a scarab lord that joined our guild) and they were like "yeah we can totally do AQ40/Naxx."  Now, the guild had Nef on farm and we still got crushed on Huhu and Anub'Rekhan...  Don't think we even bothered with trying Patchwerk or Noth
---
You are correct but this is assuming the player base is PvE focused but vanilla was a different animal where casual players were more common and the WPvP action happened all the time including players coming to help.
---
As a player who went through vanilla and bc focusing on pvp mainly every time id get bored i would start wars in lowbie zones that never failed to end up locking the zone down for a decent amount of time from players coming to assist thier faction.
---
fuck you
---
From my understanding its not supposed to change dynamically, you're assigned at login or when crossing server boundaries (i.e. boat/zepp to the other continent). Some streamer clips show differently, but that could be a bug seeing as it's a beta
---
If you're enjoying something it's not a waste of time.
---
the devilsaur mafia won't exist. they only exist on private servers because private servers don't have a TOS. it's against the TOS to control the economy.
---
Just look literature. LotR is so good because hobbits, not elves, are the heroes. JK Rowling had to go out of her way to keep Harry Potter from being seen as the hero (he thwarted Lord V every year and STILL people thought he was a liar).
---
you know, they’ve been complaining about the layering as well - it’s just not in the front of their minds because layering isn’t on the beta server properly yet.
---
This stress test towards the end was some of the most fun I have ever had in WoW. From spelling out words with bodies in Org, to raiding Elwynn to duking it out in Gurubashi and everything in between. I honestly can't believe the amount of fun I had as a level 5 nothing character.
---
I like what they did for the Horde
---
Nah its a bad idea
---
Them leaving or quitting the game can have consequences for your server. Look at Swifty and Darkspear server.
---
Dont private servers glow more lol?
---
Oh Lordy, do you get butthurt at this too👌?
---
TIME FOR ROUND TWO
---
The 2 hours was when they were asking for people to log in, but they kept the stress test server up for a full 24 hours.
---
Part of a raid.
---
Well 2 primary reasons.
---
A. You're going to have to farm on your main anyway
---
B. It's a fuckton of time to invest into getting access to, at best, a mediocre way of earning gold.
---
Esfand has half the subs asmon has and that's really impressive considering he has like 10% of the viewers at most. I like both.
---
I can understand why they didn't do it.
---
It could have been a mess for a lvl 5 player who just did a few quest  having  to find a group by himself and go through a dungeon so early
---
And later in the game  it could have been very hard to find players at lvl 5.
---
Quick someone put together a BiS for level 10 characters
---
Much more tranquil than the [last moments for the alliance](https://i.imgur.com/AJtpHIS.jpg)
---
Stress test first 2 hours was expected to be terrible, but ever since then it's been nothing but a joy. Future stress testers, play it. The players make the content. it was the most fun I've had in wow in 10 years.
---
See you all next time, it's been great! &lt;3
---
I love how there isn't "I don't give a shit" option.
---
Majordomo teleported me to Molten Core, so I spent the last moments quite differently. But hey, my guild was Blackrock Swim and Dive so I thought it was appropriate.
---
Why is engineering the standard? I understand why it's very popular in pvp, but I don't remember grenades being that effective.
---
IM IN THIS SCREENSHOT :O "Ant"
---
It was nice to get in and get a feel for Classic.  Even submitted a few bugs.  That being said, kinda sucked being stuck on a boring layer at the end where nothing happened.
---
Hell no.
---
Watch them, sure.
---
I really enjoyed reading this. Started wow at 1.3, joined a PvP guild and never looked back (made r13 Warlord) until TBC wiped our guild out.  This was totally my experience in vanilla PvE, although it wasn't until this well written post that I realized.

/cry &lt;3
---
I didn't read this because I raised bowl and it was easy. Not super easy, but to today's standards it was easy. Aq40 and naxx are guild killers
---
Both are good. Warlock is better when it comes to organized PvP and you can raid with the same spec you PvP with while as a priest you'll most likely be healing in raids. Flipside to warlock is that they are more gear dependant and have a way higher skill ceiling, meaning you will actually have to put effort in while shadowpriests can just get rank 10 gear and spam 2 buttons to faceroll people.
---
Yeah, that's something that a lot of game/level designers take huge liberties with, abusing the heck out of ambient light levels so that they don't have to spend time plopping light sources everywhere. Realistically, every scene should be lit by a lot of point lights for in-world light sources, an area-wide directional light outdoors for sunlight or moonlight, and *very* rarely an ambient light source for a cave filled with lava or something.
---
Thank you for this! I've shared my personal experience from my days of raiding in Classic and I always use Vael the Guild Killer as a precautionary tale for those who want to raid but are determined to play a meme spec. 
---
Even in 1.12 guilds would still fall apart when they got to Vael. He is the ultimate raid check for any aspiring guild. I love hearing all these people think that a guild of random specs is going to be able to progress to Naxx. Not going to happen. Once a guild stops progressing that's when things become critical. Attrition is/was/always will be a problem for any raiding guild. For every person that's happy not making any headway, there will be at least 1 who is not. Even losing deadweight can hurt a guild's ability to progress because organizing 40 warm bodies to raid consistently is a bitch. Lose too much of your core and it's a death sentence. Normally, a guild's core are the people who are the primary contributor to a guild's progression.
---
I'm all for people playing the way that makes them happy. Unfortunately, the way balance works in Classic doesnt allow 1 spec to rule them all
---
My vanilla experience was different I guess. Help happens, but for me most of it was getting one-tapped and having to log onto an alt to bitch smack my camper. Help coming felt less favorable than a coin-flip.
---
That's pretty interesting actually, I always just look at current viewers
---
must be an RP server
---
&gt;reeeeeeeee streamers generate 200k twitch viewers, why do they get in and I don't?
---
why does that matter tho?
---
They spawned Gamon for those of us on Horde
---
I only really only follow one of the "mainstream" streamers in the community, but I will say that from my experience the best classic streams come from browsing through the streamers with low viewer numbers honestly - you'll find a diamond or two down there.
---
They said after phase 1 launch period it’s not coming back so many times I’m really not sure how else the devs can put it.
---
I'm being honest when i say; maybe challenging yourself would make it more fun? Deliberately use "non optimal" gear and talents to try and capture the true classic experience.
---

Final moments of the beta. &lt;3 
---
See you on the other side. We're coming home!
---
Wow PV Funservers lobby's wants to know your location
---
They didn't even do the one mechanic the fight has particularly well. Asmongold took a bunch of hits from whirlwind and it just doesn't matter. The dungeons really just aren't that hard, they are mostly about just getting enough stats to not die to the boss abilities and then you just tank spank them to death.
---
Also communication with other guilds to queue your trials so the server were not laggy.
---
Hey, we're you there in Northshire? I might have fought you! (I usually play Horde but wanted to see the boss hullabaloo I saw in SW at the end of last night)

Probably layered with a closed beta player

Better be a fast axe...

it presents obviously unfinished layering technology in a provoking way. shitpost.

I don't think you can objectively call BFA a better game. It's more convenient and has harder hard modes, to me that doesn't correlate to a better game. I prefer one that pulls me in and fosters social interaction to one that is solely focused on game mechanics.

Other then that it all  depends on your guild, how easy the raids really are, how far your guild have progressed in said raid etc.

thanks! luckily they fixed it and I was able to play tonight for a couple hours. was a lot of fun. recorded the whole thing

Vanilla WoW looks pretty decent right out of the box. I don't want to say that it's aged well, because the graphics were outdated when the game launched. People like to pretend they were state of the art and the bestest but that's incorrect. The game released with intentionally sub-par graphics so any potato could run it. This is common in MMOs. Slap on a ReShade profile and  [vanilla graphics look pretty good](https://imgur.com/a/MxXqE).
---
I played on a pserver with custom MPQs that updated almost all mobs, npcs, and players to WoD/Legion models. I also had one that updated some of the boxy trees to their Cataclysm counterparts. I also had one that replaced the tiling textures in the game with Legion tiling textures recolored to vanilla colors.  [I thought it looked pretty sharp.](https://imgur.com/a/jIdjo) 
---
I, personally, would like to see an option for people to play with updated models and textures if they want to, as long as care is taken to ensure any color/contrast changes don't confer a realistic advantage in PvP or something. It absolutely has to be optional, and arguably disabled by default.
---
A lot of us like to push games to the limit, mod the graphics and "next gen" old games. My FFVII or TES: Oblivion mod lists (all graphics, no gameplay) would probably infuriate some of the purists here. I get that for a lot of people keeping it all original is part of the nostalgia. But people play these games for different reasons. I am looking forward to the gameplay, community, class mechanics, hybrid tax, etc. I'm not terribly attached to the graphics and art style, nor are some other people.
---
Lastly, anybody who can't play and enjoy classic because of the graphics--whether they are old or updated--is probably playing for the wrong reasons and won't be around long anyway.
---
&gt; there’s something so satisfying about watching a Female Gnome humiliate a Male Orc lmao.
---
There is probably a porn for that.
---
Night Elven Empire? Lol what? Felwood? Feralas? Winterspring? They have ONE village in those areas. They don't ''hold'' them. They're contested lands.

---
&gt; If your server pop is high enough to need 4 layers, then the server economy needs 4x the resources of a single-layer population.
---
no it doesnt because the number of ppl picking professions that require x type of resources is not a constant. you can have everyone being a miner on one layer and everyone being herbalist on another for example, or everyone being a miner on 3 layers.
---
you're thinking in an organised pattern while communities act erratic.
---
Long shot but was anyone there in goldshire at the huge naked inn dance party when the server went down?
---
if you were, post a screenshot! It was amazing!
---
This was during Asmond's "raid".  We weren't in the same layer, but we all still had a ton of fun.

---
It was actually surprisingly seamless, for a stress test being hammered by thousands of hyped fans.
---
Login was problematic for the first 3ish hours, and layering quickly turned into phasing, but that might have been the devs testing out the layering system.
---
I got booted a couple of times when switching to a different layer. 
---
Not seamless, but maybe 4 DC's and 6 noticeable phases during a day of play.
---
Thanks for the great times everybody
---
Leveled all classes to 5 and fishing, stv arena was fun, beta looks so much fun QQ

I didn't mind the bounciness terribly. I mean I'd prefer it to not be there, but for me the game was already so cartoony that I guess it wasn't so jarring for me.

"We have just wrapped up the first stress test for WoW Classic and while we understand the concerns that a number of you have mentioned, it helped us in many ways. Testing the login process is certainly an aspect that is very important for us to explore and we did gather some valuable data yesterday, so we appreciate everybody who logged in or even attempted to do so during the testing window – you have helped us prepare WoW Classic for release.

What's up Hawthorne, Sundronez here from DV.
---
Had a great time working with hundreds of players to guide patchwerk from the bridge to SW Keep.
---
&gt;Because the level of viewership correlates with the level of excitement in seeing the goal accomplished. Numbers don't lie, more people were interested in watching Asmongold kill Van Cleef than Un'unat.
---
Of course people are going to be more interested in Asmon kill Van Cleef, VC is one of the most if not the most iconic boss in WoW's history, Uu'nat is just a random boss in a 2 boss raid in a shit expansion.....what kind of comparison is that.
---
And by the way, I completely disagree with your overall point, Asmon had similiar viewership numbers when he first killed G'huun, does that make Uldir or Bfa exciting content...hell no.
---
Took me like just under 2 hours. Would probably be less than half the time if I wasn’t fighting over mob tags.
---
We felt your spirits. It was a surprisingly emotional moment for me lol.

Oh my...

they are clearly joking.....

Prepare to be downvoted by the mob of BFA fanboys who think blizzard can’t be wrong...
---
Information, resources and simple wealth of knowledge back in those days were so VASTLY limited to today.  
---
It will be so interesting to see how the "people" of today interact when Classic drops.  
---
That sense of community has been a lost thing of the past that people crave and are most notably most nostalgic about.  
---
My BWL days were similarly experienced, I was a PVP Hunter and often got taken in for my kiting ability, and my god. I remember how much people raged when individuals stuffed up their jobs in those raids.  
---
That was from the Horde perspective, I wonder if Alliance was the same!

They aren't related. One is a direct gameplay change. The other isn't. You couldn't really even liken it to transmog, as transmog has a much more tangible impact on gamepay and economy than client-side models do.
---
To be honest, I have no idea any more. I checked out of internet and meme culture a while ago because the culture wars got boring. I enjoyed the whole incel vs transradfem for a bit but they never progressed beyond that. It makes me miss SRS and SA.
---
For some reason, the thing that I wasn't expecting was the old stormwind auction house, I saw it and was overcome with nostalgia
---
Not long at all. Group up with people and it's faster
---
&gt; Land hamstring and rend to prevent kite and to set up charge.
---
Rogue could just use throw to keep combat up. 
---
&gt;rend keeps rogue from stealthing for this charge
---
Rend doesn't stop stealth, it will just knock him out if it ticks while stealthed. If timed properly the rogue has time to stealth and close in.
---
haha this is actually accurate! Good call my friend
---
did they spawn him somewhere? i didnt hear about an org raid making it past the gates
---
This is what I was going to say. Guilds on my server that cleared MC also cleared BWL. AQ40 started to put distance between the guilds. Of the guilds that did well in AQ40, most guilds that either got stuck on huhuran or emps didn't do well in naxx either. I know our guild and a couple others cannibalized guilds that were stuck on AQ40 to feed the naxx burn out during the push before TBC.
---
It's not aganst TOS to farm a specific mob though. U can do it no problem. The only questionable area is if you try grief your own faction. But controlling them/killing all the devilsaur &amp; killing enemy faction over and over when they try is totally fine.
---
That saddens me a bit
---
I was so excited that the server was staying up - I didn't get a chance to play last night due to the lag. I logged in, the world loaded. Some fuck was /yelling something about furries in the gnome starting spot. It was glorious. I went to move forward and the server got turned off. 5 seconds of classic...

Found some other guys on their way to Jasperlode mine for the quest, we partied up, just getting there was an adventure, having to dodge the level 8 wolves and murlocs.
---
We got inside and delved all the way into the back, where a chest was waiting for us. We all rolled for it, I won, I got some potions and a staff that I gave to nnyxx the mage.
---
Then we fought our way back out again and returned to the road. Goldshire had never looked so good to get back to after such a dangerous quest at level 5.
---
It was the most engaging experience I've had in an MMO for a long time, and reminded me why I love this game.
---
I find BFA and the expansions prior to be so dumbed down that everytime i have tried to get back into, i just couldn't.
---
People often call the things i like about classic 'QoL' changes such as being able to queue for dungeons anywhere in the world, yet part of the fun of doing a dungeons was, going there?
---
and the over saturation of loot, it's like give everyone a gold star regardless of if they earned it or not.
---
You’re missing an “I don’t care” option
---
The population is going to spike right after launch. A lot of people that start the game wont ever make it to 60. So they'll inflate the number of layers, giving farmers more access to mats, and then leave. There will be an oversupply of mats for low demand after layering is turned off and as server populations drop towards a standard server size. 
---
I don't think it'll be a huge issue and will even out eventually. I think there will be cheap high level mats for a while but will return to normal.
---
I think you sort of missed the point here a little.... you can run lfr and get no reaction even though it’s the a world destroyer.  Yes I understand there’s mythic which is the real challenge.  But the point is still there.  You can kill a world destroyer with that much ease and get nothing out of it
---
Hunter Pets, Druid Forms. Next week will be amazing. Level 10 sounds like a completely new and exciting world. This is like an expansion pack.
---
30 MINUTES but i got lucky
---
I remember Ragnaros and Vael being absolute shit shows and once we got around them we cleared the rest with simplicity until Nef where it was a challenge yet again. If you get beyond Vael you should be able to finish BWL. Most guilds back then couldn't
---
I might be in the minority here, but killing Mythic Argus is one of the highlights of my raiding career.
---
Alliance could DI razergore and skip 90% of the mechanics.
---
You don't think you want it, but you do
---
Starting in the Orc/Troll area has a much less optimized route. Level 3 in 35 mins is pretty much the cap. Also when moving continents on the stress test it disconnected me and between ques and server instability it took 30 mins to get back on. Not sure if it's worth.
---
My explanation is that people have been waiting for classic for a decade, it’s been in beta for a WEEK and twitch viewers are exponentially higher for new products (does apex ring a bell??). 
---
Give it 6 months and I can guarantee basically none of these big streamers will be streaming classic wow. That’s not how their business models work, they flock to the ‘trending’ game of the month.
---
Do you really have to ask why a game (retail) that’s incredibly stale (new content patch just around the corner) is dropping viewers to a game that’s so early in its lifecycle it’s not even released yet? Pretty simple explanation.
---
I didn't take many screenshots except in Azshara - because it is on top 10 Prettiest Zones.

Imagine being this pretentious and rude and having the nerve to call other people toxic unironically. That's a special type of delusional hypocrisy.
---
I'm super excited for the game, and I can't wait for it to come out!
---
I think some folk are just a little too desperate to relive the nostalgia.  I'm cheesed that it's going to be the END of summer rather than the beginning, personally.  I had some time off and was stoked to loose a month or two before going back to work.
---
can you provide a source where they said so?
---
I don't hate all streamers; I've never watched more Twitch in my life than I do now and it's all for Classic. However, I DEFINITELY dislike a number of the most prominent streamers in the community, and Tips is definitely one of them because of this kind of shit. I mostly watch smaller channels because they actually provide the most interesting and informational commentary in my opinion.
---
It’s denial from guild leaders and their cliques, they’re too invested in pservers to accept that classic won’t fail
---
Where is leeroy jenkins though
---
Seems easy to ~~exploit~~ fix and ~~abuse~~ patch once you ~~understand how it all works~~ reported it.
---
&gt;Land hamstring and rend to prevent kite
---
Literally in the first second of the video he is hamstringed and rended. It did not prevent the kite. So, where does your imaginary magical christmas land scenario go from here?
---
&gt;When kited don't chase, back off...
---
Yes, because the rogue is just going to keep moving away if the warrior 180s... JUST KIDDING, IT'S DEADZONE KITING HE'S GOING TO STAY AT 5-8 YARDS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A CHARGE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF KITING
---
Good lord you have no clue what you are talking about.
---
I’m ready to finally log in and play and it will count. Really classic server. No private severs, no betas, no stress test..no running around in retail bored to death leveling new characters pretending its classic just because I’m in “old” zones...even though they are post cata zones..you know what I mean. I’m just damn ready for real classic WoW.

RemindMe! 100 days
---
For me, this was not only one of the most memorable and fun experiences in WoW, but in gaming as a whole. I haven't had this much fun gaming in a while.
---
A majority of my time was spent doing a bunch of random things and quests with my brother. I was a Gnome Mage and he was a Dwarf Hunter. I felt like a kid again just goofing around trying to see what we can do and what we can find. There's something funny about getting hyped over a green drop from a chest, or a Small Blue Pouch. He'd always win in the /roll though.
---
One of the most memorable moments was when we killed Timber, the Level 10 rare spawn Wolf. All he ever dropped were these cloth bracers, but the fun was not in the loot, it was in the strategy of the kill. We had to plan it all out because Timber hit hard and if we just went in there expecting to tank him, we'd get destroyed.
---
I not only have screenshots, but I also have around 6 hours of footage I plan to turn into a multiple episode mini series, showcasing everything from when we were struggling to log in at the title screen, to the final moments of the server being online.
---
I only had my character one day, I got 7 and a half hours of entertainment out of him, but I'm already a little sad I won't get to play again until August. I mean, if I can get 7 and a half hours of solid entertainment out of 5 levels, imagine what I can do with 60 levels!
---
I'm extremely glad I was able to get into the Stress Test. It was awesome. I can't wait for August!
---
You'll get no argument from me on any of that man. The long runs to instance are super immersive and great for chatting new people and hanging out. No flying means the world feels big and real WPvP can happen. Having to train skills and do class quests makes my character feel real and not just some digital avatar that magically learns new abilities just by filling up a bar twice.

I mean, it's definitely still data though. Not enough to draw a direct conclusion, but enough to think it should be looked into
---
This is the correct answer.
---
I’m thinking 10-15 minutes before you’re even able to log into another layer. If you try to log into again before the timer, you’re back in the same layer. If it’s full, tough shit; you wait the remaining time and you might be put into a new layer, or back into the one you were just in. 
---
Logging in and out shouldn’t automatically guarantee you’ll be in another layer.
---
Have you noticed the usage of the term feminazi has dropped off as the people who used the term have started aligning themselves with actual Nazis more...
---
My pleasure :)
---
The major caveat is that it depends on your starter zone and the player density in your zone. I *assume* this stress test, at least the earlier phases of it, were representative of that.
---
For example, the undead zone, questing is a non-starter. You have to grind. For durotar, just quest.

/r/classicwow downvotes almost everything. Useful or not.

Because it says their name- ClassicBetaPvE, just like on live it says their name-server.
---
there's comments in this thread doing exactly that, keep reading.
---
this makes me happy
---
With a packed zone as a druid, bit over an hour. it helps if you group with people for the tag quests.
---
I think that's probably true, but it's better than the alternative imo (extreme scarcity of resources relative to population size). Everyone is worried about lotus and devilsaur, but average players are going to need resources while they're leveling too. Speed levelers are always going to end up hoarding lotus, etc. regardless of how many are available.
---
Dwarves and Gnomes also don't have the Furbolg Hell labyrinth with spawnable pickup items for quest completion so its probably the best option.
---
Those goddamn mobs in AV, had to run from them sometimes

3) It's just as time consuming. I spent almost six hours with a friend last night just running around and messing around the continents. Seriously, I cannot wait. I spent all day today testing stuff out and leveling different classes and races. I put it at least 12 hours in the last day on a 1-5 leveling experience; so next week's 1-10 will be crazy.

Bolvar is a coward for not joining in our epic battle against Patchwerk in the throne room
---
I’m not the guy you’re replying to but,
---
1: I’m sure the dude meant intercept which can be used in combat,  if he managed to drop combat then a charge would be better obviously.  He should have been backing off instead of chasing for sure to land an intercept but I don’t think tips knows what stance dancing is.
---
And 
---
2:  In the situation he is describing he is saying get rend up so he can’t stealth your charge,  so in this scenario you are at range for charge, and don’t want him to stealth it.  If he does stealth you when you’re at range, the stealth is going to break while you’re still in charge range because of how slow you are in stealth.
---
Either way tips is obviously a bad pvper whether you like the guy or not.
---
We were the two night elves and I was the one corralling everyone in. That's so great. Maybe again next week!
---
I'm sure everyone had some weird bugs with the stress test but here was my main one. [layering seperation](https://imgur.com/a/FsDrxt5)
---
Joined a raid group, went to where they were. Found no one, only a wild Rag... I mean "Unknown". After about 3 minutes everyone popped in and Ragnaros became himself. What a time to be alive :)
---
2 or 3 layers are not hard to control since both factions collude for this type of farm The mafia is just an example of layer hop abuse , assuming it stays the way it is on launch.
---
there wasn't a leak of that in november.
---
Hard to tank when 90% of your attacks don't land. Just generate threat 4head.
---
6 days? not even 6 days /played right off the start with no other high level char support, no
---
I don't think you can but I'm intrigued that you may provide a screenshot of your keyboard
---
I bet grinding the first level is better in the zones where the first quest is a drop and not just kill things (where grouping becomes pointless). Dwarf starting area first quest is a wolf meat drop for instance.
---
World record is 4 days and 20 hours /played. But that was as a hunter, no way in hell you're gonna come close as a warrior.
---
Blizzard recently removed it from Battle.net now that Reforged can be pre-purchased. I was pretty disappointed.

And yet, they have followers. It's almost like the people who bitch about streamers are not the same people who follow the streamers and there is more than one type of person who is into WoW and appreciate it in different ways...
---
Here I'll change your mind:
---
All social media is "toxic"
---
I think they were out of consumables after 3 hours of clearing trash.
---
If you've familiarized yourself with as much as you can ahead of time, I'm sure you could do it. That first 24h will be the biggest key I feel.

BUR TIRAS - accurate.

---
I don't. I want to know which ones to avoid.

wonder why they never spawn stuff horde side! we were looking for you all in elwynn and couldnt find anyone :P

How about instead of it being active, it not being active and we keep the "MM" in MMO.

After this we went to Scholo and the door mysteriously opened for us, I think it was a sign that lord Omar was watching over us.
---
I think the fastest anyone got to 60 back in vanilla (not a pserver, but actual vanilla) was just shy of 5 days /played.  As a warrior, I think your odds of getting to 60 by yourself in only 6 days, even dedicating that kind of time, are slim.
---
But hey, you'll probably get pretty close.
---
McConnell is this your alt account ?
---
And I'm pretty sure that's a pserver record, and from what people have said about the beta that speed might not be feasible. 6 days might get you to 40 as a war... But definitely not 60. And OP said tank, hopefully he isn't planning on leveling as prot or can go ahead and add another day or two /played.
---
YES! I was hoping they'd give us level 10

You might be able to do in about a week if you play about 18 hours a day with an optimized route and all that. A warrior, though?

man thats too much
---
I wanna hear more about karl
---
There’s people who will do it in /3 days played and about 4-5 days real time. /6 days played even I can do that.
---
Now let's see them do cath
---
Because they are blindly supporting layering just to support it
---
This sub called everyone haters for months if you said the pop would die out after a month or two. After layering was announced, this sub said "guys it's all good, the pop will die out quickly so they'll get rid of layering after a month or two!"
---
The fact of the matter is layering can and will be abused as long as it's around
---
Remindme! 96 days
---
Why cant everyone be invited to regular beta...
---
I think that's a different argument. When there's a change like LFG? Yea different players.... But as someone who doesn't watch streamers I find it odd at how much people dislike them, or even youtubers for that matter. I  don't think thats a case of there being different players, but rather reasons that would lead someone to be that angry about someone. Many claim bitterness and it does make sense, but over time reading those forums its almost as if they don't like anyone that they think might think is better then them. That's not a casual thing, that's a self-confidence thing if anything.
---
I'll never not be salty that we got a retconned Draenei tossed at the alliance and THEN worgen...
---
I like the second idea, the first one can be abused the way /u/imatworksup said

&gt;As a result, we will be doing another stress test on Wednesday, May 29  from 2-4pm PDT. The stress test realm will become available at 2pm PDT  and the level cap will be increased to 10. For access, we will be  including **everybody** who was invited to the test on May 22.
---
Yeah, was so bizarre. One second in SW Keep, next in Molten Core.
---
I don't think this is a minority at all. These bosses are gonna fall regularly and quickly for anyone raiding in Classic Beta. They just don't measure up in terms of difficulty to the way players approach the game anymore. And the strategies of each boss is well established and easily available.
---
No thats Joana's record back when vanilla was retail
---
&gt; 1: I’m sure the dude meant intercept which can be used in combat
---
No Rogue should let you get Intercept off, though. And a scenario in which you both dance around like 2 idiots advantages the Rogue due to:
---
- Kidney Shot cooldown being 20s
---
- Energy regenerating, whereas Rage doesn't generate if you don't hit something
---
- Charge has a 5-8 yard deadzone, Stealth + Cheap Shot do not.
---
&gt;Either way tips is obviously a bad pvper whether you like the guy or not.
---
Quite frankly a warrior at lvl 30 doesn't have much to do against Rogue. Warrior is a weak 1v1 class, even more so when they don't have their lvl 60 toys.
---
f.lux
---
Not everything but a lot
---
Holy hell. A lot of people hating on streamers but that looks intense
---
&gt; A good compromise to the issue is a 20-30m cd before you can change layer again.
---
That's not a good compromise at all. So you can't join groups for 20-30 minutes if the person is on a different layer? That makes the social aspect of vanilla shitty as fuck
---
As a warrior? Well... it's possible but not likely.
---
That bug may have something to do with it being Stormwind.
---
Well, I rolled something I wasn't planning on playing. I didn't want to burn out on my main class. Maybe others did this as well.
---
Well said!

I don't do LFR. I am also not particularly bothered by the fact that a mechanic exists that allows more people to enjoy the game. 
---
This sub has taught me that others not being able to have even a watered-down experience that they're having is crucial to their enjoyment of the game lol. Always thought that was a bit strange and cruel. 
---
I do think flex raiding for heroic and normal has kind of hurt the game though.
---
It’s doable if you have experience on private servers. Otherwise I don’t think so. You have to know the leveling route and all the ins and outs of warrior leveling.
---
Why not 18 on 6 off everyday? You only lose like 12 hours and you’ll probably feel way better. Also don’t forget to take a break to walk or stretch every hour or two. Don’t fuck yourself up. You’ll probably be within the top 10% of 60s either way and it’s not worth fucking up your body. 
---
With that said I think around 7-8 days played is pretty reasonable if you’re following a guide/know what you’re doing.  7.5 days = 180 hours and your schedule puts you at about 120. 
---
Even if you put in 24 hours a day and play hunter you’d still have to play for 6 days strait to hit 60 and you’d be a fucking moron if you did that.

Having classic with layering during the first couple of weeks, or being unable to play due to no layering for the first couple of weeks.
---
What do you prefer?
---
Yeah but sex /s
---
This is awesome. How many times did you die?
---
they talk about the stickyness of layers in several interviews, too lazy to search right now though sorry :3
---
&gt;The purpose of a beta is not to be fair to the people who want to play the beta
---
It makes me sad that we have to have this conversation every time Blizzard does a beta program. Beta is not early access to the game for your personal enjoyment. Especially early beta access. It's buggy, your progress gets constantly wiped or blocked, the client crashes or the servers rollback, and you're supposed to take the time to write informative bug reports every time you find something that's not right.
---
As soon as you get more people in beta you start getting all the post from people bitching about how they can't transfer their progress from beta to live and what a waste. They really don't understand the purpose of beta.
---
Had a fun time, leveled a priest, warlock, and hunter to level 5. Took part in some fun raids on the Alliance.
---
Gotta say though... The Horde kinda got the short end of the stick. 
---
Like the Alliance was getting all these raid bosses, Thrall, GM visits. While over in Org it was just crickets. 
---
Oh well still had a blast and hope we provided some good data for Blizz.
---
I personally wouldn't want to miss the release of classic. I want to be part of that experience and moment.
---
Pre Raid BiS Gear is 2.5 - 3k armour yeah. but one leather item compared to Mail/Plate can make a difference of 300-500 armor, so i admit it is hard to tell depending on the 2006 video. Still, to make a difference so huge that asmongold only takes 2/3 to 1/2 of the damage, he must have a lot more armor, specialy because the amount of health goes into the damage reduction through armor calculation too.
---
Maybe i am wrong and just hope there is something wrong with the dungeons. But the feel that you can make misspulls and you won't wipe, compared to back then when even a single enemy more could lead to a wipe feels just wrong. The only thing that happens with Misspulls in the Beta is, that the Healer actualy might use a bit more Mana. Except the tank can't aggro all enemies, but even my mage, or Staysafe with his warlock in SM armory can easily tank elites a while with a bit of heal and won't die quickly. Makes me be afraid of even less "challange" up to aq40/naxx release, than i already expected.
---
 RemindMe! 97 days
---
Nevermind, didn't see the comment.
---
Heh what is this?
---
Not with a warrior with the server full of people competing.  
---
I would expect server woes during launch also.
---
Wow if only they had some large scale testing, maybe 3 months before the game releases. That would give them some time to fix the problem. Shame tho.
---
It all looks like Horde territory to me ;)
---
Fix it plz thx blizz
---
S/s of email time? maybe you just didn't realize till now :S if that's case really hoping other wave did go out. or you could been on F and F list.
---
But wouldn't that mean that they think BFA is superior?
---
Those old mapmakers were pretty inaccurate
---
I am not sure how I feel about layering. Classic doesn't screw with your immersion. people dont pop in and out all the time. I couldn't get used to herb nodes all switching places when I shifted between zones. I couldn't get used to having to get an invite to the 'busy' city layer so I can chat and play around.   
---
I dunno I hope they ditch it ASAP
---

---
How is that a that a correct answer? So you're not allowed to join parties every 10-15 minutes if your friend is on a different layer? That sounds lame as fuck
---
The fact of the matter is as long as layering is around, it can and will be abused. There is no proper fix without having to alter the game. You either have layering and it's abused, or you don't have layering. This is what all the anti-layering people were trying to tell this sub. Layering will always be abused as long as it exists
---
They should really make Vael not despawn, seems odd.
---
Those are situations where the Raid Leaders should be aware that someone is giving up their raid spot for all the other bosses for someone else to gear up, and reserve the piece of loot.  
---
Any guild that goes on DKP only might run into issues.
---
I'm on the F&amp;F list and haven't even gotten an invite. Much sad :/
---
Oh right, it was introduced in patch 1.12 at the end of vanilla so I always associated it with BC
---
its unfinished in a sense that it doesnt work like they said it should. relogging shouldnt switch layers, theyre supposed to be sticky!
---
Couldn't figure out how to get it over to YouTube....this will have to do.
---
Friends &amp; Family beta probably.
---
I personally don't feel like suffering through a week of unplayable lag and mob tag. Layering is fine if it's temporary.
---
Won't work much because you can't lock levels in vanilla
---
Most important points for a warrior against a rogue is: def stance with shield plus sword in the brief moment you have after the opener and before the stun (macro), disarm asap, and intimidating shout when he pops evasion

---
In addition to what pfSonata said, he was recently bandaged until late in the duel.
---
So layering is a more easily exploitable version of dynamic respawns.
---
only 2 people out of like 1000 actually knew what to do when Kazzak got spawned in, rest continued parroting some asmongoloid memes and got shadowbolted down. that says something, it also explains the giant need for layering instead of having many servers and then merging most of them in a month
---
&gt; Yes it will be cleared very quick, by the guilds he is not referring to, there will still be these guilds regardless of how quick others do it.
---
There will be way less of them. Even for people who never played Vanilla if you've done any raiding in the game these bosses are stupid easy. Yeah someone somewhere will probably wipe on Razorgore, but even mediocre guilds not trying particularly hard are going to breeze through these raids.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.

No email. Just restarted my bnet client and it had the drop down menu to pick the beta server.

Exactly that, it was super strong for fury warriors and I was playing one at the time, I've never been as salty as during that raid tier.

If they're staying true to vanilla mechanics and stats then it seems like all of that should hold true. With the beta cap being 30 right now it's hard to test a lot of that

Yeah same, I believe a wave is going out right now though, but I think for whatever reason it takes a bit of time to finish everyone getting it instead of the whole list at once.

Eh, SM Arm is generally the level 35 instance. Cath is closer to 40.
---
GY ~31, Lib ~33, Arm ~35, Cath ~38.
---
I can see that. I thought we were talking about prevent guild blow ups, like at Vael. Underlying issues, like loot favoritism or resentment, start to creep up when people think they could be doing better. I don't really think that casual of a guild is going to die at Vael - they just might stop pushing at Vael.
---
I keep doing that as well..

This post isn't helping :^)
---
I'm not sure what their rules are for this duel.  But they for sure have a lot of ways to beat rogues at this level.  Dude didn't even pop retal.  That one button alone would have made the rogue killed himself 100%.  Just pop that and bandage, if he comes to attack you then hamstring, if he kites away to use thrown then charge.  Watching over it again he wasted fear at the very start to get like 10% of his health back up when he should have used it for his evasion.
---
Warriors, believe it or not, can be a hard counter to rogues easily.  There was a lot he could have done.
---
&gt;Rogue could just use throw to keep combat up.
---
You have to stop moving to throw, so that would completely defeat the purpose of kiting in that very tight 5-8 range.
---
I remember this all too well.  I was in a fairly laid-back guild, we tried to focus on having fun, even when it was time to put on the game face.  We were never server first on anything, but would be 3rd or 4th boss kill for our faction.  We steadily progressed through MC, and it was a rare week indeed that we did not get further and faster.  BWL was as you said though.  Razor took a good number of tries to get it down, took a bit for everyone to fully understand and get comfortable with their roles.  Once that happened, never had an issue with him again.  Vael on the other hand.  That took weeks.  Probably spent as much if not more time on him than getting to and downing Nef.   Even then there were times where someone would get distracted or smoke a bit too much, and we'd do a second or rarely a third attempt to get past him.  We didn't hit a block like Vael until the nature resist gear check of Huhuran.  
---
Great article. Thanks for posting, and I hope you post more like it!
---
then i'm gonna disregard your affirmation. you have no proof
---
Depends on what raid tier were in. Early on it’s Mages, Hunters, rogues because they don’t need much gear to be good. After AQ/R14 classes like Warlock, Warrior, Elly Shaman become pretty crazy in pvp.

---
Monkeynews, Perplexity, Tribe are all OG vanilla players and they’ve all said that leveling in the beta is significantly faster and easier than on Pservers. 
---
You’ve probably been watching Esfand or Tipsout who constantly downplay private servers as being easy when it’s the exact opposite.
---
[https://imgur.com/1rDJn1v](https://imgur.com/1rDJn1v) But this... does put a smile on my face.
---
You need to consider concurrent players. No one cares if a realm has 12000 players if only 3000 of them play on a given night. Consider 4 months down the line, guilds are raiding, most do tues but a bunch or later in the week or on th weekend. Those players will all have different shcedules.
---
If you raid 8-12 hours a week and work 40 and sleep 8 a night you have like 60 hours to play WoW at best. A week is 168 hours. A given normal player, at best, is playing only 1/3 or so of the time. So with 100% normal uptime, that’s 9000 goons round the clock to keep a 3000 server full. 
---
But people really play like 5,10,15,20 hours a week. Very few nerds approach 30 or god forbid 60. 
---
If the average is 20 hours a week—which still seems like a lot—that’s 18,000 to keep it full. 36,000 at 10. 
---
I’m bad at math and doing this from a shower with my hands out the curtain, so forgive me. 
---
Idk, I seem to remember the census sites back in the day had total accounts on the larger servers between 30,000-50,000. But that’d be like unique accounts on the server ever, not unique accounts in the last month—which I think is much more telling.
---

Did you get an email alert or just discover it by trying to login?
---
\*Siiiiip\* Still is
---
How many groups does anyone need to change in 20 mins? Takes 20 mins to do a quest in a crowded area, dungeons are instanced anyway. I would gladly take the layer hop cd than seeing people change layers because they want to run away and hide from world pvp or abuse resource spawns.
---
A well geared warlock is easily the most op class in the game and will easily take care of avarage mages with ease. Another powerful pvp class at end game would be hunter. And the obvious one throughout the whole of vanilla... spriest.
---
Ahhhhhhh.
---
I played almost 8 hours of the stress test and didn't get an invite. I doubt playtime really affects it.
---
Great job getting in though! Catch a fish for me, will ya? I tried Fishing one time but screwed it up and never actually caught a fish lol
---
I think maybe people started hardcore raiding and forgot about the early game - so they destroyed it all so people could 'hurry up and raid'.
---
Don't 'hurry up and raid' friends. You already know where it all goes. Enjoy it.
---
Is level 13 the recommended level for RFC or can you not get in at all before 13?
---
Shamans will outlevel everyone!
---
that's pretty much exactly what they did, there is a clip now of monkeynews just logging out to change layers and mine the same node multiple times, there isn't any persistence so it's literally just sharding minus the cross realm
---
No email, just restarted my bnet client and i had the menu above the play button. https://gyazo.com/1e8eb642d20537ea4b2ad05b278865e2
---
Sorry, I was only shadow for my PvP premade :) I raided as a healer.
---
I did try going shadow a few times in raids, and honestly didn't like it that much. Part of that might be due to how much I enjoyed healing. Also, my shadow gear was primarily for PvP (lots of stamina) and I didn't prep very hard with consumables for mana regen.
---
OP, is there someway to confirm an invite without checking launcher? like going to account settings in browser?
---
YOU NO TAKE CANDLE!
---
Sorry, but the concept of spending a week just to kill 3 boar because you get off on nostalgia just doesn't appeal to me. 
---
Layering is needed, and it's not going away until after launch.
---
Yes I do
---
WOW3!!! Ok. Lucky you &lt;3. Warm up home for us.

oh fuck off with this shit, do you get paid to spread misinformation or do you just do it for fun?

anyone can hear exactly what they said sharding would be used for, you'd have to be an absolute dunce to pretend "well, clearly its a slippery slope and sharding is confirmed in molten core"

Remindme! 96 days “do this”
---
It was tense. Cannot wait til release.
---
I mean if you actually think that the problem is that people are mad casuals have content then that's just ignorance on your part.
---
The problem here is that you can progress to a similar level as someone who is putting in a lot of time and effort into the game by doing basically nothing.
---
I'm not saying casuals shouldn't have content, christ I am as casual as you can get.  I'm so casual I won't even be able to raid in classic.  But, that content should NOT just give you a free pass to see end content IMO.  That content should not give you epic gear that can titanforge up to and even surpass harder content.  That's ridiculous.  
---
The WoW I know and love, content was actually a reward.  If you committed enough time and effort then you are able to see the next content.  If you don't want to do that then you have your own content with 5 mans or whatever you have time for.
---
A game shouldn't change to fit your schedule.  That's fucking ridiculous.  And just keep in mind, this is coming from a casual player who will NEVER be pushing content again not someone who is trying to be a E-peen flexer or something.
---
night elves have a lot of territory.
---
Class specific loot quests where amazing, forging Quel Serrar and doing the Priest benediction/anathema quest line was immensely satisfying
---
Saying retard was bad back in 1975, for some reason Americans have kept it going regardless.
---
I tried zoning in and it said 'lvl 10' required, which matches what I remember
---
I bet more people would take this layering shit more serious if they layered the auction house items.
---
Alright thanks for answer, cant wait to get off work
---
I was there! Cya guys in a month at the next test
---
The fuck you classes will all be there. Hunter warrior rogue mage warlock. With gear and skill they can blow anyone up.
---
Priest, Druid sham Paladin will all hold their own, but a geared arms warrior, Frost mage, subtly rogue, sl lock, or skilled hunter will delete you or humble you pretty quickly. 
---
That said, I really like being one of the healers, being dropped in on and then proceeding to win the fight. Best feeling.
---
That was with all quests above level 40 granting double experience. A bug recently discovered by speedrunners. The best time with corrected values is 4d 20h
---
Just like we used to do realm hopping to find rares etc. Lets call this layer hopping :D
---
Please help. Does layering apply to all zones? Would this benefit aoe mages since there are multiple layers of aoe camps? Meaning less competition for mobs right?
---
first few weeks is literally pulled out of your ass.  It could hypothetically last until most people are 60.
---
Damn I was hoping spending 5 hours actively bug hunting before I went to screw around would boost my odds :p guess it was a foolish dream.
---
Remind me! 96 Days
---
But don’t you need good raid gear to do well in PVP in vanilla?
---
&gt; Can’t wait to reach level 10! 
---
I can’t wait to time out the character select screen.
---
People talking about layering being an issues as if this wasn't a beta where everything will be deleted and they can work out the kinks. Good to bring this to their attention so they can find a fix before launch.
---
https://i.imgur.com/jwpwHyC.jpg
---
Good battles took place
---
World layering is absolutely no needed and it's exploitable. If they want to shard the starting zones, fine. Don't layer the entire world.
---
I cant WAIT for that fun world pvp action!! (as a druid it was fun!!)
---
The f you talking about. Good lord you're crazy.
---
No shaman tsk tsk
---
Or they could just delete layering and open a few more servers
---
I got in 2 days after it came out and I haven't gotten an email about it.
---
Just check your launcher everyday to see if your in.
---
If this is what you want to achieve with classic, it can be great. Do your homework and find experienced vanilla players as officers. Be patient and explain the boss tactics to new raiders everytime to make them comfortable. Help out guildmates to gain trust and for you to see which are loyal. Make sure to have fun while doing all this.
---
Watched it live. Was güde.
---
Take this with a grain of salt before we go and expect anything. He could be an outlier. Until we hear of others don't expect a wave, or anything else. But otherwise grats my man just do NOT want another 500 posts an hour of no beta :(
---
proof this is the case? never heard of this working for anyone.
---
oh shit here we go again.
---
 im gona check 1000 times a day
---
Helped me get excited and lower my expectations a few pegs. Very excited.
---
Can’t make horde and alliance on the same PvP realm ):
---
Its worse than that. you can log in and out on a node and spam farm it
---
Gz man
---
Thank you for saying what needed to be said.  It's still real to me damnit!
---
I believe it does display under your battle.net account&gt;games . If youre in stress test you would see the additional PTR active account in looking at OPs screenshot he probably has an additional WoW3 PTR account in his game list on the account website
---
I've already posted my screenshot, I just want to say that this has been the most fucking fun I've had in wow since Burning Crusade, and it's only level 5! This was insane!
---
There are several people who have said they were at work when they found a new PTR account listed there and it was the beta when they got to their battle.net client.
---
&gt; Personally, I couldn't care less about streamers
---
Yup, the ability to make a semi custom character was indeed awesome.
---
youre 100% right. Although i think they will make sure queues are a rare occurence.  
---
Omar Gonzalez also talks about layers being scaled dynamically so my "calculations" are very rudimentary anyways.
---
[Not only that but it will also be up to level 10 this time](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-on-may-29/181282)
---
I remember this in the Wetlands. Also I was worried I might have gotten banned or something for "exploiting" so I never ended up jumping off the edge and just slowly made my way back to Menethil after taking a few SS's of the farm
---
Scripts to remove griffins, make the UI black and to turn the portrait into a class icon. The killing blow thing at the end is MikScrollingBattleText
---
This is like a top 10 meme of all time for me right here.
---
Another top 10 of mine is “Shitters Clogged”, never fails to make me laugh
---
I don’t see why phasing the first few zones from say level 1-30 or whatever, starting from many and halving to 1 phase wasn’t a good enough solution, all you want to do is streamline the bottleneck. This will also limit the possibility of accessing high end materials
---
nice tinfoil hat there. you are assuming everyone at blizzard are corporate just because the shareholders want money.
---
Your declaration falls flat when you realize they are including classic within the retail sub... for this to be true: ".....they want all the money, "  they would have to have a separate subscription for classic, which they could easily do... but they wont, so clearly they arent as corporate as you think.
---
Just look at classic... they are not going to make any extra money from it  after blizzcon demo. Its going to be included in the retail subscription which has never changed.
---
Blizzard knows they cannot go full corporate route, they have games which have direct competition  on the market. Something that EA doesnt and they can procceed rip off customers with those sports-games every year... blizzard cannot do that or they will lose their customers. There are plenty of fantasy mmos out there.
---
Its not so black and white in the industry... quality is extremely important if you arent in a monopoly situation.
---
Private servers have given 30-40% extra quest xp since forever, but they have generally a bit tougher mobs. The private server leveling videos show this as well.
---
this would require someone to know the exact names of each PTR on their account. OP’s screenshot shows “wow2” and “wow3” so if you know the exact names of the PTRs listed there beforehand then that’s nice but a lot of people don’t
---
I am technically a millennial in some of the yearly graphs but I refuse to accept it. 
---
I am 36 fyi.
---
Priest is not slow to level. They're smooth.
---
Would love to see a comparison post like this one for the command!
---
Yes, this but its actually serious
---
The point is if an extra PTR account pops up then that means you got in. 
---
Thanks for the downvotes. You’re still wrong.
---
i rechecked the source and omar actually only stated stickyness inside one play session. so youre right, actually i dont have any reason to think that layers are assigned upon creation...
---
It feels like it too. 
---
Welcome to the alliance forces, you are new so you can't really do anything. Your hit chance is low, gear is bad, weapons are bad. You have to actually go acquire those things. Not just throw away your legendary weapon that was passed down from some ancient god who you killed by yourself so you can grab some quest greens. 
---
Feels good.
---
Theory crafting non max is just what you said brother, theoretical. I donno who downvoted you.
---
Ion says it is an entire server per layer [right here](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=236).
---
Agreed, the behavior is akin to a 5 year old going "it's not fair" and throwing a temper tantrum, pathetic.
---
I'm pretty sure they plan on doing exactly that.
---
Is warcrafttaven the best hub for beta addons so far? Someone needs to make an altoholic (or anything that tracks items across characters) addon!

Mob fanning seems to be enabled and it was a thing in TBC so its very likely thats intended

How about you listen for 5 more seconds? lol

No need to wait for a whole month  - [they actually announced that the next test is going to be on May 29](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-on-may-29/181282).
---
I played during beta of Classic all thru WoD with a break and now BfA, I was hesitant because of what we are use to with the modern conviences of retail but man I don't care about any of those fucking things as much as I thought. Classic is such a breath of fresh air and I can't wait till August.
---
They said it's a known bug.
---
I didn’t downvote you, nice assumption. I admitted after you explained that it would work you just need to know the exact names and how many are there beforehand. Have a good day.
---
Brüdda where are you &lt;Old town road&gt; is looking for you
---
There were PvP wars like crazy on the Stress Test server this afternoon. Had a ton of fun fighting ally outside Goldshire and eventually taking over the tower in Northshire Abby. I was in some guild and they were saying there were raids outside Kharanos too. The chat channels were a lot of fun and people seemed to be really excited for it!
---
Lol I knew one of you vending machines would come in here talking out your neck. 
---
To the OP he’s not wrong per say. Mage and Warlock are both very close competitors to the hunter world pvp wise. But the hunter has a minor edge, the catch though. To take advantage of that edge you must be committed and be extremely good. If you have time limited mages and locks would be a better way to go because of the numbers you can achieve in less time.
---
Looting a chest isn’t ninja looting.
---
I was bad some of the time. But when I joined the guild it was because I was a scrub rogue, and out DPS-ed all of the raid rogues, as a way to get their shit together, I guess. As I mentioned elsewhere, I was 16, so I'm certain I was just out of the loop and probably wasn't fun to raid with.
---
Maybe blacksmithing can net you some gold if you manage to get rare plans or  grind your ass off about ore. 
---
Idk rest, ive yet to do any grinding in vanilla... back on retail i never grinded, i just played the game. Hence i had the normal mount most of my time at 60.
---
Can anyone else confirm getting an invite?
---
Yea but "pretty sure" has definitely let me down in the past with Blizz :(
---
Remind Me! 95 Days "do this in game"
---
If you're a pvp rougue you're going to get invited to do a Vael fight at some point. It's just a fact of life. Sure I don't have a beta invite, you're going to wonder why there are so many tanks and why all the beta rogues are suddenly acting alpha as fuck. It's the Vael fight children, and there is energy enough for everyone.
---
They deserve it
---
Dang, that's a lot of paladins.
---
nice! update us when you get home from work :)
---
There's going to be many more layers upon launch. 3000 pr. Layer would mean 500 players in each starting zone. The game can't handle 500 players in Durotar. As the first days passes by a server will consist of upto 100 layers in my estimate. As the load on starting zones decrease they will close down layers eventually working their way down to 1 final layer which I expect to be 3000-6000
---
i did, he talks about creating several continental layers to soften the impact of the launch.
---
LMAO he crit him for like 750+ within 2 hits

After the stress test i unsubbed from wow, i have enough time till the next stress test, but it was so much fun ill only stay subbed for classic.... i started in cataclysm onward and i gotta say when it comes to wow.... the only thing that matters is Azeroth itself and the people in it.

[Here's me back in 200X](https://imgur.com/a/0QezBa5) (can't remember, but it was vanilla, pre Naxx.)
---
You have missed the point entirely.  #1 if a guy wants to play a smite priest that’s his business.  If he joins a raid to do a job, it is fair to expect him to do that job.  It’s no one else’s business how he specs in order to do that job.  
---
You seem to say that a tank is allowed to do whatever he wants (ala wear a dps helm) but healers are required to do exactly what you think they should do (ala not spec Rey or smite).
---
Valuing one class/ role over the other is arbitrary.  The game is dynamic and every change has a tradeoff.
---
For instance, we ran a oomkin in vanilla, because we had a lot of cloth.  While the dps of the oomkin is mathematically less, bringing an oomkin have a dps boost to the casters AND gave us another battle res/innervate.
---
Oh rip! I meant to say shimmering flats in 1k needles, thanks for that.
---
I was gonna say lol. If your girlfriend is on the "making you unhappy" side then that's a problem...
---
RemindMe! 96 days "Weather it up bitch"
---
They've announced this already. August 13th you can reserve your character names, which necessitates servers.
---
It won't be so MM after 3 weeks without layering
---
It's effectively the same thing, just with shared auction houses and stuff
---
Who gives a shit if people farm some extra herbs? People are talking like switching between layers to farm an entire continent every hour is exploiting and will be so far ahead financially. Who the fuck cares? How does this effect you so much? You dont think a server. That has 2-3 layers. 6-9k pop. That everyone wont be doing this? I'm not sure how to fathom the stupidity here on why this is such a huge deal to people.
---
Take a deep breath, concentrate on the actuality of this. Then realize you also dont care.
---
&gt; a server will consist of upto 100 layers 
---
how can so many players fit in one layer eventually?
---
God, I hope Tips roll alliance, what an embarrassment to Horde he is.
---
It's pretty terrible. Hoping for a better source of classic information &amp; community to pop up.
---
Remind me! 96 days
---
It's extremely important to alot of us.  I have a group of about 40 people now.    The sooner we can post a server name as the target server the better chance we have to actually play together
---
I will! Man im excited right now!
---
The world looks mostly alliance from here. Where my gnomies at?!
---
I actually would not mind them reskinning a couple of the 50 plate helms that use that model. Its just... freaking everywhere
---
I know that weapon skills were set to max values in PvP combat, but was that also true for defense skill?
---
Is there anyone that demonstrated this was true (or not) before the 2.0 patch?
---
Yeah that's fair but like, you've thrown in random mob NPCs and dungeons but left out the goblin towns that as a player would be seen/visited more.
---
Weird that it created another account for you instead of upgrading the stress test account, if someone has a BFA ptr account it could mean the same problems we had before with not seeing the beta account listed in the launcher due to the 2 account limit.
---
Still in  beta. System which will only get used for first phase. Chill the fuck out.
---
Those people would have quit anyway when the shine wears off and the grind begins.
---
Sharding the starting zones was an acceptable solution, not ideal but I can live with it. But they decided to ~~shard~~ "layer" the entire world.
---
I spent the final half hour or so in Stormwind fighting Patchwerk. We kited him to the throne room hoping for Bolvar to help fight him. In the last moments, a bunch of infernals called "Guardian of Blizzard" spawned and started killing even more of us. Was a very fun time, especially near the end there.
---
Hate all gnomes* ftfy
---
You don’t seem to get that being a “team” doesn’t require micromanaging your teammates and implementing some cookie cutter strategy that was arbitrarily agreed upon by some neckbeard on a pserver to be “the best” way to do things.
---
You say team, but then seem to think the mages individual dps should be valued over all else, which just sounds like mage favoritism.
---
Make gnomes puntable again.
---
So Shaman has totems and chain heal. Totems are raid buffs. Very in demand. Chain heal is a less-predictable but powerful heal, especially when targeting the melee group.
---
Druid is a weaker healer but they have better HoTs which can be kept on the Warlocks for very efficient mana restoration and to take care of the raid-wide damage.
---
Generally, shaman will be more in demand than druid.
---

---
Hitler doesn't make it into the stress test. Hopefully y'all like it. Couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get it off this website onto youtube.
---
I don’t know if they’ve answered this question but sharding was only in phase one which they did away with, did they announce anything specifically related to layering?
---
nice.
---
Then barrens or the next zone will become unquestable as well
---
What part of the map is delve?
---
&gt; Private servers have given 30-40% extra quest xp since forever
---
That all got fixed like 18 months ago.
---
Brox here, I was running around with you guys for a little bit =) Good fun!
---
The twin Emps killed my guild. RIP Alone on Burning Legion
---
They stated they will allow people with subscriptions to log on and create your to 3 characters to reserve names. They stated 2 weeks prior, if I'm not mistaken. This will hopefully mean we know which servers they occupy. Then you can make an educated guess on where to start.
---
I imagine they'll aim to be on the same server as each other, right? So they have fair competition?
---
Awesome map! What about Hillsbrad Foothills, would that not be a part of Lordaeron?
---
Shaman is more of a raid healer, Druids dont really cast many HoTs as you think. Regrowth is so mana inefficient that most dont even use it. You largely keep Reju on tanks and spam different levels of Healing Touch. In that sense the Druid can feel like a scuffed Paladin almost. This was fixed in TBC, as Druids gained Lifebloom and HoTs became better.
---
There are builds that with better gear are more HoT oriented, but you still dont really use Regrowth much.
---
R. Shaman is probably the most guarantied raid spot in the game, as many guilds want 1 per grp. And Ele and Enhance are rarely invited. But you will get a easy spot as either. And Druids are in my opinion better in PvP, as you are the best flag carrier in the game.
---
Which would create the problems they tried to fix. Like char immersion (You will sudenly lose your name cause others have the same on other servers), not the same immersion in terms of sudenly a big influx of other players. 
---
They reason they do this is because they know 1/3 of players will leave after weak 1/2. So if they don't have this all servers will be dead after a while, or atleast not full servers.
---
Hey I was there too :) It was a valiant effort
---
Layering will help
---
&gt; I do think flex raiding for heroic and normal has kind of hurt the game though
---
Only when they get the tuning messed up for "break points" in number of people in a raid, where adding just one more person increases the difficulty more than it exponentially would otherwise.
---
Flex allowed some guilds to keep raiding when they couldn't get a full 25 people, and allowed more people to come along when there were more than 10 people capable of raiding.  It helped a guild I'm in continue raiding until eventually the rest of the game feeling like a second job just killed too much interest and led to not even having ten people available.
---
I stick with that guild with my main and primary alts because it was an enjoyable guild that didn't just run raids.  That's kind of the problem with current WoW... it seems like it's just raids, or soulless repetitive gameplay.  I have a couple of friends playing, who are in a raid team, but even if I can figure out what guild they transferred to because the one I joined to play with them broke up due to not enough raiders, I still can't raid because I'm only at ilvl 385 and that's not enough for "cutting edge raiders" (even if I probably can perform better than some of the people in their group), so I'm left to play the non-raiding game which... sucks.  (Mythics are also out because people only want to run higher M+ for the gear, and if you aren't over 400, you're not worth bringing.)
---
I look forward to Classic because there's meaningful dungeons to run at 60, the reps have more meaning to them, professions had use, and I feel like even if I don't land in a raid team, I'll have options for stuff to do.  But hell, there's a better chance I can get in a raid, because aside from having 40 slots (or 20 for some), there's not as much of this annoying gating from ilvl requirements.  If you've got competent gear and know how to do your job, you should find a spot.
---
I think the problem with current WoW isn't that LFR exists, it's that raiders demand certain ilvls and figure if you don't have that (which you'd have to have been raiding the whole time to have, basically), you can just stick to LFR... which isn't the same.  Not because it's watered down, but because people feel like it's so watered down they don't put effort in and there's too many wipes to just pure stupidity.

Yeah thank god. I don't mind streamers, but once they get to a certain popularity it's impossible for them to do anything without being helped every step of the way by a mob of fans. Most EU streamers are much smaller or are the kind of people who would insist on declining help from fans. The EU streamers I've seen playing Classic have mostly just been taking it slow and enjoying it.

Yeah, i guess they werent finished discussing the details of layering back then.  i cant think of any reasons why they shouldnt make seperate continents as layers though, it sounds like it has no drawbacks, assuming the entire server wouldnt meet on one content, in which case the server opens up more layers.
---
reju on warlocks is a powerful conversion of mana to dps
---
Holy shit. It's so complicated and crazy. I cant believe it.
---
Some people getting some extra nodes. Game is broken.
---
warrior/rogue is significantly faster on beta. pretty sure the reason casters are having trouble is mobs on pservers have 0 resists
---
It definitely would be hard to control unless you have consistent access to every layer and know how many layers exist at any point in time.
---
Apparently there's a stealthed rogue in the middle. 😂

Can't dammit....let me in! Let me in!

---
I spent 30-ish minutes today trying to get enough imps for the orc starting zone quest. And then another 10-15 for the scorpids. Without layering you'd be there for hours.
---
&gt;Private servers have given 30-40% extra quest xp since forever
---
this was fixed a long time ago
---
and yes double mage is by far the fastest on private servers but casters on beta is significantly slower than pservers and all physical classes are faster(except maybe hunters because of how buggy they are atm)
---
To all my fellow tauren in Mulgore during the last few seconds, it was mad fun. PM me here if any of you would like to stay in contact for Classic and future tests!

&gt;RemindMe! 96 days "do this"
---
We were in a group and rolling for it
---
Pretty sure they've said that it's fine to do. Iirc it was from a stream from esfand or one of them that talked about it to ion about if it's allowed, things like making cthun prenerf version for a little bit for shits and giggles, and some other stuff
---
I kept trying to level my fishing but I kept missing the fish because of the lag and all the stress the server was under lmao
---
Oh well I must have missed that post, looked at all the blue posts prior just to reduce the chance of me posting about something already taken care of, dang. Thanks! I can sleep easy
---
Not to mention undead when talking about PvP, devouring plague is huge for 1v1s and single target burst damage, and touch of undead significantly gimps dual wield classes.
---
Are you a steamer? Could be steamer priority latency
---
layering only few weeks/not beyond phase 1.
---
&gt; Then realize you also dont care. 
---
Unfortunately im bored and i do care. I think people are grossly overestimating the impact of these "exploits" aswell and im sure it wont be noticable anymore after a few weeks tops.  
---
Seeing some rage kids planning on rushing to 60 on their goldfarm hunter to farm several years worth of mats in a week (their words, not mine) is ridiculous
---
I wouldn't expect the Barrens to be unsharded if that's the direction they were taking. 3/4 Horde races end up in the Barrens.
---
This goes against the spirit of Classic WoW. I really hope Blizzard reconsiders their stance on Layering and prevents actions like this from happening.
---
I remember wiping to Vael  30-40 times in a single night. Woof.
---
Did you get roll back from any of the DC's?  
---
I got phased at one point then DC a few minutes later, once I re-logged I was back where the phase happened. My inventory had also rolled back, excluding quest items.
---
“They didn’t even test layering.”
---
EXACTLY. My favorite (only) streamer immediately left the starter zone, so I watched other streams and people were doing such meme stuff that I never actually saw the layering take place.
---
Hi, /u/Archavius01
---
The fastest hunter in the world did over 4 days (in classic retail), there is no way a warrior is cracking /played 4 days
---
I wouldn't want to shit anyone for pushing themselves but you gotta be realistic with this rush to 60.  Most likely you're gonna not make first to 60 and not find out you didn't "win" till you were into your 40's or 50's.  Not sleeping and taking stuff to keep yourself awake to play a game can be seriously hazardous to your health.  You won't get anything for hitting 60 then keeling over from a heart attack.  Take care of yourself before the game! Bit of a buzz kill but it needs to be said. Cheers, see you there.
---
I'm gen y. Too young to be gen x, too old to be a millenial. I'm 37 (38 In like 3 weeks)
---
Yes but you will need to pull ahead over a lot of ppl on launch or you will be looking for mobs a lot and waste time.
---
It’s just okay. DM / Ruin is better for raids.
---
i keep checking my bnet just in case i get a late invite... pepeHands
---
Yeah I really don't understand the big difference... I was on the stress test for hours today, and any time you got invited to a group you would switch layer and players and mobs would pop in and out all around you. It was identical to joining random groups in group finder for world quests or something in Legion/BFA. It felt really bad. People were spamming trade chat like crazy begging to be invited to the right layer where something fun was happening.
---
i remember ganking these fields FOR MONTHS on my 43 warlock back then. I had no power to quest, it was so tedious in my eyes! 
---
Quested half an hour? Gonna reward myself with 6hours of lows ganking!
---
Ahh, that was not in the chat.
---
It'd be roughly 500 in each starting zone. 3 starting zones per faction, right?
---
I think it'll be rough at the start but if you just push on whatever way you can it'll be easier and easier. But having a plan b might be a good idea...
---
i started a 19 twink and took me 20 mins to get there and i have like 4 spells.. i hate it
---
Its definitely a necessary evil and a lot of these no changes people are insane lol.
---
I mean you can look at the stress test which has layers and how insane the starting areas were. Apparently spending an hour trying to get some kobold kills sounds like the pinnacle of fun for some people.
---
It should definitely be removed later on in game life and even potentially kept only to first few zones. I think there are also ways to keep as is while fixing some possible exploits such as this (not have logging out change your layer??) 
---
But holy crap these people calling for its outright removal are ridiculous
---
No, totems are party buffs. They affect 5 people.
---
If you’ve had an active sub since 2005, that’s roughly $2,500 just for an active sub, let alone buying the expansions. I’d say I’ve been actively subbed for about 12 of those 15 years and they can’t give your boy beta access?
---
I didn't downvote it, but my issue is that it's a LITTLE misleading. The next while after he keeps trying to switch around and isn't that consistent. I think he had a layer switch to resources after this once like once in 10 something attempts.        
---
It's like saying hey if you log out and back in, voila you'll switch layers into a vein that you just gathered on a different one.
---

One of the main things that turned me off of retail was when I made a druid, and I had nothing I could do in cat/bear unless I was specced into a specific form of Feral druid. Why even have the character at that point? I agree, making a custom, non cookie cutter class was my favorite thing and the fact I can not do that in retail really turned me off
---
wait what?
---
Awesome boss summoning event and there's that one guy that just wants to make his tabard look cool.
---
...... Go back to BfA if you want to play dress up.
---
Mine was sunwell and probably nef nothing in WOTLK on gave me the joy of downing a new boss in sunwell(killed KJ pre-nerf although my guild died on buru and the guild I transfered to got it's first KJ kill the night I joined (50th in US) so the content up to buru is what I feel good about) or finally clearing BWL.
---
I did twice, but they were kind of strange roll-backs.
---
Completed quests were never hurt, neither were equipped items. But my position would be reset to some landmark, eg last accepted quest, and I *think* I think lost quest progress on not-completed quests.
---
But this happened only twice, after being DC'd after an obvious layering/phasing fail.
---
They should make it so you have to go to the store and buy those boxes to get classic. Just so we get the full authentic experience

So.. for anyone who didn't play Alliance.. did they do anything for the Horde in Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff, or Undercity? It feels like they really wanted to do stuff where the streamers were since the "top" ones rolled on Alliance for stress.  
---
Kinda bummed I picked Horde if I'm missing out on all these "cool" events.

We shall see! I’m just a dog on the internet! If by “watching rogue craft” you mean over 200 days /played on vanilla warrior, yep! But hey we probably won’t come to an agreement over reddit. See you in August! I’ll be the warrior dancing on your rogue corpse /train    xp
---
I hope they give us server names BEFORE NAME RESERVATION! otherwise i cant reserve names until my guild agreed on 1 server! (it states 3 names PER ACCOUNT, not per server)
---
Yeah good correction but that's what I meant really: you want a bunch of them to cover the whole raid.
---
Layering is their full "solution" per continent. So like if you're in layer 1, you'd be in layer 1 across all zones unless you log off or join a party that's in a different layer
---
Poe's Law is everywhere.

Oh yes the infamous "It's only beta. It's only first month. It's only 3 months." Haha ex dee.

It could get pretty bad from the beginning.

I hopped on this morning and played for 45 mins with 2 random people. Most fun I've had in so long, just chatting, competing for mob tags. Thanks for the group invite, Supworld. Can't wait for release!
---
It was fine after the 2hr stress period, and hopefully they can mitigate that issue for the next one.
---
Not particularly. Pally heal or shaman 3 target chain heal will be better HPM than a rejuv.
---
Other than mass-dc's and a hundred org-shards with 3 people in, no. :(
---
I mean after we got through Ragnaros we had most of these problems solved already.  Sure it took plenty of wipes but so did rag.  I do remember a few guild fights we had during vael, but we did end up getting it down.  We were all pretty nice people in our guild and just agreed to keep trying until we got it done.  People admitted mistakes and we just moved on to the next attempt.  You just get used to the run back.

Is there a setting between 1 and 0? Could you set it to .5?
---
Depends how long phase 1 is. People who rush to 60 and abuse layer hopping for lotus etc will reap the rewards and further push hardcore players above casuals in terms of economy...
---
At this point we're moving into raid make-up so I'm gonna duck this by saying "it depends on your raid build"
---
I... don't get it.
---
This is AWESOME
---
Pretty much, people just remember old memes like Mankrik's wife and are sad about it being new memes instead. As if everyone was going to talk as if it was 2004 again, you can play an old game but that won't change the people playing it. OSRS is the same, it's filled with passionate people for the old 2007 version of the game, but it's also filled with pepe memes.
---
I didn't see them spawn any of this cool shit in the horde zone.
---

How did you all find each other? I’m looking to try and start rallying together alliance side pvpers for a tight knit wpvp/casual pve guild.
---
Lost generation
---
Any solution they will pick to make the launch go smoother will inevitably affect one of the games aspects in one way or another. 
---
But out of all aspects choose to affect the whole world, and everything intertwined with it (the economy, the immersion, the way the community interacts with eachother etc) by using layering as THE tool to handle launch seems like a very bad idea for a game like classic, which is based first and foremost on the living, breathing, authentic world experience and the players who inhabit it.
---
Except a couple of them have said they aren't going to say what server they're on right away. You're still gonna have to gamble or you're gonna have to wait a bit on launch day to avoid them all.
---
I'm not sure what the logic behind not revealing that information right away is, I imagine its to get ahead of the horde of people wanting to follow them around. idk tho.
---
Both Soda and Asmon have said that they're committed to rolling on a PvP server though, so if you don't care about server type, you can just roll on PvE to avoid the two biggest streamers.
---
Man, my old guild didn't even step foot into BWL until we were well staffed and well geared I guess. Testament to the leadership. We had our wipes, but it was Chromag that we ended up stuck on the longest. And that's what killed the guild.
---
And not because it took us so long to down him, but because the Xbow dropped first kill and there was huge infighting among the leadership on which Hunter it should go to.
---
And akin to OP, those fractures start and they don't stop. Everything was questioned, everything bickered over ever after. Less than a month later the guild was disbanded over night with no announcement. The guild 'bank' looted, and wealth distributed by whomever in the leadership chose to strike first.
---
The hunter who didn't get to Xbow, did end up getting an apology and a ton of guild mats in his mailbox that morning though.
---
It was more like 3 hours before I could get in.
---
I was killing a boar in Shadowglen, the night elf starting zone, when it was one hit from dead i got shifted zones. All the mobs i had just killed were around me and I did not get kill credit for the boar. To me it seemed like the layer shift was indiscriminate to what was currently happening. Not the biggest issue when killing a boat but if I had found a Black Lotus and got shifted layers mid gather now that would be a different story.
---
Rofl you blurred peoples names out like it matters

Elfs seem to have this trait in most fantasy settings. I think it's a cool racial flavor for them. So wise and ancient.

Facebook.   
---
Friends of friends over the years.   I've used Facebook for a very very long time and have original vanilla people on it.
---
Layering is fine. Thats not layering. That would be sharding or something else causing that.
---
Who got the helm. Do I even have to ask?
---
&gt; Monkeynews 
---
just asked him, he said dungeons are easier in beta, but mobs are harder because they have a lot of abilities. overall its very similiar according to him
---
RemindMe! 96 Days
---
Pain in the ass :)
---
I've heard people in similar situations saying they all agreed on something similar to "We will all roll on the first PvP server that starts with K".
---
This was before the 2 week name reserve announcement was made though.
---
Even if people do that. Rush to 60 and raid log with years worth of mats. Or sell them now or later. I dont understand how this is in any way effecting anything, or your gaming?  cept there are some extra black lotus or arcane Crystal's in circulation. Bringing the price down a bit until they are gone. How many nodes did these people farm? Holy shit probably double what they normally would of had. So 100 black lotus instead of 50? And these people that do this. How many are doing it? Like everyone getting double loots? Omg so crazy. It's like they farmed 10 hours when they only farmed 5.
---
Ppl need to chill about this. Especially since its beta testing.
---
Are people jealous of this speed leveler? I'm just curious as to how this effects anyone's game?
---
I am still looking for these threads. OP's OP please deliver.
---
Where do I find these scripts?
---
Nice choice on the name, Primarch.
---
So, not as same as vanilla then.
---
Or just dont allow people to hop servers/layers.
---
We shall never see his like again. And now his watch has ended.
---
&gt; After the 2nd wipe, where Rag had like 20% hp, the raid leader made a ballsy call and told the DPS'ers to shred the fire res and go full damage.
---
What a fucking epic moment that must have been
---
For grinding post 2-3 have you tried using the guards to help? I didn't have much time to play on this stress test but was going to test it out more next time. Kiting an aggroable (red name) mob into a guard will force them to kill it for you and you will receive 100% of the xp. There's a group of orcs that ride wolfs up and down between Razor Hill and the starting area that you can abuse this with. There are also the guards around Razorhill and the tower up the hill as well.

This. I actually think expansions like Legion did the "hero" role pretty good, it actually did feel epic and fun. It kinda felt like the finale of WoW where you had become just like the old role models, like Thrall with Doomhammer or Tirion with Ashbringer. It was only because they went really all-out in that expansion, and really did make you the hero, rather than half assing it like they do in every other expansion. Going all out was only going to work once really. Now I can't wait to run around in my shitty grey and white gear, looking like a hermit, doing tasks for tiny amounts of coin and getting way too excited to get my first green.

  Seems like you don't know the tos nor how the mafia works.
---
I've seen multiple reports of people getting an email up to 24h after actually getting access, so it's still worth checking.
---
I did play with that, but I noticed that if it was a yellow mob (i.e. neutral) then the guards would not help you. Maybe this is a bug? but it does mean that this is only useful in some rare cases when a red mob can be kited to the guards.
---
not OP but I did the thing, seems shorter

People always grossly overestimate these kind of things. Theyre bored and want to critique the game to make it better for when it finally releases. 
---
Also there are things you want although you wont experience them personally. (like people not wanting mythic endbosses downed in week1 although theyre no mythic raiding, just liking the idea of an unbeaten or hard endgame goal)

One of the people working on Weak Auras tweeted out a chain of tweets talking about the rumour of an API leak which revealed BFA started with 3.2M players and was down to half that by October. Unfortunately most people only read that first tweet that included the numbers, and not the rest of the tweets which mentioned to not take things like this at face value because it hadn't been proved yet. Of course that initial tweet spread like wildfire, popped up everywhere, and the whole thing got out of hand.
---
But yea, there was no leak.
---
Ours had a similar concept, but was ridiculously complicated and required spreadsheets and hours of prep. The exact details escape me, but this was the gist
---
- At the start of a raid, the raider would submit a BiS list, and would have priority over anyone else who did not mark it as BiS, if other factors were equal
---
- Raiders and designated bench would be awarded a proportional amount of points for the gear looted (similar to later dkp systems)
---
 * Progression nights where repairs are covered typically awarded more points per person than farm nights
---
 * Wipe nights for previously downed content paid out less points than farm nights
---
- Gear cost a base amount, dependant on ilvl
---
 * multiplied by a small percent for end-boss loot
---
 * if sharded, yielded a minimum value of points for the raid, at no cost to anyone
---
 * If loot was claimed as an upgrade, the raider would only pay the difference between what they were currently wearing and the upgraded item.
---
 * If loot was claimed as a sidegrade or off-spec, it would be debited for minimum value (like a sharded piece) 
---
Loot priority was determined by 2 main factors:
---
- "Raid" rank:   
---
1=tanks and members claiming BiS,  
---
2=full members paying full price (not the upgrade price),  
---
3=recruits paying full price and non-recruits claiming upgrade,  
---
4=recruits claiming upgrade/non-recruits claiming sidegrade or offspec,  
---
5=everything else and/or shard
---
- Consideration within the ranks was how many points designating the piece would yield to the raid as a whole-- a recruit paying full price gives more points to the raid and would be heavily considered over normal raiders' upgrades. A raider could jump the queue somewhat by electing to pay full price instead of the upgrade discount, which implied they placed high value (but not BiS claim)
---
 * When people were in the same tier and point cost, loot council would generally decide to award the piece to the player with the highest points.
---
 * Points could go negative, but you could not spend more once you were negative (gearing new tanks excluded). 
---
 * Caveat: if the item would otherwise be sharded, the person in the negative could pick it up, but would receive no payout but also incur no additional cost to the claimant. This kept brand-new recruits from going into a hole so big that the best option would be to quit and hop to another guild with all the purps
---
I'm sure we had some other rules, too, for keeping people from passing on upgrades, but that escapes me.
---
We abused the hell out of a publicly accessible excel document. At some point, the raids two tiers back became worth no points just due to the administrative hassle and the fact that people could pug it.
---
I put in edit in my last post.
---
If i can't find that guild I'm making that guild.
---
Can someone explain to me why Blizz decided to shard their servers instead of just lowering the amount of servers?
---
This is an interesting strategy...
---
I knew of some guilds...not MY guild of course... that used to just wall jump off the braziers going into vaels room, and summon the rest of the raid up there.
---
You would basically just leave a skeleton crew on the orb and evade bug all the adds with ranged attacks...
---
/r/anime would like a word.
---
Not everyone had mics, internet was spotty, screen resolution for monitors was potato tier. You really can't go home again.
---
No idea, although I'd understand the blood removal... But what about the flashy light when you're struck? Without it it just seems like you're hitting the air lol
---
Wow, I vividly remember the chat channels and the text whispers. My guild was just a handful of try hards in a bigger raid, so we would even bicker in guild chat. Though from what I heard from my brother, the rogue chat was the worst hahaha
---
Oh man. That’s pretty smart. I deleted my Facebook a long time ago..
---
I came in 10th place on the stress test to level 5 at roughly 39 minutes. The first 2 quests weren't worth even trying to do. I actually lost time trying to search for wolves in between other quests. Grind everything you see in the starting area. Level 2s and 3s being the best until level 4. Then either you'll have some quest complete or you can run out and grind level 5 mobs on the way to town. I would probably do this until level 6 on live and then just continue as normal.
---
Yeah, I also noticed that entering and exiting the city was taking me in and out of different layers (or shards). Recorded it briefly but I figure it on a bunch of people's streams.
---
LFG WC.  Must be on same layer, won't wait 20 min.
---
Oh come off it.
---
Having a cool looking guild tabard is as Vanilla as you can get.
---
Nice, have fun. I was foolishly hoping playing as much of the stress test as I could might up my chances but I doubt it. The level 10 stress test next week will be fun though.
---
The beta isn't for testing things. Its for advertisement. That's why the streamers always get priority loading in.
---
Nah, nothing in Horde cities; all I was was some Hoggers in the Valley of Trials. Here's hoping horde will get some fun stuff next stress test
---
sorry :&gt;  
---
im still agreeing with you though :P
---
I understand your fear:P but as a druid how would I be locked in place :P fastest runner in the server :) and can get out of traps by shifting :) not to mention if their was water near by you lost me in seconds lol/!!  thats why i had so much fun in STV. I felt like a real hunter (or prey) slowly slinking through the jungle kiling ONE quest target than RUNNNNNIIINNNGG lol

Their community is shitty, not them. Even they tend to admit that. Nice way to twist things and say I blame it on streamers.

its one those super specific memes

Oh yeah 100%. I didnt mean to come off rude. Lol, just actually saying I agree with u 2. And not saying you are saying these things in your original post
---
A random group formed in goldshire to try and fight off some horde and kill hogger. The majority of ended up staying together for the rest of the day for over 11 hours just exploring and chatting in the ingame voice. We ended up making a guild. These are a few screenshots I took of the adventures. Thanks for the great day hoggers boys.
---
Are you on a F&amp;F list?
---
Oh, sorry.. I missed a letter in the word, but I'm glad miss-spelling completely invalidates my point. 
---
Addons that weren't in Vanilla will be in Classic. There's nothing that can be done to stop it. It's a double edged sword.
---
16 Debuff slots and 1.12 itemization are going to overcome Vael's DPS check very easily. Chromagus' notorious guild breaking is already nullified by everyone knowing the ramp strategy.
---
Shamans are great healers and support in a raid. The totems they drop can offer great benefits to the group and they are a top tier healer when specced for resto. Chain heal is quasi-random but if you treat it like a direct heal when using it you can heal multiple targets simultaneously. 
---
Druids can offer versatility in any group providing they're specced correctly. If your guild lets you raid as feral you can offtank and provide a crit buff to the melee group. Regardless of what spec you are you can innervate and restore mana to a caster group. Druids also have crowd control in the form of entangling roots and hibernate, which has some utility in certain scenarios. 
---
Both are a solid choice so it depends on what playstyle you really want. I'd say shamans have the edge when it comes to getting a raid spot though. Bitches love windfury.
---
The stress server was a PvP server only.
---
From memory, wasn’t that scripted battle something you flew over when using the flight path north? The idea being that even as you were flying around, you maintained the immersion of Ironforge’s fight again the troggs/trolls.
---
The devs said in chat they were testing layering. So, yes they did.
---
Everything will depend on server type, population and community driven interests on that server but you could have just been on a heavily pve focused or low pop/underpopulated faction.
---
The WPvP didnt die on my realms until most people had flying mounts/farming rep dailies or sunwell came out moving the WPvP to that isle. But before that you could always get help to deal with gankers within minutes.
---
This was so Troll.
---
August isn't soon, but we are going home
---
RemindMe 100 days
---
Yeah for real.  Losing out on 40 man loot because some scrub is getting carried in zg? what the actual fuck is that system?
---
It's kind of fucked up how layering is basically them betting against themselves.
---
Like really they think they are going to lose 1/3-2/3 of their players in 3 months...
---
Seems not only risky but also just bad bet to take.
---
But, the Stress Test server was just 1 server.  When the game releases, 1 server will have a bunch of layers that you will select. Like Stormrage 1, Stormrage 2, Stormrage 3 etc. Once you select your layer, you're on that layer. There won't be typical phasing issues like your example of logging out and back in. There should be **zero** phasing UNLESS you get invited by someone on Stormrage 3 and you're on Stormrage 1. Once layering is deleted from the game, all the layers will be merged together.
---
So basically, trying to understand how layering is going to work while on a Stress Test server just makes it work and look like phasing.
---
aren't dwarves already fat dwarves though?
---
And that's one of many reasons why Classic was so much more satisfying. It felt like you accomplished something hard with a team of friends, rather than just being put on autopilot with a random group of people you'll never talk to again.
---
/console SET ffxDeath "0" 
---
This turns off the grey vision death effect
---
No
---
What I mean is, anybody who hits 60 quickly and abuses layer hopping to farm early, will get more value out of it. Layers are not going to be around after phase 1. So if you hit 60 and get triple the Black Lotus than you could without Layering, and then 2 months later when the majority of people hit 60 it is removed for phase 2, those people have had a huge advantage over slower levelers.
---
bfa is already dead, least when i play
---
oof* my bad
---
&gt; that you will select.

---
Same, but if there is differences like this that actually change the size of the model, then it might have some balancing or hitbox issues.
---
RemindMe! 96 days “wow glow fix”
---
The class that ganks you
---
you're the one posting a 7 month old comment from early on in development and crying about how he promised that there would only be sharding/layering in starting zones
---
This, if the idea of some dude abusing it pisses you off, then go abuse it better. If you plan on enjoying your leveling and taking your time then this has ZERO effect on you. That player would still be ahead of you BECAUSE they are hardcore, not because of the layering abuse.
---
I don't believe it's a bug since it was always that way, even on retail I think. The guards are programmed to only kill hostile mobs to keep them away from people standing in camp/city areas.
---
As far as durotar you can use this method with all the scorpions, bloodtalons, and razormane quillboar. It definitely is limited but depending on how saturated the starting zones are on release it could be worth it.
---
&gt;Sorta-kinda.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; But yea, there was no leak in the end. 
---
pick one :)
---
&gt;There was a leak of that number in November
---
no there wasn't.
---
&gt;how do you think that's relevant?
---
no I choose not to explain myself
---
Devilsaur mafia might exist on one or two servers yes,  if they all stuck together, but there going to be a ton of servers, don't think it's going to be a huge issue.
---
Arthas really did a number on Quel Thalas
---
You have my attention...
---
Gen Y are millennials tho.
---
Man whybare the gms and devs active in current game like this. Stupid stuff like this made the world so much more interesting and alive.
---
I watched the whole thing, had it in background while I was testing random stuff in stress test 
---
As they progressed through and respawns and pays started happening the tension built so high by the end. The packs with 38's crushing like crazy it was so intense by the end haha
---
Have to admit I was amped by the end it was like a movie haha
---
reposting the guide i made a week ago:

---
Dat lag
---
Supply and demand folks. If there are enough people on a server that another layer gets created, then more raw materials need to exist to supply the bigger population.
---
I remember my first experience leveling a troll. The quest said to go down that way to yet to the earth shaman rock thing. I went WAY that way and wound up in the barrens. I was not a smart noob
---
First picture reminds me of the ninja looter video.
---
"we gotta kill this wolf, and he's gonna drop these really good boots...."
---
The devs said in-game chat they were testing layering and you "could" see some phasing because it just turned on. You should not see phasing like this unless two layers consolidate because population has dropped, or someone invited you to a group in a different layer (obv you have to switch to be with them).
---
Ah shoot I got in and was gonna make a post on it. You got in a few hours before me it looks. Gratz!
---
Layering also has the advantage of solving a different non-Vanilla problem; population decline. After a few months a LOT of people are gonna leave. Layering makes it so you can control the server populations without having to do something awful like mergers.
---
Extremely excited for the official launch, honestly haven't had this much fun in WoW for a long long time. Even the corpse running to Gromgol was full of fun banter and laughs. It's good to be home.
---
You seriously think there won't be max capped servers after a few weeks? I don't remember servers being dead when TBC came out. There will be tons of high pop servers and for the people that quit there will be others who will join.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/428669378?t=04h47m13s
---
That's like 80% of potential votes. I will avoid the servers streamers have announced they will play on, but I'm not waiting to log in and play, so if asmon or whatever decides to be sneaky and not stream the first couple of hours or something and I wind up on his server then whatever.
---
Actually now that you mention it. It's possible you might not select the layer, that's just how I heard most people talk about it. But I am betting you will have to select a layer and you will make a character that's locked to that layer. (Opposed to making a character then selecting a layer to log into). Otherwise people will just log out and back in to get to a different layer. So the only way it COULD work is if they treat a layer like it's own server with characters locked to it. Unless you have a reason that would make sense for it to work another way?
---
Oof rough how crowded it is
---
If there's so many people that we need 2 layers then you won't have trouble finding you on your layer.
---
I have seen plenty of posts from people claiming that Classic will get steamrolled by people in very short order because we're all better players now. I think they underestimate how little decent loot there was being handed out in 40 man raids and how many fights were mathematically gear checks.
---
They're underestimating the impact on having to spend significant amounts of time outside of raid farming and prepping for raid, farming 5 mans for blues because they were rare - lots of people went into MC in greens, the amount of time getting 40 people to the instance entrance, the drama involved in managing a viable roster of 40 raiders with depth to cover absences, even just the amount of time involved in wipe recovery when you didn't spawn at the instance entrance when you died but half a zone away.
---
I suspect a lot of people are going in with a fantasy of what they think Vanilla should have been like, and are going to burn out really really quickly. I will be surprised if there are many serious raiding guilds operating 3 months after launch.
---
The only way this is doable is if you are on immediately when the servers come up. Not a minute behind, not a second behind. Loading in and moving before the mass of humanity that wants to play. Then you need to have a strategy to level out of the start zone that you are sharing with said mass.
---
Then you need to level faster than everyone else, otherwise there aren't going to be the number of mobs that you need to get quest items. If you can get ahead of the pack enough that you're among the first people to get to a zone to quest, you'll have a huge advantage as everyone else struggles with a lack of mobs, a lack of quest items, and possible zone lag. 
---
I'm in beta, also playing a warrior. I was not in the very first wave but I've seen plenty of people in my travels to the point where I'm usually sitting around waiting for respawns in order to do quests. It was infinitely easier for me to make this warrior due to the "lack of people" on the PvP beta server compared to what we will experience at launch, shards or not. Unless these 3 day or 4 day 20 hour records were set on a full brand new server (and I'm almost positive they aren't), the estimates aren't a good measure of what to expect. 
---
Speaking to people on beta, who think they are going to be clearing Molten Core in the first reset, I've heard that some guilds are having a "B Team" and a "C Team" make characters that are designed to support the ~50 or so people on the "A Team" who are trying to be in on that first clear. Those characters are meant to funnel potions, gear, other useful drops (and tradeable quest items), and gold to the "A Team" that are ahead of the pack. 
---
If you've got that kind of support behind you, and a group of friends that you can rely on, more power to you. But even the best of players are going to have issues pop up that cause them to lag behind. Maybe it's really bad RNG, server/shard instability, other unforseen problems, etc., and if you fall behind the pack, you're not going to be able to make it up elsewhere.
---
None of this includes the folks who will be account sharing, even if it's from the same physical location to avoid detection from Blizzard, server downtime to do hotfixes which might put you into a queue when things come back up, or PvP from the opposite faction if you play on a PvP realm. 
---
I have no doubt that there will be people that will somehow hit 60 in the first week, there might even be enough people in some guilds who do it to clear at least some of MC, if not the whole thing. But the number of people who believe they can do this is way too high. You're already making a commitment to having almost no sleep and spending nearly every waking moment sitting in front of your PC for almost a week. You also need to get sleep before going back to work after all of this, so take that into account. 
---
I've seen people practicing their routes and runs on the beta and the cap right now is only level 30. I'm sure people will refine their strategies even more as the beta continues and cap is raised. But I also saw the stress test yesterday and while launch day might not be as insane, I wouldn't bet on it.
---
I’d rather just have sharding in the starting zones for the first ~3 days than have layering everywhere for months
---
I read a blue post a few days ago that said they're removing rogues and gnomes from Classic. Don't worry about me citing my source, not my job to do that.
---
This is fun!
---
I already go raids without seeing upgrades in BFA lol.
---
Tho that's just cause there aren't any for me in the raids our raid does.
---
I meant that as more the "leak" exploded all over WoW news sites and social media, but there wasn't one.
---
Yeah it makes sense that they don't assist with neutral mobs. Maybe doing that optimally can help your grinding method? But around Razor Hill and the road towards it are mostly yellow mobs. I'll give this a try next stress test :)
---
You get devo at 2, and have literally no reason to ever turn it off, so quite likely.
---
Totem humpers have more raid utility. Druids were used more for dps and combat res
---
?? lol reply to the wrong comment, pal?
---
"first few weeks" is literally from Blizzard. 
---
Thats how long they anticipate having layers in Classic.
---
you can’t world first fifteen year old content
---
Seems unlikely that you would be locked into a layer as that would prevent people from playing with their friends. I doubt there will be a selection either. I expect it will be pretty much exactly what we're seeing now. Janky sharding until they hopefully remove the system.
---
I'm pretty sure we had Razorgore on farm long before that bug became well known. I raided Alliance and never saw this strat.
---
Stress Test was amazing. The whole vibe was really positive, and I'm optimistic about Classic being the same.
---
A couple screenshots from the end: https://imgur.com/a/SU8JHP5
---
I will optimize the amount of fun I will have as best as I can.
---
Jokes aside, thanks for the advise. I'll try.
---
RemindMe! Do it
---
Even more when it's on a version not officially released =(. Alot of no life out there waiting for the race xD
---
 
---
( not me tho )
---
Can you give some c ontext to the 2 PTR account limit? I have BFA PTR listed and the stress test one listed, but my account page on the website shows two listings for Legion PTR instead. Something sounds wrong with my PTRs, just hope im not sitting on a beta invite and not using it.
---
This is a really great write up.
---
I hope to see more.
---
thats the way I take to quickly uncover flight path there, there is a chest in the watert around there too
---
Between multiple difficulties, order hall/weekly chests and guildies who had it you never managed to loot it?
---
If you make an Alliance character and know a bit about the lore, you can visit Anduin in Stormwind Keep and tell them a little about him. It might be nice for your kids to see what is essentially another kid in charge.
---
I think the first time we killed Rags with no sons phase our TS server went crazy. It felt like an enormous achievement.
---
But how can you kill that which has no life?
---
Tad bit of overreaction, it's SM lol
---
Same. Fuck facebook
---
Your BFA point is not true at all. I can dip into and out of the BFA market at will, you just need to figure out where to put the effort in. 
---
Made 80k of two simple crafts last night that I noticed noone had put up. less than 5 posts of each. Didnt post a single auction first 6 months of BFA because I was too busy having fun.
---
Not that BFA is great but..the goblin comment. Cmon. Of ALL the things you can complain about, and you go there??
---
It's likely tuned to make it happen a lot to reveal bugs, rather than to make it happen as little as possible.
---
Basically fuck everyone on beta to try to figure out how to do it better.
---
I don't get it either. /2 wtb explanation
---
Yeah, just wanted to make sure. Of the core that is going to found the guild, I'm the only one with any significant tanking experience (some off-tanking in TBC, MT through Wrath, Cata, and MoP).
---
Been practicing some warrior tanking on a vanilla pserver, since I mostly tanked as a paladin. I may have temporarily forgotten about LoS pulls for casters lol.
---
I’ll be honest if they release a banshee type race similar to sylvanas I will 100% level an alt 1-120, otherwise I’ll just enjoy seeing the pic of them for 5 seconds on google and forget about it.

Undead Rogue since that was mine in 04  and  Undead lock

Even if you have a pocket healer, it's not possible. Prot warriors have subpar dmg. Between your low dmg and having to stop and eat or bandage, it's gonna take some time
---
It's so true and so sad at the same time. Sheep..
---
I think if they made it so that you could not see resource nodes for a limited time after changing layers it would be a pretty good fix for this. Either way this is obviously a bug that needs to be fixed before launch and I'm sure it will be.
---
I'm gonna roll on Asmons server and McCool and I are gonna be friends :)

RemindMe! 96 days "dodat"
---
Oh mine says 2 legion ptrs as well and it's just 1 classic stress test and the other BFA. Basically the 2 PTR account limit was discovered when the last stress test invites came out on Wednesday where if you had 2 BFA ptrs on your account and if you were flagged for classic it wouldn't add the new classic PTR account because of the limit. It was only discovered because people received an email but not the account so they manually removed the extra BFA PTR and reflagged the accounts. Not sure if they have worked on a workaround yet but if it's happened again we will know when people receive a classic beta email but not an account/access for.it
---
Anyone have a link to confirmation of cthun prenerf? I've only seen rumor so far.
---
Did anyone get a trustworthy guide? I never played WoW before, but I decided to play on a private server until the official is released.   
---
Guides say going BM talents, getting owl (night elf), and later getting screech skill for it for easier AoE aggro and tanking capabilities. 
---
Buying Bows and Ammo from vendors first few levels (lev 11 bow, lev 10 ammo upgrade). 
---
Engineering for more damage and survivability and ammo.
---
And then there is all that thing about macros that I don't really understand, there are many versions. 
---
What I got about all of that is, the auto attack is basically very high damage "skill" which can't be used if you are moving (interrupt message), but while you are moving you can use skills between auto attacks. 
---
There is also all that thing about controlling a pet. So macros usually have - mark a target-send pet while using autoattack-use skills. But still...I used mark-autoattack-arcane-concussive-serpent combo since the moment I got all those skills, while always moving while casting a skill and then stopping for the auto attack to go off. 
---
I still didn't get to level 10 (started to play a few hours ago) to see how it all goes with a pet...but seeing all those macros just makes it all so confusing. I get it that they can make things easier, but I don't want to use something I don't really need. So, which are the really good ones?
---
Lol k
---
except with wow's server tech the nodes are still shared between layers. You see this in retail when you go to harvest a node but it vanishes or says that someone is already interacting with that node even though no one is around you.
---
Cross-faction collusion is against the rules though, which is what they are doing.
---
In classic,  druid, pally, shamans,  the hybrids.
---

Hey OP, do you also still have the Stress Test account listed in your options along with the beta? 
---
I noticed that one is still there for me, but when I logged in it only showed the stress test server which is obviously offline because they're done with it.
---
Did anyone's stress test account option get removed?
---
!reminder 96 days
---
I love all the No. It will always be streamers factions fighting each others lol. I want something different.
---
This is the age of entitlement.  all i wish for is that this reddit can have good discussions  and less memes and complaints.  i dont give a damn about streamers, beta testing and alpha males. i just want to have a healthy game release in late august
---
I believe at least after the first week it will definitely start to rise back up again. I can’t wait to see all the kids who never experienced vanilla but are super pumped to play it for the first time get absolutely turned off once they realize how bare boned and difficult vanilla was. Actually having to walk everywhere, no mount till 40, having to actually figure out where to go for a quest based off the quest giver lol so many little QOL things that I’m sure will annoy people so much that they just go back to BFA.
---
It's more than just brightness. It's like there's a fuzziness to objects. Makes the world seem kind of ethereal and dreamy.
---
Hunter is pretty much a utility class. Not only do you kite, but your only value, spellwise, comes from tranquilizing shot (for enrages) and trueshot aura for five ranged-raid members. 
---
Kinda cool that you can play Hunter, be guaranteed a raid slot, but at the same time not entirely play the hyper-min/max DPS game.
---
They will probably all be on the same or close dont you think ? Really curious of the results
---
Having played with the new character models in 1.12 on P servers its really not the jarring at all. And best of all the new models use the old animations fine.
---
Ahhh I remember you man! Thanks for the epic battles! A lasting memory for sure.
---
Same. I got in the day after it started but I still don't have an email. I just came home from work and checked and there it was.
---
Pally/shaman bring the best buffs. Hunters can kite yeah but it is rare it's useful, it's not like you do it every fight or even every second fight. More like one fight per raid. 90% of the time you'll be expected to dps.
---
I wonder if our characters will persist? I don't mind either way, but it'd be cool to start off at 5 to get to 10 quicker
---
What? My classicwow front page has been almsot nothing but BDF posts for days.
---
This is the best answer
---
Ohh i know that strat. It’s been forever but i know it.
---
Hi, /u/Armoonsb
---
&gt; Class officers, the middle management of Guilds
---
Well, fuck, this puts my life into sharper perspective than I'd expected :&lt;
---
That was by far the coolest part of the stress test
---
&gt;RemindMe! 95 days
---
Both Tribe and Monkeynews were on LH servers and are both now streaming, and they arent arrogant like tips. Be careful the groups you put people in, its more just that Tipsout talks out his ass.
---
I'm a GM/RL of a retail guild. If I do end up playing Classic there's no way in hell I will be putting my hand up to be an officer for any guild, I remember having to be loot officer for way too many years maintaining the DKP tables, or having to work out who could come and who was being sat out each week, and all the drama that caused. Nope. Not doing it again.
---
You too! A good guild can be ruined by bad officers. Don’t be afraid to keep your players in line. What they do out in the world effects your guilds reputation.
---
Yes! Let us stress test a dungeon.
---
Towards the end, ran my Orc Hunter to Northshire Valley.  Met up with an Undead Priest.  We would /hi, /dance etc... even help kill mobs the human characters were working on.  But sure enough we got attacked, and that's where the real fun began.  Ended the stress test with a huge smile, from simple low level world PvP.  Good times.
---
lol people are going to destroy BWL in Classic
---
now we just need to cause more issues so they make it a weekly event :)
---
Layering is going to be abused so hard. A bunch of mages in my guild are going to use layering to just AoE level to 60 without ever having to wait for respawns or player competition.
---

 A random group formed in goldshire to try and fight off some horde and kill hogger. The majority of ended up staying together for the rest of the day for over 11 hours just exploring and chatting in the ingame voice and discord. We ended up making a guild. These are a few screenshots I took of the adventures. Thanks for a great day hoggers in the chat boys!
---
In original vanilla there were more alliance players than horde. I suspect in classic it will be about equal.
---
What I've always wondered is since that's the case, why is the term "ninja loot" defined as a deliberate act?
---
He posted another link in the comments here showing how his Launcher shows 2 "Beta &amp; Stress Test" options in his dropdown menu.  One is named WoW2 and the other WoW3.
---
Every class had a niche role that no other class could fill
---
Warriors- tanking
---
Priests- heavy heals and fortitude
---
Mages- portals and food
---
Warlocks- summons, healthstones, and soul stone
---
Druids- battle res, emergency tank, mana restore, and mark
---
Paladins- direct heals
---
Hunters- kiting and pet pulls
---
Rogues- interrupts 
---
Shamans- totem buffs, raid heals, and lust
---
I am talking from a gameplay perspective. Upon launch everyone will be at the exact same 6 starter zones. There are 2-6 minute respawn timers on all mobs. When everyone 2 weeks later are spread out through Azeroth the need for many layers decrease drastically.
---
Listen to what Ion says in the clip. Yes technically the game can handle it, but it will be a miserable experience. They want to give everyone a nice fluid experience.
---
Orc Rogue, best racial perks by a mile.
---
Thinking orc rogue because I know it, I'm skilled with it, and I'll have fun and nostalgia with it. But still considering orc warrior because I've always wanted to 2h and I've always wanted to wield Ashkandi. The only time I saw it drop, it was disenchanted.
---
Tried to get everyone :)
---
As great as the test was, there were def layering issues. I'm sure there were more people in there (from other screenshots), than what's shown in mine.
---
It depends on server.
---
He’s not wrong though? Players in BFA get and lose money super fast. It’s the Goblins that banked off WoD and Legion and flipping that aren’t effected. People have been bitching that the gold sinks at every level of the expansion is hurting casual players and anyone who isn’t a goblin. Which is true, most of my guild would have burn through what ever we got for raids and mythic plus.
---
Blizzards poll showed a 56/44 split favoring the horde. The horde is apparantly the favorite in retail as well now. 
---
I'm still rolling Alliance for the fresh new experience. Idgaf, shorter BG queue times I guess.
---
It creates a new layer when the population hits a certain number, around 3k. During the stress test, when logging in you may have a pretty good chance of getting into a new layer, but it does not create one just for you every time you log in.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "doo diss"
---
yup, hes a douche.
---
By the time AQ was open, my guild was running raids 5 days per week, that included 2 days of 20 man raids for ZG and AQ20, and three days per week for AQ40 and potentially the other 40mans (MC/BWL). We ran progression on the weekend and there was an expectation that everyone should make an effort to attend (minimum attendance requirements), the farm content and 20 mans ran during the week.
---
For context, for the AQ Gate questline, you had to run BWL in under 4 hours - for many guilds trying to complete the staff, that was the roadblock.
---
Tauren shaman
---
Night Elf Druid. Prefer horde, but I cant play cows.
---
in 2004 bro
---
I assumed everyone got in? Is that not true?
---
No, you're locked onto a layer. But other layers can interact with each-other because all the layers are just part of a mega-server. So, you can still join guilds, group up etc. with anyone from the other layers part of the mega-servers. You will choose a server/layer, make your character. Your character is locked to that layer like a server BUT you can still interact with everyone in the other layers part of your mega-server. Including travel to the other layers. Because remember, you're all on one server, just in different layers.
---
There's a reason dkp was a thing. It's because loot was so rare you had to had to save for a month to get 1 thing that otherwise would go to a pug.
---
So edgy. My nelf rogue wears bloodfang to this day. Bloodfang &gt; all other sets.
---
Worrying about streamers is the last thing I'll be doing when picking a realm. If I pick one with a streamer, fine, otherwise, whatever; what effect would it really have on me?
---
No pushback, no capped targets, infinite mana? Holy Nova was the best heal, really. Leave the MT healing to the others who have shorter or instant casts.
---
This makes my nostalgia happy
---
With dynamic virtual server technology, why can't they simply vary the size of the virtual server according to the population of the server? Oldschool wow had dead servers and nobody cared. I'd prefer there be a few very large servers with many players than be on a sparsely populated server, but nobody ever said they can't forcibly transfer players to more populated servers. I hate layering and other manipulations of the population. It ruins the purpose of massive multiplayer online games and is what made wow so fuckin awesome in the old days.
---
I'm actually in the beta.. but nice try
---
You mean just like how they said sharding would only stay in the starting zones?
---
RemindMe! 96 days "di this"
---
Okay so something tips doesn't do is hold blood rage right. You always keep it unless you need the pump for when a rog tries to stealth drop combat so you can't be sapped during it. (Pre berserker rage ofc) also getting 5-8 kited is pretty silly, he should have thrown wep and take a step back and throw to prevent rogue from dropping combat. Not having tactical mastery is bad as fuck. Even a prot tank should get tactical mastery, it's the best pvp talents you can have at 30 besides maybe deep wounds. Using demoralizing shout would have helped him. 50%over power crit. 5% base crit.
---
Most of the fight seemed to be lack of talent knowledge, without the setup you can be trivialized on warrior.
---
Also he never switches to sword&amp;board. If you are a prot warrior a shield will reduce a rog dmg by like 40%. You will also be able to disarm in defensive stance which im not sure if you can get wep chain in beta. But a disarm (cant remember if you can get imp with talents,) can greatly hinder a rog.
---
Without tact mastery you are basically throwing away 10-20 rage every 10 seconds which is fucking terrible. Spec properly. If you want to pvp at all you need it, it is essential.
---
Pff. Forsaken show up in Barrens to quest too. Pretty much all of the horde go there. Even in Vanilla I saw forsaken dancing around X-Roads.
---
Night elf mohawk
---
Like Goku taking off the weights bois
---
Is it true that part of the Furbolg Totem dungeon still in the game? 
---
I remember there being a quest in Teldrassil where you go down this spiral into a furbolg den (I just looked it up and I think it's the Ban'ethil Barrow Den), and I always heard that was originally part of a dungeon that got scrapped.
---
I'm not sure if it's true or not tbh, but it's interesting to think about.
---
We had a hunter in our guild do that - it was magnificent to watch. Once.
---
I went around asking people their /played time as I ran my own routes, I averaged about 1 hour to 5 as a gnome rogue. The average /played was 1h30 (I have a spreadsheet if people are interested) of random players. That being said, I am 99.9% sure that dynamic spawning, or at least sped up spawning was **TURNED ON** in the stress test. This is 100% not how it's going to be live, I wouldn't think much into these rates to be completely honest.
---
Edit: I leveled 8 rogues. The times were using fedex method only.
---
But only temporarily.
---
Just force him to play when it comes out. It's a 15 dollar experience.
---
I was a priest in vanilla and i loved healing.
---
I was/am a bit miffed about the way my gear was so much less useful  to me than a dps class's. 
---
They got better at all aspects of the game while I only got better at grouping.
---
/console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 5
---
or
---
/script console=SetCVar("cameraDistanceMax", 50)
---
for those who would just like to Ctl + C/Ctrl + V it into game
---
Perhaps they ought to give the layer swap a 15 minute CD or something to line up with conjured items. No reason in particular, just to line up with other "logged out" timers
---
I'm waiting for all the QQ about the Green Dragons. Only one group can get the kill per cycle. Approximately 4 days before it spawns again.
---
Is bloodfang a viable lvl 60 set though? I know there's no transmogs and for armour in this era it's my favourite aesthetically.
---
I'm curious about how they are going to deal with the initial launch, when everyone is crammed into elwynn or vally of trials. Ion brought up sharding as a solution to this. But I havnt heard anything since.
---
Some people were saying blizzard would never have a launch where this happened. It would make new players quit and have a bad experience.
---
Are they still using sharding at the launch? Along with layering for higher level zones? This is unclear to me
---
Elwynn forest is providence
---
3000 *per* continent
---
so 6000 per "layer" Because eastern kingdoms and kalimdor are discreet unconnected zones.
---
That's a long time
---
Dynamic/Sped up spawns were turned on, I don't think these rates are accurate.
---
This reads like a political thriller based on historical events. Thanks.
---
Perplexity is one of the best rogues out there. He would beat any one of you haha.
---
Ive said that so many times i figure if he understands the gameplay and then watches something like venrukis nuts engages against asmon hell get hyped as all hell
---
I believe Ion said that Layering will only be in phase 1, but we will see.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Probably a stupid question, but were any of the spawned bosses killed? Did they even break 90%?
---
&gt; PvP: Warlock
---
Unless you're Alliance. Because WotF is *that* broken.
---
I had forgotten about this, but I remember the drama BWL caused. 
---
We cleared BWL after too many months, moved on to AQ40 and Twin Emps and only ever got them down once before disbanding.
---
I remember there was a mod where you played cards inbetween wipes which was the only way to kill time when you were waiting for people to Rez or if you were waiting for late comers.
---
 I'm definitely going back for Vanilla but I wonder if I could go through all of that again.
---
Yeah it is definitely shorter.
---
Tauren Druid.. always wanted to be a Druid and always wanted to have my main on horde
---
I'm doing my part!
---
Being shown a tutorial video on a game is the #1 to kill any hype a person could get for the game. Just spend 15 dollars and make him play it for a bit.
---
WoW isnt hard. If he has half a brain he'll figure it out as he goes, as long as you're not behind him telling him what's optimal and meta.
---
It's a fun game, people find it addictive even. I'm sure if you by your friend this $15 worth of crack, he'll probably like it.
---
I see
---
yea i explored jasperlode mine in elwynn and got 40 silver, which helped me buy my cat pet from crazy cat lady. thought that was a bit of a high reward, makes sense now.
---
Mining
---
So what's your point?
---
I'm pretty sure everyone knows you can jump on a Zepplin and travel.
---
From my experience players on Twitter and Reddit that actually care about the game have always leaned more Horde than Alliance.
---
I'm predicting a 51/49 or 52/48 split either way for most servers.
---
It depends on when it makes a new layer relative to the population of the server.  Let's say max pop is 3,000 people and a new layer starts at 3001.  That means you have virtually the same number of people but twice the number of materials.
---
I thought my friends and I were something special with our private Ventrilo binds talking shit in MC/BWL, but I guess the clique phenomenon was a common occurrence. I feel so basic now. 
---
The first guild I was in also hit a wall at Razorgore and I ended up leaving because it wasn't fun wiping for week on the same boss. I remember it was frustrating watching people who put in very little effort learning the game and their class die over and over again to the same mobs that were not much harder than a couple big UBRS pulls. Except they were the same people who probably only ran UBRS once to get their Ony key and never set foot in it again, so it made sense.
---
I guess this experience was more typical of vanilla than I realized, haha. It's nice to see a write-up that really captures a lot of the essence of what it was like doing those early raids. So much nostalgia.
---
ooof, I guess people need to see a /s to understand it.
---
There's more knowledge out there but a large number of current players are total dogshit man.
---
I'm on the fence with this overall, but the above clip and related exploits seem worse than server merging to me. I'm just hoping for more communication between each stress test about what they're tweaking with the system.
---
Whats this free month of game time everyone seems to be talking about? where do i get it?
---
Screenshot of my ultrawide view. Had no idea you could see ratchet from the starting zone! I always rolled Alliance so this was really cool to see. 
---
[https://imgur.com/QQuR1Bs](https://imgur.com/QQuR1Bs)
---
That would just give it an extra level of pressure, imo. I think it could be done in an interesting way.
---
&gt; Yeah I couldn't tell if he was self-aware meming
---
He is.  I watched him spam execute (by clicking) on mobs starting at 100% health just so "right when they hit 20% I hit them with an execute."
---
Its all a persona to get a reaction out of his chat.
---
I would agree with you for retail WoW. But the Classic dev team do seem to be paying attention to bug reports and are responding to the most prolific ones, in addition to explaining why popular reports aren't actually bugs, like the elite boss dmg.
---
Definitely a night and day difference to BFA beta, in my opinion
---
He doesn't really need to understand anything. You just need to make sure that he sits down on his ass on the 27th and experience how vanilla WoW sucks you into a different world.
---
I notice the same when playing on a classic private server. No sound coming from my computer. I’m on a desktop iMac
---
Underrated. Exactly how I feel.
---
I’m agreeing with you and just saying that I saw forsaken going to X-roads all the time?
---
Aside from my Lock, Rogue and Priest, when I was in Xroads I’d see forsaken all the time there. I think even though SFK is awesome everyone just gravitates to Xroads.
---
Idk cuz i was excited to play regardless but with all the streamers playing and watching old videos ive just been getting more and more hyped daily
---
I admit to being one of those players with a 'unviable' spec - I healed as a druid with 31 points in Balance.
---
I raided through to 2/3 of the way through Naxx before TBC launched.
---
Sometimes it depended just how 'unviable' the spec was and the player. I may not have had the biggest throughput as a healer, but I was still healing when the rest had run out of mana due to my regen (balance talents).
---
Another druid in my raid team healed as 31 points in Feral. He was also one of our back up off-tanks.
---
It could be done.
---
Remind me! 97 days
---
Inability to play isn't the issue.  It's the inevitable population spike and subsequent crash that are the problem.  There will be tons of low pop servers without layering.
---
Hi, /u/spArk_k
---
either way is a good split, i just dont want to be an overwhelming majority.
---
Nothing about retail is amazing except the newer models and maybe some spell effects
---
its part of the experience even with layering
---
TBC and Wrath were both as good if not better than Legion.
---
pretty sure most streamers will be forced onto a pve server. for the few that will play on pvp servers im hoping those servers will be easy to avoid (im sure a lot of streamers will play on the same servers)
---
Undead priest most likely. Possibly troll priest.
---
Female, because if I'm going to have to wear a dress, I may as well rock it.
---
Ya I like your write up too. This little thing I typed is just something I always say to people who say that vanilla is easy because a lot of the boss fights are easier. There's just more to it than that.
---
Holy shit that's a lot of players
---
Yes that furbolg den probably is the dungeon
---
Same for the fargodeep mine, it is probably the kobold lair.
---
Brambleblade ravine could also be the tauren dungeon.
---
- says increasingly nervous man
---
I forgot about that!!
---
That sounds terrible :  you are unable to join any other groups on different layers for one hour because you have been in too many groups in the last hour.
---
They usually have the help of hi level alts or friends a prot war... haha
---
I wish Kara was in vanilla so bad.
---
Seems like every server I played on was about 55-60% alliance. Horde is excellent because you get faster queue times and in most cases someone tries to go for that mining or herb node, it's an enemy you can kill for it and not an ally.
---
I hope the dynamic hasn't changed.
---
I saw Thrall went down
---
!RemindMe 96 days do this
---
I don’t think your guildies understand how layering works. You can’t just hop layers to a pristine, empty layer. If there are other layers, there will be other players in those layers.
---
 RemindMe! 96 Days
---
I have nothing against streamers its just the way beta invites for all games these days go. If you don't think Streamers are getting a preferential treatment for beta keys you are in for a rude awaking. Destiny just got in and he as never played WoW ever in his life. Shouldn't they prioritizing older accounts over players who have never played the game? I'm sure him being a streamer has nothing to do with it right?
---
Kick him in his balls.
---
While hes down, hit some other pressure points.
---
Chop to the throat/jugular. Charlie horse his inner thigh. Some hard punches to the ribs or stomach. Smash the knee so he gets that pain like in that family guy episode.
---
Just do these things and he wont be your friend anymore. Then you got nothing to worry about. 
---
You welcome dogg
---
According to interviews it sounded like it would be the entire world would stick you to one layer with everyone else in that layer. Seems to be something else going on with major cities, though.
---
A ninja-pull always meant an intentional pull when I played vanilla. Like someone that was salty enough to pull a pack just before rage quitting. Or more commonly angsty hunters that want to get through the dungeon faster by running ahead and ninja pulling packs.
---
An accidental pull was usually called a body pull if it was because you accidentally got too close to a mob.
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/PatientGloriousMomTBTacoRight](https://clips.twitch.tv/PatientGloriousMomTBTacoRight)
---
Oh shit thats 195 iq
---
What were the rewards it again?
---
Yeah this seems like a long ass time away :(.
---
Not true at all. 3 Subbed accounts in my family 2 of them from December 2004 and none of us got in.
---
I think in the (somewhat unlikely) case of 3 full layers 1 month in on the one realm they would just spin up a new server and allow free character transfers. Put a 2 min login queue on the overpopulated one and you'll quickly thin things out.   
---
Your realm cluster solution sounds like it is exactly the same as layering but you're banning groups/guilds from grouping through clusters. By doing this all you're saying is that they aren't the same server at all, they're separate servers with just a shared character name list so they can be merged. The problem then is that people have to control which cluster they are on, and you have the exact same problems as servers do- people flock to some and desert others. You have no way of guaranteeing your clusters are set up to merge in a way that actually solves the problem of population balance. The point of layering is that it dynamically splits up players while still allowing them to play together, so you get your intelligent population balancing AND people can still play together.  
---
Obviously that is what leads to the server hopping exploitation things, but I guess Blizzard thinks it's a worthy sacrifice so that the pop in and out isn't extensive and jarring (like it would be with sharding), and it allows groups of people to play together while preserving population balance through a ridiculously inflated population at launch.
---
I think esfand
---
I'd bring him in a week or two later so he doesn't get discouraged if there is a server crash or three.
---
Is this supposed to happen?? [https://imgur.com/12PQBfk](https://imgur.com/12PQBfk)
---
Have you seen the videos of people abusing the layering in Beta right now? They do something (mine a node, pick an herb, clear a crypt), log onto an alt, then log back in. BAM, node/herb/crypt respawned.
---
here is to classic. 3 months to go
---
Is that official?
---
Was streaming it over on my Twitch (twitch.tv/IrishGallowglass)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usyk_SqpYjc&amp;feature=share
---
Hilarity ensued.
---
Attacking skill (level * 5 for bosses, weapon skill for players) versus Defense skill determines chance to hit/miss. You subtract that chance from 100%, then subtract parry and dodge and block from that. Then, you add in the chance to crit and crush. Shield Block increases your block chance high enough to get you to 100% chance to get missed, parry, dodge, or block to greater than 100%, so there is no more chance to get crit or crushed. So essentially, Shield Block removes your chance to get crit.
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/PatientGloriousMomTBTacoRigh](https://clips.twitch.tv/PatientGloriousMomTBTacoRight) have they talked about the ways to abuse the layering system?
---
Thought I'd share what I experienced with my time on the 1st Stress Test Beta.
---
things are only fair when you consider the time investment. witch you are not.
---
Tauren druid
---
No achievements, and you can reserve up to three characters names, if I’m not mistaken.
---
Doesn't the same problem still result? Dead servers result in the lack of "MM" in MMORPG. Then forcing people onto new servers means people will cry foul on the "community" aspect of the game. 
---
If layering ends relatively quick then most of the population won't be at high enough level to get into these kinds of exploits.
---
just  the tip guys.
---
That’s phasing. Not layering and it’s not how it’s supposed to be.
---
very interesting, and we are talking about the stress test correct?
---
Same.  My only thought is that it wasn't technically feasible for some reason, but that doesn't make sense with how much sharding and phasing has been in the game since wotlk.
---
This feels like an interpretation designed by an alliance king.  I think theramore and nightelf territory are grossly overstated (most of theramore's territory is actually ruled either by dragonkin or ogres if you go to dustwallow marsh, you can't honestly say that anything outside of the island theramore sits on feels "controlled" or owned by anything with two legs and one head.  Also huge swathes of "night elf" territory are in no way controlled by the night elf empire.  Feralas, felwood, stone talon and moonglade to name a few.  If there is a driving "narrative" for kalimdor it's that the horde, and the goblin clans, are slowly but surely driving the night elves back to Teldrassil.  By the time of Classic, the map doesn't look like this anymore.
---
That’s a wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide screen right there.
---
First stress test has just concluded and I recorded a few things here and there. Just made a short edit with some of the clips I had. It's kind of lame, but maybe some of you will enjoy.
---
This beta has the good ol' classic feel. Level 1's running around every where, stupid meme's, hogger, and people enjoying some classic wow.
---
Some of the things I tested:
---
1) Certain skips are available - e.g. dying in the corner of the troll cave of the dwarf starting area to port to the Kharanos graveyard).
---
2) Warlock pets - I main a warlock so this experience was very important to me. Pet commands seem to fall within the current implementation of spell batching and it just feels clunky. At times your pet responds immediately to a command and at other times it sits there for nearly a second before your input is carried out in game. I really hope this is something that Blizzard looks into because it just didn't feel smooth.
---
3) High level gathering nodes - I went to Burning Steppes to look for rich thorium veins and more specifically to see if dark iron ore was available. To my knowledge dark iron shouldn't be available at early stages of the game and this is seemingly correct, because I couldn't find any nodes. I passed nearly 15 rich thorium node spawns and only saw 3 total spawned in the world. If a new layer is made I hope objects for gathering professions take some time to spawn.
---
4) Lava jumping - I went into Blackrock Mountain to test lava jumping, which is jumping consecutively to avoid the lava's fire damage. I was not successful on multiple attempts. At times I would res and it would take a moment for the lava to inflict damage, but at other times it would tick immediately after res'ing.
---
5) World chests - High level chests are in the game and available 8)
---
Hopefully later down the line they will allow us to test high level spells in the stress tests.
---
Thanks all!
---
That's why layering will be relaxed as the player count goes down. This is a complete non-issue, because they've already said that they're only doing layering while the initial player count is high. They're planning for a significant portion of the player-base to become bored with Classic and drop out, at which point the number of layers will go down, allowing them to just have one or two. Don't freak out just because layering will be on while everyone is, on average, level 20-40.
---
 The inevitable population spike and subsequent crash that are the problem. There will be tons of low pop servers without layering.
---
Stress test showed me that launch is going to be the painful experience the #nochanges folks want it to be, and it has nothing to do with the actual window where people struggled to log in.
---
I made a character tonight before the serve closed and even with the modest (by comparison) amount of people in the starter zone it took HALF AN HOUR to do the first human kobold quest due to the amount of competition and the slower respawns.  
---
Definitely puts things in perspective.
---
You purists need everything to be 100% exact, it's so damn weird.
---
And Oomkins breath from their feet!
---
Really? Fury warriors?
---
I've heard of it being hunters/shamans more often because they're sacrificing less dps than what fury does with BiS weapons.
---
Yeah that's a rough spot.  Might need to have a "1 reserved piece of loot total per run" or something.  Unless that rogue is in your AQ/Naxx Progession group or something.
---
I was there.. on a different layer...
---
Not necessarily - layering works for the whole world, not just a zone like sharding.  
---
You have your bell curve for the character population. If 90% of the player characters are between lvl 15-35, your aoe'ing mages might be 45 in a low populated zone. But the way layering works is it spins up entire continents, not zones - so if you have 15,000 characters on the realm than 3 layers will be spawned to manage the population for redridge/the barrens where most of the players are. But this also means 3 tanaris's will be generated too, so the low pop tanaris will go become 3x very very low pop tanaris - and that could well be the difference between having aoe levelling be viable or not.
---
is this for stress test or beta? cos i have a legion ptr there now!
---
Friend logs in and you group with him, the cooldown wouldn't matter here cause if you can't leave your layer friend can still join yours.
---
it was fun and at the same time frustrating to getting to the dark portal but when i did and went for a bio break and getting back to my pc i saw 4 characters kneeling infront of me lol. priceless moment idd. it was really fun chatting with you guys as the world was coming to its end.
---
When it comes to buying mounts, I don't think people realize that gold can only come from quests and vendors. It doesn't matter how much you farm and craft because the value of all loot will be limited by the total amount of gold in circulation, and that gold will be incredibly scarce in the first few weeks.
---
There’s no way to tell which one it is from the website. You’ll have to log in to the client.
---
Dwarf warrior/human mage/dwarf priest/human rogue.
---
Because this is a BETA and the system most likely isn't perfected yet. Hard to wrap your head around, I know.
---
Careful now. You can't question Blizzard decisions over here. Only submission and giving in your support blindly is allowed.
---
yea i got into the stress test alright. fuck sharding.
---
They do but they are low priority.
---
hes wrong btw
---
They are only doing it for launch to handle the mass amounts of players. They have stated this will be temporary and they tested collapsing layers today on the stress test server
---
hahaha not a chance, good luck hitting 40 in that time as a warrior.
---
Haha loved their commercials. Enjoyed the toyota one alot.
---
It’s the same tech, they just made the shards basically as big as the whole continent so you don’t see people disappear as you’re walking between zones or whatever (since you stay on one)
---
nice screenshot! :) i was having a hard time getting one in the throne room cuz everyone kept talking, so i'm glad you got one of all of us instead. was fun to play with you, see ya next stress test!
---
Even if it's just the 1st few packs, it's still everything since the rest will respawn before you clear to them.
---
Itll still be pretty darn jarring when they merge them. I dont want a ton of cross realm stuff in classic via realm mergers. Remember if I took the name Orcdude and someone got the same name and we got merged the game has to handle that. Meaning you'll have Orcdude-Realm1 and Orcdude-Realm2
---
Layering is so much better than that junk
---
I disagree. The #nochanges pleayers most likely played Vanilla and they know that a lot of things take time in Vanilla. 
---
The first days yes it will be slow to do the initial quests but people will probably have fun and enjoy it. The real grind begins later and it takes a lot of time to level tour profession or even to reach level 60.
---
OK but why
---
Actually I'm fine with dual-spec, giving paladins taunt, and level 60 Karazhan.
---
How do you define a realm cluster beforehand to people? Do you even tell people about the cluster? 
---
You could abuse it by making a character on each realm in the cluster and just hopping realms assuming the cluster will collapse. 
---
Do you create new UI to show what cluster you're part of? 
---
That is not vanilla. #nochanges
---
What about Timmy whose friend Phil is on Server A in Cluster 3?
---
Server A is full but Server C has room. Oops sorry Timmy looks like server A never got small enough you can deal with que times forever or stay on server C. Phil isnt going to change though because all his friends are on server A. Its the same issue, can you expect the clusters to collapse back or should you expect the servers to stay individual?
---
What about server identity?
---
Clusters mean at any moment your server could get merged with another. Which is what blizzard wants to avoid doing.
---
Lets say the cluster fully collapses to a single server, what about the characters names? What players get to keep their names and who has to change? How do you decide who gets the name change? 
---
That is gonna piss people off no matter what. 
---
Or do make clusters effectively servers and enforce naming across the cluster expecting it to collapse?
---
That is basically layering then. Just now you're assigned a layer that doesnt change until phase 2. And Timmy still doesn't get to see Phil for 2 months. After which theres suddenly 3x more people running around that he's never met that already have guilds and raid groups made. Plus lucky johnny got onto a dead server in the cluster, so now he's stupid far ahead since the high end mats were uncontested.
---
TL;DR:
---
There are issues with literally every single possible course of action blizzard could take. Its time to stop being drama queens; that try to start an argument over something that, they have zero control over and, will not effect them 2 months after launch.
---
Little bit offtopic but I always liked how every continent was almost specific to one faction with one exception. Like kalimdor is only horde except of night elfes and lorderon the same for alliance with undead (when talking about major cities). Now in bfa they tried this one again and it‘s kind of a mess. Back in the day it used to be more clear. You could still level as alliance on kalimdor but most people did it in lorderon. I also rly like how different the two continents are. Kalimdor is this rough plane world with the barrens and on the other side the magical woods of the nightelfs. Lorderon is more a traditional medieval world with human kingdoms and mountains etc

A lot of retail players joined I guess, was not this bad when it was around 20k at least.
---
wish i had an ultrawide sometimes, look at all that space for activities!
---
on Esfands ClassiCast show, they had a couple of the early devs on and talked about this.
---
iirc, the initial plan for all the cave systems you encounter was for them to be group/dungeon content, but the idea was dropped early on
---

Lol, indeed. I am seeing lots of speculation that it's going to ruin the economy somehow reward speed runners beyond thier wildest dreams.
---
Can we sticky this. Lol. That glow was killing me.
---
I’m sorta a “no changes” but if they stayed alittle bigger I wouldn’t be devastated.
---
Theres a little gated area in the tram that gnomes could get into but my nightelf coulnt. No idea if thats changed over the years or not
---
Yes they are debuffs. And it depends on priority. Higher priority debuffs will bump off a lower one if 16 debuff limit is reached. Lower priority ones cannot overwrite higher priority ones.
---
This has me so hyped. Thanks for taking the time to write this up.
---
Why do you care?
---
your experience as an individual is irrelevant when we're talking about millions of users
---
TUJ knows better than you.
---
every realm has auctions undercutting by 50-75% around the clock.
---
you made 80k? extraordinary! also irrelevant.
---
blizzard has lost control of its economy ages ago and they admitted it
---
&gt;  Of ALL the things you can complain about, and you go there??
---
i dont understand what you;re suppose to say with that and i don't think i should care
---
Yes. Its what you wear for a while.
---
No, what they said is phase 1. They did not tell us how long phase 1 is. So you pulled first few weeks out of nowhere.
---
Eh it was about 4-5 hours after the stress test started but yeah after that it was fine.
---
How do scripts not work? In vanilla you needed to use scripts in many situations because things like /startattack didn't exist yet. 
---
It's been a long time but you'll want to put things on off bars and combine accordingly, like:
---
/Cast spell
---
/Script if not iscurrentaction(#) then useaction(#) end;
---
Where # is the corresponding hot bar slot.
---
So brass tacks, could the warrior have won there?
---
Pics or you don't exist :)
---
If only those humanoids dropped some cloth to make bandages with..
---
Arguably has easier but harder ways to exploit though. Dynamic respawns have a consistent way to be able to get every single item, eg having a devilsaur mafia, or being able to get every lotus 100% of the time.       
---
But in the other way layering is an easy one swap assuming that you have non guildies in a different layer and no one else is farming stuff. The end results the same more or less, just one has an easier way to control vs the other
---
Why do people treat server merges like they are so bad? If they are planned from the beginning, then it is just the same as having layers collapse into one... without the whole sharding thing.
---
Classic needs no convincing

"An additional Classic Stress Test has been scheduled for May 29th! Blizzard has acknowledged the issues many players faced failing to log in, and since then issues prevented them from fully testing other aspects of the game during the stress test, they have decided to schedule an additional ones."
---
You were saying?
---
So they get to 60 then load up their own accounts and start again haha.
---
Yes
---
*GASP* a bug in the beta? NO IT CANT BE TRUE BETAS ARE COMPLETE GAMES GUYS. 
---
CLASSIC IS DOOMED DO YOU HEAR ME DOOOOOOOOOOOMED.
---
I'm dying to know; how good does WoW look on a CRT?  Are they as good as I remember?
---
Layering is entirely this: A tool to keep server population healthy after half the people quit once they hit the lvl 30-50 grind. Having 3-4 layers of 3000 people on the server that will later be merged to one layer is the benefit. It will do nothing for making quest mobs easier to find or day 1 leveling easier.
---
Layering should only be used for the starting zones and only for one week.
---
My theory is that if the population collapses for multiple realms, you can always merge them. You should never be left with more than one low-pop realm per cluster, which I consider ultimately a good thing. Offering a variety of realm populations is good, as server meta tends to be quite different on low pop realms in my experience. When there are fewer players around, individual players have more bargaining power and can thus use less optimal specs/builds, and still get into raids since the guild/raid can't easily find better players to replace them.
---
Did an unpaired t-test on the data and the difference is statistically significant and unlikely to be due to randomness. The two-tailed p-value is 0.036 so its like saying that we are \~96% certain that Lemmesmashxd does less damage per hit than Cepexa.
---
Wasn't that a foregone conclusion? I don't want to overgeneralize, but I get the sense most people here (and on the official forums) were not old enough to have heavily participated in WoW at launch.
---
Devilsaur Mafia wont happen because it relies on cross faction collusion which is bannable.
---
upvoting not because i agree, but because i enjoy the memes.
---
I've been waffling on Horde or Alliance for almost 2 years now and I finally know thanks to this picture. Thrall's such a chill mofo, why does everyone wanna kill him like this? ....I like Bolvar, sure, but I don't think I'd have the same sympathetic reaction to any Ally Leaders. Lok'tar Ogar it is!
---
Hunters and druids are brought more for utility than meter numbers. They are out performed by other classes in terms of meters.
---
Hunters can use nightfall, tranq shot, ice trap, kite, FD/cables for wipe recovery, and even buff with trueshot and wolves. 
---
Druids bring brez, can flex between heals/offtank, innervate, and mark of the wild.
---
All classes have some utility, and often unique utility, but Hunter/druid are the really stand out ones since it's pretty exclusively why they are brought to raids. Yeah, locks and paladins have a lot of utility as well, but locks can top meters and paladins are amazing heals and would likely be brought even without their utility. Idk if the same would be true for Hunter/druid, without their niche utility they'd essentially only be taken to fill when you couldn't find another class.
---
I’m confused. I wasn’t saying one thing is good or bad, just making an observation that even with layering we may still have plenty of people at launch for a crazy experience.  Maybe I wasn’t clear?
---

---
Was there any sort of damage meter add-on back then?
---
On average, across all servers, I think it was roughly 53/47. Some servers were way out of balance, others close.
---
They said it won't be able to exist past phase 1 but didn't say it would last all of pohase 1.
---
ummm if someones playing the game to just level.... then yeah... but are we even talking about those people? like come on dude.... ZERO effect? they will literally be able to control the prices of every item on the ah....... while they have excess of any said item... you must not have played monopoly when you were younger.. or rather you don't understand the implications
---
Never heard the term 'ninja pull' in vanilla, so this is weird terminology.

&gt; Layering for How Long?
---
&gt;
---
&gt; The technology is there only for launch and will fade away in about a month, albeit it's still hard to determine if this is true, but it should definitely be gone before Phase 2 and world bosses become available in Classic.
---
&gt; Layering will be gone in a few weeks after launch, merging all layers of the same continents into a single realm.﻿

Uhh I thought the layers were semi-permanent and you stayed in the one you were assigned?

Night Elves were basically D&amp;D wood elves in culture and design that had D&amp;D dark elf complexion and the dark elf matriarch society.

Elder Scrolls wood elves were also of a similar design iirc.
---
everyone in the stress test beta got in to the servers eventually.   
---
you don't mean every single person was accepted in to the stress test beta?  That didn't happen.
---
So that's why Fireball debuffs etc. aren't a concern during fights because there are already 16 high priority debuffs on the target ?
---
Well using multibox to pvp is just stupid
---
Don’t rush to get to then game, take your time and read the quests, take in the landscape and explore. Don’t feel like you need to get to max level more fun is had in the experiences you have while leveling.
---
Nope. Just a regular person
---
they literally said this, it's possible they go back on their word but like we don't really know until then, it's not the same as just assuming they'll change something without a statement at all
---
This was a great read. Thank you. You have made up my mind to not play. I forgot about all the guild drama. I'm to old for that crap. I want to play for enjoyment. And raiding is what I wanted to do. Again thank you.

Only for the first 3 hours. Then everyone could log on and never had any problems.

And always will be - it is easy for decent players to forget that 80+ percent of the people who play WoW are LFR tier players. Like, literally, there is a huge population of players who have never done a raid outside LFR.

---
Layering is basically sharding applied at the continent level from how I understand it. However there's things like it's SUPPOSED to choose a layer for you on login, and not move you around unless you join a group. And I think guilds are supposed to be preferred to be in the same layer
---
well thats disappointing hopefully more and more get flagged for each stress test. im assuming they are trying to recreate a launch experience so i don't see why not
---
Is there anything inside at all?

I've seen it in arguments over things regarding blizzard a lot. Basically when layering is talked about lol

So, what does it mean when I have two different selections for Stress Test servers? I have WoW5, and that server is offline. When I go to WoW6, the server is online and I can level further than level 5. I haven't figured out yet if it's the actual Beta, or if it's another stress test that some weren't invited to? I only ask because my buddy who was in the original stress test doesn't have either of the stress test's listed that I do.

Oh, my fault man! Totally misread that, you go on ahead go and wreck shit with 2h fury, YOU GOT THIS.

This makes more sense. I had assumed a ninja pull was the term used for all pulls that the party/raid didn't want, accidental or intentional. Had no idea that the term body pull existed. Thanks!
---
My guild in vanilla had bwl on farm but could only get to fankriss in aq40
---
My best advice is create your own experience as we did without the thought of tactics, addons and veteran player tips.
---
Just play and learn as we did back in 1876
---
yeah, thats about what i tried to get people to do in their role channels - have them decide beforehand amongst themselves who in the run gets what items.  worked pretty well, but then you'd have the guys that were in their first week ever of raiding wondering why they werent allowed to have a chance on neltharions tear or offtanks still in some greens wondering why they couldnt get maladath.  even trickier were the guys that raided once a month, but hadn't gotten anything in like 5 or 6 months.  
---
then you get the people that flake out on progression raids and only come for farm status.  that's what really kills guilds in my opinion, when all the old timers that started the guild for progression content get burned out and replaced by the newcomers that joined because your guild has bwl cleared in 2 hours without wipes.
---
You parsed his comment incorrectly.
---
He didn’t say “nobody gets as excited in retail as they do in classic”. He said the fact you *can* get more excited by killing a low level dungeon boss compared to the big bad in retail tells you something about the depth of the experience throughout vanilla. No need to get defensive.
---
The level cap will be increased to 10. For access, we will be including **everybody** who was invited to the test on May 22
---
Definitely take your time leveling, do the dungeons as you get the quests and just have fun with it. As for what class your friend should play, what does he want to play? Melee or ranged? Healer dps or tank? Since you'll be a mage it would be less competition on gear if he went for a class that uses different gear, but really it comes down to what he will enjoy. Watch some videos on gameplay to see what he thinks looks fun. 
---
I would say you should join a guild, you can always leave it if you dont like the guild but it will be nice to have a guild to see if anyone wants to do dungeons or run battlegrounds. Find a social guild that is willing to help each other and looking to have fun, if you get into raiding you can always find a raiding guild later on.
---
Oh, my fault man, sorry! Totally misread that, go wreck shit with 2h fury, YOU GOT THIS

The majority of retail players don’t raid anything harder than LFR and you can ignore half the mechanics until you get to mythic anyway.

I don't mind all the "Fuck! I died to a random patrol!" posts because it shows people are learning the game. I will mind all the "Blizz needs to turn down the amount of random patrols!" posts, because that's just dumb as dog shit.
---
Clusters could easily be done as something like "Mal'Ganis A/B/C" on the realm list. And they are effectively completely different servers with no interaction, which is far more #nochanges than layering.
---
Just like in the original, you can always join a high pop server, but you might have to face queues. So you can always join with your friends. The trick is that, if you have A, B and C, and a month in, realm A is still doing well but B and C have collapsed, you can merge B and C to create a single server and leave the healthy realm A alone. Once populations have stabilised, rename your servers with Realm A keeping the original name.
---
Still not perfect, no, but it seems to have all the benefits of layering with fewer downsides.
---
Honestly, get in discord and just jump in. You will explore and have fun, and then you will meet some cool people along the way, and maybe you will join their guild or maybe you make your own. Don't overthink it :)

More like TrashOut, dude is the biggest Classic fanboy and wasn’t even around during the length of vanilla, all his “knowledge base” and “experiences” come from private servers.
---
Stormwind acts a little funny on Retail in regards to sharding, so this may be a holdover from that they need to work out.
---
At this point you need to calm down and realize *you're the one* who didn't know wtf they were talking about. Reflect and be nicer.
---
Right I know that stuff about layering.
---
But what about what's in my post. As far as initial cramming of vally of trials. Is this still an issue to blizzard. Layering wont fix this. Which seemed to be thier main concern as to why they would even use sharding in the first place.
---
I'm not sure you meant to reply to my post cause..... are they using sharding for Initial launch ? Or has that concern eluded us and blizzard somehow?
---
You forgot the best part. Low pop clusters would be incredibly easy to abuse for resources, as in an even smaller subset of people can control things.

Plus imagine merging multiple clusters that all have THEIR OWN ECONOMY. Can't imagine the aftermath of that.

I'd genuinely love to see newer players experiance the back half of Sunwell though. It's a literal waking nightmare

What the Classic WoW Stress Test Was Really Like:  
---
[https://youtu.be/kfbSLfncGy8](https://youtu.be/kfbSLfncGy8)
---
I mean, it's also because most people don't understand what layering is, why it's necessary, and are generally overreacting about it. But yes, I have been referred ot as a shill. it has nothing to do with my love for blizzard, it has to do with me thinking people are morons and shortsighted.
---
The projection is palpable. “These people aren’t true beta testers/fans because they don’t have to go through this error” &lt;- Essentially what you said
---
Imagine saying a video when you watch a 50second clip that's followed by 10 ish minutes of failure doing the same thing LOL
---
&gt; good to know i dont need to continue this conversation any further. 
---
Incredible how that's all it takes to make a classic fan completely shut down. I've seen this across several discussions.
---
Definitely a scary thing to watch for the classic haters who tried so hard to try and persuade people that there would be nothing to do in Vanilla but sit in a city forming a group for hours. The level cap is at 30 and there are so many amazing videos already out, and it's only BETA LOL
---
Troll hunter, mon
---
That is way too complicated, although probably ended up being pretty fair.
---
Private server i play on my eyes gets fucked in durotar
---
together in loneliness
---
I disagree entirely.
---
if you didn't care you wolndnt bother even saying anything
---
I'm finding that thrown weapons have a minimum range of 5, while bows/guns have a range 8. If that's true, then it would seriously help the matchup and does show a lack of knowledge on tips' part.  
---
Yeah, his trash build really shows against rogue when he needs to switch stances all the time. 
---
Welp, I finally got a good answer. You are the savior of this thread. At least to me. :)
---
Nice picture!
---
Proper talents and better movement. Should be a 65/35. You will never win every fight. Even with +50% crit etc etc, he could get no crits and miss disarm etc. But it should not have been this 1sided
---
Your intuition is right, but the outcome is opposite because it's unintuitive. You actually want a class that does the most DPS swinging Nightfall.
---
Let me copypaste [this great response](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brx7ze/lets_theorycraft_while_we_wait_whats_the_best/eohfrkp/) from another thread:
---
&gt; Nightfall's benefit is strongly misconceived by people who see 15% spell damage and think "wow, thats a lot!" You lose a DPSer by including a Nightfall user, which means that person is going to have to compensate for the loss of a normal DPSer. At 100% uptime, with an average 13 casters, you'd get 195% of the average Caster DPSer in gains. Thats with 100% uptime, which will literally never happen. With the average PPM, it's like 1/5th of the time on a good day, which means you're only gaining about 44% of the average caster's DPS, which means its up to the Nightfall user to compensate for that 56% shortfall. Hunters will never accomplish that.
---
In essence:
---
&gt; Hunter is by far the worst, you get more uptime, but effectively do near 0 damage
---
That's all just romantic spin-doctoring and it always has been. Those things all get old and tiresome *quickly*.
---
Besides class quests, because that's the only example that's actual real, valuable content with a tangible benefit.
---
there's not enough people for a completely new batch.  there's only me left.
---
No it isn't. 3 months is nothing. Go out, enjoy the summer. Talk to some new people. Try new foods. Travel to a new place or two.
---
Do all of this in the next 3 months. Because after that you won't see or talk to anyone for 2 years.
---
Of all the streams Asmon’s actually had the best showing of layering. He jumped multiple layers by being added to different groups.
---
it is the tier 2 rogue set, so very viable during that phase.
---
&gt; no it doesnt because the number of ppl picking professions that require x type of resources is not a constant. you can have everyone being a miner on one layer and everyone being herbalist on another for example, or everyone being a miner on 3 layers.
---
&gt; you're thinking in an organised pattern while communities act erratic.
---
With such a large sample size it would tend towards the averages. It's extremely unlikely one layer will be filled with miners and one with herbalists. It could happen, obviously, but not really.
---
It doesn't matter whether you're right or wrong because it's all opinion anyways but I'll just tell you right now you're in the wrong subreddit.
---
If the realms you can select aren't labeled as "stress test" then I believe you have beta access.
---
I was under the understanding that you were stuck in your Layer once you created your character. That way, every person you met, will be with you for the rest of both characters time on the servers. That layering was basically mini servers inside of a server to split up population. I was accepting of that (especially if only used at certain times) because I would have the confidence I would see other players I met and interacted with again in the future. This is worrisome to me.
---
Cool. Now how do you get back to layer 1?
---
Echo what everyone else said, let it all come natural.
---
Everyone here takes about rushing to 60, etc.  take your time, have fun, and just do your thing
---
The true rage-inducers will be the kobolds that flee before death and bring more enemies into the combat, effectively trapping you in a situation that will involve either running and dying or fighting and dying. Or everyone will play a lock or hunter
---
Resto shamans can drop those. Enhance sham might he the lowest melee dps.
---
Aq is guild kill
---
I'm assuming this was at the end of the 2 hour window? Because it just shut down at the end of the total window.
---
So really the only problem is titanforging. If we went back to not having it, those lower difficulty raids wouldn't get gear that surpasses the higher difficulties. Problem solved.
---
He should play what ever class interest him. Try out a few, you should do the same. With 2 people questing together things will be easier and you can always ask for help if needed on those harder quest. As for a guild and add ons and all that stuff just let it happen naturally. When you start just focus on enjoying the adventure and exploring. WoW was amazing my first time because I truly felt like I was stepping into a massive world and I knew nothing about it. Reading quest logs and actually having to look at landmarks and follow the directions in the quest log is a great immersive feeling. Don't sweat min/max until end game. At end game you can start looking up what gear you need to raid and strategies, best builds (you can pay in game currency to redistribute your talents so no need to worry about that) by then you will probably have been in and out of a few guilds. Just enjoy the ride, enjoy the unknown and discovery, enjoy the community. I read the manual cover to cover while it was loading back in the day and went in blind for a majority of my first character and it was a wonderful experience. You will pick up stuff and learn naturally as you play. Welcome to Azeroth friend.
---
Yeah, warrior is like 75% prep, 15% mechanics,  10% experience. With his build and playstyle he will never beat this rogue. This fight at this point (no changing any talents/builds/etc) is like a 90/10 split for the rogue.
---
This is not good.
---
Because sharding allows them to lower bandwidth and server load = more money.
---
 RemindMe! 96 days "Change settings in classic wow"
---
loot council with the GM having final say is the way to go, in my opinion.  tough to work because the GM has to view the raid as a single collective unit - e.g. focusing on spreading everything out so no one person gets too outgeared (yes, even the MT, people disagree with me on that but having someone stuck as a forever offtank or being a forever MT is a real guild killer).  also making sure there are no weak areas in the raid, while remembering that trust is a two-way street.  people will come if they know theyll get loot, so when they start to flake when they arent getting loot, the GM can't look at that and say "ah!  I knew that person would flake, that's why i didn't give them gear!"
---
its tough as hell and i vividly remember the times i've fucked up the loot, or pushed players too hard by scheduling too many raids in a week.  once you get too much stress, the strategy is to just chill out with some scholo/strat/brd runs.  god, i love vanilla.  can't wait for september.
---
Right? With no layering and no sharding. Imagine what you saw on the stress test last night x10. Imagine 2000 people in northshire abby fighting over kobolds.
---
Could be that they want to give everyone from the first wave a chance to actually get in as well.  There would be a lot of salt if it was a new batch of invites, as some people struggled to get past the login on this stress test.  Though today was much smoother in that regard.  They did say they found some issues this time around, so it was certainly a very successful test :)
---
All valid points!
---
RemindMe! 95 days "weather setting"
---
It was nuts. Easy 300 people. Maybe more.
---
My 3 months of raiding on my friends second account never saw a piece of gear, I was in dungeon gear in mc, 2 weeks in a row every pally tier piece dropped and we were horde
---
F
---
Horde will most likely have more people. No paladins make raids much harder too.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "add this command into classic wow"
---
WR is over 4 days, what makes you say people can beat that on a new release server where everyone is starting at 1?
---
I personally love the insanity of the overcrowded starter zones. It only lasts a short while and is like an awesome hardcore difficulty minigame to escape
---
Oh I know they are getting preferential treatment. I just think the number of them is being overblown. The amount of streamers vs normal people is probably something like 10 normal for 1 streamer. That’s all I’m saying
---
(4x)
---
UWHD? it should be fine, ask on r/buildapc
---
I was sitting at 14ms during the stress test tonight. I usually have a low latency if there is a central region server, but it’s usually in the 20s. Hopefully they maintain spread out server points.
---
keep in mind the stress test servers were up until tonight (9pm EST) so you may not have been able to log in last night but everything worked pretty well today.
---
Play together. Other than that, just enjoy the ride. :)
---
If you get stuck, you're usually better off Googling the answer than trying to ask people in-game.

I was in a hardcore raiding and pvp guild in vanilla/bc/wotlk. Fuck Vael and fuck Chromaggus. 
---
Vael was the dps/tank check, ole Chromface was the line of sight check. If you didn’t get the LoS timing just right...you might as well give up. It was also the healer/caster check for dispelling debuffs. If you missed even one in the short amount of time the raid was fucked. 
---
The there’s our best friend Nef. Wipe on Nef? Too bad you’re sitting there without anything to do for the next 15mins because you have to wait for his lazy ass to respawn on the throne. Spent many nights playing DOTA 2 with guild mates in that downtime. 
---
BWL didn’t kill us (thank god) but the famed tunnel in AQ40 almost did. Stupid hunters. 
---
DO NOT FAINT IN THE TUNNEL! 
---
Compared to all that, Naxx was almost a breeze.
---
6+ in stress test is impossible.
---
Keep in mind that the actual test lasted for two-three ish hours, afterwards blizzard left the servers open for a day.
---
Same is true for a normal server when it's not 100% full during night time for example.
---
That shit will never fly with the GMs of Classic.
---
The whole Devilsaur shit was borderline extortion and the guys who "Invented" that shit can go fuck themselves.
---
Bad bot
---
This was today around 8:10pm central. Just like the extra stress test next week the stress test was open 26 hours.
---
Meal prep and piss bottles
---
Wheres the blackrock clan? :p
---
Oh, so I'm not allowed to post here because I have the sheer temerity to admit that there are things retail does better than classic?
---
Everlasting virginity
---
Pick a good audiobook and listen to it while grinding.
---
Im curious on their make believe Strat. So let's say there's 4 layers, I'll choose some random numbers to help make a point since we don't have full confirmation but it's probably to be close enough anyway.       
---
Let's say theirs 8k people total.         
---
Alright so you have lets say 4 mages in your guild aoe leveling, lets say they somehow all go to seperate aoe spots that are viable at the start (probably won't have enough but let's pretend). Okay so now HYPOTHETICALLY in a PERFECT WORLD each mage has 4 layers to farm right? Right.          
---
But wait there is 7,996 other people, or if we assume a 50/50 split around 3,996 people. Now of course not all people are mages, so let's say likely a lower bound of 10% even though they're popular. So 399 mages, not all will level fast nor will all aoe. But I highly doubt that there will be zero that try to go aoe grind with this AMAZING mage layer aoe grinding everyone's been talking about. Then ruining everyone's viability. Of course this strat also depends on your mages each having people outside of the guild, and identifying who's in which layer and then swapping around in correct order.           
---
Also there's going to be opposite faction competition I'm sure, but that wouldn't be likely for the earliest grind.         
---
If someone can have such a perfect setup for all that to happen, then fuck it they deserve it
---
My plan? Party up with 1 other person, run outside of the starting zone, and start grinding mobs together and completely skip the quests in the first area. With the exception of class quests such as the Warlock Imp quest.
---
Solid argument.
---
Stress Test invite does not equal you could only log in for 2 hours.
---
Everyone with the invite could play for the next day, you are just nitpicking and grasping at straws.
---
:) good times. will enjoy the upcoming stress tests too, but wish the game was coming sooner
---
It's more about having to balance mob spawns and resources than the actual capacity of the server.
---
Now that's some PogChamp news to my ears.
---
I actually prefer gear being a lot rarer. It makes every upgrade insanely more meaningful, especially getting dungeon best in slotted even after you raid. You aren't grinding heroics for extra rolls or titanforge bullshit, you are grinding 5-mans for incremental upgrades. Then when you do replace something in a raid it feels amazing. Although seeing a ton of gear drop and getting fucked over via loot council or unlucky rolls is a pretty crummy feeling.
---
iMac, good meme.
---
Yeah but I find enhancment more fun. Someone with invite me to a raid eventually. I'm in no rush.
---
Kiss each other each time you level
---
1-30 is half the game...
---
It only changes when you relog or join a party. Sharding changes as you move around, the whole word is divided into a grid of shards. With layering the whole world is one layer, and you can get put in another layer the next time you log in.
---
I don't think they're using sharding at all anymore, and are using only layering for everything from what I've read I think? I'm going to assume part of the testing out layering thing in the early zones is what they're figuring out to make it usable. I don't see how layering wouldn't fix the issues of cramped early zones?
---
That guy will be the first one in the Classic-First ragnaros kill post complaining.
---
seems like no.
---
To play a shaman you have to be horde. So Druid it is.
---
during the 2 hour window I could not play at all (couldn't create a character), but I could login fine all day. so I could've played for like 20 hours if I didn't have work and stuff (I played for like 5 hours)
---
Yeah I know I was on the last hour before it closed today and there weren't any friendly messages that I saw, which is why I was wondering.
---
Mergers are awful. It's putting together a mass of players who already have guilds and what not. It destroys the small community aspect of a WoW community. Vanilla is about knowing the people on your server, and mergers destroy that.
---
Yeah, it's a shame they've never had a working version of these servers before and that they now have to resort to this.
---
Human female rogue or undead male rogue. Literally all decides on my friends and what they primarily wanna play.
---
that's not just what he said but ok
---
What stories about him and his dad?
---
It was supposed to be just the first couple weeks of launch now it's all of phase 1.. With little backlash from community this scares me.
---
Just expect it to be in the game at this point to avoid further disappointment.
---
Let's say you're level 35.  You have just started leveling swords, so your swords are at 67/175, and your defense is at 171/175.
---
In PVP, both should be 175/175.
---
It definitely does a great job driving away players, without BFA being so shit maybe we wouldn’t be getting Classic this summer, those Q3 margins for Blizzard are looking pretty rough.
---
If that slot machine of a game with p2w tokens has “things” that are better than retail it definitely won’t matter because in the future people will really only care about their characters they’ve built and attached to on Classic versus the soulless world that is BFA.
---
Obviously, this hasn’t happened yet, but with the way things are going, it will.
---
Broken link. They talked about how layering is meant to stop exploits. Sharding is much easier to manipulate.
---
Orc Warlock, then some sorta rogue at some point.
---
Remind me! 96 days "do this"
---
He doesn’t need an argument when he’s disagreeing with your opinion, and he’s right, raids in BFA are absolutely trash. 
---
There is a good reason nobody is playing that game anymore pal, sorry to break it to you.
---
Not even close to what I said, might want to reread it. Didn't say a thing about 'true' anything. It's funny you talk about protecting, cause your seriously protected your own insecurities into what I said. It was quite simple. 
---
Those that cried about it, haven't experienced the hardships of error 34, or forgot. 
---
Thats it. Nothing to do with true testers/fans, nothing about anything you said lol. You sound like a person that looks to be victim, even when it's not there at all haha
---
He brings up his dad a lot and their experiences together.   Just the other day, mind you this is not verbatim, that his dad's friends used to come over and make fun of him being a shut in nerd.
---
Absolute fucking ball tearer.
---
If you dislike layering, worry not. Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. Layering also will not happen after Phase 1, the importance of that being that Phase 2 is planned to introduce the World Boss Kazzak, with the Green Dragons being released later on, both of which would make layering a tool to disrupt the flow of World Bosses in Classic.
---
That’s what the devs spoke about and explained. It was never “only in the starting zones” as that would be subject to scrutiny of when do the starting zones end. It was always phase one, which ends with the release of world bosses. So phasing won’t be present from then on according to the devs.
---
This has been stated many many many times and the devs keep repeating their reasoning. If you are too much of an insane purist to want any changes at all, classic ain’t for you.
---
100% agree buddy.
---
I hope I didn’t deter you from playing what is most definitely the most memorable parts of Vanilla.
---
One thing I didn’t mention in my OP that I should have is that it was INCREDIBLY rewarding to finally kill Raz and Vael after all the struggles — and I think lots of the comments to my post reflect that.
---
Also — your mileage will vary with drama. I think a lot of people who will play vanilla will be veterans who are now in their 30s and, well, might be a little more mellow than they were in their teens on the first go around for Vanilla :-)
---
"insert snarky voice here" "because private server players did it".       
---
Meanwhile they ignore the whole abuse of dynamic respawns for private servers, drop values being wrong, and I'm sure more when people leveled much slower on beta compared to private servers.
---
You clearly have never played a pserver launch. Please stop talking, you have no clue.
---
That doesn't make it sad at all. We all want visibility for WoW classic right now. It's just a beta access so what's the fuzz? Personally I'm staying far away from that and enjoy the final product in Autumn.
---
that's what I've heard as well. he said he had a 51 warrior and then BC came out and he quit, then came back in wotlk. yet people keep saying hes only been playing since cata, maybe cause cata is sort of a meme by itself cause that's the point of no return of the game, but it's really hard to believe anything at this point
---
yeah the next day, but that wasnt the test.
---
Im just saying that while, during the actual test, login was hard. Afterwards everything went pretty smooth.
---
The two playtimes arent very comperable
---
I’m just gonna play. I’m not particularly worried. It was like this for the original launch and I dealt with it then.
---
I've noticed that the mainstream media have begun slapping the 'far-right' label to everyone on the right of Karl Marx yes...
---
so if classical liberal like Peterson or Dave Ruben are 'nazi', then yeah, a lot of people are aligning themselve with nazi.
---
That's not a shut down. I made a post that compared YT/Twitch content regarding BfA content and how that content's viewership and engagement were dropping with YT/Twitch content regarding Classic and how its been doing well and the guy responded with "but...but...but...I like BfA...". 
---
His comment had essentially no relevance to the discussion at hand and I didn't feel like going down a rabbit hole of what we each do and don't like about each when the result was always going to be "okay, agree to disagree." So I said that from the get go and moved on.
---
In 2006ish upgraded to a 21" secondhand CRT just for WOW. I remember the sound it made and the feeling in my chest when i turned it on. I probably have latent superpowers as a result.
---
but mop content is awful...
---
diddnt people use to make memes back in the day about how you and other players were the ones who saved the day by defeating dragons, and illidan, stopping Naxx but still being treated like just some ordinary dude? 
---
I feel like no matter what blizz does people are gonna find something to complain about. Thats just the progression of the game, you grow from a nobody into a hero that is recognized by your faction, it would be odd if that diddnt happen.
---
I get what you mean though, thats kind of why i liked some of the MoP questing zones, some of it kinda just felt like you were an adventurer again and not the savior of azeroth.
---
just play the game.
---
seriously.
---
Prolly just start grouping with random ppl tbh at least until the crowd thins out.
---
Wouldn't that be 24/3?
---
There should have been an achievement for losing less than 5 people to DCs between each boss.
---
That was pretty beautiful by perplexity.
---
Would def love to see a Heyven memorial in Eversong woods on retail, as he did a ton of work recreating what a rebuilt highborne civilization would look like, and TB def belongs in the friendly murloc tribe in Northrend.
---
I remember for 1 to 10 staysafe, esfand were doing 2 to 2.5 hours for private servers? I can't remember how long it took staysafe for 10 on beta and alpha though, I think 3 something hours? Esfand one isn't relevant since he was more careless while leveling with asmon
---
This post is stupid.
---
This is a poll to see how long people played overall.
---
The server itself was called Stress Test.
---
Not sure why we are arguing when it is pretty obvious what I mean lmao
---
No you're not because everyone here disagrees with you. What were you honestly expecting here?
---
Ya don't get experiences like that in retail.
---
[I think we do alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl6jn-DdafM&amp;feature=share)
---
Speaking from experience on a private server, but when a server launched, it took 3 hours for someone to farm 10 doomweed in tirisfal glades. Mob tagging sucks, but gathering quests? No layering means just go grind experience instead
---
Everyone knows about Coca Cola bro... What's the point in advertising? Doritos though makes sense because they have different flavours.
---
I'm actually hoping to put together a guild like this.  I have a group of about 15-20 people that are planning on playing together, and we're probably going to fall within this category.  I also don't want toxicity in my guild as I can't stand it.  If you want to roll with us, message me and I'll send you our work in progress of a guild site to get you access for discussion and coordinating a server to roll on.
---
Play pve server instead of dogshit pvp servers?
---
Because seeing how long someone can play low level content is stupid?
---
Why make this an issue in an otherwise positive thread? Don't fan the flames bro. Let people upset calm down and level headed players can chill not baiting them.
---
&gt; With such a large sample size it would tend towards the averages.
---
i think we can both agree that economy is not an exact science so no one will know if there will be a trend towards average.
---
&gt;  It's extremely unlikely one layer will be filled with miners and one with herbalists.
---
this is [reductio ad absurdum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) to prove a point.
---
**Reductio ad absurdum**
---
In logic, reductio ad absurdum (Latin for "reduction to absurdity"), also known as argumentum ad absurdum (Latin for "argument to absurdity"), apagogical arguments or the appeal to extremes, is a form of argument that attempts either to disprove a statement by showing it inevitably leads to a ridiculous, absurd, or impractical conclusion, or to prove one by showing that if it were not true, the result would be absurd or impossible. Traced back to classical Greek philosophy in Aristotle's Prior Analytics (Greek: ἡ εἰς τὸ ἀδύνατον ἀπόδειξις, lit. 'demonstration to the impossible', 62b), this technique has been used throughout history in both formal mathematical and philosophical reasoning, as well as in debate.
---
The "absurd" conclusion of a reductio ad absurdum argument can take a range of forms, as these examples show:
---
The Earth cannot be flat; otherwise, we would find people falling off the edge.

Doesnt work in retail, but the script for vanilla was:
---
/script if UnitPowerType('target')&gt;0 then CastSpellByName("Serpent Sting"); else CastSpellByName("Viper Sting"); end
---
Makes it so anyone who has mana was gonna get the viper sting, but rogues and warriors get serpent sting. So i can tab and spam at will.
---
omg the feels... I miss home.
---
It's going to be pretty hard to full clear M.C first reset without anyone having the rep to buy the  Aqual Quintessence.
---
Troll shaman, heal off and on in retail and wanted to dedicate myself to it. Played in vanilla on the alliance as a night elf rogue/hunter and will def make those alts at some point but on different server because pvp realm rule :P
---
&gt;It seems to me that the sole purpose of Layering is to overpopulate servers in case of a major population collapse some time during Phase 1, while maintaining the illusion of a steady 5-6k total server population.
---
It's only purpose is that blizzard doesn't get backlash for having players sit in queue for hours and hours. 
---
They are essentially making mini servers with layering, that's it and it blows.
---
Gonna roll a resto shammy, shove my totems up someone's ass, and piggy back off of them
---
I got a couple questions if you don't mind.       
---
For exploration were you exploring from 1 to 5? Or just like 1 to 3/4?       
---
Also what was fucked about the undead starting zone?
---
they could fix this by just running 20+ servers instead, lol like they did back in the day.. and when players on a server reached their "cap" it locked creation of new characters to people that didnt already have a character on that server, the locks lasted anywhere from 1hour to a couple days
---
I’m guessing they wanted everyone on one side to overload certain areas, so they went to where the streamers were and starting spawning tons of stuff in.
---
I fear your poll wont be representable seeing as players are interpreting what the stress test is differently.
---
As i would say the test was only when blizzard managed the servers in the 4-6 PDT window, while you would say  it was the whole up time. No wrong answer, so no point arguing.
---
Maybe specify in title, cause many would be answering with the two hour window in mind.
---
Stormrage = alliance heavy 
---
Illidan = horde heavy
---
This is awesome, I’m glad they are doing it again and raising level cap to 10 at that!
---
check it
---
It is the entire reason worth a damn players got into the beta and the  scrubs didnt.   Feels good man.
---
What do you mean "hammered by thousands of hyped fans"?
---
The stress test was nothing compared to when Classic actually lunches. I don't know how many players will be playing for over a month, but on the first hour of the first day, it will be an absolute massacre that even Blizzard had never seen before.
---
The whole point of stress tests is to "make things go smoothly". Although, knowing Blizzard, I am heavily considering sleeping extra 3 hours because I doubt I will be able to log in and accomplish anything during that period anyway.
---
It is obvious by the poll results that I don't mean the 2 hour window.
---
I think the biggest thing is to *take your time*. It's a huge world with lots of memories to make along the way - don't just race to the end and miss out on half (or more) of the game. Classic makes it harder to just blaze through because (unlike retail WoW) it doesn't mark quest areas for you - forcing you to read the quest, traveling takes longer, respawns take longer, you have to spend time recovering between big fights, everything is expensive, etc. So a lot of it will slow you naturally, but I would recommend against looking up speed guides or trying to find addons that put you on autopilot etc.
---
The second thing I'd recommend is to try and visit each dungeon as you level up. It won't always be optimal or efficient in terms of speedy leveling, but you'll make great memories and you could make long-term friends from building a group to go with you.
---
I vote yes to joining a guild because they can be great resources for info, grouping, and even for giving away items/mats/gold if you really need it. It's more fun to get help from your community than through a guide or addon. 
---
Also remember that races start in different zones, so if you want to level together you might choose the same race or one of you will need to travel to the other's starting zone. There are exceptions, like Gnomes and Dwarves, so do some research on that.
---
What about the names of people on B and C?
---
What about the separate economies of B and C? 
---
This seems like a huge sticking point with layering. But how is combining two completely separate economies help anyone? What effect could that have on the players for different servers? It could completely crash flask prices for a server. Or it could send herb prices skyrocketing so far that just gathering makes a ton of money. It could completely destroy the economies of the resulting server.
---
Why risk fucking the economy for not only one, but an entire CLUSTER of servers?
---
My point was and still is the following:
---
"It is super easy to shit on any idea, especially when you don't take the entire picture and every possible consequence of the actions into account. Something which is nearly impossible and leaves one with multiple options, none of which appease everyone while also fixing every problem." 
---
Blizzard has made a choice. Stop acting like it is the end of the damn world.
---
The very end left a bitter taste in my mouth.
---
don't get me wrong, I enjoyed myself - a lot - but the literal last seconds were unfortunate for me.
---
I was in booty bay, and managed to travel to gurubashi arena (finally) and took apart of the HUGE group of people, we ended up traveling down to booty bay near the last 3 minutes of server and a huge group (seriously 100s) of people started attacking the giant elite out there. 
---
That was when I posted in a guild I joined how much fun I was having. How 100s of frostbolts and arrows and smites and all those in between were attacking together to destroy enemies.
---
A guildie messaged me and asked if I could invite him to the rumble for the last few minutes so he could see it. He said he was on a different "layer," so I thought, 'Oh what the hell, why not," and invited him.
---
Not even 30 seconds later I was phased out of what the seriously the best moment of my recent wow career.
---
I was phased into a NEAR EMPTY "zone" where five horde killed me almost instantly.
---
The server was going offline in 1:30 minutes at that point.
---
I had an extremely bitter taste in my mouth that the literal last moment were taken away from me because of layering, due to ME inviting someone who should have joined MY layer, not the opposite when \*\*I was the leader\*\*.
---
I overall and REALLY looking forward to classic, but cannot help but feel layering did me dirty at the literal last moment.
---
Thanks
---
Imagine no life to 60 and farm a couple hundred leather in the first week? Oh, you only farmed 10000 gold, no big deal
---
I do appreciate the positive light you shine on it. I agree that we are a part of the process and we do have our own stories to tell now. 
---
... but man... we really did miss out on something great.
---
Yeah I agree.  It was fun getting to 5, but being able to go just a little further will be nice.
---
Why didn't everyone stay in range for battle shout spam? Can't miss.
---
How is this any different from a neckbeard playing 16 hours a day in a basement for months at a time?
---
He'll have to play it to understand. 
---
But if he doesn't like mmorpgs then RIP.
---
Not really, 34% of the responses fit within the 2 hour window.
---
As much as it won't be as nostalgic and authentic, my personal opinion is to setup a better than standard UI before you get really involved in the game. Changing things like map position, bar position and keybinds will get you into a good habit from day 1 rather than learning all the trash Blizz UI locations and then struggling to change later on.
---
 - TukUI or ElvUI are both decent options.
---
OR
---
 - Bag mod  
---
 - Move the map to the bottom of the screen  
---
 - Keybinds (1,2,3,4,5,f,g,q,e,r,z,x,c,v,shift buttons)  
---
 - Lazypig  
---
 - Dominos  
---
 - ETC
---
Making something more palatable on the eyes really improves my experience.
---
From retail but the idea is nice.  
---

---
I thought there was a quest chain which led to a quest to kill 4 of the MC bosses to be able to buy a one charge Aqual quintessence. I didn't realize it was rep gated.
---
Exploit Early and often to make the gold.
---
Why didn't he just battle-shout the group? Threat that can't miss, applies to all targets
---
Yep, this was the strat for doing the faction leaders in 3.0 for the achievements before the level cap was raised. Stack a raid full of hunters because every other DPS gets fucked by the level difference.
---
As long as people keep paying $15 a month I doubt they will stop, 14 weeks till release so 5 level increments with maybe a 2 week break before actual release is level 60. Will probably test raiding by giving everyone a max level bis, everyone freaks out and thanks Blizzard for the good will and Blizzard subscriptions soar to heights unseen since Cataclysm.        
---
         
---
I'm just going to wait for the full thing, I got a little burned out playing P. Servers and I dont wanna risk it right before release.
---
Now pound sand..
---
They already mentioned that layering won't be a thing in later zones
---
I should play horde since I played alliance in vanilla but it's hard for me to not play a human or a night elf.
---
They said nowhere that it was better
---
way less.  it doesnt seem much different than pservers honestly (ive been using classic settings).  my gpu/cpu are barely above idle temps
---
You aren't going to have a mafia with fucking layering lol people will get devilsaur kills on other layers and skin them.
---
LF1M DM Need Healer (Layer 1)
---
Oh wow I didn’t know Classic came out! Gosh darn it!
---
Back in Vanilla Blizz made a level 19-capped private server for WSG pvp to give out TBC beta keys. We went so far as to research what quests were acceptable at level 19 and what the rewards were. Figured out that we could start the Battle for Hillsbrad series and complete the entire thing at level 19 so we raided the shit out of it until our whole guild got the quest rewards we needed. The bow reward did almost twice as much damage as the next best level 19 bow, the WC drop.
---
Wtf that was me you liar
---
first
---
You stay in the same layer until you relog, change continents, or are invited to a group with someone in a different layer.
---
No I mean the fact that there are options beyond 2 hours...
---
Are you fucking with me lmao
---
Still Beta.
---
They also "literally said" that you wouldn't be sharded in/out randomly while in the world but indeed that was a lie.
---
Would love to see how many kills Hogger got during this...
---
Not bad
---
Lol ahead... no chance for me.
---
I have never played a wow release where I got in the servers close to release and by the time I got in there weren't already people in the next zone.
---
This world first was more entertaining than any world first in BFA
---
Redbull
---
Cheetos
---
Pizza
---
Lan Party for 18 hours
---
I think the word might originate from when rogues in vanilla often accidently pulled when they were going in for a sap or trying to stealth past.
---
🦀🦀🦀JAGEX POWERLESS OVER CLASSIC WOW🦀🦀🦀
---
Themechanic definitely has such an underrated stream. Him and his brother are super interactive with chat and they’re both generally really entertaining. I’m really glad they’ve gotten some publicity by playing beta and with some of the bigger streamers.
---
Good luck with all those totem quests. Those things drove me nuts!
---
And what if the total realm population is still over 4K concurrent after 2 weeks? And then after 1 month? Even if it’s there for 3 months, that’s not betraying their only promise of keeping it phase 1. 
---
What I hate is that we went from talking about 1-10 or 1-20 assistance, and now it’s the entire 1-60 experience.
---
No BETA for you.. Just wait till AUG 27TH.
---
Your standard for tough is misguided
---
&gt; This is what blizz has chosen to show. How is it unfinished?
---
Holy shit dude, it's a beta test. You think that new server tech like this isn't part of the testing? Do you think the login difficulties were intentional too, blizzard chose to show the world that tons of people got stuck on character creation?
---
&gt;I've never seen so much apology on this sub before. What do you owe blizzard?
---
Not freaking out immediately and crying "CLASSIC IS DEAD" when you see something off in a beta is 'apology' and 'owing blizzard' apparently.
---
Look, I'm not saying don't be concerned or talk about the issues with layering right now. It needs reported and this kind of exploitation needs to be nipped in the bud. But it's probably a bug given how they talked about it, and the classic team has been receptive to feedback and making changes based on community concerns already (spell batching, loot trading, sharding).
---
Is this a screenshot from classic? This looks so good wtf
---
I agree with you lol I love bfas dungeons and raids
---
Pretty sure you could always walk in but 13 is the low end for it. With all 10s that shit would be insane, hell even the quests for that place are red till 14 if I remember right.
---
Officially, Blizz said it wouldn't last longer than the end of phase 1. For one, world bosses are released in phase 2, and having multiple Azuregos and Kazzak (one per layer) would be a shitshow.
---
Shh dont let people find out about ele shams
---
My memory might be wrong because it's been a long time, but didnt people group up for quests so they could share progress on quests instead of having to do it alone? I don't understand why people are so concerned with having to share their leveling experience or taking time to wait for mob spawns. It's all part of the game.
---
So they can control it with even more ease and absolutely no chance of anyone fighting back?  
---
  Again, seems like you people don't know how far this mafia goes.
---
Not just that, but it wouldn't be a good demonstration of class mechanics at such a low level with no talents and abilities.
---
The group quests they had where fine imo, not too many and not too hard, but hard enough that you really needed at least 1 person to help.
---
Why are you adding an O in devilsaur?
---
Ha nice try. If i tell you i wont be ahead now will i?
---
So I guess no new invites?  Sad
---
With the added benefit of cannibalism!
---
I’m just gonna wait about an hour if I can and let the crowd thin out. I’m not gonna rush to 60. This will be my first time playing classic so I’m gonna go slow and enjoy it. I still haven’t even decided what to level yet. If anyone has a class recommendation for a first timer in vanilla please suggest some. I’m not good with casters cause I don’t get the whole using lower rank spells and dealing with mana. I’m super stoked for classic though.
---
Nah
---
Ok, you win im stupid.
---
Does he play retail WoW? And is he worried about it being overwhelming, or is he just not interested?
---
Happened to me too
---
BWL will be cleared in the first week.   easy is as easy does.
---
I’d prefer the best of both worlds. Layering for 1-25 or 1-30, and then 30+ zones being completely unlayered. STV will be a shitshow but it’s not a bottleneck, and id prefer to get the necessary evil bullshit out of the way earlier than later .
---
Had more fun in a few hours of classic than the past decade of retail
---
Hunters for pulling, hunters for tranq shot, hunters for kiting, hunters for trueshot (even if it's pretty shit), hunters for being masterlooter (cause they generally have bag space and aren't needed much otherwise), hunters for feign death + jumper cables lol.
---
Honestly though Druids when they are on DPS mode are more there for innervate, brez and maybe a few heals if shit is hitting fans.
---
Holy shit. This is actually epic. The video, the fact that you guys killed him, how well it all matches up, the emotion. Everything. Well done guys.
---
At least you got in at all
---
Are you aware this games been out for 10 years and min maxing has been a thing forever? if this game and min maxing is new to you than cool I understand!
---
High end guilds will take all the resources, it's not gonna be spread evenly. So instead of 1x the resources the guilds will have 5+x
---
I really hope blizzard brings back some vintage style wow commercials for classic. Oh and the gamer fuel Mtn Dew that would be dope.
---
Raids are amazing in retail, endgame content is the only thing it really does well nowadays. Mechanics for encounters are truly fun to learn and master, and single bosses have more mechanics that several raids in vanilla combined. A normal boss in BFA is harder than anything you'll find until AQ40, and that's three tiers below the highest difficulty. 
---
Retail's issues wrt raids exist in the design philosophies that surround those raids and make the time doing them less worthwhile/remove motivation for players to strive to complete them (e.g., equivalent gear that's available from easier sources, lower difficulties like LFR that allow access separate from the more difficult versions of the encounter, catch-up mechanics making effort to attain gear worthless with every new content patch). 
---
Issues like these are what hurt retail, not the raids which have only gotten better (on average) over time.
---
Yeah, this time we get to go to the Barrens.
---
Retail bad classic good
---
Also could have bandaged while he was waiting for Herod's whirlwind to finish.
---
This.  Thank you!   As someone who raided Vanilla, and tanked Vael (I was tank 2 or 3 in the rotation), you got it exactly right!
---
Thank you for this!
---
Same here man. I'm so tired of people acting like its the end of the world over some fucking herbalism mats.
---
Login and go to realm select. Does it say classic beta? Then it's classic beta.
---
I think it makes the most sense to remove layering in 25/30+ zones, when world PvP and material farming really start to open up. Best of both worlds?
---
doing 5 levels never felt so good... Launch can't come soon enough 
---
https://imgur.com/a/lnSgLRD?
---
False I was layered (read sharded) 5x today while solo fighting mobs in darkshore.
---
When I first started WoW, I was Alliance.  I didn't swap to horde until MoP, so I never got to experience original Org or Barrens chat.  I'm looking forward to that!
---
Akchually r/anthemthegame is the most toxic sub
---
Lol I think a lot of the kids who didn’t play vanilla will dislike classic, but as someone who started in day 1 vanilla and played pservers of vanilla I definitely won’t be returning to live upon release.
---
Stop looking at the game with rose-tinted goggles. It’s not hard. Current raids/mythic+ are much harder than anything in Vanilla. I fully expect all phase 1 content to be cleared in less than 2 weeks. The whole “autopilot with a random group of people” is on you mate, many of us actually join guilds and socialize in MMOs.
---
The absolute nerve of blizzard to test this technology in different ways during MY beta. Who do they think they are?
---
I promise you that Blizzard did not select beta invitees by monitoring their scrubbiness.
---
RemindMe! 96 days wow
---
I mean, it IS just beta. We can't see the future.
---
There is a post over at MMORPG.com. That's the guild I plan on joining.
---
Glad that guy came along and enlightened us all, would have been ages stuck in the dark.
---
I realize the stress test is MUCH lower number than we will most likely actually see on launch day, but I have to agree with you. The 'mini game' aspect of tagging mobs, or making groups to increase you rate of success was apart of the fun. After getting out of the 1-5 areas, it opens up and becomes much easier.
---
[I decided to do the same screenshot on my (non-official) WoW client for comparison](https://i.imgur.com/3z5IRt2.jpg)
---
I'm not sure if it's due to the time of day, certain graphics settings, or potentially NVidia settings, but your screenshot also seems to have a lot more red in it. For reference, the server time was 6:00 am for this screenshot.
---
P.S. Apparently posting the name of a private server gets your post deleted.
---
Friend from 2006 got in. And I made my account 1 day after original launch and also got in. To beta that is.
---
"bug"
---
What is this speak of clips? He has the one vital thing you needed in 2004. Text and a pic.
---
Now make a post about the level 48 BOT going by him.... lets see how the shills explain that one...
---
Okay, I will check it out. Thank you 😊
---
You should be locked to your layer for a significant amount of time maybe even a whole week or even the whole time layering is active. You can only move layers if your invited to group obviously or blizzard collapses layers some.
---
Perfect fight for a feral with crowd pummeler.
---
It looked like he had to switch characters to get the layer to switch.  Not sure if it matters, but the node was in Kalimdor and the human he logged into was in Eastern Kingdoms, so maybe that's how he's triggering the actual layer switch.
---
Yeah really. The circle jerk in here can get pretty toxic when talking about BFA. It's a bad expansion, but that's not a result of its raids which are pretty damn good and way more difficult than vanilla content. 
---
It's bad because of the design philosophy that surrounds those raids.
---
This is why if you have an enhance shaman you should push them to be the nightfall wielder. They get to DPS but also bring a buff to the raid and nightfall is still a very good dps weapon for shamans until AQ+ where they aren't totally gimped.
---
Pepega
---
RemindMe! 98 days
---
Agreed. I pulled a boar into Orgrimmar, only to be sharded and the boar reset agro and ran back.
---
you will get more dmg reduction by killing them faster with dps spells plus he need to work hard for threat.
---
Most people who play video games only know if they are having fun, but are basically morons when it comes to understanding why they are having fun.
---
Everyone thinks playing the completely overpowered hero is the most fun but it basically never is. This is why people use cheat codes in single player games and then quickly get bored.
---
Depends on where my friends decide to play. Human Paladin or Tauren Shaman.
---
My pleasure. And thank you for your often thankless service being a tank!
---
The main area is all there, though instead of a plateau in the middle with a dragon, there's just a pile of sand. The swirling portal visuals are there too, though they won't teleport you inside the TBC instances.
---
I hope someone is kind enough to tell him he can get a new one from the next inn
---
Worst I've seen is r/anthemthegame
---
I didn’t know Ron Jeremy played WoW.
---
My friend and I both got put in today, we were on the F&amp;F list though.
---
what
---
Most casual games today have such toxic players. These players want everything handed to them. Those same toxic players will be playing this game. Put them in a 40 man raid where they have to actually work together and be prepared. I smell a shit fest.
---
I created a tactic for my guild where we would all group up and aoe fear the mobs in a cycle.  I haven't seen it anywhere else.
---
ahahah
---
cause i'm a tired idiot that shits all over his spelling. sorry
---
Oh so in your mind, this "version" of technology includes doing the exact opposite of what the tech was intended to do is a test? Sounds real fucking stupid.
---
yeah, in vanilla that happened sometimes when you reached close enough proximity to the inn
---
My friend and I did without an email earlier today. On the F&amp;F list though.
---
I actually thought of that too, but the issue I saw/thought that no matter at what point you remove layering of the zones, you're going to flood people in. Of course it's not going to be when you have the first few people racing through. I guess it would be if they think it's an issue or not, but it'd be pretty shitty to go from decent amounts of people in a layered zone, and suddenly all of those people go into an unlayered zone and you get shit on for trying to level.
---
Launch period for any MMO is nuts. Even if they aren't losing players, you can still see server populations drop huge amounts just did to people normalizing their play time.
---
As in that Classic is included with retail sub and they have to assume that launch populations are going to be greatly inflated.
---
It's ironic because you're talking about the red pill which is a reference to the matrix where you are trying to escape a virtual world
---
People shouldn't pop in and out all the time with layering.
---
You don't change layers when entering a new zone.
---
People are not going to get infinitely ahead by abusing layering.
---
FPS classic 300+ 
---
Retail  about 180..  in most places
---
Of you can level above 5 you have the beta. Congratulations! I hate you. &lt;3
---
I was the same but I was the mage. We only had 1 netherwind chest drop and the officer mage who told me he didn't wanted changed his mind on the spot. Never got it and I raided to 4 horsemen in naxx. Also went months never getting a weapon then azuresong drops. I take it, but end up getting claw of chrommagus the next week. Unlucky there, but I also won zulian tiger rolling 94 when I was the only person not in the guild that ran zg. Plus my real life friend and guild mate got the raptor a few weeks later, that has to be insane odds.
---
GRIZZLY ASSEMBLE
---
Classic has a community because the game fosters it. It’s not that people who play Classic are any better or worse than on modern WoW, but the game encourages team play over solo. 
---
BFA could have an excellent community, if there wasn’t LFR/4 raid difficulties, no LFG, no cross server everything, a long leveling experience, etc.
---
This can be solved using sticky sessions.
---
Check this out for all of them:
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Console_variables/Complete_list
---
Thank me later ;)
---
Mandatory "read the paper manual" time before it lets you log in.
---
&gt;  I fully expect all phase 1 content to be cleared in less than 2 weeks.
---
i'd give it an extra week because you still gotta wait for 40 people to hit 60 and iirc, the experience needed ramps at 40+.
---
Blood elf or Void elf DH for sure.
---
I thought classic was hard Kappa
---
Wasn't obvious to me. I wasn't able to log in during the actual test, so that's how I voted. I did log in today, though
---
Hunters, warlocks, and druids can level faster than mages. This is known. Mages are 3rd/4th depending on skill level.
---
Aug 13th  son.  so you fan pick the name AUTOATTACKANDY
---
RemindMe! 96 days do this
---
"next week's 1-10 will be crazy. "
---
There's another test next week?
---
I disagree, I think you may be the one with some tinted glasses man.
---
WoW raids may not be as complex, but as far as actually getting them done? Takes atleast twice as long as anything in retail, and is 10x as satisfying. That's just my opinion. Play what you want.
---
That's fantastic! Honestly knowing that my efforts to login yesterday and my presence in todays SW events made a difference helped make Classic better is awesome.
---

---
Some of the things I tested: 1) Certain skips are available - e.g. dying in the corner of the troll cave of the dwarf starting area to port to the Kharanos graveyard).
---
Tons of quests are based on item drops that aren't shared across the party. And parties can only be of limited size. So there is definitely a limit to how much it helps when it comes to heavy overcrowding
---
*Its a little long and if I didn't explain something well enough let me know. Or if something is redundant *
---
No one can tell you how to have fun, just do whatever is fun for you. Leveling as fast as you can? go ahead, Do you want to experience the quests for the first time without being told where to go? Then after an hour getting frustrated that you still cant find Mankrik's wife. I found that fun, not being told where to go and having to figure it out my self or eventually giving up and looking it up. 
---
My earliest memory of WoW that I can remember was when someone first showed it to me a few months after it came out. I played a night elf and after an hour in the game probably still only level 2 or 3 I died and had no idea how to find my body. So I just made a new character. leveling fast going hardcore raiding in a guild  didn't matter to me, I just had fun playing the game. What I mostly did was just run around doing quest killings things and talking to people.
---
Now i'm definitely not as bad as when I first started, and neither is everyone else so I'm curious how it'll go. Especially since a lot of people are use to Modern WoW as it is. 
---
But as for what class your friend should play? There's a lot more information out there then there was when WoW first came out. He  
---
 could take a look at what the classes offer and see which one he would like to play but try not to pick which ones that are perceived to be the "best". They could be the best at what they do but if you don't have fun playing them then whats the point? Why play a game like a job? Play to have fun. If you want to experience Classic WoW blind go ahead I find it fun going into a game with no information and to figure it out myself but it might be different for you. You can also look up how to play the classes perfectly the best strats to level before the game comes out if that's how you wan't to play then that's how you want to play.
---
As for addon's? again that's up to you guys. There's DPS charts there's that questie addon thats shows you were to go I believe. There's Meter addon's for dps/healing but those don't really matter for leveling. I havn't really looked at the addons since I don't plan to use them, but look at the addons see if there's anything you want to use.
---
As for a think of it like a high school, you join  a class that has the serious  students that are focused on scoring an A+ and being perfect. Now that's fun for them  but you see a classroom down the hall that's getting d's-c's who don't care that they're almost failing, that they're wiping for hours on a boss or that some people are getting f's. While the teachers just playing movies and having fun with them instead of teaching, and you're jealous that they're having a blast while your stuck in the quiet room where everyone has to be perfect at all times. If you guys have fun in the A+ perfect class then join that class. Or if you don't care that you're not clearing the raids in the first day or even the first 3 weeks, then join the fun class. Its all up to you guys on what community you want to join.
---
TL:DR
---
 No one can tell you how to have fun. Figure out the way you want to play and just go for it. Hardcore rush to the end? join the A+ Class . Just have a blast playing? join the Guilds for the people not the performance and just play the game. However if you want to be serious about raiding also don't join the guilds that refuse to deal with people that are obviously the issue to not killing a boss.
---
its Closed. stay out
---
I've not played on private servers for years, so I have no clue who they are. My B.
---
 I agree with that.
---
But modern mythic guild have gone through a similar process time and time again. There's always one fight, mid-tier, that put a big emphasis on personal responsability.
---
In battle of dazar'alor it's Opulence :  ifyou don't do  mechanic properly you aren't making out of the gauntlet phase, which means less people to soak on opulence himself /less dps... and it goes downhill for there.
---
in Uldir it was fetid devourer : if you couldn't position yourself properly or if you kept spreading the debuff , it would be a wipe.
---
We have gotten quite efficient at identifying underperforming / making strat around them ( for razorgore , guild can DPS everything instead of kiting dragonkin.)

It's not even a BFA vs classic argument. Classic is better than BFA by a longshot (imo), but its viewer numbers are definitely inflated by the fact that people want to play the game but can't. Twitch viewers go through cycles, and they'll get bored of classic just like they got bored of Apex. 
---
It's really just Fortnite, GTA5, and League that remain at the top for a long time.
---
I'm honestly pretty tired of people acting like twitch is the only metric that matters for a game's popularity.

This but unironically

I love how the other guy randomly has Benediction

Enemy mobs should be buffed to account for increases in player skill, knowledge, and accessibility. This has been done on private servers (in dungeons especially) and has been well received by the community. Face-rolling a dungeon makes it more like retail and doesn't give the same feeling of satisfaction and fulfillment that we got back in Vanilla.

I haven't deleted anything, why would I?

Hold up. Is this repeatable more than the one time? Realistically how often would you be able to switch layers and do this? Once? I suppose it would depend on how many actual layers per server there is, but even then would logging out put you in a different layer every time?
---
"You think you want it but you don't." Blizzard should stick to their guns and cancel Classic altogether instead of all this flip flopping.
---
Not going to lie that’s a great video lol

I think that has been confirmed as a private server thing at this point

Indeed, i want to play this level 30 meta

just go to the vod and skipp till you see sm. Well worth too see the full run
---
Dude did you like forget about the video when you wrote this? Asmongold took MORE damage than the guy in the video, where are you getting 2/3 - 1/2. You feel like people take less damage because when you used to play Vanilla you were 10 and were godawful at video games. I’ll take Blizzard’s word that dungeon damage is correct.
---
This guy probabilities
---
but did he die?
---
Idk how they do it, but id imagine they stress-test the servers based on their rated capacity. So get one server up and running, prove it out, determine it's load handling capacities, stress-test and fix major problems with limited-but-server-appropriate-load. Then replicate it how ever many times you need in order to support the expected user-base.
---
No doubt there will be hiccups, but that's how any production launch goes.
---
It's not about sharing your leveling experience. It's waiting forever to kill enough mobs. Not every quest is kill 20 boars. It'll take you an hour to get enough livers to satisfy five peoples quests. I've played private servers with high population and no dynamic spawns. It's fucking awful. I don't have interest, nor the time to deal with that bullshit.
---
I play on one of the most populated servers, even the most crowded guilds are almost dead silent at all times. It's a ghost town, man.

I’m not defending them not having horde events but I think they chose to have it on one faction only to make it easier for them to see what’s working and what’s not. More players on one side only? I donno

Lewd!

So I think I've only noticed this on myself and party members, but not on non-party targets, now I haven't tested it since the patch(s) with party members.
---
The server would run just fine without layering. But they'd still have to preserve the 2500 cap. Which means dead servers in a few months. Layer prevents that by allowing the tourists to leave without impacting the server health.

Tell me, do dead servers seem like a "working version" of the game?

Yeh its not rocket science, they are playing what pays the most money. At the moment that’s classic.

I honestly don’t get why people on this sub are so infatuated with streamers? But I have never really got it, I’d much rather play the game myself than watching some 39 year old with the temperament of a toddler play the same game.
---
I was sure you would refer to the authentic vanilla launch experience, where people could not even log in. So yeah, people got to experience authentic WoW that day.
---
My potato could run classic twice as long as retail before overheating.

You're definitely right, but the funniest thing is that after vael you had suppression room and I remember that was also one of the bigger pita of vanilla raiding.

I'm playing warrior so...first 10 levels will take me 8 hours because I can't tag shit, but I plan to play at least 30 hours day one so hopefully I can just out last the first wave.

Tourists can fuck off and go play retail if they want to complain about spawns and lag. Accommodating them is already starting to ruin classic.
---
I can guarantee that there are guilds of 40+ people ready to no-life for a week for this. I’ve seen it happen in other games (and in WoW as well).
---
Yes, but I'm getting just as tired of people complaining about streamers.

warlock was very useful tho with summoning if they run out of items or get broken gear plus ss hs and imp buff and fear. I think thats more important than 1 hunter atleast.

Getting BIS on my main can still result in me earning very little gold. You're correct about the time investment. I'd still argue that this time investment is worth it in the long term considering both of these classes have unique ways to fame for gold. 
---
I'm curious, what will you be going to farm gold on your main?
---
We might have missed out on a part of it but at the very least we got to experience being on the actual server vicariously through the streamers.
---
Absolutely not
---
most likely, yeah. i wouldn't be surprised if Ony/MC is dead in under 2 weeks since one of the streamers said they want to be Level 60 "in 10 days" or something like that.

Had a LCD 15" in 2004 pre-WOW for myself.

I agree it should be reverted, not having it makes combat seem bland.

---
Given that the Classic team haven't steered us wrong yet, I'll give them the benefit of doubt with regards to layering being gone a couple months into release.
---
You're finally awake
---
It’s really comfortable for me - it took some time to get the muscle memory for the middle numbers on the pad.  But the 123 and 0-= are quite easy and it makes WoW a lot easier for me.

You often don't have that choice in vanilla. With this guy who someone said ninjad an item, you're ready to go. If you kick him out you have to spend another 30 min finding another party member. Probably longer if he was a healer or tank.

Do you have a link for that

You mean Mandela effect? Lul.
---
I think this is an important part of the stress test. This is the sort of data blizzard is looking for to determine whether or not layers are working the way they're supposed to. IIRC if players are grouped in the same guild in game, they will be able to find each other in the same 'layer' so to speak. I guess since the cap was level 5, it wouldn't have been possible to make a guild and so you ended up moving to your guildie's layer instead of staying where the action was. 
---
This is important though because it means the layering technology they have is working. So you were able to successfully determine that in the stress test, and this experience can be valuable as feedback for blizzard. It kinda tells them 'hey, players who want to bring friends to their layer to participate in this world boss/elite fight are having issues' which then leads to -&gt; 'what caused this and how can we improve the implementation so that friends can see each other and fight the same world boss/world elites together'
---
Though you had a bittersweet moment towards the end, you got Blizz some valuable information (assuming you report your scenario on the forums to determine if this is how layering should work). Just means classic will be improved further come lunch time!
---
I'm gettin' rid of Britta!

Lmfao this smells like Arthas-NA when pat was hopping around guilds trying to get real raid gear and everyone was kicking him because he fookin sucked ass.

Just wait for Classic auto pilot and let the snooze fest begin.

The only hope for the classic community is to play the way it was intended to be played.  you have retail to float through.

It appears the other player is consistently hitting outside the possible damage range (assuming armor formula is correct). I could confirm the armor formula though if someone could tell me the % reduction for 636 armor at lvl 5 in the beta. It comes out to be 56%\~ with the formula I used found from   [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Armor](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Armor)  1-59 which could be wrong  
---
Anyways female damage looks correct. Male damage looks like he has armor pen or something lol
---
No  Changes
---
This was a fantastic read on a subject that isn’t spoken about as much as it should be when it comes to raiding in Classic.
---
Having never played a tank (huntard for lyfe) I've really enjoyed the plethora of Classic tanking videos on YouTube. I still have no real desire to roll one, but I've learned so much about exactly what tanks are thinking about. Just two videos of Preach and I'm so much more knowledgeable about the details. I still haven't found a good source for hunter talk. Maybe it's just not out there?
---
Great video! Can we expect mage next :-))?
---
You clearly didn't spend about a couple hours racing other players for kills in the stress test. Even *with* layering, it was absolutely terrible.
---
I have 2 Legion PTRs and I only had 1 before. I don't have Beta though unless something is messed up with the account.
---
tadaaaa ...
---
I will thank you in August, but also now too: Thank you :)
---
I have been playing this game since late vanilla and never knew how you would get a new one if needed. Probably because I was never put in this situation but it’s good to know,  thank you.
---
Yeah I skipped that quest on my nelf alts and just ran to IF.
---
I was there, it wasn’t nearly as bad as you say. Good players know how to find and tag mobs efficiently. Good and bad players will spread apart by skill and knowledge.

eDKP. No loot council (except for legendaries). Points earned by time &amp; bosses killed. Adjusted for performance (via ranks)

---
I see me in there! Before Kazzak stomped me out and the server went down!
---
What happens when all the people from all the layers pile into one Barrens? The same exact thing that would've happened in the starting zones. Especially given that the realms will be several times larger than vanilla realms, world layering is absolutely needed. 
---
It isn't just nostalgia, it's idiocy, and just because that's impossible to reason with doesn't mean Blizzard has to deliver an unfun product to appease you.

Those are good things.

streamer Privilege. Feels good man
---
I prefer DKP and loot council. Loot council can decide on gearing up the MT and also for legendaries.
---
DKP for the rest of the loot. If you all have DKP, then all can bid as much or less as they decide the importance of the upgrade.
---
Did you ever encounter your guilds leaders ignoring the implemented loot system to help them gear out friends(whether in game, or IRL)?
---
I agree, layering only 1-40. After that everyone exists in only one layer. That way you don't mess up the economy as there is not too much to be gained from abuse in low lvl zones.
---
I'm most concerned about hunter as it seems to be the most buggy, so I decided to compile a list of bugs for hunter specifically and I will be updating/keeping track of the bugs as we go throughout the beta.

Historically? Yes. That’s why i created a guild for Classic. Not trusting pre-establishes guilds who will have inherent biases.
---
I’m so happy right now.
---
Im lplaying every stress test i love the early leveling zones and level 1 "launch" hype and choas of it. Seeing so many players is a great feeling. All logging in at the same time , all level 1 with 0 copper and bare bone supplies. Everyone is at square 1 which hasnt ever been a thing since the original vanilla server launch. Expansions are just additive, fresh launch is full reset and thats the most fun.
---
Classic WoW is about the journey not the destination. Leveling is part of the experience and it's significantly better designed with a great feedback loop and the feeling of progression.
---
But it is just there to be there and has no real correlation to the story or time-line. Basically, you aren't sent back in time, lore wise. This fight never happened in cavern of times. It's just there so people could experience it.
---
Blizzards own words, Google it mate.
---
I don’t play this game I’m more of a first person shooter type but I like how stoked the players are about it. Makes me want to check out the game now
---
I've never had a loot system work without issue. Worst being another rogue quitting when I got the first guild glaive in TBC because we had a DKP system and I had the highest. 
---
Loot council worked well for a little bit, but outside of tanks, people started to feel let down, including myself, being lower on priority than some better geared players because my damage was higher, and it's all because I farmed 6 flasks and countless elixirs each week and many others did not.
---
Zero sum DKP also never worked because we might want an item for PvP or offspec, but we're going to lose our points for it, so it just gets sharded.
---
Honestly, I'm thinking I'm going to just choose a class/faction/race combo that gives me the lowest amount of loot competition so I can avoid the drama and get a drop now and then.
---
So you prefer a DKP bid system as opposed to the item value. How did you find that worked out?
---
Asmon had over 100k viewers when Tomb of Sargeras and Uldir came out, so your argument doesn't make much sense. A lot of his viewership this past week is due to most people not having access to Classic.
---
I'd agree, but the actual population of Classic servers will be much larger than the closed beta servers. That seems pretty common sense. With that in mind, more people means more attempting to exploit things like this; only issue is that the more people mining nodes like this, the less "layer hopping" works.
---
Depends on your guild, but my guild will be using lewt council for set items and legendary because they are so valuable for some classes and trash or others. And some version of set value dkp for the rest. Sounds like you got fucked over by your guild and I’m sorry about that
---
Meesa

Is eDKP a bid system, or item value system?

I had a rollback DC when I had just entered Orgrimmar as a tauren. I had taken the flight path and was heading towards Thrall. Got DCd in the drag, logged back in at the entrance of Orgrimmar. Went to check if it affected the flight path pickup and yup, had to grab that again.
---
&gt; It definitely does a great job driving away players
---
Check my post history on the subject. I've had plenty of bad things to say about retail. I still think it does many things better than Vanilla by virtue of iterative design and experience. Don't get me wrong, it's worse than its predecessors and some of the new systems they have added are atrocious and are driving people away, but there are still good things to say too. It's stubborn and overly-generalistic to say literally everything is worse in retail.
---
Item value I believe but I think both can be used.
---
Seeing as us with stresstest but no beta access can stil log in and see an offline stress test server with x amount of characters on it, I’d say we can pick up where we left off.
---
Blizzard has stated that layering is only going to persist in the first phase. It’s not a permanent thing if they stick to their word.
---
It's a **stress test**, they're *intentionally* cramming as many people as possible into one area.
---
The silver lining is, you won’t feel pressured to keep up with everyone else at launch, you can just take it at your own pace no pressure
---
You and I are very similar. All of these systems seem to have varying flaws. Loot council personally being the absolute worst that no guild should ever institute as their main form of loot distribution.
---
Like I said elsewhere: yes, there are reasons people are quitting retail, but that doesn't include raid design. The zone and encounter design is still very good and as such is not usually part of the usual complaints about retail.

Very good post. People are trying to expand the discontent of retail to include all aspects of the game. There are plenty of things wrong with retail but zone and encounter design are not among them.
---

---
"Da nostalgia players", just stop. BC and WOTLK became popular BECAUSE of vanilla. It's kinda like how Game of Thrones late seasons are objectively more popular, have millions more watching them than the early seasons but that never would have happened if they weren't built on the success of the early seasons. 
---
It's not just about the community, but that is a huge part of it. Several things were better designed than they would become later. The leveling experience was FAR superior even considering the lack of quests in the 55-60 range.
---
Any time I have been in a guild using DKP, I have gotten fucked over pretty more than once. I always avoided guilds that exclusively used loot council because that is just way to easy to abuse. Though I do agree, certain items NEED to be discussed rather than just thrown out to the highest person on the list.
---
Battle Shout spam is a private server thing, in Classic the buffs do not give enough aggro.
---

---
Hunters and hunters you mean? I can't count how many kills were stolen by a hunter in just one hour of playing. That's got nothing to do with skill.
---
Now you can play Hearthstone while you wait for your FP, boat, raid, cooldown, etc!!!
---
It’s not a public beta
---
Worked brilliantly. Never any drama. If one player bids lots of their dkp, then they are down the list of chance of getting next item/upgrade. But it means the raiders coming week in week out have a better chance over someone who doesn’t raid a lot. It puts the onus on the player to value the item. 
---
Also means the casual players will eventually get the item for a lot less once you’ve all got it. 
---
This helps gear up the regular raiders before the casual raiders and is totally fair as it’s your choice to bid high or low.
---
Mcconnell is the class leader for all paladins!
---
You caught me haha!
---
Ret is gimped and busted on pservers because Seal of Command doesn't even work properly and scaling values and what procs what is all jacked up.
---
I personally think you should play the faction you prefer first before picking a class, and I also think you should take Ret with a grain of salt of pservers more than literally any other spec.  Ret gets the most inaccurate representation than any other build.
---
not even close
---
Streaming numbers are not indicative of the long-term health of a game. Classic obviously has very high anticipation just because it's something people have been asking for for years, but it's not like it's an either-or thing; plenty of people will play both especially since they share a subscription. Plus, right now most people don't have beta so you combine a highly anticipated game with limited access and of course you are going to get high stream viewership. 
---
What happens when classic has been out for weeks/months, or well into the future when it stops getting new content while retail continues to get new expansions and content patches? You can make your own observation of stream view counts and make a judgement all you want but no amount of scientific wording is going to make it, you know, *actually scientific*.
---
The fastest I've gotten warrior to 60 is around 5 days 18 hours but that was with perfect conditions and someone helped me on WW axe, this obviously isn't going to happen on launch and I'm estimating myself to probably be around 7 days played realistically just based off how long 1-20 is going to take with the Zerg before I can get ahead.
---
The younger playerbase will probably stay on live. Quick rewarding gameplay is all kids care about now.
---
And the servers won’t be ghost towns because sharding.
---
But yea, the looking for group tool will be quite empty.
---
Both are not very good. But ret is way more viable than enhance. And paladins are just really good period.
---
It did work. You could tell by how fucking stressed everyone was. Christ people were being fucking babies yesterday.
---
Hunters exist so the game needs layering LUL.
---
You can out tag hunters pretty easily if you learn spawns, which you will if you keep getting out tagged by a hunter
---
Then after the Barrens? After that next zone? 
---
Face it; having layering all the way to 60 is better solution than guessing which level or zone the cutoff is.
---
No Lewt system is perfect but after talking about it a lot with people. I think it really comes down to who you have in your guild. Good people = a good time if you find you have a dickhead just get rid of them, no matter how good they are. The content is not that hard and if your not min/max then it’s really not worth it.
---
We knew we wanted it, and it's amazing.
---
I hear a catheter is a better option than a loss bottle lol!
---
You have a seriously warped view of the purpose of online discussion boards. They're not actually meant to be homogenous echo chambers, you know?
---
How is/was gear that wasnt needed by anyone but a new raider handled? Did that new raider still have to bid? Was their a minimum amount of DKP they had to lose in order to get the item? Were they just given the item since it was going to be junked anyways?
---
Head over to dead by daylight if you want to see a toxic sub

Just give it your 100% and you'll be fine, I will he rooting for you my parallax-ian friend :)
---
Play what you want to play.  Thats the only way to have fun and make sure you get the most out of your time.
---
With that said, but both specs are going to be bad for pvp and it is hard to find gear for the specs.  And its really the gear that will make it hell for you as the server progresses.  Because dps pieces for hybrid classes are hard to come by, more optimized classes with blow right by you with their easier to find upgrades.
---
As for raids, most guilds don't take ret spec.  Waste of space.  Some won't mind a single enchantment though since grace of air was a solid hunter/rogue buff.
---
I was there!  We tried made that circle and screamed "Omar" to try and summon him. That was super fun.
---
Props to you lol waiting an our true force of will power lol I recommend rouge lol if you’re not worried about min max and competition for spots they are so much fun stealth lets you avoid so many unwanted situations key
---
In the past week I've talked to a ridiculous amount of people who argue with full sincerity that there's not a *single thing* retail does better than classic. It's absurd. It feels like the classic fans are trying to hijack outrage about retail and it's totally counterproductive.
---
I guess you'd call me a naysayer of a sorts when it came to Classic. I wasn't particularly interested. I wasn't against it either. Having since been invited to the beta....yeah, I'm a convert, and I'm re-enjoying the experience of playing again, near 15 years later.
---
But the topic of this post right here has, and still is, one of the primary reasons I'm still a bit of a skeptic.
---
I raided hardcore. I (tried) to pvp hardcore too. I think many, *many*, **many** people are in for a rude awakening for both PvE and PvP. This post does a good job of highlighting a couple of problem bosses, but frankly the biggest problem boss was the logistics of 40 man raiding as a whole. 
---
During my time in Vanilla, I made it as far as Naxx, having cleared 3/4 quarters only to hit the wall that was 4H. In that time, I probably went through 5 guilds (from MC to Naxx). Keep in mind, server reputation was key, so when I say 5 guilds I don't mean I hopped guilds for progression's sake. These were all "top tier" guilds with extensive application processes. No, I went through 5 guilds because each previous guild *died* or was merged into a new one.
---
You needed 40+ people online, on time, prepared and ready to go. You needed a specific class spread. Some fights were pretty lax, others were pretty rigid. Add to that DKP systems, limited loot and clear cut cases of try-hards and carries....and yeah, OP is 100% spot on, there were massive cliques and drama issues. Always.

And I (nor OP) have even touched on the brutal grind that was PvP ranking. Long story short, with what time I had left after raiding I barely scratched the surface of rank 10, and that was with some well ran pre-mades and a still not insignificant amount of time. For 11-14 expect to make it your 2nd job.
---
I'm still looking forward to seeing what happens, truly. But I do wonder if this "generation" of MMORPG players are really ready for what end-game looks like in this version of the game from a different era. Should be interesting.
---
Sounds painful ouch #totemlove
---
I wasn't complaining I was giving an example on why layering helps.
---
Blizzard knows about it. I've been farming ore and herbs during Legion with realm hop addon and nobody stopped me.
---
Man there is always a first for everything :)
---
We had tried this before. Knowing the benefit of being able to bid it, we agreed an order amongst my class. The recipient would bid as little as the guild allowed and they would be uncontested by the rest of us. It went over very poorly with everyone that wasn't us and they changed it.
---
No you’re not shut the hell up troll
---
Next level man 30hrs a day you are a man by my own heart may the the old gods give you strength
---
Bull shit. If you saw Bolvar getting gangbanged by A bunch of orcs and trolls you would shit your pants and be up in arms about the injustice. 
---
Your passive, calm, and thoughtful reaction to this should be all the evidence you need to know you're an alliance main.
---
Oh man I remember making edits like this... For forum signatures and avatars xD that pic makes me super nostalgic..
---
 RemindMe! 96 days  "change wow settings in console"
---
Was it a blind bid system? Or more of an auction done in chat?
---
I really hope they dont implement this BS. Layering seems like sharding with extra steps
---
Amen! This is my one of those things I wish people would love by before attacking someone on the internet when they make a mistake
---
Asmon and Esfand, among many others "flocking to the closed beta with very few invites" have advocated for Classic for a very very long time.
---
Esfand was even banned from youtube streaming because he streamed vanilla private server content.
---
Of course there is a big audience for classic right now which broadcasters are interested in. But what is best for their channel does not always align with what they want to play.
---
Guys I am curious. I didn’t play the game back then (only since tbc start) and don’t know really how it should work. But I wasn’t able to go Fullscreen in the settings? I could select windowed or windowed fullscreen, nur both settings, let let your cursor get on my other 2 monitors. So quickly clicking on my unitframe, oops on left screen. Quickly clicking on right side action bar, oops on right screen. 
---
I know fullscreen is a problem of retail with dx12, but in classic client I can’t chose that.
---
When warriors start getting geared, they get really scary.
---
I really feel like the layering was really the thing they wanted to test the most for this first test. They know how much some people don't like the idea of it, so they want it to work as well as possible. Other stuff, too of course, but I think that was the biggie.
---
&gt; RemindMe! 96 days "/console WeatherDensity 3"
---
No, leveling is not even close to the whole game since the majority of your play time is spent at max level raiding or pvping. But even if it was, 1-30 takes way less time than 30-60 to do. I think the world record leveling run had 20% of the total time between 1-30.
---
You misspelled layer
---
Why would I lie about that? Lol
---
I mean, just because the existing areas are not instances doesn’t mean they can’t be viewed as group content. I think they were just opening it up so that you don’t have to group or can drop in and out
---
&gt;No, you're locked onto a layer
---
Citation required
---
They are still in the game you know, they are just not instanced nor do they have elites. It's the caves in every starter zone where you have to head in and kill X dude or pickup Y thing. 
---
Every starter zone have such a cave, and it's often in this cave that you'll group for the first time as the mobs in there are quite strong.
---
Layering is not accommodating the turists though. The whole point of layering is accommodating the players that will actually stick around, when the tourists "fuck off".
---
And it is accommodating everyone trying to actually play the game in those few first days. Not having layering is when you would see "tourists" spoil the fun.
---
Layering is just global sharding.
---
There's no reason to shard the entire world/high level areas. Shard the low levels areas and be done with it. The economy is going to be completely destroyed by people who are going to no-life it to 60 and have no competition for the higher end materials.
---
And considering I'm taking time off work, I expect within a few days to be 60.
---
RP is awesome
---
With all these titles and ranks introducing player character sounds like introducing Daenerys in Game of Thrones. And the worse is that we are all equal with that. Imagine everyone being Grand Marshal/High Warlord.
---
I want to be "one of adventureres" once again. Meaningless alone but together with others doing amazing things.
---
Class and race representation isn't really accurate, people logged for a stress test
---
Ha, I forgot about these things
---
My guild on nost did this and I’m just going to say one thing... this bidding system stops people taking upgrades because they don’t want to miss out on the one big ticket item. And you end up with people saving all their dkp. Also if you have a silent bid system like my guild was, it did tend to have another side effect of people dkp fucking other people for small upgrades so that they could not get the next bigger one.
---
 For example t2 for paladins is trash and should go for Minimum bid but cause it looks good and is ok for PvP you would have people paying 2-3 weeks worth of dkp cause people were being assholes.
---
I love this
---
I dont understand that logic at all. The reason Hunters should have Nightfall is Exactly because they have High uptime and dont do a lot of damage regardless.
---
It is pretty easy to compare: Fury warrior does 700 dps but 400 with Nightfall. Hunter does 300 dps and 100 with Nightfall.
---
The hunter only loses 200 DPS and theoretically has a higher uptime. 
---
The real misconception is giving Nightfall to your best DPS class.
---
I think people are sorta misconstruing the question. Obviously healing specs have "utility", but they aren't doing damage at all. So the question should be, "What DPS spec of a class is there because of their utility, not their damage output?"
---
The answer to that question is Shadowpriest. It's the only hybrid offspec that's regularly tolerated in high-level raids, because it provides an extremely good debuff for Warlocks. Its actual damage output is only mediocre, especially in long fights where it runs out of mana. Nevertheless, because of that debuff alone, SPriests are a 1-per-raid sorta deal.
---
Hunters fall off late in progression, but they still put out good damage up to at least AQ. Other hybrid specs are rarely ever invited. Other pure dps classes have great damage output and are there more for damage than utility.
---
I'm wondering if the Deathcharger Reins will have the original 0.05% drop chance or the buffed 1% drop rate. Also the Piccolo of the Flaming Fire will have the unlimited duration 1min Cooldown or the nerfed 30s duration 5min Cooldown.
---
Not wasting PTO Monday, but off the next 6 days. So sleeping pills around 5PM EST, sleep when the server opens 6EST. Get a good 6-8 hours sleep while there may be server issues, tryhards being rude to get ahead, and everyone else puttering around. 
---
Around 12-2 assume casuals have dropped off and most everyone else is a zone or two ahead, so start. I'll pass the casuals easy by time they are back on and never catch the tryhards. Ride that sweet middle ground and sleep at the busiest hours in the early evening.
---
Also benefit of seeing early server pops, double check the ones the big streamers ended up on... to avoid, and choosing among the ones I got character names reserved on that have good middle population.
---
i sat in the que for 90 mins before deciding to do something else. so this is the only screenshot i have from it.

Yeah cloth turn ins were open and I had a main already. 
---
You can hit well past revered with a good darnassus rep guide. Ghost run to darn starting zone from level 1 and do anything with that rep. Can def hit it by 60 with enough cloth
---
I caught the last fight after work. It was fun to watch. I'm loving these streams.
---
And, good news for EU folks, it starts at 2300 which is quite a bit better than 0100 :)
---
aren't elites bugged and not as powerful as they should be?
---
MS&gt;OS /random 100, let the gods decide.
---
&gt; so its like saying that we are ~96% certain that Lemmesmashxd does less damage per hit than Cepexa.
---
It's like saying we think there is only a 4% chance of seeing these results if there is no bug.
---
That does not mean that there is a 96% chance there is a bug.
---
Read the sidebar.
---
They say that, but people have been whining about lfr since before titanforging was a thing.
---
If it wasnt that, it would be something else. See all the complaining when people ask for games like sekiro and dark souls to have different difficulty levels so they can still play.
---
I play games on the hardest difficulty but why should everyone have to play that way? If they want to play on easy, so be it. There's no legitimate reason to exclude them. The same arguments were made back in wrath about "Why do bad players get to see my content!?!?!?!?!" "We should get something exclusive beyond item levels for our amazingness!!!!!!!". Its a bunch of bullshit. We get the pleasure of knowing we beat it. I'll always know i beat H LK before 4.0 patch. Nobody can take that away from me.
---
Its great content, but i was thinking. If they Can clear this at lvl 30, When they hit 60 i hope their dungeons will be as intense. But i doubt it, i think pve at lvl 60 will be a steamroll unfortunatly.
---
Well you have to spend time with her, give her attention, sometimes take care, survive changes of moods and stuff. It's not all rainbows and unicorns.
---
Appreciate the love Sammy. :)
---
Seriously that's an amazing shot, touched up or not
---
Actually it's more.  There are 22 zones that you can actively quest in up to level 30 and 18 after.
---
People will probably take your comment the wrong way, but I get it.  In the end, player psychology is the most important factor in any video game.  It's a tricky thing to make someone "feel" powerful when it's actually a relative thing.
---
Also, playing any game for too long will cause burnout and you'll naturally lose track of what is "high" and "low" unfortunately.
---
Hi, /u/Draglesss
---
Chat auction. They would raid warning a piece and let it start, making sure to give everyone enough time to get in those late bids.
---
The system felt toxic to begin with. Prior to this there was an issue of people bidding just because they wanted someone else to bid higher and drop their points to reduce future competition, and a lot of, "oh wait, nevermind", which they allowed. 
---
This is the only bid system I witnessed and it didn't last long.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "mach das!"
---
&gt;stop the toxicity
---
I will gank you, orcy.
---
Where? I wanna join!
---
That's a spicy meat-a-ball
---
Thanks, Sex Hitler.
---
I'm glad someone brought this up. I personally love the idea of a random element added to the looting. For just this reason, a friend and I actually brainstormed and developed an alternative loot system back in TBC. It tracked attendance and gave each raider a % based on that attendance. Then loot was put out to /roll and whatever your roll was, you added your % to that roll. IE if my attendance was at 90%, and I rolled a 70, my overall roll would be 160. We also limited how much loot each person could receive in a given night/lockout to ensure fair distribution.
---
This.  I've been on Stormrage since classic, and even to this day seeing horde that are actually from that server is like spotting a unicorn.
---
why are they screaming like pigs ? Are these the biggest streamers encouraged by the community ? lol what
---
Stress test was pretty great all around.  A few major concerns though.   
---
First, elephant in the room, phasing/sharding/layering was a drag.  Multiple times I engaged mobs to then zone into TB and have the mob we were fighting disappear on us.  Particularly rough is Ghosthowl who along certain points in his path is completely unkillable and twice I had a bead on him, zoned into tb accidentally, and then when I zoned back out was in a different shard and he was gone.  Multiple times before they announced they were going to be crunching layers I was killed by a swarm of sharded mobs, roughest of which is in caves.  There was so much phasing/sharding/layering going on that it really detracted from the overall experience.  I'm a huge fan of the game and sunk around 16 hours into the test even with work, but I will not be playing on live if this isn't changed.
---
Second, the attack table is jank.  I wish I could have kept a more detailed log but from observation, unarmed attacks can't crit, having 20% chance to dodge on my hunter (+8 agi coming from gear and aspect of monkey) and if the mob was even or over me by 1 level I was never dodging.  Spells were reliably (60-80%) of the time landing on mobs 5-7 levels higher than the caster.  Glancing and crushing works to how it was originally modeled though.  Didn't test fishing skill on rods but that was also supposed to behave as weapon skill but from dueling people I felt this wasn't the case.  Over all, this is a massive concern.  It'd be like removing the d20 out of DND  the replacing it with something else.  You'd still have the same theme, the same abilities and the same superficial jist of the game, but the core mechanic that is its foundation will have changed.  I believe this is the main reason why the game feels so easy at this point, its just fundamentally easier to hit the target.
---
Third and perhaps most complicated, hit detection and positioning registering server side.  The game is running very smooth and the client to server interactions are amazing, but they are significantly different than the original game.  One of the reason the Tauren hit box feels so large is right now you start swinging as soon as you're in range with perhaps a .2 second delay, where on the old client and server there would be a .8-1 second delay of registration caused by internet latency of 2005 where the character would still be moving closer to contact.  This combined with the legion mob's propensity to preposition itself with 100% speed backpedaling and the new animation system has really lost a lot of the reason such systems they are trying to implement for being there.   In other words, there are vestigial systems that are artifacts left over from them trying to problem solve for 2004 technology and they are implementing them over 2019 code.  Its not really anything I can point to specifically (except stuff like moving mobs while tanking them, speed of mob switching targets on threat table change and moonwalking) but over all it has a very different feel of the game.  I know movement, range and collision detection is less important in an rpg with targeting but part of WoW's original charm was the interaction of player vs environment and i'd equate it to nintendo trying to change the way Mario jumped and moved in super mario 64.
---
Overall though its great to see how much private server and the databases got wrong though.  Quest that were supposed to have a prereq level of 8 (Rites of the Earth Mother) actually was doable at 5, chest didn't drop an abundance of journeyman's staves (didn't see a single one the entire time while looking on ah) and cloth was actually something needing to be farmed and decided to spend it on a primary profession or first aid.    
---
I really hope the dynamic respawns were just for the test and I beg them to remember their promises about layering.  This isn't vanilla wow by any stretch of the imagination, but classic can be great if its a single server world.
---
Ouch!
---
I'm from Stormrage.  I did my part diving the horde off that server.  There was a mass exodus of horde when BC launched with server split due to over pop.  Alliance stayed and horde went to Area52.
---
rip lol
---
Finally an honest take on the longevity problem Classic faces. If you were some kid playing Vanilla or just ended up raiding MC towards the end before TBC you probably don't understand the more complex issues of how Vanilla will turn people off eventually. All the time investment, all the inconveniences, all the gate keeping, it wears on people. 
---
End-game Vanilla is a grueling experience, both for pve and pvp. That's not to say there's nothing good about it and that no one will find enjoyment from it, but it will grind and grind on the playerbase every step of the way.
---
&gt; even just the amount of time involved in wipe recovery when you didn't spawn at the instance entrance when you died but half a zone away.
---
Jesus christ, I had forgotten that was a thing. When did they change it? I vaguely remember running across westfall to get back to deadmines haha
---
Well i think its official, any form of bidding dkp system is garbage. lol
---
I was watching a TV show on my second monitor with WindowsMediaPlayer and both WoW and WMP crashed at the same moment tonight. Would like to know the cause of that bug. :)
---
it's my personal fav raid in classic by a looooong way
---
Please tell me everyone did /sleep before server died
---
You’re spot on about the risk of even losing “deadweight” because even a useless body was usually better than no body. 
---
I think you also hit upon a really important aspect I didn’t really mention.... which was the Core .... or the real main people who made efforts to progress the guild. 
---
It was hard to get 40 people to show up on time.... but it was REALLY hard to get 40 people to consistently show up!
---
I did the same thing, accidentally opted in for wow beta but meant to opt in for wow classic lol
---
The rednecks the win
---
You're confusing a Ubisoft beta with actual betas. This is an actual beta with a ton of bugs.
---
Ret, only noobs play horde.
---
How are they going to stop me killing it if they cant kill me?
---
Just so awesome that a level THIRTY dungeon can be this entertaining! I know they're under-levelled and all but still, I'd almost forgotten how exciting this game could be even while levelling. Can you imagine when Classic releases and we can all get lost for hours in Sunken Temple? Cannot wait.
---
Yeah, I expect Suppression Room, Firemaw (assuming  no safe spots), and Chromaggus to be the roadblocks for Classic BWL.
---
Also, you can exploit the unstuck request for a free second hearth.
---
Tell me your secret
---
Loads classic.
---
Goes to Capitol city.
---
"/1 LF hc raiding guild. Pst if recruiting."
---
I imagine if you join at launch that's about all it will take.
---
I know something felt less powerful when hitting a juicy crit..
---
This is important to me!
---
&gt; It felt like you accomplished something hard with a team of friends, rather than just being put on autopilot with a random group of people you'll never talk to again.
---
Let's pump the breaks. These guys are doing a boss 7 levels higher than them. Doing SM Armory at-level is not hard and does not have a feel of accomplishment.
---
I 4-man'd RFC with randoms in the beta and we didn't go around high-fiving afterwards. You autopilot dungeons in Classic the same as Retail. Having to spam /1 with "LFG X" doesn't make it harder or more rewarding.
---
Wtf that's a thing?  Now I gotta check F
---
Where is this :o
---
How fragile is the dude?
---
We actually did, we formed the word “BETA” in hopes of getting it lol
---
They can always remove it later, once the initial bulk of players push through the leveling process
---
In the future GameStop will be bankrupt
---
Yeah you can say that, look up the central limit theorems
---
They're having a memorial day service for the sunwell.
---
I think thats what WoW does to you. Once you play the best you have a hard time enjoying anything but the best. I kind of enjoyed the FF mmo and im still playing runescape but other than that ill put any game down after a couple hours.
---
A few hours
---
There needs to be a cartoon with this as narration like “ze end of the world” cartoon or w/e
---
I loaded up a private server for the first time this week and I'm really impressed with how good it is. Sure I'd rather be in the beta, but it does feel like I'm playing vanilla WoW again.
---
Again you have no fucking clue how this works, they don't have to kill you what so ever.  
---
  Good luck trying to outtag huge groups with all the tools to do this faster than anyone and efficiently.  
---
  If you're gonna enter a topic at the very least inform yourself.
---
Was a wonderful end to an awesome stress test. Had fun chatting with y'all.
---
For most it was.
---
You'll miss out on precious REP that way, the starter quests give a nutty amount of rep you'll sorely miss in later stages. If you take the approach of skipping the starter zone, doing explore run to level will be faster for the first levels ^^
---
The first part of AQ40, up to but excluding Huhuran, is actually pretty easy, and every guild that can clear the second half of BWL should have no issue at all.
---
But yeah, wiping on the trash in the second half of the raid can be demotivaring for sure.
---
To be fair, after a common man does a certain amount of heroic things, he'll be considered a hero...
---
If you create a game and want to have some semblance of character progression, after a while the heroic tasks need to be acknowledged and mentioned by both npcs and story.
---
What region?
---
Same thing happened to me. Same error too. Reported in game and in the crash window
---
I could always just go back after to complete them.

Hi, /u/anonymouspsy
---
If there are 5x as many players there will be 5x as many guilds farming the resources...
---
He's dating a pretty hot girl while you are hammering that white sock over and over
---
Critical strike to your beta chance
---
a hardcore guild will have its roster sorted before launch
---
In vanilla I was one of the few dwarf hunters on the server. And that's what I'll play again.
---
To those saying the group of 5 played poorly... Yeh, how else would you think 2 would win against 5.
---
By far the easiest way it is to play a crap load the first 3 weeks. All the hardcore guilds will be gearing up for raids and will be inviting 60s. Anyone high level at that stage will get into hardcore raids/groups/guilds very easily.  
---
      
---
The vast majority of 'hardcore' guilds recruiting now will fall apart within the first month when it becomes apparent all the players that bragged about playing 8 hours a day actually only played 3 hours a day and won't be ready for raiding for 2 months. They won't survive the drama when the 5 people that do actually play 8 hours a day start recruiting other high level people to do UBRS and all the lvl 38 noobs with jobs and wives get upset that they're losing their raid spots.
---
It was my favorite raid though :/ So pretty and calming.

It was online for awhile today as well. No que at all compared to yesterday. Hopefully the next stress test will go better for you ;D
---
A Korean dude died when WoW released because he forgot to eat
---
Very true. We missed the big laggy memefest at the beginning. But each player, evidenced by all these screenshots, made their own memories and stamp on history in the ~24 hours that were to follow, from opposite-faction conquests, intense grinding, exploring, and the many celebrations at the end of the test.
---
which is why I'm so not raiding in Classic.  
---
I did it--casually, only got through ZG, AQ20 and MC--in vanilla and even that was a time investment.  Took maybe 8-10 hours a week, plus I'd help farm mats for the progession groups that were in AQ40 (I only went on one or two attempts there and frankly wasn't good enough to stay on progression runs).
---
its still creepy, white knight bro
---
Yeah I was pissed when I realized wow and wow classic are two different options
---
Remind Me! 96 days "WoW Classic nerd"
---
If they are grey quest, you won't get anything from them. I think it's even drastically reduced at green
---
Oh My God
---
Most stuff seemed to work fine, I was a little annoyed by the "delay", or what to call it, is it the batching system? When looting it sometimes takes quite long, and when using spells as a paladin, SoR/judgement, the damage comes out with a big delay compared to when the animation hits the target.
---
Got to level 5 in 40mins in my best run, compared to 22\~mins on an empty private server, so Im happy with the training I got.
---
That was pretty much the most fun I've had in WoW. I remember we were raiding SFK for some drop that was lvl 19 requirement.
---
Asmon himself said during the Deadman stream that he had never had over 100k before that stream
---
Neither.

Their toolkit. Basically their abilities have very good pvp application that is less gear dependent than most other classes.
---
Yeh I think this is the most likely, and when BWL is on farm you can do all 3 same raid night.
---
Sorry to disregard your entire essay but what does "up to the four horsemen" mean? Did you have to take out the wings in a specific order in Vanilla? You can do them however you want in WotLK so that could either mean you beat like 2 bosses in the first wing or you beat the other 3 wings and were working on the last one
---
You could've just said "no, I don't understand how simple economics work and why this is a bad thing" and then possibly someone would explain it to you. Now noones going to waste their time doing that because you come across as someone not worthy of being explained simple concepts.

---
Layers are full server size right now, like 3k people. That crams the early zones as we saw from the stress test. Layering is meant to deal with the full server pop, not zone balance soecifically. Whereas sharding helps zone balance. So it's a legit question. 
---
I suspect what they will do with each round of stress test is lower the layer cap. Judging how well that has indirectly impacted the starter zones by just having fewer total people on a layer. Maybe the settle on 1500 people per layer for the release day. Bumping it back up to 3k once people have spread through more areas and crowding is less of an issue. 
---
This doesn't work as well as sharding since it is an indirect form of reducing zone contention. Certain start zones, the popular ones, could still be quite bad early on because layering doesn't control by zone. But I think the image of sharding for classic is so bad, they just want to avoid it.
---
ye but what was your best /played to 5 though?
---
The only options are god awful login queues, lots of dead empty servers, or layers. Blizzard chose layers.

Haha, that's lovely!

You're always there for me in my time of need. Whenever I act like a little bitch the Sweety Squad is there to smack that nonsense right out of my head
---
Sounds like you have a keeper lol
---
I plan on joining the first guild I see recruiting for raiding when I’m 60, at that point, after a few weeks, I will check to see which guilds have established themselves as good raiding guilds on my server and then apply to those.
---
We tried making “Beta pls” but the word beta was already looking deformed so we just stuck with Beta
---
Tauren Shaman for Horde.  
---
Human Paladin for Alliance... I think.
---
We call that ass pull on pservers
---
One of my favorite things about Vanilla was no elves in The Horde.
---
All still there just not instanced and dont drop any quality loot.
---
What are glancing blows?
---
Waiting an hour isn’t going to help at all. It was like 6 hours until I was able to log in to the stress test and the Undead zone was still a shitshow. I imagine Orc/Troll will be similarly bad on Horde. Peoples best bet is starting in an unpopular zone for the first rush like Thunder Bluffs.
---
Amazin'
---
You so edgy
---
TRUE. But, 14.99 for a pre owned copy of gears 3!? Someone is tripping hah
---
i wonder if they plan to do this with pvp and pve servers in every region
---
id say there is a good chance which sort of sucks
---
 GUys its fine, sellout streamers and spineless redditors already confirmed layering makes sense xD
---
RemindMe! 96 days “/console weatherdensity 3”
---
Man sleeping pills how did I not think of this lol get a full days rest prior lol!!!
---
That would actually be awesome. But only if you could earn or trade/craft the cards in game, not buying a bunch of packs
---
Numbers will change based off of boss armor/resist values, but the overall meta that evolved from private servers will remain.
---
Warrior and Rogue on top until Fire mages get their day in the sun.
---
Lol, okay.
---
See you in Vanilla steam rolling through SM on the first try, because that's how it worked.
---
Oh wait.
---
Alright, tell me wise one - how do they outtag me apart from probability through increased player count? What do they have access to that me and a group of my friends could not access?
---
It makes sense you become a hero or "champion" given everything you have done. It just then limits what they can really do with you to keep the adventure feel. Short of killing azeroth and having us move to a brand new planet where no one knows us. Or killing us and azeroth off and having wow 2. I don't see a way out of it.
---
And he will never be forgotten for his commitment - RIP
---
&gt; In Classic, you are a common man doing heroic things

Defeating Ragnaros?
---
Don't be dumb.
---
If anyone is wondering what this zone is... here is your answer :P
---
https://youtu.be/c5G_aoEcwK4
---
I assume it's just a bug and reported it as such, but I wanted to bring it to people's attention.
---
Everything seems to point to horde being more populated this time while the hard raiders are alliance because paladins are amazing. So longer queues for horde against the better geared faction.
---
So the starting zones will be similar to sharding population. But layering tech?
---
I'm just trying to find a place where blizzard has said this. I cant seem to confirm it. But I'd assume this is whT they would do.
---
WOTLK had two shit raid tiers.
---
You are a bit confused on the tech. Layering is server wide, it isn't a zone based tech. So it cannot just be used in starter zones.
---
Sharding is the zone based balancing solution. Though it seems like they may not be using it and just living with less granular balancing of the world through layers.
---
You think the toxicity stops once everyone logs in?
---
Oh, sweet summer child..
---
Something wrong, because a group of 30s hardly could pass the first pack of Myrmidons, let alone reach Herod and defeat it.
---
NPC damage still low
---
Druid numbers are normally limited in raids so you will be kitted extra fast... 5 man healing on a druid is balls without a resurrection (finding a shadow priest friend can help)
---
 While gamer dads like yourself will probably be lvl 15 after few weeks tops, the server will be damaged by most active players farming lotuses and other important mats at increased pace. Also how about stuff like Tidal charm? Stuff that matters and adds a lot of prestige to vanilla.
---
Pretty sure its time of day in server too.
---
Yeah, making it worse, playing in EU timezone. Its mid day in server when its semi dark here. Literally had to run to tauren area to keep playing.
---
Basically it just uses the /who window. But of course because /who is limited to 49 results it has to use a lot of filter commands to get a real number of players without hitting the 49 cap. So basically it will do this
---
*/who r-"human" c-"Warrior 5-5 n-a*
---
That means look for Human Warriors level 5 only with names starting with A
---
Then it will do
---
*/who r-"human" c-"Warrior 5-5 n-b*
---
Which is Human Warriors level 5 only with names starting with A
---
It will do that for every letter of every race and class combination of every character level possible. It will refine itself further if it hits the /who cap, such as searching based on zones, etc.
---
If poeple were merged by the end of phase 1 no one would notice.

RemindMe! 96 days "Classic brightness k"
---
wowinterface has his own section for Classic with already over 25 Addons.  And Tukui released a early beta on their github
---
Have you not changed since you were a teenager? even soda is embarrassed about his old self.
---
Jump it to an hour
---
Going to report this as a BUG. No fucking way it should be as bad at mid day server time as it is. It makes your eyes bleed.
---
Fuck McCuck LUL
---
Fury Warriors are better tanks that Prot Warriors btw.
---
But regardless, what you're not understanding is that such a low uptime on Nightfall means that it's not necessarily better DPS over just having another Warrior doing max DPS.
---
So if you're going to nerf your raid just to have a Nightfall swinger, then you should get the most DPS Nightfaller. Otherwise it's a DPS loss overall. That's the logic.
---
Im home, no closed beta for me!
---
As suspected it turned out to be the retail PTR and Stress test accounts.
---
They feel superior by trying to make retail seem as though it has nothing good. Same with the streamer crap. They want to be outraged because they are jealous and streamers are the easiest target because they can be seen in public. Like the excuses people have made to try and make streamers look like villains baffles me. Streamers are just a handful of people compared to the many non-streamers that got in too.
---
It sounds like the issue from people is that they don't want to compete or be impacted by other players at all.
---
That's it, the cut off can be the Barrens. I know it's 2019, but sometimes things will be inconvenient. If you want to have an easy time where everything is sunshine and rainbows there's always retail.
---
Castlevania 1 &amp; 2
---
People say that about enhance, except resto shams can lay the same totems down, though slightly worse if specced.
---
Lol I joined much later since I was just messing with horde but damn that pop difference was crazy noticeable.
---
Will it increase my dps?
---
But we were not *the* hero. In wotlk Arthas killed us all with a single blow of Frostmourne and only then we got rezzed and the blade destroyed by Tirion
---
Even donations??
---
You’re the one trying to say he played so much in TBC and shit, when the proof just isn’t there. Now you’re trying to back out now that you’re proven to be talking out of your ass.
---
Don’t worry buddy I turned on my interest for classic wow beta day 1 and have still gotten nothing.  I’ve accepted my fate that I have to wait until 8/27 like most others
---
MY DUDE! I CANNOT WAIT TO RUN SCHOLOMANCE AGAIN. EASILY ONE OF MY FAVORITE DUNGEONS IN CLASSIC.
---
Asmon is a bad player, idiot didn't even use shield wall in the fight. Him and Tips really are trash and clearly don't know Vanilla
---
So hunters will be god this stress test? I imagine warlocks would be second best. Anything else that would be super strong at 10 and make exploring easier?
---
&gt; Can you imagine when Classic releases and we can all get lost for hours in Sunken Temple? 
---
Jeesus, that place is confusing. Even having a map doesnt help with all the multiple floors.
---
5 minutes still sounds kinda low. 2 hours or more would be better because it will limit Black Lotus farming.
---
You guys seriously need to cut TipsOut some slack. For it being his first time dueling on a non-instant level 60 server without instant r14 gear and every PvP trinket in the game, he did pretty well.
---
You mean like if it was not a single player game?
---
There will always be a way to exploit some things and if you restrict something too much you won't just affect people that are trying to exploit it.
---
Won't do much if they are locked to it a week if you can just invite them to put them into another layer?
---
For most players, the system will put them on a layer where the majority of their guild is. If you relogg, the same happens, so you'll be always on the same layer. No one forces you to be in a guild though :/
---
Their "L30" isnt what you are going to have at level 30. They are stacked with gear. Its like freshly dinged L60 compared to pre-bis/raid geared L60's.
---
I stayed at Lv. 59 for the longest time because I loved the BGs and knew hitting 60 would make me a peon in gear. If anyone reading this has no intentions to endgame raid, I wonder if it'd be more fun to make a Lv. 59 twink and just be a field general in that bracket.
---
Nobody would watch him for gameplay alone LULW.
---
Him pretending to be a god while he isnt is just his shtick.
---
I will report on forums. Great idea! (Was also thinking of doing bug report for next stress test next week)
---
Since it's using legion and, well, it won't impact others negatively, I wonder if ActionCam is enabled. Thatd be fun for some PvP vids. Probably looks like ass given old spell animations though.
---
&gt; I don't think I've seen a fury warrior actually want to gimp himself like that.
---
Nightfall might be a DPS-loss for the entire raid because you're losing a DPS slot by bringing a Nightfall-swinger. To make up for that DPS loss, you need to have that swinger be the most DPS out of the four possible classes: Warrior, Shaman, Ret, Hunter.
---
Absolutely, and for that I am grateful
---
Honestly I'm so tired of seeing all these posts about toxicity. I have no idea what people are talking about, I have seen almost no toxic behaviour. Any stupid comments have been downvoted to oblivion.
---
It's like calling this sub "toxic" has become some kind of meme where people are just saying it because it's the thing you do. Either that or retail players are the most sensitive snowflakes I've ever come across.
---
&gt;Harry Potter
---
Imo she did that very well though with the prime minister spreading fake news to cling to his power and the pure delusion of large parts of the wizarding community. Totally believable to be honest. I wonder why.
---
Logged in and it took 2 hours to get to level 5. Loved every second of it.
---
Yup, my guild was stuck on Razorgore twice as long as Vael. As a shaman, once we figured out good kiting strategy / earthbind totem placement, we beat him every time after the first kill.
---
I am going to run comparisons next week on the extra stress test. But it’s no secret that the Classic client already runs way better than Retail.
---
If you’re going mage then I’d recommend he chooses a class that can tank or heal to make getting groups easier. Also pick a class with different gear type, eg not cloth. Maybe paladin. If you play the same race you can group from the start otherwise one of you can run to the other start area. 
---
Pick different professions, especially don’t pick the same gathering ones. Otherwise yeah take your time and explore the world, read quests etc, have fun!
---
And also during half term, for those in education (teachers and students)
---
ah so this is why everything on retail has been plummeting in price
---
Oh my goodness, a bug in a beta? A minor annoyance that will last, at most, a few months?
---
Yeah, layering is just fine. I'm not worried.
---
The one true warchief
---
So if I have multiple friends in different guilds, I have to wait for half an hour until I can join another group (not saying that's a day to day use-case) because I can't join their layer?
---
If we have layered servers you have to be able to switch layers, or the "social aspect" of the server dies even more. Other people are right though, without a group (!), you should always land on the same layer for a pretty long time, unless your layer is close to dying (though in that case, the entire layer should be merged with another one).
---
I do not understand I live in EU and my account is EU account, I was connected to play in NA. Howcome you can play in EU?
---
Nope nope nope.
---
No more content after classic please. Don’t trust blizzard not to fuck it up.
---
Merge them at the end of the month.
---
Congrats you are world first complainer about world first memes.
---
2hander and ranged has same hit chance.
---
But glancing blows is HUGE on high lvls.
---
&gt;throw away your legendary weapon that was passed down from some ancient god who you killed by yourself so you can grab some quest greens
---
I always had the most problems with this and that's also why I didn't enjoy new expansions. Everything became worthless overnight.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "/console WeatherDensity 3 /console ffxglow 0"
---
How difficult is it to output ~300-350dps in Vanilla? 
---
I’d assume ~220dps would be enough to kill Vael in three minutes if everyone was alive all the time? So 350dps for each damage dealer should be enough?
---
They should make it so you can only change your layers to a new one in a resting area. Plus add a time limit of 30minutes or something.
---
And you cannot crit.
---
I don't know what's more unrealistic. Buying a game at GameStop or someone wanting to buy BFA.
---
Hahaha exactly! Even with the map it was hard to know exactly where the hell you were going. Place was a goddamn maze but I do miss it. BRD was always pretty confusing too but players have had a long time to learn it now. Gonna be fun man :)
---
I just looked at my [config.wtf](https://config.wtf) of the stress test client and it looks like that is already set if you turn everything up in the graphics, it has SET weatherDensity "3.000000" in it.
---
I've never "subbed" before, but I get my next paycheck next Friday and I'll grab a twitch sub, you're awesome dude. 
---
BTW, I honestly believe that with enough determination and kiting skill you guys could probably take down Princess in Mara. It will be one hell of a grind, but I think it's doable... It'd be getting there that's the problem though but if you guys are clever I think you can do it. In any case, I'm excited to see what you do next.
---
you want to play a single player game so bad there are plenty on the market for you
---
I think healing as those specs is a little different than trying to DPS in those specs, especially as a druid where their main raid utility is in innervate and combat rez. Still pretty impressive to be able to get that far without guild drama from it, but that is definitely not the common scenario in my experience.
---
Just like the first few level 60s not being able to see eachother, that's a shit show to me.
---
Well the internet is filled with sheeps. People who read shit online and are incapable of making an opinion of their own. Yeah BfA sucks, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t done a single thing right, and something Blizzard does consistently well is making raids. I honestly thought almost everyone agreed on that :/
---
Though if people are honestly arguing vanilla PvE hold a candle to literally any other expansion they are delusional.
---
Oh, you didn’t show the part where you got clapped, then regrouped and got clapped again.
---
We had you little babies running from fights all day.
---
Everything? To my understanding even the casuals are interested in minmaxxing and will roll alliance.
---
I'm not gonna make it 3 months boys...
---
Other peolpe in my MMO &gt; No people in my MMO. 
---
Im happy to sit back and wait a day or so if it means there will be no exploiting. Im sorry but I really dont care that the tourists wont be able to play day 1, Anyone who is sticking around will have no issue with a little patience.
---
Fuck dude that's why he looks so familiar
---
There are private server guilds at all stages of content progression on ND which is 3 weeks in to the Naxx patch.  I've seen multiple guilds fall apart due to lack of progress
---
None of what you've written changes the fact that your experience on your scrub server is irrelevant and you're not an authority on bwl
---
considering that pservers have higher armor values than blizzlike, I suspect rogues/warriors will be even more broken than they already are. Maybe fire mages will come close to them with AQ/naxx, but I honestly doubt they'll ever beat them.
---
Back in vanilla we had a small clique channel of people from my local town (all RL friends at start). It somehow grew to the point it was like a national channel. There were ideas of making a national guild for a long time, until stuff sort of aligned and people in 3 guilds were unhappy at the same time, so they all quit their guilds and a new one formed.
---
It was suppose to be a casual national guild, however what nobody expected was that more people quit those 3 guilds and wanted to join ours. So turned out we became an international hardcore raiding guild instead.
---
Not Hawthorne
---
So you guys exploited the shit out of bwl by cascading multiple IDs a week?
---
Testing how the tech is able to phase people around, and in which cases it may missbehave, is stupid? You WILL change layers if someone invites you. You WILL change layers if you change your guild. And very likely you might change layers if your layer becomes insanely small and it gets merged into another layer, though AFAIK they never said how that behaves. They're testing the tech.
---
They've clearly explained how it's supposed to work. Yes they first wanted sharding, and it was controversial and tons of people hated it. So they decided to create a completely new tech as a compromise, and you believe they'll change that entire tech in the last 2 months? While still actively testing it? Yeah, no way.
---
Just so everyone knows, there was a lot of extra money flowing in from being at level cap. 
---
When you're at cap, you get extra money instead of experience. So at level 5 people were getting a lot more money that normal.
---
Isn't that assuming there is an ability to pay for that item at that point though? There won't be many people with enough gold to fuel the demand for them to hit that level of gold that quickly
---
They said in yellow server messages they're going to activate and test layering. I imagine they played with that in all the possible ways they could, in order to put the tech under heavy testing and observe the results. They won't be able to experiment on live servers.
---
Didn't you watch the video?
---
Eh there are probably plenty of people that wait with recruiting until we have infos on server/realms etc... 
---
I plan to raid "hardcore" (lol) but i haven't even searched for anything yet. Bet there are plenty people like me.
---
Ah the old Asmongold strat
---
Hey, I'm on the Orgrimmar screenshot!
---
Holy shit dude, they invited streamers to show off their new technology. They are literally prodcasting it to hundreds of thousands of people. They obviously think it's pretty close. The fact that so many people are on here not just accepting whatever blizzard says about layering despite what we see, but y'all are actively trying to shutdown any concern or questions about layering. It's insane. I normally think it's ridiculous to talk about paid shills, but why the fuck are people defending a company so hard? Especially one with the track record of blizz/Activision.
---
yeah but nobody cares about it in retail. Blizzard will fix this for classic
---
Yeah, it's definitely not because Classic is right around the corner or anything. XD
---
I still like how you both say it's going to be easy while arguing that I'm wrong for saying it's easy. My word you can perform some mighty mental gymnastics in the pursuit of arguing over the internet.
---
Nice Ad Hominem there bud. 
---
Again I ask. If you are just leveling in wow, taking your time and enjoying the game for what it is, how can you expect to compete with Johnny Nolife that plays 16 hours a day for months at a time?
---
How is Johnny Nolife's lead from being a no-life neckbeard any different than Jimbob somehow abusing layering at JUST the right time to be the one who gets the lotus spawns (bearing in mind there WILL be about 100 Jimbobs with the same idea so its pretty fucking likely it wont happen). 
---
The answer is in practice there is no difference. That's how mmorpgs work. The more time you invest, the more mechanics you learn to abuse, the farther ahead you are from the casuals that are just having fun. On top of that and back to the original argument about server clusters, 
---
*WHAT ABOUT THE SERVERS THAT MERGE?*
---
There could be Johnny Nolifes and Jimbobs abusing a low pop server by creating a devilsaur/blacklotus mafia to stockpile them in prep for the inevitable merger. Following which they will dump their stock and crash the economy on post-merger server.
---
Now stop acting like a spoiled fucking drama queen that had her weekly brunch ruined when fucking Brenda started crying about her fat niece.
---
SHills gonna shill
---
False dilemma. You're presenting the problem as though there are only two options "Do as I say or be a failure for the rest of your life"; there are other options.
---
One of them being just creating enough servers to handle the population like every other mmo does during launch and then merging the dead servers together.
---
This totally solves the phasing issues and depletes queue times to their bare minimum. That being said, I'd rather experience long queue times than phasing because afterall - sacrificingthe  authenticity of the mmorpg experience for convenience is what gave us retail in the first place.
---
The title of a real man imo. Ill take trogg slayer over grand marshall any day
---
It is funny that i can't remember peoples names who i met 9 seconds ago at work or school but character names of guild mates from 10 years ago instantly comes to my mind.
---
Who on earth would care what layer they're in unless they're trying to exploit it? 
---
As long as you can go to your friends layer via group invite, there is absolutely no inconvenience to locking people in layers
---
Or keep it because for some reason a large volume of players didn't quit and managed to hit 60.
---
Can I just take some time to praise the construction of this meme, the wording is excellent. 
---
The first image is "No beta" pure and simple.. "I don't have beta access" As many can relate to this part, the vast majority. It starts out strong with a cut and clear message grabbing many people. Alright now we are in on the meme... or are we?.. because no beta? Well I do technically got beta, just stress test.. No worries the meme got you covered.. 
---
Second image, "stress test.. nope" it's a brilliant wording seen too little in memes.. You could reason it with luck, but that doesn't take anything away from the wording.. Some people will read this as "I don't even have stress test either.." while others will read this as "While I do have stress test, it's a nope for me. Doesn't feel right, not the real game." This allows for the meme to catch a broader audience and resonates with more people.
---
The third image finalizes a feeling that all of the above share and have in common, as you don't find other games fun any more. Which is why many people would naturally feel because they just stated their desire for classic, and this inches onto the final text at the bottom. Creating its very own little foreshadowing of what is to come.
---
Fourth and final image, the one thing everyone here has done, wether it be just once out of curiosity or just a fanatic daily ritual. All who's already on board have checked their battle net, just to see if they got "the" beta. This wording allows little to imagination as it quote us of our exact actions, as a collective group. 
---
The final text needs no context or explanation, as everyone is aware of meaning of the date.
---
Well... mostly I just wanted to praise the 2nd image wording in context to the others.. brilliant.. 
---
That said, I am not sure if it's ripped off of other memes, but I like it none the less.
---
Wish you all a great day.
---
And then that 1 rogue you pugged rolls 100 on CHT.
---
&gt;Oldschool wow had dead servers and nobody cared.
---
That's a no for me. Everyone cared. People begged Blizzard to merge servers. Free server transfers were offered away from popular towards dead realms. Blizzard actively fought the issue.
---
&gt; It ruins the purpose of massive multiplayer online games and is what made wow so fuckin awesome in the old days. 
---
There's nothing awesome about dead servers. Nothing. Layering will last for a few months to deal with the initial amount of players and will soon be gone.
---
https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/169/Strawman-Fallacy
---
RemindMe! 95 days "add"
---
We don't know that. Private servers base their armor values on some beast lore off of maexxna. Maexxna could be a low armor boss. We found out that armor values were not normalized so some bosses on private servers could be undertuned and others could be overtuned.
---
Oh look, again you're talking about a subject you know nothing about
---
I love them, but it would've been cool if they joined the Alliance and the tensions between them and the other factions was explored. Especially the Night Elves, for obvious reasons, and the Humans, who many Belfs would probably dislike for the whole abandonment and attempted genocide thing. Alliance is missing the politics from WC2. Their close proximity to the Forsaken, and relationship with Sylvanas would have added some extra intrigue too. Horde could've had goblins or ogres or something instead. While we're taking hypotheticals, they could maybe also not make Kael'thas into such a big dickhead.
---
That's exactly what layering does, so why have layering then?
---
Since you specifically mentioned dps I assume you don't mean healers.
---
Warriors: Have to sometimes tank. Bringing a lot of tanks so that you have one for every encounter that needs multiple tanks is silly, so fury warriors have to equip tanking gear to tank trash and even some bosses(notably: majordomo/garr, Razorgore &amp; nef waves and ofc 4HM). 
---
Rogues: The only utility they bring is putting down traps in suppression room BWL, and in AQ there's a couple of encounters where mind numbing posion is useful.
---
Warlock: Banishing in MC is a big part. Summons soulstones and putting down their curse is a constant.
---
Mage: Sheeping some packs, ranged interupt with counterspell.
---
Hunter: Like you said, a lot of kiting when you are doing progression, they also have to tranq which honestly I think is super easy but yet somehow people think it's impressive and some fail to do it.
---
still beta btw 4Head. Idk if you play retail but this mentality is really terrible when it comes to Blizzard. If people aren't up in arms about something as soon as possible they will literally never fix/change it
---
X alt accounts in guilds glued to different layers, ready to invite to power shift between them. Easy.
---
Or a discord server for your faction and server and a simple add-on to keep track and rotate invites.
---
We don't get to see the enemies bar lol
---
You're acting as if the only options is to have either layering or suffer unplayability. This is simply not true. Layers are just more servers that are automatically created with player population. Know that, Blizzard COULD just make 6x the servers and merge the dead ones. Because merging dead layers is essentially the exact same thing as merging dead servers.
---
Yeah, during layering tests. They said they test the tech. Look through the last weeks of footage from streamers. They're NOT constantly sharded/layered. That never happened apart from the very beginning, where Blizzard acknowledged it as a bug.
---
What are you on about? Vanilla is easy as fuck, or do you seriously think SM is some kind of uber elite endgame instance? delusional classic players lmao
---
Layering is flat out inferior to sharding. Sharding would be limited to a few low level zones. Layering is the entire world.
---
People on the dead servers definitely cared about the dead servers
---
The numbers will be very similar. Near enough that they won't make a huge or really any difference to class selection. We're not going to suddenly work out that balance druid and shadow priest are amazing raid dps'ers and pallys are the best tanks.
---
I remember beeing bored in Vanille at night and someone came up with the idee to do Herod(we were only 3 People around lv 35)Mage and 2 Palas it was an epic experience to hear 3 guys screaming in fear of herods aggro like little girls lol
---
Chewie, we're [going] home.
---
Oh wow, classic wow being hard? How can anyone even fathom the notion!
---
Well Huhuran was kinda of a guild killer as well
---
From playing the stress test the layering was activated. I got put into a different layer a couple of times for no apparent reason which is very game breaking and doesnt feel good.
---
I hope at the end of the stress tests they got a tech working so that you never experience having a mob or people disappear infront of you.
---
Layering is temporary
---
I mean they’ve only made some of the most critically acclaimed pc games of all time and have original developers working on this project, if anyone wouldn’t fuck it up, it’d be blizzard. That said, wod, legion and bfa.
---
I've only gotten up there once out of 100 tries. Please teach us the way senpai.
---
yea but have u ever killed herod, didnt think so champ
---
I still have my original wow manual. It was as thick as a novella and most of the information was downright incorrect because they were already printed during the alpha and things changed.
---
The guild I was in used an incredibly complicated bid system that worked obscenely well.
---
DKP was awarded for boss kills, or hours of attempts on unbeaten content.  Bonus dkp for first boss kills, and we offered a bounty on world bosses. You got bonus dkp if you spotted one up, and we got the kill.  
---
The only things decided by LC were legendaries, resist gear, and recipes, and legendaries carried a massive DKP cost, they weren't just free.  Also, there were class/spec restrictions added to a lot of items to prioritize raid progression (which as a hunter, I loathed.  Silithid Claw was the first decent hunter weapon that hunters were allowed to bid on in tier)
---
Minimum bids were kept low, with the cost halved for non-current tier content, and officers reserved the right to lower the minimum on items in current tier if they were obviously poor items (everything was new, so we didn't know what mobs were going to drop). And it used pretty much single bid, blind proxy bidding (you bid in a whisper to the officer running loot, and the final cost to you is just enough to beat the next person if you won).
---
All of that was pretty straight forward, but where it became interesting was....
---
If bids were within 20 points of each other, it wasn't a clear cut win. You had to do weighted rolls for it.  If Bob bid 100 and Bill bid 110, then Bob rolled 1-100 and Bill rolled 51-100. 
---
That seems weird but, it meant there was way less pressure on people to hoard dkp by letting upgrades rot.
---
You would be wrong. Undead zone was only survivable in groups. Getting 20 or however many tags on the zombies was impossible if you were a slower first cast class. For collecting quests it still seems smarter to group and just change loot settings because you will still get xp from them killing mobs since you can’t really rotate around and have to camp just a spawn or two.
---
At least on ND armor values on bosses has never been accurate. It wasn't the goal, more or less all the bosses have buffed hp/armor to make raiding more fun. A guy looked at specifically KT some time ago because he found a video where he can see kick damage(which is flat so you can calculate armor), and he found KT to have about 1k less armor on vanilla than ND, and the developers say time after time that they just buff it after what's necessary.
---
This is basic statistics, not the economy, you'd do well to familiarise yourself with such simple concepts.
---
Blizzard had a poll for this and horde heavily outnumbered alliance. This reflects much of the sentiment I'm seeing.
---
Watching everyone get angry as they ran through the portal only to load back into the blasted lands lol, was quality fun :)
---
Why does the world HAVE to be unplayable without sharding/layering? They could just create enough servers to handle the population and merge the dead ones after a few months, which is what merging dead layers basically is minus the terrible vanilla killing asoects of phasing. Pro-phasers always have the same arguement, "we NEED sharding". No we don't. How does any other MMO handle crazy launch day populations? By opening enough servers.
---
[Return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK0KwlQOGEI) part 2 would be freaking amazing.
---
The guy who animated the first one got hired by blizzard to animate their in-engine cinematics, so the [sequel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyFEPZ5MpK8) never happened.
---
Would you keep wanting to play on your private server that's destined to be permanently shut down 3 months? Not many people are going to want to keep on pushing raids when faced with that deadline? I know I wouldn't. It's why I stopped playing private servers. Hell, it's part of why original Naxx was really never a big thing for the majority of players prior to TBC. They knew it was going to be going way in a few months.
---
I was referring to the boss and the enraged myrmidons. Each block could potentially save 200hp in dmg. He would've saved alot of mana for the healer. Also he kept trying to demo shout the packs but it always resisted. Aggro was indeed an issue but it could be handled quite differently :) Oh and since ranged weps cant glancing blow, it would've been better to spam shoot Herod when he WWed. But all in all this was a blast to watch and obviously everyone has a huge learning curve still in classic :)
---
Being drunk makes them extrapolate
---
They said there will be no crossrealm in classic. That's like 50% of the reason people actually want classic and it would instantly kill the entire community.
---
Avoiding server merging is like half the reason why layering exists. 
---
No one wants this, merging dead realms with healthy ones is not a good an option.
---
Was there watching people reload intto blasted lands everytime they jumped through lol
---
Looks like a buffalo hot wing ultra brightness
---
Glancing blow chance is always 40%, weapon skill only changes how much damage they do
---
Not BigRandy.  BigRandy the people's champ.
---
I won't touch retail after Classic comes out until the next expansion.
---
There are already confirmations that mobs at higher levels in private servers are not using abilities they would in classic, to compensate the private server increase the damage or armor values. These variations will be the difference, and the damage will still be relatively the same. So classic will be "harder" but also more fun
---
&gt;F&amp;F
---
what is FF?
---
Now that's the crossover im waiting for
---
Shamans get kited and fucked more by good players than ret does so Idk where you get this from
---
&gt;From my experience as enhance i was able to defeat every class in duels, i had only trouble with mages
---
you can watch the whole video, he does a chest above afterwards.
---
Wow I too started when I was 12 in Vanilla and stopped at the beginning of MoP.
---
Would be interesting, but only after extended time of NAXX. Maybe on opt in basis that the purist can stay raiding naxx forever if they like.
---
If they get in via F&amp;F from one of their viewers, how do you think they got invited by Blizzard?
---
I'm going to have a second account just for AH stuff because why the fuck not. In the stress test if you invited someone to your party they would join your layer, and I think guilds are bound to layers right? So at minimum I can have my second account join another guild that is on another layer and then invite my main to party to switch from my main layer to alt layer.
---
Talkin about a guy who always looks visibly confused all the time while playing, I’m not surprised at all he lost.
---
Asmon did a good job of calling that actually
---
this is what i would have done if i had stress test, just run around doing all the exploits
---
Yes and any other MMO has the same issues when you have to many servers, you have dead realms that you have to merge and then cause people to have to rename and lose all this "identity/community" people care about in vanilla. Including having to deal with a fucked economy post merge. I'm sure there's more reasonings that get posted in response to a "just have more servers". Its definitely not the same as merging layers minus phasing.     
---
Also I don't think any other MMO has the kind of hype that classic has, could be wrong but I haven't seen any come close
---
Are you sure? I have seen old vanilla Razorgore tactic videos and the dragonkin battleshout threat warrior kiting was definetly a thing
---
They said "play session" logging in and out of a character is a new "play session". This is intended and its the problem we have all been talking about for the last month whilst being told to shut up.
---
You control the difficulty by doing dungeons at whatever gear and level you feel comfortable. After a couple of raids (ie week 2/3 for hardcores) really all 5man content in the game is trivialised. In a way that sucks, but that's Vanilla. By the time you're clearing BWL and AQ, you can 3 man all the 5 man lvl 60 dungeons no problem at all. In Naxx gear you can 5 man Onxyia.
---
Sure, but it actually had content unlike WoD...
---
Resto Druid. Full tier sets before any other class and always useful even if they aren't the best healers.
---
My friend on layer 1 invites me back.
---
&gt; Still in beta
---
lmao
---
Trying to explain this to the blizz defence force in 2019 is pointless but dont worry daddy blizz knows what is best :)
---
Had full Pala T2, never got the pants, even though they already dropped from ragnaros and were available a loot sooner than the rest of T2. What a time :D.
---
Not even reading past the first sentence, just about done with this
---
Maybe on classic you'll clear bwl before 1.10 ROFL
---
Makes perfect sense to prioritize streamers when you have limited spots.
---
1 player = 1 player
---
1 streamer = 1 player and xxxx viewers that get some experience of vanilla. 
---
Imagine if there was no streamers on the beta at all, and it was only a thousand random players. How little you would know about the beta, how little you would have seen.
---
Have you got any evidence for this claim?
---
If this was an M+ no one would be watching it because no one cares at all about retail
---
World record is 4 days 20 hours on a hunter. The fastest leveling class ingame.
---
NE priest, a little under 2 hr. I dont like to be rude and snipe mobs. Grouped up for some, solo'd others. The area was packed. People were either running around in circles or just camping a specific spot. Also didnt remember where certain quests were, so wandered a bit. Killed the wrong mobs sometimes.
---
Unless the future stress tests show them lowering layer cap to thin the zones a bit, I'll probably just be waiting a few hours after release to start. I'd rather just avoid the rush and feeling rushed.
---
who cares you still get to play in on release.
---
You're being absurd, there is no world in which you will have to wait weeks to kill 3 boars, at worst you would only have to wait in queue for a while. The population cap of the server would stay 3k no matter what. And if there is too high of a demand for servers to handle, Blizzard devs themselves have said in multiple interviews that they are more than willing to create more servers to accommodate the population. 
---
Afterall, high demand for your game is a good problem to have, from a business AND a consumer's perspective in this scenario. Having a lot of people trying to play the game increases the chance it will survive a long time. What **isn't** a good problem to have is hardcore vanilla fans being put off by phasing to the extent that they don't play. Sharding/layering is not a smart idea no matter how you cut it.
---
I played it on my laptop from 2011. It has a second gen i5, 8GB RAM and a GT555M  1GB video card, apart from the ram and cpu it's a potato nowadays technically. I played on lowest but I think my cpu throttled because the poor thing ran 90 degrees. Anyway, it was playable on lowest xD.

This is why I'll be rolling Horde in Classic despite being Alliance in retail.
---
get out of here with this logic non sense!
---
We all just purchased these pitchforks, let us use them.
---
Groups servers togther and make them have a name pool. No character name change needed. "But I saw XXpoonslazyer on the other realm and wanted that name so I rerolled on this realm" Oh well?
---
It's almost like blizzlike vanilla private servers don't exist
---
 not only can you farm with an alt on different layers like in the video any time you are about to die both PVP or PVE you can jump to a new layer and escape. i tested it on the stress test its complete garbage.
---
As you can see his name is Alyse-ClassicAlpha so he is not from the beta, maybe from the blizzard closed alpha.
---
Nope,  Mages are by far the fastest lvlers if you have a dedicated route.
---
If you go standard, hunters, locks and druids are faster. But if you are AoE lvling mages reach 60 in about 15 hours less than hunters, which was confirmed by Joana
---
No shit lol you dont seem to know much about anything but you sure like to post a lot
---
#Blizz add /Console Crtform 1 plz
---
Well it wasnt too bad in NE zone, but in human that's what I did.
---
i think he gets excited and forgets about that stuff.  all of chat was trying to tell him that his gun was hitting for much more than his hammer.
---
4d chess he made it more exciting on purpose?  he does definitely have a sense of production, it's hidden for the most part though.
---
In BRD there is a windows slit at the shadowforge lock (which closes the big gate). Only gnomes can jump through it. It's just a little shortcut, nothing else.
---
besides, bgs, but I mean we can't have people slightly inconvenienced by queue times, can we?
---
RemindMe! 90 days
---
Dkp with a non rotating roster of 45-50 players. 
---
10 rogues is entirely too many for your core team, that’s 1/4 of your raid if they are all in. 
---
If you are in a guild with 10 rogues on roster? Just /random 100.
---
If it’s a tight roster and everyone there sees the game the same way (Ie their intent to clear content, Pve to PvP, pre raid farm, etc., interest in gear v progress for progresses sake) then dkp or loot council work great. Both systems aim to achieve the same goal—distribute raid loot to the greatest benefit for the raid. Dkp gives raiders agency, loot council aims to take away the invisible hand of 40 self interests and make the correct decision for the raid. 
---
Loot drops slowly in classic. And it isn’t that important. Rag will be killable in dungeon blues. We will have months—years to get his loot. I’m not worried about corruption or collusion—if I trust my team—and I’ll always take the choice that leads to agency and more choice, so I choose dkp.
---
God I dislike Esfand...
---
Right. Although it will be like that, no matter what, when they remove layering. Personally, I dont mind taking a little longer to quest, if I can be playing in the one, unified, *world* of warcraft.
---
Awesome! Just what I needed to hear 😊
---
Did 8 years of World of Hordecraft on Retail make you addicted to being the dev teams focus 24/7?
---
Thrall went down twice, surprisingly we were able to get Patchwerk down by just enough we could see his health bar move after about 20 minutes of kiting him to Anduin. The server got shut down a couple minutes after, when they spawned a bunch of Guardians of Blizzard.
---
I'm not sure we can compare a 8-11k pserver pop to a 3-5k Blizz classic one.
---
I'm afraid prices are going to be more expensive than that, just because there will be less players so less resources.
---
I mean, you gotta look at it from a longevity perspective. PVP has way more longevity than PVE. So of course, if I play on a private Server for 2-3 years or more eventually the only thing left is to go to PVP, so after some time you think its the only thing that matters.
---
for sure!

Hi, /u/Cpandrej
---
it works in pvp aswell you can layer jump anytime you are close to death, just have a fresh lvl 1 invite you to group and phase out.
---
Looking forward to people like you shitting up the Classic experience!
---
They removed the fullscreen option either in legion or bfa, I don't remember which. You may need to find a third party solution of some sort to pin your mouse to your active monitor
---
Just sit on your stockpile until people can afford it. While continuing to farm more and pvp'ing down any competition
---
Supply and demand. Demand will always be high you just have to control the supply
---
It’s hard to say. I’m not in the closed beta and my memory is 14 years old, but I do remember the effect being pretty strong. I liked it at the time because it softened the edges and heightened the color. It required a decent GPU to run well.
---
Hardcore guilds already plan on makong multiple guilds for themself during the leveling so eazy gabk escape etc. Once all 60 they unite. Its lame and hope blizz will come up with a fix.
---
You could actually add extra ground clutter beyond the slider's limit with console commands in vanilla. It was a system drain, though.
---
Horde is cooler, argument over

(I expect this comment to be downvoted a lot hence proving my point :p )
---
&gt; Let's stop acting like Vanilla WoW was so easy. 
---
Is this a joke? WoW was the easiest released MMO of its era. People who came over from EQ and DAoC laughed about how piss-easy it easy to roll through content.
---
Just because WoW was your first MMO as a kid and you were bad at gaming at the time doesn't mean WoW was ever hard.
---
elwynn was burnt to the ground
---
the first edition of d&amp;d did this. then they get sued by the feminist movement and now its the same and no i'm not joking.
---
In point.i Dezember my Guild having MC,ZG,AQ20 clear ans on easy mode Farm but we NEVER were able to down the First Boss in BWL.After weeks and weeks of wiping de slowly realised that we just coud Not Beat it with our rooster.After that realisation the Guild felt apart in like 2 weeks.
---
The [islands](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/South_Seas_islands) south of Tanaris were totally legit though, or did you mean the underwater houses?
---
Disturbed discovery on repeat
---
&gt; it would've been cool if they joined the Alliance
---
they were in the alliance before vanilla.
---
Thank you now
---
The vael fight was also the harbinger of "things to come"; fights that had the potential to be really easy, or really hard, based on the random number generator.
---
You could have vael on farm for 6 weeks and then wipe three times in a row because of a bad adrenaline order.
---
You could roll through Chrommagus on your first night only to not even see nefarian the next week because a generous RNG the week before gave you a bunch of unearned confidence.
---
Most, if not all, of the fights in MC were "yours to lose" if you had a gear level and class mix to beat them.  There was a baseline difficulty that you could only increase through mistakes.   
---
But the biggest thing, in my opinion, that made vael a guild breaker, was that the time limit on him meant that, not only did you not have a lot of time to attempt him (or time to pop into lbrs for the FR buff), but more importantly, you didn't have time during the raid to really dive into why wiped, because the clock was ticking.  Fighting vael when you haven't yet beaten him is like trying to get to sleep with insomnia; where you're so obsessed with staring at the clock and seeing how much sleep you're going to get tick down, that you can't relax enough to fall asleep.
---
Remind me! 96 days "member"

Took more like 6 hours for me. Spent the first two frantically trying to get in. Then went to dinner for about 3 hours. And then took about another hour after I got home before I was finally able to log in. Still beat waiting 12 hours to log into Illidan at BFA launch 😭

The "classic team" are the same guys that worked on retail... you retail players are the exact reason why WoW became so bad "it's only beta trust blizzard garrisons/artifact power/talent trees/ashran/insert whatever bs change blizz made won't be so bad they will fix it, naysayers are toxic; ridicule, downvote them into oblivion and silence their warnings so that Blizzard has 0 incentive to actually change these things!" Idk where this boot licking attitude comes from with you guus, maybe it's Stockholm syndrome after being abused for all these years but how would it hurt Blizzard to ask them to find alternative routes? Do you think they are offended by constructive criticism and feedback? Get real, for classic to survive they NEED these things.
---
Was there a summoning stone? I saw one on asmongold's stream and I don't think they were in the game yet.
---
RemindMe! 96 days “good graphics yo”
---
That's a bummer. Hmu if you do tho, a wave went out tonight
---
12 and unmarried? Filthy casual.
---
Ion literally said they will have phased layering out completely by when they have added the first world boss (kazzak). "But you can't trust them, blizzard always lies!!!" Well go play on private server then
---
&gt; but if you guys are clever
---
Just roll on every weapon, press your buttons, and turn off your pet's growl.  Hunters are notoriously easy to play because they're actually pretty easy to play.
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much, when I played in vanilla the server I was on had more alliance than horde you just have to learn to avoid them, in all honesty you won't just have 40man raids running about tanking people for the hell of it. this was my biggest gripe about warmode it wasn't like being on a PvP server it was like walking in to a battle ground on you own
---
That's one of the 2 controversy articles. in the other one Ion said that post-content is out of the question. I wish blizzard just shows up and say something on the matter.
---
So why not allow cheating and botting too, if it doesn't affect you?
---
Your comparisons of fury = tanks isnt true for most guilds, and some of the top end guilds dont use Nightfall because they stack fury Warriors and rogues, so it doesnt even apply in those situations. If you wanted to say the off tanks are fury specced it should be mentioned. Otherwise, fury Warriors are DPS Warriors in DPS gear.
---
 I agree that the Nightfall swinger should go a person who loses the least amount of DPS, hence my original example.
---
Using your own example with fury Warriors serving as off tanks is just another argument for giving it to a hunter since the fury warrior will lose more DPS equpping Nightfall than the Hunter would, because in situations where the fury warr is swinging Nightfall he would be better off with his own DPS weapons.
---
Tl:dr: Assuming your offtanks are fury specced, they lose more DPS equpping Nightfall than their hunter counterparts.
---
What does merging dead layers solve that merging dead servers does not, pray tell?
---
Thank you for your answer. Can u explain me, what do you mean by "SoC doesn't work properly in pservers? how it works on pservers and how it should work in retail classic? Should it be higher dmg or ?
---
i heard that armor reducing abilities stacked the wrong way on pservers, so in raids bosses had 0 armor anyway. dunno if that's true.
---
Nah, I have several I like. I'm tired of the obsessive portion of the community that follows them though.
---
For the Fallen Dreams, While She Sleeps, and Architects probably. I may be someone who doesn't want very many changes at all but fuck me I'm not listening to Linkin Park and other early - mid 2000s bands lmao.
---
Classes have been boiled down so much now. I hate playing most of them since they're all just two or three buttons with occasional cooldowns. I used to enjoy leveling alts and seeing how the different classes played and now most of them just feel samey and unfulfilling.
---
Because he's trying to be counter-culture and cool
---
And they weren't during.
---
I thought gamestop died like 5-7 years ago but nope, people actually still go there.
---
I’m not sure if you say that because you simply like classic more or what...but blizzard does very much care about this sort of thing in retail. Don’t you remember the crack down on realm hopping Addons and such?
---
Pretty sure OP is not on the same skill level as Joanna.
---
for the horde.
---
That's fair, I just think it'd be a lot longer than just a little, and something I'd rather avoid with dealing with. I don't mind there being a bunch of people waiting for spawns and being able to do stuff, I'd just rather avoid the complete hellhole of 100+ in a small zone or something like that
---
That's just cross server with extra steps
---
They said first come first serve isn't a thing so might get an invite still, I imagine they will stop al08l invites on May 30th.
---
shit dude are you telling me the tech didn't work right during the beta test?
---
Much better than the alternative shit shows of either having way too many servers or an impossibly crowded launch.
---
That was a player from the Alpha server (closed to employees and close friends) who was sharded/layered into the Beta server. There was a lot of testing and tweaking on the stress test which had Stress Test players on Beta server and Alpha to Beta it seems.
---
Cool video! Thanks
---
My only solace is that I am not a fan of PvP and every streamer seems to be obsessed with it, which means by default I won't be playing on any of their PvP servers and they will likely never be playing on mine.
---
You could whisper people on the beta server and even the level 48 alpha server by adding the server name much like in retail. 
---
Given that, I think it’s possible to whisper anyone in a different layer on the same server.
---
The only reason it didn't work every time is because there probably weren't enough people on the server to even create layers. But when launch happens u can bet ur butt that every timenyou log off one of the thousands of people logging in every second will instantly take your spot and you will be transferred to a different layer when you log in again.
---
Since JRE hasn't been live for a few weeks I'll be cherry picking episodes between now and then and just making a 40 hr playlist lol
---
RemindMe! 96 days do it
---
Okay, then we can settle on an agreement: If your guild is serious enough, they won't be doing Nightfall bullshit and will have Fury-specced off-tanks. 
---
If your guild isn't hardcore and isn't speccing their MT/OT as Fury, then give it to either an Enhancement Shaman or a Ret Paladin (if available)—otherwise give it to a Hunter.
---
This looks so much better!
---
my problem is while streamers do generate some interest in the game it's not going to be loads of players that weren't already going to get the game, you're going to watch the stream because you're interested in classic you're not going to become interested in classic from watching the stream. so all it is really doing is lining the streamers pockets not blizzards, and in some cases the steamer acts like a fucking 2 year old and brings nothing to the beta, don't get me wrong a lot of them are fantastic for bug finding and testing but some are just morons with a camera
---
I always thought razergore had the nickname of “Guildbreaker” more then Vael had.
---
Thank you.
---
If I was gonna be a healer I'd go paladin if I was gonna do PvP beside healing. The only reason I'd go priest would be to mind controlling people into lava. 
---
To me paladin offers much more as a healer in terms of fun. Have a warrior buddy and heal/cleanse/freedom him to dominate horde in PvP.
---
I actually prefer to be the smaller community, better queue times for BGs and things get boring when you dont bump into the other faction. 
---
Ally are quoted as better pve (and more aesthetically pleasing.. ) and horde are the go-to for pvp so itll be hard to predict which faction ends up larger than the other. I suggest rolling the faction you feel most at home with and enjoy what comes of it!
---
&gt;So which is it? Is p2w content or advantage? Cuz you are kinda moving the goalposts here.
---
​its the same thing  
---
being able to buy variety of champions that have different tools and strengths each patch is p2w
---
26th in NA and I'm so excited :) 6pm launch and I'll probably beat login server boss by 8pm!
---
Remindme! 96 days ditto
---
&gt; pretty sure most streamers will be forced onto a pve server.
---
No, basically every "big name" WoW streamer right now (Just click the twitch category and pick out the top 20) are 100% PvP obsessed and are basically known for their PvPing, there is no chance in hell they will be going on anything but a PvP server, regardless of harassment.
---
!remindme 96 days
---
Why can’t you post the screenshot without the shitty overused meme?
---
It can't waaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
---
I'd say STV is more fountain
---
Well how does literally any other mmo handle it? By creating enough servers to accommodate the population and merging the dead ones
---
Alliance will get rolled for a bit then it will balance then they'll get rolled for the rest of the time.
---
Yes they have like 2 people in total remaining from that time... Also Activision. Nothing they made post WoTLK is anything but average. Except SC2.
---
Having engineers of old working on Classic, and having the actual gameplay designers are 2 entirely different cases.
---
It's like trusting Bioware with making a good Mass Effect as of today, because ME 1-3 were excellent.
---
Its shit but I upvoted for the reference haha
---
streamers didn't exist when vanilla was first out and it was popular enough to speak a game that has lasted 15 years, do you honestly think streamers are bringing anything to the game that wasn't already there, except a few idiots that think people like asmongold are normal
---
If you worry about it, just go PVE server and it doesnt matter at all.
---
I got that drop once and sold it for mad money. I farmed the shit out of SFK for weeks after that and never saw it again.
---
dude, after 1 month layering is GONE :D
---
Yes, I agree.
---
Idk, as enh only mage could kite me, but with frostshocks i could get close to them, also with engi tools like stunnade, helm, reflector. But these are only duels, idk what happens i wpvp, but i think they can escape from me. As ret i cant get close to mages, even with freedom, i have no slow for them, and even if i could get close to them, if soc not proc i just hit an absorb shield and thn he just nova, slow and ran away, also im getting oom realy fast. I played with full r14 set, with deep ret spec 11/9/31, maybe i should play spellpower gear instead of melee, idk. Thank you for your answer
---
Heard today was friends and family, no?
---
So any streamers friends that wanted in got in. 
---
Pretty cool that we'll get to watch first time wow players playing the closed beta!
---
Oh don't forget the streamers that will still shit on the game while playing it :)
---
Yeah there's a lot of things you can come up with that gives you an advantage.
---
&gt;old school wow had dead servers and nobody cared.
---
Hold up. You couldn’t be more wrong. I played on a dead server as a broke teenager and I hated it. I’m frightened of playing on a dead server again but at least now I can afford a transfer off if it happens.
---
Yeah it's not going to be easy on Day 1, you'll spend 20mins just finding 10 Wolves to kill.
---
I've wanted Ogres to be playable since I first encountered them.
---
And there's a little bit of broken isles + Outland mixed in there IIRC
---
So much so that Blizzard simulated one dealing with the quest dot not displaying correctly or something.
---
lvl 45 is around halfway XP wise, who judges progress in this game by how many zones you have done lol?
---
It was the same at Vanilla beta : a majority of the interested players were going Horde.
---
Then the game was released, the casuals came and the ratio was 80A / 20H ...
---
Don't forget that Blizzard added the Blood elves in TBC to make horde more attractive.
---
I expect it to be a bit more balanced this time, but still more alliance than horde except on a few top PVP servers where the ratio will be more like 45A / 55H.
---
As for me, I started the game as a Tauren warrior but my friends told me I could not play with them since they were alliance. So I rolled a dwarf warrior on their PVE server.
---
Months later they stopped playing. I could not raid any more and the ratio A/H was so bad that there were no BGs for alliance.
---
So I rerolled horde on a PVP server and never looked back. At the end of Vanilla, I'd say (number pulled of my ass) 30% of hordies were former alliance members that decided to balance the game since the A/H ratio was so broken.
---
Way too many servers? You understand that layers are just servers within a server, right? And what would be wrong with having enough servers to accommodate the launch pop? Where is the negative? Because after all - there is virtually NO difference in merging dead layers and merging dead servers.
---
It's not no people though lol, stop exaggerating. There were multiple layers in this very stress test which you could tell from all the various reports of bosses people were seeing at the same time, and in each of those layers it was absolutely packed with players. 
---
Does it really matter that much if you see random player #1380 vs random player #2052 in an a literal ocean of bodies? 
---
"exploiting", give me a break, most of these 'exploits' are incredibly minor and could easily be fixed without outright removing the system. 
---
Also can we talk about for your solution for layers is that you would rather have the game be literally unplayable for its release than be layered? And to give it to the 'tourists' because who as a fan of a game would ever want new players to experience it for the first time, NO, it should be centered around you.
---
You are selfish, an idiot, and a prick. Thank fuck that blizzard does not listen to a lot of this communities suggestions.
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com/
---
Maybe you'll find some more goalposts to move and make more assertions against an idea while simultaneously saying things that agree with the idea you're arguing against for the sake of being toxic.
---
!RemindMe 95 days "this do"
---
Yes, there are kids now who might be interested in trying it. I'm sure blizzard is trying to get a whole new generation of players to try playing it and the more streamers who do so, from a wide variety of different games, shows this to a different crowd who might not have heard or had an interest in it before.
---
Nice! I can finally do this again. It sucked when they removed this option in retail.
---
Or I mis-remember. It has been so long. Maybe the config command was always there but the option in the graphics menu was removed.
---
Now that I type it, I think there used to be a option in the UI to turn off the death effect and I never tried disabling it with the config.
---
Casual (no r13 and top tier gear) rets and enhs belong to the bottom of the food chain.
---
Paladin is at least a bit more helpful because of dispels, some cheap offheals and not relying on RNG.
---
I believe the point is to bank the materials. It is not that you farmed 10,000 gold in the first week; its that you banked 10,000 gold worth of materials in the first week.
---
Yeah I remember you could fly hack no problem but change your model and you were hunted down
---
Nah man I love Vanilla open world pvp, just as long as there is a faction balance on the realm so end tier regions aren't locked down by a particular faction.
---
This. Please let her just choose the class. 
---
Chances are big, that you lessen her fun and interest, if she feels forced to play what you want her to play.   
---
Let her even fool around instead pushing time efficiency. If she wants to climb a hill, lets climb the hill.
---
It will pay of.
---
Good write up! BWL killed my guild. We couldn’t get past the first boss. I was a hunter so I don’t recall what other groups were failing at but we had 4 hunters and only two of us could kite the dragons. Both of us were heavy pvpers (he made rank 14, I made rank 11) so kiting was easy to us. Not so much for the other two. Explains why I was the last hunter to get my epic bow quest but the first the only one finish it (rank 14 hunter had Warlord bow so he didn’t need it). BWL killed many casual guilds like mine on my server.
---
The big issue with layering and gather proffeccions is that if someone knows the system and how to abuse it. It will give him the ore's of not only 1 layer but maybe 3 or 4. Meaning he does not take an ore away for 3k people but he takes the ore away from 12k people.
---
Its like the serverhopping we had in MoP. Rare hunters took every rare on every realm. So a handfull of people took everything away from 30-40 realms.
---
Its a big issue and making ragulair gathering not worth it.
---
Yeah. I think it's because he is so positive and engaging with his chat. So he has a nice following of people that support him but don't watch all the time. Might be since he is a bit older and also has a bit older following. I'm not sure. That's just my speculations.
---
This made me laugh. I wish I had more upvotes to offer.
---
The solution to an impossibly crowded launch is sharding the starting zones like they were going to originally.
---
Personally I don't want any sharding or layering, however the best solution is to shard the 1-~25 zones.
---
An example for layering would be that there are only 10 level 50+s on the entire server, and most of them can't see eachother. How does that make any sense? That's just stupid.
---
Why would I want cheating and botting? U cant just make up new shit to argue about dood. Go away
---
Is that really layering?  
---
I mean, i remember during BFA launch that there was a system that didnt despawn nodes immediately, it was disappearing after like 30 second or 1 minute so other players could pick it up.  
---
PS. Im not saying its good, its bad for Classic, just pointing out another might be the reason.
---
They said you could to stop people doing it and getting stuck and needing gm help out I doubt they actually banned any one for getting out of bounds
---
I remember, being the best geared Warlock in a slightly above average raiding guild, if I was given the Adrenaline buff among the first 2 people I couldn't go all out without pulling aggro and getting all kinds of people cleaved in the ass. That fight was so fun.
---
However, I really don't remember the despawning after an hour thing?
---
Beta and stress tests are not early access. They're tests.
---
&gt;maybe a whole week or even the whole time layering is active.
---
Source? What happens when you log off and someone in queue takes your place on your layer? You will probably be put into another layer everytime you see a loading screen
---
You do as well, but you seem to be an unrelenting asshole almost the entire time. While being terrible at punctuation. 
---
I can tell you are also a pro 1337 gamer with all your posts about vanilla being easy. Man you are cool, hopefully I can be like you someday.
---
lol the night elves have just been getting effed with each xpac.
---
I mean, its not uncommon for mages to AoE grind to 60, people have been doing it on private for years, and it will be the same on retail.
---
So if you are asking which class is the fastest to 60 its without a doubt  mage.
---
Raiding itself around 8-12 hours and depending on class and raid difficulty another 4 to 10 hours of farming for consumables.
---
I pulled this numbers out of nothing.
---
4 horseman required 8 geared tanks, making it a hardwall for any guild that couldnt steal tanks from other guilds
---
I had about 114 but then I'm in the UK. I honestly kept forgetting the server is in the US it was that smooth.
---
I've always played Ali, heavily for the aesthetic appeal of major cities, as well as leveling in westfall and deadlines being my favourite nostalgic dungeon. But I could be open to giving horde a try (i mean the character models are badass).
---
The "#NoChanges but I want 1.12 talents and content released in a different order" people confuse the shit out of me, lol.

This is something I don't understand : how do you kite a class that has ranged spells ? Oo
---
I mean shaman is a hybrid, when you go enhance it doesn't mean your ranged spells disappear from your spell book !
---
My highest shaman alt was lvl 41, so I'm probably missing something but still ...
---
Jesus fuck that made me physically sick. I hate you for not tagging this as NSFL.
---
Gz, you figured out how the world works!
---
You can definitely take more than two
---
How is that different than merging dead layers? Hmmmmm?
---
They haven't specified if they'll be inviting more. But at least the people who were already invited to the first one will be in this next one.
---
Id argue against the other guy who replied, its more than just okay, it's just 5% damage less than the "full raid spec" so it isn't much worse. It's the second best raid spec a warlock can use.
---
Tool album releases a few days after classic. Coincidence?

Ah it‘s too bright I get it know. I was already wondering during stress test
---
Definitely likely, they *did* re-add some class buffs back to most classes in BFA (Blessings, Fort, Int, etc.)
---
For whatever reason though, MotW wasn't re-added. 🤔
---
Damn could have sworn that keyring was here at least from T2 patch.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "yes plz"

Nice one

why does that scrub keep running backwards
---
Yeah maybe guilds that are going for world firsts. The majority will be recruiting
---
Maybe not Underwater Breathing, but you could definitely use (seemingly useless) Curse of Recklessness to prevent low-HP mobs from fleeing in Stockades and pulling the entire wing.
---
Trying something new is causing a lot of people to switch sides come classic, personally id love to play ally but i have too many horde friends I’d lose doing that :( my group is more important to me than faction
---
So to alleviate your concern, it’s not something you can predict. Best to worry more about where your group is going or which faction pulls your heartstrings the most ^_^
---
Cmon guys did anyone really expect them to not use it for TBC launch?
---
Trust Blizzard guys, they never screwed us over before guys
---
I imagine Belves and Ogres both have some bad blood between them after Cho'gall and Gul'dan desecrated one of their runestones to make ogre magi in WC2. They might have been able to play with that a bit too. Would've drastically altered TBC, and we wouldn't have blue space goats.

Should have had two accounts with a WoW subscription, you filthy casual.

play on a PvE server and it wont matter
---
I'm not so sure that BWL will be that much of an issue these days. Given the patch level and the changes to talents, ability, gear, etc. that occurred between BWL's release and 1.12, it's going to be a very different raid. I don't think it will be near the problem it was originally.
---
No what the actual fuck is wrong with you , asshole
---
I guess just wait till the 28th
---
Friends and family.
---
Are you not NA ? I had 110 ms from West EU, and watching server hour it was obvious that we were playing on something hosted on West coast. 110ms gives this kind of delay to looting.
---
Sharding and CRZ made sweet forbidden love. Layering is their web footed 9 fingered incest baby.
---
Cope harder
---
I'd argue that's the storytelling and character progression of the rpg element. 
---
You're at the end of a journey that brought you from a *primary starting ability* spamming nobody to a hero over the course of a long tough journey.
---
merging servers forcibly removes players from their chosen realm and we all know realm identity is an important thing in vanilla. they explained this in the interview about layering.
---
She wants Thrall to sign her breasts.
---
There's a massive difference. Merging dead servers means huge problems with stuff like names and really strange things done to economies, there's no reason to do that when it can be layered instead.
---
actually looking forward to STV. see you at the arena.
---
That's pretty cool. I've heard that rumor for years (since Vanilla itself iirc) but I never knew if it was true.
---
I wonder why they decided to convert the dungeons into quests though. Maybe it didn't work well with low level players and instancing? Hmmm. Either way this is super interesting stuff. I love it.
---
I could stand it when it was just every expansion, but hated it once it became every patch as well.
---

Every blizzard beta there's a guy like you who yells " Lmao that's just a beta report and stop whining".
---
Usually that guy is nowhere to be found when we're six months in the game and every fucking bug is still here.
---
None of this crap is true if you are in a decent-&gt;good guild. This kind of things happen when you are in casual pleb guild who have issues on something as basic as dealing decent damage/healing.
---
&gt; Tips says he plays since vanilla and I'd like to see a proof for that as well
---
One trip to his account summary page can give us a look at his WoW subscription history. No personal details are on the page, just the date, the duration of the sub and the price. Any time someone claims they played vanilla but come off as lying just tell them to show their first subscription date.
---
It's amazing how many excuses you'll hear for why they can't open this page.
---
I do not remember this and I feel like it's been happening since realm hopping existed. Even without the add-ons I used to use it to make farming easier.
---
Its same system like in bfa. It has different name because thats how you deal with problems when you have more managers and marketing people than game developers.
---
Nah, I'll just find the block button, the fact you haven't understood the post you're responding to along with your 1.10 "success" suggests you're not on my level
---
There's kinda a limit to that though. There's a finite number of layers, if you always assume you get into the "next" layer, sure that works. Though if there's tons of people logging in, you'll miss some. Now of course in this case you aren't able to get into a previous layer which is unrealistic. But in that case it's unsustainable and thus you wouldn't be able to constantly repeat it.       
---
Now in the realistic case, depending on how layering actually is done changes things (for release). If you can randomly go into any layer after relog, you're going to be heavily against the odds. You might be able to get some resources, don't get me wrong you will. But you won't know how many layers exist, nor which ones you already mined or whatever on. Which is going to heavily cut into how much you can abuse it.         
---
Personally I don't think this is the most reliable way it can be abused, but it should definitely be changed in any case.
---
RemindMe! 96 days “DO THIS”

Shadowblade or the other one.. Assassin's Knife or something?

Yes, because this is definitely representative of what classic wow will be like and not just players messing around on a stress test
---
I prefere to know nothing about the beta than watching streamers lol.
---
This is definitely wrong.
---
This is a great post and the type of content I want from this subreddit.
---
There's a pretty significant difference between modern WoW accepting that part of sharding and CRZ is this happening and trying to reduce it, and Classic WoW using layering as a temporary measure and wanting it to impact as little as possible in the relatively short time it'll be active.
---
You dont change layer no matter what, unless you join a group or logout.
---
Fuck streamers

They were saying what they think should happen, not how they think it already does/will work.

Most of what you mentioned can be worked around with a discord server/addons created for the intent of abusing sharding for your respective server which you know will exist among gold farmers and meta game autists

I remember being kicked from dungeon groups when I was new because for the life of me I could not find the entrances after dying.

First of all i thought your reply to him was because he thought the glow was never in vanilla that's why i said Mandela effect.

No, that is being biased.

They could just have a group of six servers which are guaranteed to merge after population dies which is the exact same thing as layering minus the negative effects of phasing
---

---
Explore run depends on race doesn't it? Like humans is nuts, the last orc troll one I saw for example seemed mega slow
---
How does layering not also do that?
---
i would argue that there is something about choosing one´s server. so it feels like a small personal blow when "my" server is dead and moved to another.   
---
pretty silly but the only answer i could find in me.   
---
i think layering is good, but only for low lvl zones (tutorial area only) and preferably only for the launch period when there usually are many players. otherwise, i would really not want layering since it takes away from the social aspect of the world and harms the economy.
---
Imagine using "not on my level" unironically. Yikes.
---
I dunno what you are talking about dood. Just take me for an idiot and stfu. You make no sense to me
---
This is exactly spot on.  I have been talking in length with a few people as to what the difficulty of changing it would be and I don't think its feasible in the timeline they're thinking before launch and its a shame.  I mentioned it in my other post recently and its a simple questions to ask yourself.  If mechanically it was all the same numeric values, but they visually changed how mario jumped in super mario world, would it have the same charm?  I honestly don't think so.
---
Frost also played on LH and even Perp. Most of the streamers did, can't really say it has anything to do with playing on a private server, but rather with individual personalities.
---
No, I wish I was though haha :&lt;

---
Can someone enlighten me on why everyone has autoattack on hotbar?I mean you Attack with right mouse button and to stop you just go out of melee range or untarget ur target...so why have autoattack wasting space on the hotbar?
---
That one stormwind picture with the modern shadow detail effects looks so good. Adds more immersion.
---
I completely agree with you. Are there more guides and likely more skill players? Sure. But every guild isn't going to have a perfect composition. Someone is going to pull up a guide that says "just have your shaman drop a grounding totem" and they are going to say "Well we don't have any Shamans?" That was half of Vanilla. You had to figure out how to adapt your raid to perform the task.
---
Yup this is me. Trying to workout what days to take off once classic drops, first or second week?
---
Ok well then don't?
---
They did the same in the cataclysm zone updates but as soon as you start raiding you're no longer a nobody.
---
One of the key aspects is that in vanilla the major characters didn't do anything and just sat in their respective cities. As soon as these people started doing more in quests and talk directly to the player more often the language would have to change because they know what you've done. So they'd call you some variation of champion or hero.
---
Thanks for your reply. On what issues is that? I see the terms veteran, original player and the like, are these the entitled once?
---
Why
---
Vanilla pve was way more epic. Would love to see 40 people crank out some raids with newer mechanics, the scaling system we got now kinda blows and makes raiding not epic or really that difficult. The raids are clearly balanced around mythic.
---
I understand they fear that Blizz would fuck-up, but if they only add dungeons and raids and don't touch to talents and spells, I don't think they would do bad.
---
Please don't upvote me, you're supposed to downvote !!!!

You said that people should not care if someone exploits layering to gain 100 black lotus instead of 50. You might as well say that people should not care if a cheat or bot is used to gain 50 black lotus. How the fuck is this hard to understand?
---
Friends and Family.
---
The raids are fine, but the characters we use to play them just aren’t fun. Idk how anyone can think the game is good if the character quality is so low.
---
Just how it goes baby. Horde is red and cool so people will go to them and outnumber the alliance. 
---
Then alliance will form on specific servers and outnumber the horde.
---
Then horde will still outnumber the alliance on the rest of the servers.
---
Sry, what's DI?

I can only think of divine intervention but I'm not even sure it's a spell in vanilla / they have it at 30

Right, I know they will and can. My point isn't towards discords or add-ons. It's towards logging on and off for layering swapping. There's some super hardcore ways to abuse it if people wanted to (abusing switching groups that is)

Once you get to the level 60 content, dungeons in Vanilla do take longer, though. You can't just rush through them like on retail until you significantly outgear them. To me, they feel more rewarding to complete because of that. They might not be "difficult" exactly but then again, nothing in WoW besides really high M+ and Mythic raiding is.
---
Wow is relatively easy, but rfc is a joke dungeon with super training wheels so to think 4 manning that is difficult....

Tfw literally all current raid fights are cleared in the first 2 weeks. And you say classic is easy lol
---
Horde or alliance
---
You could avoid that simply by making "battlegroups" of 6 servers that all share a naming server and are guaranteed to merge when population dies down, which is what layering is but accomplishes all the goals of layering minus the negative aspects of phasing.
---
Retail peasants has no sense of quality so they dont care about this kind of stuff. The more refined, sophisticated and high borne top tier classic players do care about server quality.
---
Nah man. I'm not wanting to have the mundane argument of comparisons to other shitty thing to do in vanilla. I dont see the point. Analogies to other distasteful stuff doesnt make any sense ever when arguing a point. Just stop it because its not the same.

Hi, /u/Rocto
---
Well, freedom cant be on you 0/24, even if you get nova and use freedom, thats a gcd, and by that time mage can get away and just run while freedom on you, or just blink away and poly the freedom and start again the fight. I dont feel pursuit of justice so great that i can outrun a mage from distance, also i can cleanse, but gettin oom fast. But as ret i dont have problem with just the mages, beating an sl lock is impossible, beating enh is hard, but its possible like 2 out of 10 duels, against elem, 0 chance, just frostshock purge, i cant kill them in a hoj/rep. Atleast on that pserver. Good rogues are difficult too, hunters are impossible.( For me on that pservers)
---
Well to be fair,  male characters should hit harder then females. So that they know their place.
---
If you want to be fully neutral in your interpretation, the Qiraji empire should be much larger and encompass parts of Feralas, Un'Goro, 1k needles and Tanaris.
---
The Centaur Khanate should also rule Desolace, the Barrens and part of Mulgore, and encroach into Durotar.
---
I didn't feel like copying over the same points made in the comments ngl
---
!Reminder 96 days “do this”
---
&gt;Is this not sharding? Or have I misunderstood something
---
No, that would be cross-realm zones, but that isn't going to be in the final game either, they were likely just running tests. 
---
Sharding is where the population in a zone would be too much for some gameplay/hardware reason so it is split into multiple shards. The combination of the two is how live operates where there can be multiple shards per realm and other people can be put into you shard, but for example RP servers will shard, but not cross-realm zone (though people can still be invited from other realms through cross-realm parties). 
---
&gt;leaving the canyon where the quest was I was shifted layers mid combat with a lightning beast, it despawned my imp and put right on top of another mob.
---
That sounds like either a bug, or related to the tests they were running, part of the design goal with layers being the entire continent rather than zones is that nothing will shift you over to a different layer except for joining the party of someone on a different layer (ie not people you can see), they're meant to be "stickier" than CRZ to avoid situations like this.
---

---
The issue there is that it's not as dynamic. With layering, if there's only enough people for four servers, there'll be four layers. If that hops back up to five, there'll be five again. With hard servers that are just promised to eventually merge, that's an instant process that either happens or doesn't. Beyond that, creating a hard set of servers means you kind of have to get the count correct while layering is flexible in that regard. They don't have to know if there'll be five or twenty layers on server, the layering is built to adapt.
---
TOTB defends their copper minez
---
it's a good theory but the problem is most people won't watch someone streaming a game they have no interest in, some will and it will get some new players but not 1000s of new players.
---
for example I have no interest in fortnite or many other battle royal games and as such I won't watch someone streaming it.
---
my point is while giving them access will generate a few, and I do mean only a few, extra subs it won't be game changing numbers and it does more for the steamer than it will do for blizz. and in some cases may even turn people away, I have seen some post with people worried that the streamers are going to heavily unbalance server population which is a legitimate concern but again it won't make the game unplayable just means server with streamers on will be full of people that want to play with that streamer
---
I'm gonna have a relatively easy work schedule and will definitely have WoW FOMO anytime I'm doing anything but work and WoW, so I feel that. There is a certain beauty unknowing you cant compete, thus pointless to push.
---
It is literally 3 months and 3 days until release so there is plenty of time left for beta testing.
---
What do you mean with "should". Do you mean that it is like this is vanilla? Or that you'd want it to be?
---
I never knew they got maxed in PVP.
---
&gt; people who argue with full sincerity that there's not a single thing retail does better than classic
---
That's because they likely haven't raided Mythic or even Heroic, because they can't bare to get through the slough of world quests and repeating the same Mythic dungeons over and over to get ther gear to do the raids.
---
At least in Classic gear progression is only one roll of the dice whether you win/lose the item, not about 5 different rolls of the dice to get the "perfect" variant of the item you want.
---
Sarkoth was variable.  On a high pop shard that I had hearthed into I saw him killed 3 times before my cd said I had 56 minutes left.   Later on I got into a noticeably quieter shard and I had to wait 5 minutes for one spawn.  I think for the purposes of testing they enabled dynamic respawns for this one test.
---
If you want to watch streamers who are skilled and actually know what they are talking about then watch any of APES, perp, tribe, monkey etc.
---
Also they're down to earth and likeable and chat isnt an autism-off.
---
I know this is satire,
---
but fun fact: He reported missing a keyring.
---
Thank you for conceding
---
Does anyone know if it's still possible to get invites to the standard Beta? I really want to practice, get warmed up and see how it runs on my PC. I'm thinking of popping a token in hopes of getting invited but I'm not sure if there's even a chance?
---
I played the stress test for a few hours today on my [chromebook from 2013](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-11-6-Inch-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00FNPD1VW).
---
Specs:
---
* CPU: Intel Celeron 2955U 1.4 GHz (Haswell)
---
* RAM: 2 GB DDR3
---
* GPU: Intel HD Graphics 4600
---
* SSD: 64GB (I upgraded it)
---
* OS: ChromeOS with Ubuntu 16.04 via crouton
---
I get ~10fps when 50+ people are on screen. I got an average of 24fps when questing in the open world. Would get above 30fps when in-doors. Never felt like a slideshow even when raiding Hogger. This was on pretty much everything the lowest video setting.
---
Like, just nuke the gnomes, they weren't in any previous games anyway. So horde stays the same, alliance gets humans, blood elves, night elves, dwarves. High elf refugees from the scourge invasion settled in stormwind, now in vanilla they are out for revenge against the undead. Share starter area with humans, keep the intellect boost, racial as the gnome, and the class selection.
---
 No way man, not for many at least. Half the time you would be fighting level 50's and lvl 51's that would still be in quest greens from like STV... I mean don't get me wrong you would be like a god but 60 would be much more of a real challenge.
---
I'm NA, had no lag or delay with anything besides that.
---
You wont have character name collision when you merge layers because they are all part of the same server. Each layer is basically a virtual server part of the same main server. All branches but on the same tree.
---
Overrated? Lool have you seen his pvp videos? Guys playing rogue in 3022 with 500iq plays
---
RemindMe! 96 days "wow client setting for launch"
---
The lowbies that look like theyre running away really make this screeny
---
Than you for your insight
---
Getting kited either lol
---
Yup common man running around on foot in barrens. Can’t wait!
---
I don't think a tank should do whatever he wants. I think they should do whats best for raid.
---
Running an oomkin is fine compared to having a dps specced healers and mortal strike tanks.
---
I was just some rando scrub on horde for stormscale but that server was so much fun. I remember madawk running strat like 10000 times for that mount. 
---
I also have memories of getting ganked by many RoD members. Good times
---
They could make it as dynamic as layering, and if people are willing to wait in queue for the high populated server instead of starting on a low populated server shouldn't it remain the player's choice instead of having layering/phasing shoved down their throats?
---
You say it will be a few but still even if it’s a few that more blizzard made for doing literally nothing but giving people access to beta. You just sound salty.
---
The only stress test I know about, is waiting for my Beta invite..
---
CPU: Intel Pentium G4560 
---
Graphics card: ASUS Cerberus GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB OC Edition 
---
Outside of the chaotic raid environment I can play with max graphics and have a good frame rate. (I had vsync enabled)
---
Layering is a necessity if you've been listening.
---
The client runs on a slimmed down and retrograded Legion client, if you can run Legion you can run classic.  
---
If you are unsure of how well your PC runs Legion, these are the recommended specifications:
---
(however, Classics new "Classic mode" lowers the recommended specs a tad)
---
"The best chance at playing **World of Warcraft**: **Legion** at recommended sys **specs** on a 1920x1080 screen resolution will be if your PC has at least the GeForce GTX 750 Ti/Radeon R7 260X v2 graphics card. The CPU required to meet recommended requirements is either an AMD FX-6300 or Intel Core i5-3330 3.0GHz processor."
---
One thing to take note of, the client they used for the retrograding does not have the current multithreading optimizations that the BFA client has and therefore thrives on a higher single core speed over multiple slower cores.
---
Enemies started respawning behind them and catching up fast, I’m pretty sure they would have had to kill everything again
---
Ya but I am literally playing BFA right now and I just saw a multiboxing druid in a 5 man running around picking herbs because of the feature that allows you to pick a herb quickly right after someone else does. (another feature that givesa more convience at the cost of competition and player interactivity). Isnt thjat the same thing
---
McCuck*
---
No need to do it in 2h, the stress realm stayed open for 24h, exactly as it was officially announced. Only the 'stress' part was scheduled to last 2 hours.
---
For next stress test on 29 may, they're doing the same - 2h of stress test for the starting zones followed by 24h realm kept online for anyone invited to play.
---
Remind Me! 96 days "just do it"
---
You need to read up on layering and their reasons for doing it, son.
---
Nice,  the 80 v 80 level 5 pvp fights at 1am in both the Valley of Trials and Elwynn Forest were awesome.  Can't wait to do it again at level 10 next week.
---
Oh =( 
---
Like I said, with dx12 in bfa I know that it’s limited with dx12 and how it works. That you can’t go fullscreen or something like that. Didn’t knew it would be like that in classic also. 
---
Ok then I will find a way I guess, thanks!
---
That sounds too much like homework and too complex.   
---
How about just   
---
- Make us live guy  
---
- Make monster dead guy  
---
So tank and healing are the same thing and any dps can stand where ever they want?   
---
So simple and immersive.
---
you guys have Gamon /s
---
character name collisions.
---
But it is the same. You just didn't think of it when you made your retarded argument.
---
"I was just spamming buttons"
---
Lmao I just pictured some goofy undead rogue mid boss fight with gouge in rotation.
---
Gnomes were in WC2. Lorewise, much of Dwarven tech beyond explosives and guns are actually gnomish tech adapted into weapons and vehicles of war.
---
Mate...stop playing the victim.
---
he won't last long
---
Very slim chance. There was a blue post referring to having nearly all they need for the full beta.
---
It is all of the mages at once. Or the warrior's mortal strike that doesn't even do more damage than a fury would. The warrior is the selfish one. Its not decided by neckbeards. It is basic math. they do more dmg than you do.
---
Wrong. Not an argument. Never has been
---
Cause you don't get forcibly transferred to another realm?! You remain on the same realm but on a different layer. You can communicate and interact with all the players from your realm even if they are in different layers. Also when the layers are merged you get to keep your name and realm reputation be it bad(for ninja looting or other shenanigans) or good.
---
Sorry, what bow drop? I have checked dB and there isn’t a bow reward in the battle for hills Brad chain
---
humans are gonna make for a better warrior than gnomes
---
It's lower than retail. On mode 4 and at 3440x1440 on Ryzen 3 2200g apu i got above 100 fps. That's just a better integrated graphics. For higher fidelity you will need more though.
---
Bosses usually drop 3-4 pieces of loot for a 40 man group. Wen I last raided (Heroic Dragon Soul, back in Cataclysm), we got 2-3 pieces of loot for a 10-man group. Things are differently different, even though Cataclysm is 'old' by modern standards.
---
I’ll sell you “bodies by drowning pool”  and “down with the sickness by disturbed” for 20s each.
---
Not sure what the original chugged through back jn the day, but I imagine blizzard has a lot more going on behind the scenes than a private server. I'd mention it on the beta forums anyway. It's interesting anyway
---
I agree with the centaur control of desolace, with the taurens being the encroaching force, but not the qir'aji.  The silithids aren't qiraji any more than kodos are tauren.  A related servant species, but they're just bugs.  Bugs corrupted by an old god, but bugs none the less.
---
I forget, did that ever get changed?
---
People think stress test and beta is gonna be the same as live lol. The games gonna be terrible and unplayable when it comes out and everyone will drop it in a month or two
---
Honestly, at least for me, as long as all the big streamers stay on 1 or 2 servers I'll be happy. The streamer affect is true and it showed on retail that chat basically became an extension of Twitch chat and people would be grieved or harassed if they did something against the streamer or mass reported. 
---
I'd like to be on a server with high numbers, but I won't be able to stand the cult like mentality that streamers bring with them, and that's no fault of their own. They are just trying to make a living doing what they and we all love.
---
My plan? Take my time, enjoy myself. There's no need to rush to max level like in current wow so I'm going to just enjoy myself.
---
I remember the first time I tanked Razorgore.
---
Christ.
---
The issue is that if it's not dynamic enough there's a situation where every server could be over- or under-populated.
---
Additionally, how do you handle chat channels? I could be mistaken, but with layering Trade chat (as well as user-created channels?) is shared between all layers since they're still on your server. If they're separate servers, do you still get to talk to people in the same cluster? Or do you not, and randomly just get to learn  that your #1 server Ragnaros kill is now actually #3 because some guilds you never heard of merged into your server. Oh, and hope you didn't get attached to your server name; you're no longer on Sunwell-PvP, you're on Hillsbrad-PvP.
---
During Mists of Pandaria, my relatively low pop server got merged with another server and it destroyed everything I loved about the server. It was *awful.* Whatever sense of community we had was shattered when a completely different server culture was injected into our own. Server merging is something that should be avoided if at all possible.
---
Yeah sure OK.
---
We all know how that will go....
---
Human prot warr
---
RemindMe! 96 days don’t forget to do this
---
Isn't merging the dead layers forcibly being merged anyway?
---
Isnit confirmed that all the layers will use the same chat? Then abusing phasing will be even easier as you will be able to coordinate it with people using the in game chat.
---
You could just have battlegroups of servers that all share the same naming server and merge them when the population dies down, which is the same thing as sharding/layering minus the negative effects of phasing.
---
It is no players. If im not seeing people stood in the same spot im not seeing people. Yes it does matter if im seeing 1380 vs 2052 becasue I could be seeing them both and we could be having a good time. Instead why bother? These people are not likely to get into my shard again. 
---
Minor exploit untill its not a minor expolit amiright.
---
Yes clearly im the selfish one, The one who wants the game to live. You on the other hand mister who cares if they servers die or if classic fades becasue ill be gone after my great 2 week experaince are very very selfless. I applaude you sir. If only we could all try our hardest to kill this game off the world would be a better place.
---
both are great for leveling
---
warlocks power spike later on in the game and dont really get fully online until naxx gear
---
hunters power spike early and trail off towards the end
---
both are great in pvp, hunters are probably much better until the lock gets geared
---
hunters have deadzone and try to play as far back as possible, whereas warlocks can take a bit of punishment and kind of facetank
---

Here's some of the highlights from last night, was a blast! A lot of PvP action in enemy territory.
---
We were camping Northshire for an hour or so, then we decided to move out south again. We were outnumbered at Goldshire, so we decided to hold out in a barn.
---
After holding the barn for 15 minutes or so, we rushed out and managed to defeat them.
---
Had a lot of fun, comment if you see your name or were in the groups!
---
Layering is aids and will kill classic.
---
Quote me.
---
But is your day ruined?
---
Goblin Sapper Charges and Gnomish Battle Chicken are the important ones. 
---
https://youtu.be/GN9eTALnZOw
---
Are you sure about that? Because the account they gave me for the stress test is labelled "World of Warcraft: Legion (WoW1)"
---
But couldn't you just accomplish the exact same thing by having battlegroups of servers that share the same naming server and merge when the population dies down?
---
When nost died I sent my druid to the depths of the thunder bluff pool lol
---
Insane is that iam from EU and still had sub 125 latency.
---
I forgot this !
---
And there was also a  black dragon fighting dwarves as you fly over the border of searing gorge?
---
I’m so excited for classic!
---
Meh. 90% of the communication issues from those days are easily resolved via addon functionality in modern game. Add stable internet connection and reliable voice communication, access to info and previous WoW skill -  vanilla raiding turns into trivial af content to raid in terms of mechanics. 
---
I bet ya - those raids will get cleared the week of release in 40 man, and after a few weeks will be in farm with 20 bodies
---
DI was in vanilla, it could br used to cheese the first boss BWL in early patches
---
Eh, you can talk shit about retail all you want, but endgame content is absolutely better than it has ever been.
---
Orc Warrior. Lok'tar Ogar
---
Great writing, thanks for the post! Your are absolutly right with Vael being a guild killer. I remember 2 guilds on my server disbanded in BWL from that boss alone. 
---
One thing tho: you said Vael despawned after 60 minutes and you had to wait for a week. IIRC he only despawned for 12h and you could try him again the next day.
---
Every mob I tried to kill was quickly tagged. Didn't help my latency was like 400+. So I just broke away from the crowd and went exploring. Just like I did when I first rolled a night elf rogue back all those years ago. Good times.
---
So this exact thing happened to me with aggressive furblogs and not neutral enemies. I died.
---
Simply put yes :D  Every class uses a mix of pvp and pve gear.
---
Any source for this claim?
---
Me too, I always extrapolate when I hit the piss
---
The Game.
---
I just really hope these sorts of people are the sorts who will leave before hitting level 10, and I can enjoy my grind in peace.
---
This is the core issue, really. The content itself can be as amazing as it wants, but if actually playing your character is unenjoyable then the content itself will be unenjoyable, no matter how well it's designed.
---
Already have a general caster guide out on my channel. If I have time over the summer I might get to mages specifically, but can't promise.
---
Definitely gonna want to get as much frost damage as possible though ;)
---
August 27th.
---
why do those character models look so good?
---
Some people just prefer to tab target, so they have the mouse for camera control sometimes (or they are just lazy and kept it there, since the game puts it there at lvl 1)
---
only for friends and family streamers etc
---
We were called champions back in wotlk
---
Yes that's a great example. KT is a caster boss so he'll have naturally low armor but higher resistances (primarily to frost and shadow). Garr on the other hand is a big rock so he'll have massive amounts of armor but most likely lower resistances to certain schools of magic.
---
RemindMe! 96 days /console WeatherDensity 3
---
&gt; they were likely just running tests
---
I would report it as a bug anyway since they stated CRZ wouldn't be in Classic, it's possible the underneath technology is similar but if CRZ is showing up instead of just sharding/layering something may not be working as intended.
---
Tiny things, but the text on the vendor item costs change colors if you don't have enough money. 
---
For example, if an item costs 50 silver, but you only have 10, the 50 number will have a grey color, instead of white.
---
If you have enough money, they show the regular white.
---
Seems like a modern feature, I could be wrong.
---
If league is designed to be toxic then so is counter strike and probably ever other competitive game
---
Both Alex Jones ones on repeat.
---
Try not to go insane.
---
I will check the box for "loop music" then just listen to the soundtrack provided by blizzard plus the ambient sounds maxed out.
---
I got 2 weeks free from work when classic launches....
---
I will be a different man when i go back to work.
---
Oh yeah it was Dangerous! The wanted poster quest my b
---
Yup, it's Divine Intervention. It was in the game at launch and removed in 4.0
---
One of the most nostalgic times were when I was listening to Killswitch engage 2014 album while questing
---
Not really sure what you're talking about.  Feral spec through Wrath was a hybrid Cat/Bear tree.  You could tank or DPS in the same gear and same spec.  Agility was your primary stat in both forms.  
---
At low levels and Pre-TBC, sure, you've only got Maul/Bash and Cat-Sinister-Strike.  But once you get swipe in bear and a few cooldowns in Cat then each form becomes more interesting.
---
You had to power shift in order to use your abilities but that's the whole point of it all.
---
Just wait until you see what they call me at the Goldshire inn.
---
Didn't it get changed in like mop? I def remember having it in cata with the stonecore runbacks
---
I'm like 99% sure that what /u/skribsbb is true.
---
[This Wowwiki article] (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill) also says that weapon skill is maxed in PvP, and PvP is mentioned nowhere in the changelog, which gives the impression that it's always been like this.
---
This is the best advice.
---
Get to 60 ASAP and raiding guilds will want you.
---
why you keep replying
---
&gt;The issue is that if it's not dynamic enough there's a situation where every server could be over- or under-populated.
---
And how will layering be any different? Surely there will be some layers of only 200 players if the server only reaches +200 of the server cap
---
&gt;Additionally, how do you handle chat channels? I could be mistaken, but with layering Trade chat (as well as user-created channels?) is shared between all layers since they're still on your server. If they're separate servers, do you still get to talk to people in the same cluster? Or do you not, and randomly just get to learn  that your #1 server Ragnaros kill is now actually #3 because some guilds you never heard of merged into your server. Oh, and hope you didn't get attached to your server name; you're no longer on Sunwell-PvP, you're on Hillsbrad-PvP.
---
I haven't seen any where that all the layers will share the same chat channels. I would lean on them not, seeing as to how it would make phasing even more easy to abuse. And if layers do share the same chat, why couldn't they make the battlegroup also share the same chat. Also how does layering solve the issue of realm firsts? When your layer is merged with another, couldn't you also learn your "layer first" was actually slightly slower than a neighboring layer's?
---
&gt;During Mists of Pandaria, my relatively low pop server got merged with another server and it destroyed everything I loved about the server. It was *awful.* Whatever sense of community we had was shattered when a completely different server culture was injected into our own. Server merging is something that should be avoided if at all possible.
---
The same thing will inevitably happen with your layer as "layers" are just servers within servers. Server merging = layer merging in every sense
---
this so much. Gear resets are a necessary evil you simply cant avoid, otherwise the relative difference would become ridiculous eventually. But having a soft reset every few months is just absurd.
---
It really is bizarre. Watching my friends play video games and not playing myself was agony when I was a kid. Now I do it with strangers willingly, sometimes for hours on end.
---
Is F&amp;F like a prioritized list that you get put on by blizz employees?
---
Thank you dad for the needed information, really contributes.
---
!RemindMe 96 days "do this"
---
It might be a debugging mode enabled for the beta that is sending a ton more data back than necessary.
---
You can dispells on yourself right? You know that?
---
How exactly do you think you'd catch that mage as a fucking shaman? by spamming frostshock?
---
The difference is that layering is on the same server, whereas sharding is cross-server. People spamming to be invited to the "right" layer is just people wanting to see all the stress test madness. Once Classic releases layering will make sure that server communities are intact, as opposed to the clusterfuck we see in retail.
---
Seeing Teldrassil is making me so home sick!
---
100-200 forsaken all camping the lvl 1 skeletons was great fun. I loved that starting zone, and it was so good. Warlocks are op op
---
&gt; 5) World chests - High level chests are in the game and available 8)
---
But can You open them as a low level?
---
im not saying kiting is the answer im saying that there is no answer.
---
It was an achievement to them, in vanilla, let them be excited. Go back to BFA.
---
That's not a proper fix. ffxglow exists in Vanilla too. Setting it to 0 just makes it *too* dark. Vanilla's glow implementation is less "in your face" and looks better in my opinion.
---
But regardless of anyone's opinion, the original Vanilla look should be available. It should be extremely easy for them to make it happen. I suspect they just increased a value for the glow in later iterations so all it would take is to let us set it back to what it was in Vanilla.
---
Yeah you can have an alt in another layer and invite a friend to farm and so on.
---
I hope it either gets a bit more locked down or restricted to a shorter time than already known to avoid endgame mats abuse on a more global scale than a few hardcore levellers being ahead of everyone.
---
not salty at all, love that the instant response to anyone saying anything bad against streamers on here is "you're just salty", i have disliked a lot of the streamers for a long time, the ones that feel they have to act like up to their audience just cause a massive circle jerk of morons that follow them about polishing their egos, you get the streamers that are actually worth watching and less of them got onto the beta, or have announced that they got in, than the circle jerk generators.
---
/r/classicwow back to normal again
---
Awesome stuff.
---
Replace the non-warlock DPS with Hunters. You'll want the Warlock for CoW, but Hunters are the kings of underleveled challenge because ranged auto attacks are not subject to Parry Glancing Blows (Which are 40% of all swings against a boss level enemy and reduce white damage by 30%)
---
I know. I wouldn't expect it to be the exact same rate, but using more than 3x what I used to use per month in less than a week seems like a bit too much of a difference. 
---
Like I said, on my data plan it goes from something I can easily afford to something out of the question. I have a 10gb a month allowance, so using 2gb isn't bad, 24gb definitely is.
---
You have to get back into the mode of mob sniping. Casting takes too long lol.
---
Esfand and Asmon both need rolled and Esfand won.
---
This troll is a total hipster! 100% vegan too!
---
Very cool thanks!
---
IIRC Draenei and Eredar weren't connected to eachother? I believe the Eredar were just a race of demons, and the Draaenei were a different race.
---
They got retconned to where the Burning Legion corrupted the Eredar.
---
He absolutely REFUSES to bandage, ever.
---
I've already reported it as a bug: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bp61yw/beta_bugsproblems_megathread_report_issues_here/eojawjd/
---
(Your screenshots, although well meaning are not convincing enough because you didn't control properly for time of day and weather.)
---
Friends and Family, Blizzard first step of external testing before public Alpha/Beta is usually a Friends and Family Alpha, where you get invited if you're an employee of Blizzard of an employee has nominated you as one of their friends/family.
---
I can't confirm this specific bug.
---
But I can confirm that fearing through weak spots in a wall is in.
---
Definitely a possibility. 
---
#OP ask on blizzard forums about it.
---
That's not a proper fix. ffxglow exists in Vanilla too. Setting it to 0 just makes it too dark. Vanilla's glow implementation is less "in your face" and looks better in my opinion.
---
Just being able to buy those level 6 skills from the starting zone trainer will feel good.  They were just sat there taunting me in the UI window, knowing that I could never touch them no matter how hard I tried.  Revenge will be sweet.
---
It's a leveling dungeon and much harder than heroics are on live
---
I haven't watched any Beta content at all, so I don't know if this is still a valid reason, but in the original 1.12 client you needed autoattack on a hotbar to create skill macros that would make you start attacking, even when you don't have enough resources to actually use/cast the skill. 
---
Like, a Heroic Strike macro that would make you start attacking even when used at 0 rage.
---
You won't get in save it for August... only a select few get to pre plan classic and try things out before launch :)
---
started slapping things with my staff to get the tag and then casting at it, melee mage anyone?
---
why do you?
---
&gt; but stuff would drop only when they didn't attend the raid, of course
---
Played Paladin in Vanilla, I was in a somewhat hardcore guild (I think top 5 or so alliance side of my server) so we had BWL on farm status, never had any issues with the bosses including Vael when I was playing with them. I had 5/8 t2 and really wanted the chest (as I had all other highly visible parts). Did BWL many times, never saw it drop once and the one time I'm not there because I'm on vacation there drops 2 judgement chests from Nef.. Both DE'd as well as the cherry on top.
---
Fuck, that video made a really strong case for me going rogue in classic over warrior.  I'm not going to claim I'd be as good as that rogue was, but having the ability to completely manhandle someone if I'm good enough is really enticing.
---
Jadenar in Felwood was also planned as a instanced dungeon, I heared.
---
Love that place.
---
There's not much Tips can do.
---
Rogue Imo Sprinted first Hamstring.
---
Rogue escape artists next hamstring.
---
Rogue then evasion and finished him off.
---
"Slightly inconvenienced" is a rather mild term for the 1+ hour queues some servers had. I actually experienced that myself and crossrealm BGs were a godsend because such long queues for a potential 15 minute BG are really no fun at all.
---
lmao athene
---
It's disappointing to see how low people regard GameStop. In my country in particular, many nerds including me are very thankful of the game release events they're arranging.
---
I wanted to buy BFA wbefore it was released...and then I did. I know you don't belieber me.
---
I wait after 1 month. Haven't been back.
---
If you think this subreddit is toxic, you dont visit actually toxic subreddits.
---
Probably not, Blizzard said yesterday they have just about everyone they need for the Beta. Not sure about the stress tests.
---
lol, dude does not even know how shield block works. Crit and crushed on every other hit.
---
But I don’t. And I’m not a liar. 
---
Hope the best for you who do and that you get your servers!
---
It should be like that, depends exactly how layering works.
---
But I think the problem is not so much the economy as it is farming in the world. Abusing layering to essentially be herbing on 2-3 servers at once will obviously be quite profitable, the problem is that because it's so good, you are basically forced to abuse layering for world gathering, because it's so much stronger.
---
??? Lol kid ok. Played from Vanilla to end of LK. Then on off from Cata to Legion. When I finally gave up.  
---
Way to assume because I don't buy into the pig scream streamers I'm a bfa baby.
---
Okay........
---
Intended, hunters have a small dead zone.
---
They'll introduce a 3rd version of it. No sharding, no layering.
---
 Introducing "2D friends" when huge amounts of players are at the same spot, they are replaced by static 2D sprites. Promise it will only be used for the few months of AQ, and only in and around azeroth during and or after the event, unless it also occurs outside of this event in which case stop being toxic you streamhating alt right gamer.
---
WHat toxicity exactly? People keep saying that but i fail to see it
---
You have no idea what layering even means. Layering is retarded solution to something that is not a problem in the first place (dead realms after tourists go away). Layering does not affect the amount of people in starting zones, a 3k layer will have same people in starting zone as a 3k server.
---
No.
---
So, if I use a melee ability in the dead zone it will not trigger auto attack mode on?
---
Do you think the text color on that image is supposed to be indicative of something?  Like, yellow names were Alliance dungeons and white ones Horde?
---
No disagreement here -- usually the ML would miss most of the trash on farm nights, sorting out the tells and spreadsheet.
---
But it did keep the bench available, recruits from scampering off with nearly a full set of gear, and long-time raiders incentivized -- which was a problem that many guilds in the #2 and #3 server progression position found themselves in.
---
You need a new irony detector. Yours is broken.
---
yea really fuckin annoying, these people have no idea what toxicity is.
---
I mean, I see the issue. And I do think it's not the most beautiful solution, but what would you all choose if you had 2 options: either this, or many players (including yourself) simply not being able to play the game because of server load? And they already said it's only going to be there for a short time.
---
I see so much panic in this screenshot
---
So I resubbed to check /played on my Vanilla main...  [37 days](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yfu58h68s75gsjv/37-days.png) pre-60, and I loved every minute of it!
---
At some point this is inevitable if people are going to keep playing it. 
---
I get some people want Classic to stay Classic. But if we’re realistic how fun will it be when players start to drop off after they’ve met a natural limit to what they can experience from the game, either that being they’ve had Naxx on farm for a good while, or they’re not able to commit to raiding to that degree. 
---
Post-Naxx content isn’t necessarily limited to new dungeons or raids either, it may be in the form of seasons or other things, which seem to be rather popular given the amount of players on the Ascension servers. Classless WoW is honestly a rather fun concept for instance. 
---
I think many people forget that much of the driving factors behind an MMORPG is new content. Classic will have a stream of ‘new’ content for probably two years at least, which will keep the players content for a good while. But at some point we will be back to square one, which is where we are at now, we want something different. 
---
I think the most exciting thing about Classic is the fact that we’re seeing a major game company break convention. I wouldn’t be too surprised if this is the start of Blizzard actually going back to its roots with a sort of a blank sheet.
---
it's for science.... i swear
---
was playing on a private server about a week ago and by the time i was level 4-5 i had full set of bags and was selling others that were dropping so nice to actually have to manage the little bag space that you have on the beta with the real drop % and not skewed ones that are on private servers
---
I never said you started in BFA, i simply said go back to it, take a deep breath. You came into a thread just to shit on other people having a blast doing something they have a passion for. Fuck yourself with that attitude, kid. "Oh you're doing something you enjoy? Nah you should feel bad about it"
---
Get rid of that “friend”
---
It's been so long, did this not happen in Vanilla? All I can remember is Nodes randomly dissapearing and me being pissed off.
---
Screenshot of email or dont care.
---
I bet you that's why he took the screenshot back then lol
---
There are also some people who will login to farm gold on retail, buy a token with it and use it for the sub.
---
&gt;**Look, I'm not saying don't be concerned or talk about the issues with layering right now. It needs reported and this kind of exploitation needs to be nipped in the bud.**
---
What part of that is "shut down any concern or questions about layering", again? I must have missed the part of my post where I said "nobody needs to talk about layering, why are you asking questions? How dare you be concerned." 
---
&gt;I normally think it's ridiculous to talk about paid shills, but why the fuck are people defending a company so hard?
---
Okay...
---
Blizzard's writing team is fucking atrocious, whoever thought that azerite armor was fit to ship was out of their mind and their constant cutting of abilities and simplification of gameplay over the years has proven that the main target audience for modern WoW is not so much people who enjoy playing MMORPGs but people who are completely anti-social and have no intelligence whatsoever. Modern WoW dev constantly tells us that we're too stupid for basic things like tooltips with actual information in them or options in the interface. They stupidly remove them and make us download an addon to bring it back. They always shoot themselves in the foot with new features, taking one step forward and nine steps back and have never managed to stop overcorrecting problems. They're also stupid as hell with their refusal to make class changes beyond buffs and nerfs during the course of an expansion, which is why I quit the game and will only consider returning to modern if 9.0's class design actually brings some diversity back to things. Titanforging is shit that devalues gear that takes actual effort to get, and new faceroll content as well as scaling constantly invalidate rewards to the point you don't even feel like progressing. Flying was a mistake and WoW is barely even an RPG anymore, and the current devs feel completely out of touch with their former core audience, it seems like they go out of their way to fuck things up half the time and i'm really just sick of it entirely, they need a serious attitude shift.
---
Do you still think I'm a shill?
---
Just because someone doesn't immediately assume the worst-case scenario about something doesn't make them a shill. I seriously don't understand this mentality that is all over the WoW Reddit community.
---
&gt;Holy shit dude, they invited streamers to show off their new technology. They are literally broadcasting it to hundreds of thousands of people. They obviously think it's pretty close.
---
They always invite streamers to betas, even alphas sometimes (Legion). That's not an indicator that "it's pretty close to done", we are still months away from launch and beta has just barely been available for a week.
---
&gt;they invited streamers to show off their new technology
---
Streamers serve multiple purposes but showing off the ways you can abuse new server tech is not one of them. It's all about keeping the hype train going, and "new layering technology" is not a part of that for most people. Also, Blizz can use recordings from streamers for debugging purposes; not the main reason, but still above "show off layering" I'm sure.
---
Also, layering is probably based on sharding so they need to work on it more to fix the problems to make it work like they say it should. New tech needs testing, and its not gonna be marked as a "complete feature" before testing.
---
Layering needs fixed before Classic goes live or it will cause problems. But assuming that the way it works on the **beta** right now is intended when they specifically go out of their way to assuage the community over and over feels like an overreaction. If they truly cared so little, wouldn't they have just kept the sharding plan, kept loot trading the way it was, etc?
---
I loved BWL, it is still my all time fav raid.

LEVEL 10 HYPE WE GOT 1 TALENT BOIS
---
You've already made it abundantly clear how much care about seeing and meeting new people when you said you don't care about what is likely to be the highest % of players with the new players not being able to play day 1 lol. 
---
And yes minor exploit. Being able to currently hop layers to harvest an extra node? That is minor in the whole entire grand scheme of things. 
---
The point is there though that there are numerous ways to fix this one insignificant issue other than saying "lol better remove the whole thing" 
---
And what's more likely to get people to ruins peoples interest in the game. Someone getting extra thorium nodes, or the majority of players not being able to enjoy the game at launch because either A) the servers can't handle that many people condensed in that tight an area so have fun with your giant login queues or B) they can't quest when there's literally thousands of other people camping quest objectives. 
---
I don't like layering, I wish it didn't have to exist, but I can at least recognize and say it's a necessary evil to actually make the game playable and enjoyable at launch. With the design philosophy of vanilla's quests it is not feasible to have such a huge influx of players all in the same area and be able to have an enjoyable experience.
---
And again, acting like the sky is falling and that this exploit is gonna be the death of classic and the only way to fix it is to completely remove laying is retarded. There are multiple ways this could be approached and yet people suggest just removing laying from the start with definitely no ulterior motives. I will give you some freebies -
---
- Limit layering to early zones. Anything past Durotar/Barrens, Elwynn/Westfall, Dun Morogh/Loch Modan, etc etc does not have the technologies. By the time people get past those zones the popular will be far more spread out.
---
- Limit how often you can transfer layers. The only problem with this is that grouping would still have to transfer you to your friends layer which would not remove the exploit, just make it more annoying to pull off.
---
- REALIZE THAT BLIZZARD LITERALLY SAID THAT THE LAYERING IS TEMPORARY TO DEAL WITH THE HUGE AMOUNT OF PLAYERS AT LAUNCH.
---
Yeah absolutely. Durotar is kinda big
---
I hated to ask on the official forums since I'm obviously hesitant to mention playing on a private server there. I don't know if they would care or not, but I obviously don't want to do or say anything that might get me in trouble with Blizz.
---
I'll try to get the point across without mentioning the private servers.
---
Thanks. Looks like you and I have similar builds. 
---
I built my PC 4 years ago. I build a new one every 5 years. Next year I will be upgraded as well.
---
i'm a bit on the fence with dynamic spawns, on one side i think having to fight for mobs in busy areas is fine, but on the other side when you have 20+ people waiting to kill 1 quest mob with a bad respawn timer it gets a little boring, even worse when its a quest shared between factions, at least if they are all one faction you can just make groups
---
It's bugged, you need to right click the mob or wait for auto shot to fail before pressing raptor strike, or you get "stuck".
---

Shadowfang. As someone who played level 19 twin bracket very heavily, this weapon was like the fucking holy grail. I remember people would very very often buy it on another server (if they got the tip it was for sale) then transfer the character over. If you had it you really were the dogs bollox.

All good. I do very much enjoy raiding, actually. It Is the thing I enjoy the most about retail. I just didn't enjoy grinding islands on multiple characters to compete for high ranks in BFA. In legion I could grind m+ to stay competitive, which was way more emjoyable imo.

Wow based on these comments it feels like I’m the only one who didn’t get in 😭
---
Blizzard at Blizzcon: "We are going to use sharding on starter zones for the initial few weeks".
---
Blizzard when launching the demo: "We are going to use layering(A.K.A. Sharding) across the entire game world for an entire phase lasting several months.

Psshh. Games release events.... I have gigabit internet. When I want a game, I download that shit. GameStop. Pshhhh.
---
/s because people have sensitive feelers.
---
If bfa wasn’t attached to a triple-A publisher giant like Blizzard, it would go down as the worst game/scam of 2018, on par with the No Man’s Sky scandal.
---
Can confirm the menu option is gone but the command still works in retail. My gf's eyes are pretty bad and she got lost easily when the ghost effect was on until she googled a command to get rid of it. About a month or two ago I believe.
---
Guildies don't have to be in the same in-game guild

 Nowhere near the most toxic, just more people and more opinions, id say there are more people crying about toxicity and not being in their safe space than the actual toxic people.

Bone of the fathers, unknowingly given. Flesh of the servants, willingly given. Blood of the enemy, taken by force. The forsaken. Shall rise. Again!

The alternative being crashing the second you look at the cave because there are 600 people in it. I think this fixable bug is preferable to that.
---
This was around 2 hours before stress test ended. No one else was in my shard and then he randomly disappeared. I had hope he would return. He did not..
---
get the mallet
---
&gt;I can see that you think that from your previous comment, so no need to repeat that if you don't have to add anything else.
---
Newsflash: Those players are coming back!! They are already here upvoting this post. Say what you want about retail but that playerbase is only around still because 1) they love the game 2) they are good at it.
---
&gt;And how will layering be any different? Surely there will be some layers of only 200 players if the server only reaches +200 of the server cap
---
As we understand it, it doesn't use a hard cap like that. It doesn't wait to reach its absolute capacity before starting a new layer, since it needs room for people moving between layers (and apparently they want you to automatically get put on layers with your friends and guild mates, if I recall). As well, any underpopulation would be temporary as either more people would log on to fill out the layer, or people would log off so some layers would merge.
---
&gt;The same thing will inevitably happen with your layer as "layers" are just servers within servers. Server merging = layer merging in every sense
---
As demonstrated from the video above, the layer you're on isn't consistent. Layers merging won't cause confusion with server firsts because it's completely irrelevant there. You can group with people on different layers. Layers won't be able to develop their own communities because they're constantly shifting and changing by the day, as opposed to this temporary server idea where the servers will build an identity over the course of weeks or months before having it destroyed.
---
Layers are 'separate servers' only in the sense of minute-to-minute functioning. Their distinction from sharding primarily comes from that you won't be shifted between them randomly while playing, and it'll be consistent across zones. Sharding in modern WoW sees you move between shards from crossing zone borders or sometimes when just playing, which is jarring and disruptive (especially adding in that sharding is cross-realm). Layering is just slower, single-server, full continent sharding. If you believe that merging servers has as little impact as merging layers, I don't know what to tell you.
---
This is why TBC was the best expansion.
---
Here's a tip for any budding guild leadership out there in 40 mans, don't have your guild master be the raid leader.  The raid leader will generally be disliked, will have to make unpopular decisions, and occasionally will need to crack the whip, if the raid leader is the same person as the guild master it can breed animosity quickly.
---
However, if the guild master is more of a participant in the process, a sort of "Joe Everyman", he can remain popular, which is a huge boon for morale as well as preventing cliques from overwhelming your raid team.  Ideally you want your guild master to be kind of dumb (the likable dumb and not the belligerent dumb) and reasonably unselfish.  It is also really beneficial if he is a healer, as that particular group often catches blame, is in high demand, and tend to be a little more temperamental.
---
To everyone who participated, or tried, please answer this strawpoll, i'd like to see how many people actually got to play.

I'm a Vanilla Kid. We only know lol and rofl.

There was a comment about testing layer merges and there were disconnects so it's likely he got a layer all for himself :)

But where are the High elves of Quel’thalas
---
 And layering isnt shit show ?
---
"Will CC be allowed?"
---
All Elves have addiction problems
---
Hmm, yeah. I joined a guild that was already in late AQ40 and had BWL on farm status. I never experienced 'tough' BWL.
---
The amount of resisting parrying and dodging or missing seemed fine to me. Not really sure what you mean about the spawns either, we had 50 people waiting for the lvl 1 zombies at the forsaken starting zone to respawn. All of those quests too a while to do. I think I saw a couple rattlecage skeletons in the 2 hours I played. Like 3 lol
---
&gt; about arenas not being in the game
---
Gurubashi Arena? Hellooooo? Best arena in the game, you never know if suddenly 2 rogues pop up and backstab you from behind. Much more engaging if its a battleroyal instead of 2v2 3v3 or 5v5.
---
Nah I'm shitting of these 30 years old acting like 14 years old on coke to hype the viewers. I always find this kind of attitude fake and forced. whatever floats your boat.
---
 Id prefer an actual logical decision by blizzard, but its way easier to feed this broken ass layering since community seem to take it up their arse happily so why bother and spend extra resources?
---
 I can see that you think that from your previous comment, so no need to repeat that if you don't have to add anything else.
---
NP I'm happy to help.
---
It’s already like this
---
Yup, although. I got to play yesterday after work (I live in Norway). So it's all cool. This is to be expected though.   
---
Sad salty people.
---
&gt; An example for layering would be that there are only 10 level 50+s on the entire server, and most of them can't see eachother. How does that make any sense?
---
It makes sense though. Layers are like separate servers with ability to move players between them. 
---
"*here are only 10 level 50+s on the entire server, and most of them can't see eachother*" - Well, would you complain if they were on separate servers?
---
Even if this isn’t why the streamers were doing it, this is the correct answer. There was no /startattack macro in vanilla so you had to make a macro to manually use a certain button on your bar in addition to the ability it was being hotkeyed to. 
---
This was very important for example playing a rogue where you might want to switch targets and get lucky applying a poison from autoattacks even if you didn’t want to burn energy with an ability, which would happen in PvP often enough.
---
Personally I want the servers to crash for a week straight because 1500 people are trying to do level 1 quests at the same exact time. Maybe if I'm really diligent I can tag a boar/wolf or two after a few hours! 
---
Or we can have 80 servers per region and have all but 5 of them completely dead after the first 2 weeks, and then have people bitching and moaning because of server merging and name disputes. 
---
I'm honestly getting fed up with the whiny nerds on this subreddit in regards to layering. It's as if you guys think there's some magic fix that Blizzard can do that will solve the problem completely without accounting for population fluctuation... but I've yet to hear a single one!
---
That would suck real bad. What would be the point of servers at that point? Being more connected to everybody in the same server is important to form a strong community with people who you recognize and being able to group with anyone talking in the same chat as you is vital to that.
---
And you'll find that they are except it's not really toxic. It's just people shit talking and letting out steam, people should take what others say on a video game as seriously as they do nowadays. Shit happens and you fail, people are gonna be mad about it and say something.
---
We're not at work where we have to hold ourselves together at all times on the clock, we're playing a competitive game trying to win. If you die over and over again then you gotta expect that people are going to say something to you.
---
That's what Old Gods want you to believe :D
---
I disagree but see your point. I don't think we've ever seen any uncorrupted silithid? That alone makes me put on my tinfoil hat. I always see them as the wow equivalent of the Zerg, and as such they deserve to be part of the faction that controls them.
---
Yes, they’ll realize just why Classic is objectively a better mmorpg. Retail isn’t even the same genre anymore, it’s a diablo or destiny like mmo.
---
Unless that person has a life now lol.
---
 go home dad you're drunk.
---
But Hunters?
---
Joana is a dude, and he says he plans on sleeping every night, so he probably won't even be top 10 to 60.
---
I won’t because the Azerite system is fucking awful
---
yeah im guessing its intended you cant see those people from other servers 
---
they may plan to have the pvp and pve servers on the same server and just separate them with layers , essentially as a cost saving thing
---
Is this asmonbald?
---
I had really mixed results with the "layering", I was playing a troll rogue and I noticed the layering 2-3 times.
---
The first two times helped me out massively to be honest - one was killing the guy for the medallion in the cave, I was stood next to his corpse along with like 8 other people and then i got moved to a server where he was alive and i was the first one there. Easy kill from what could have been me waiting 20+ minutes to get the tag on him. Also near that cave system, I managed to move "layers" into a fresh one again which let me tag 4 imps in quick succession getting me to 11/12 - it had taken me quite a while before that to get the first 7, and even a few mins after to get the last one I needed.   
---
That being said, I can definitely see how annoying and frustrating that would be if it were the other way around, especially in a game where pulling an extra mob or two means a good chance of your death.
---
I was in that group, a lot of fun. :)
---
Ofc i know man, i might be doing something wrong but im not totally braindead. (2.4-2.5 exp WoD, Legion).  
---
As enh the mage cant start on me with sheep thanks to eartshock, and by that time i can get close to him and able to do an SS, he novas me blink or ran away try to cast poly again, i have back my shock, i can eat that poly with ground, and frost shock, or earth shock etc. i can interrupt mage with my shocks, with stun trinket ( idk the name atm) by engi helm. but with ret, i have only rep, hoj if i can get close to him.. Thats just my experience, not means that im right
---
If someone doesnt raid in retail then it is not due to gear. It has never been faster and easier to get yourself geared. I got my druid up to 390 ilvl within 3 hours of dinging 120. Its not exactly fun - but neither is doing a 3 hour BRD run only to once again get nothing. Like, if you cant endure gearing up in Retail you probably wont even make it to lvl 40 in Classic.
---
What if I told you that Blizz gave out 1k closed beta invites to the average player and 100 beta invites were given to streamers.
---
Now those 100 were not taken from the 1k pool rather they were given specifically to those individuals.
---
Meaning a streamer getting an invite did not take away from the average player getting an invite.
---
It's a record in /played not for first 60 ^^

The simplest thing he could have done is to demo shout when the rogue is deadzoning him. If you let a rogue get as many openers as he wants you are going to lose (no matter how many of them you resist with the orc crutch). You just demo shout shortly before you know you and the rogue would be leaving combat.
---
Yeah it's pure fanatism. Classic will be a blast, but let's face it : raids in vanilla weren't *that* great.

I would also like to know

Great analysis! No rip-off just a pure longing for Classic. Have a nice day!

No. It didn't happen in vanilla.

There will be queue!

Or just make enough servers &amp; eventually merge them together which is essentially the same thing as merging layers. This is stupid &amp; Blizzard is already bending on their promises.
---
Let it be
---
The layering felt weird sometimes. There was 2 moments where I was fighting a mob, then suddenly the mob and every other player/mob in my area phased and I seemingly switched into another layer. No I did not get invited to a group or something like that.
---
Also it's really weird to have people say stuff like "100+ horde fighting in Gurubashi/Elwynn" and then you go there and see NOBODY. Kills the immersion really hard. But I see how we need layering on launch, I just can't wait 'til we won't need that anymore.
---
I hope you will find a raid guild that will allow you to play with mortal strike build. Maybe they will even give you vendorstrike weapon to use for being MVP.

The stress test discovered that butthurt beta testers cannot take any stress.

Thats half the fun! Mob sniping, grabbing people into your group to try and get those quests done (only to realize you can't loot shit because one of your party members got the loot drop even though the guy is on the other side of the zone lol)

You and I both pick the same server, let's say we reach level 60 before anyone else. I'm in Azshara, you're in Azshara. We're the only people in that entire zone. And we can't see eachother.
---
Why? How does that benefit the performance of the servers?
---
Use sharding for the low end zones, they can adjust it if required. But there's no reason to slather layers over the entire game when it could only be applied to specific zones.

More difficult =| better. Your post clearly makes this false equivelance.

Cool. Great. And when the Devilsaur Mafia hordes tons of leather &amp; Lotus nodes are camped the economy is going to be just peachy. Remember this is worldwide and is going to last for 3-4 months (phase 1) which is a significant amount of time in game.

Imagine hunters having an easier time taming Broken Tooth because there's literally 2-3 of them that can be spawned at the same time on any given server. Bad stuff.
---
Yeah, I have no idea why a server merge a few weeks in is imagined as this huge traumatic event. I mean, on average, 2/3 or whatever of the people you killed Hogger with will have quit by then too, so it's not like there is no huge community change going on anyway.
---
By setting a clear end time for layering - content stage 2 - you have to accept that there will be servers with 1k prime-time population, and servers with 6k+ prime-time population. Because there is no way you could predict/control population development to get it closer than that consistently.

I disagree about charge/rend. If you try to charge you are just assuming you have better latency. The rogue is going to be mashing stealth and he will probably get it before you charge. And rend cant hurt to use, but it does not guarantee that the rogue cant stealth. He will just stealth and re-open in between ticks.
---
The key when you are getting kited like that is to just demo shout to keep the rogue in combat. Bandaging is good too, but IMO if you let a good ever see the "leaving combat" message flash across his screen, you deserve to lose and probably will.
---
i been saying that forever!
---
But who knows how long Phase 1 is going to be. This layering should be turned off as soon as it's possible.
---
Yes, there's a large number of players being terrible. But that still doesn't change the average player being better than back then. Try to play a online game these days and you'll see thousands of guides and even dog shit people expecting you to follow these guides or doing it themselves. It's a lot more common for people to do their homework.

This just shows that classic beta elite damage of mobs are off, should not be able to do this atall, should get nearly 1 shoted, just makes classic look less appealing if its going to be easy mode, hope blizz fix this shit
---
So you basically agree with me? The game just isn't hard, even for the average player, because he's better than the average player back then. I don't get your point. His 'raiding 4 times a week and didn't kill Razorgore' is definitely in a minority in today's standards.
---
&gt;Or just make enough servers &amp; eventually merge them together which is essentially the same thing as merging layers.
---
It isn't the same, because you can't have people with the same name on different layers for the same server. **How do we deal with naming/title disputes if we merge servers?** Not a single person has been able to answer that for me.

The whole point of layering is to hold the ratio (total players) / (layer number) somewhat constant. So there will be more people trying to exploit the system, but more layers to do it with. Should cancel itself out.
---
On the whole, this will not change the total amount gathered much. It's just that players exploiting the system will benefit at the expense of people deciding not to, because layer hopping is dumb, or was not in vanilla, or other reasons like that.
---
Layering is stupid. Merging different layers is essentially the same thing as merging different servers. Farmers are going to abuse the fuck outta this.
---
I'm gonna blow your mind. I was playing Ms Pac-Man yesterday.
---
This arguement that everyone parrots is so flawed. Layering is not the only solution. 
---
Queues, more servers, dynamic respawns are all viable alternatives.

The reference should be a static object, an object we know is the same height as it was. A mailbox, wagon, bridge, etc. Something in the original map files.

Comparing a spawned NPC to a player adds a lot of extra variables - so it's difficult to say what has changed.
---
See that post where Tips loses a duel to a rogue? People celebrating it  like Hitler was just assassinated. Anytime a streamer gets mentioned there's a group that just goes in and posts snide or hateful remarks. They are the minority though but are loud and obnoxious.
---
Layering should stop around lvl35 zones. All these "tourists", for whom this layering is made and who will stop playing the game around this cranked up exp values and quest drought, will drop the game and it won't be needed anyway.
---
They wont. Even if we assume that Classic has more players by then, developing content for retail is more profitable and less gruesome. WoW tokens, Account services, blizzard shop... all this stuff doesnt make money in Classic. And people in retail want new content all the time, meanwhile releasing new content for Classic had to be managed incredibly carefully with all the nochange folks around. If Blizzard wants to keep the retro train rolling, rereleasing TBC is the much easier route.
---
Why not both? People got better and the game got easier.
---
I feel you brother, but what pisses me off is not the bad players, losing games, heck we cant win every time ! It's the stupidity of people and the lack of basic human interaction. They can't be corrected, they cant understand they made a mistake, I don't know, feels like 80% of that community has some social and personal problems.
---
Literally this. My guild and I agreed that we felt more accomplished raiding Valley of Trials than we ever did in the past few expansions. Who knew getting a green weapon which is lvl 5 BIS would be so exciting
---
This discussion AGAIN. They haven't done a single thing wrong so far with how they handle Classic, 0 errors made. They've listened to pretty much all our concerns and have changed things to the way we want it or changed it into a compromise. And they know sharding/layering is a dealbreaker in the long run. They know the community fucking hates it, they won't have layering active longer than they've said. And that being said, it is needed, the first two weeks will be unplayable without it.
---
And 4k concurrent players is fine. There's 8k per faction on the stress test realm and there's no lag, so like... 4k is fine. As for the world itself 4k is also fine. And why can't you assume that they have a plan to avoid a server ending up with 12k players when they merge the layers? Like you think they designed layering and then went "Well what do we do if the server pop is too high for a merge? Dunno" like you really think they'd go that way? They could legit just cap the server, they could cap the layers, they could offer free transfers(which they did in vanilla). Like the most obvious problem they could face when merging layers is server population being too high and you really think they haven't thought about that? All this fucking outrage is so exhausting to read about it's like people jump to the worst possible solution/conclusion to problems and just assume that's how they are going to solve it.

Yea I agree, I did some CM's as brewie, but I played windwalker most of MoP and it was very engaging both in pvp and pve. Haha I also had a resto shaman in MoP! I think that was the best state the resto shaman ever was in, playstyle wise.
---
Level increased to 10. It would be nice if I entered the test and wasn't stuck on character create screen. Maybe I would level up haha.
---
Don't forget this isn't the finished version of their layering system yet. They announced they found alot of issues with it already, and haven't even gotten around to testing everything they wanted to test in the stresstest because of this. So anything you saw, might change. 
---
Though the second part of your comment is likely not gonna change, and is indeed something we need to accept, unless we want laggy servers/login queues/....
---
Man I know this isn't related at all but watching this really took me back to all the crazy and fun stuff we used to do in this game. I barely got to play Vanilla but in BC when I was around level 50-55 as a hunter, all I wanted to do was explore blackrock spire and hand in a quest in there. Found a few groups but all of them fell apart at one point or another, so I just said fuck it and tried to get through it on my own. 
---
I'd run through as far as I could, feign death, wait for readiness to come off cooldown, take a few more steps, feign death, etc etc... Keep in mind readiness was something like a 4 minute cooldown if you were specced properly. Sometimes I was able to have my pet tank one mob, trap another, wing clip another, and run through a bit further this way. It literally took 4-5 hours, but I explored that fucking place top to bottom and finally handed in my quest. Sounds stupid but it was honestly one of my fondest WoW memories.
---

Got some shaman questions for you:
---
Shaman leveling: Enh? Ele? Resto for hit?
---
If Enh: 2hand?  Flametounge dagger?  Both (based on the best item you find?)
---
Ouch.
---
I remember getting constantly ganked by a ret pally, logged into my main to kill him but right before he died he walked into a phased area and disappeared. 
---
From that moment on I hate any type of sharding/layering/phasing with a passion
---
I'll get deleted if I say server names, but one that got shut down SoC adjusted Paladin attack speed for no reason.  Some of them scaled with AP.  The big one right now seems to have a short internal cooldown so you can't double proc or back-to-back proc, probably because reck bombs are broken, so that's lowering burst.
---
Some of them you can do seal twisting and some you can't to take advantage of PPM on SoC which sometimes the dang PPM was wrong too.
---
It's not the only seal with issues either.  Seal of the Crusader doesn't always have a damage penalty or gives incorrect attack power/haste or doesn't scale with weighted stones.  Sometimes judgement of Light and Wisdom procs on Seal of Righteousness and some servers will not etc.
---
I don't think anyone but Blizz figured out how this crap should work.  Idk know what server got what right at this point.
---
I played CS:GO in high elo, in CS you can just mute everyone and go 1v5 way easier than League of Legends. I think league players are way cringier  (if that's a word) for their speech, and overall maturity. But yeah, I stopped playing every team based game without my mates.
---
I've mained both since 2005 but for Classic I'm at least starting with only one due to time. I was all set on Priest but now I'm leaning Paly, mainly for the Tier sets which I love and the mounts. I think Paly will be better for PvP, they're both great for PvE. 
---
The only thing that might sway me is if all I see are Human Paly's everywhere and hardly any Priests then I might swap. In the long run I'm pretty sure I'll level both tho.
---
Yeah, I would personally add layer switching to innkeepers, and make the instant switch on joining a group be optional with a longish (4 hours?) cooldown.
---
It depends. I used to raid lead a little on private servers in a pretty casual raiding guild, although we cleared all the content in a decent pace, but weren't competitive and didn't bother flasking. We usually brought a couple "unviable" specs to our raids. Had a balance druid almost every raid, enhancement shaman etc. When we hit a wall, we'd usually just ask them if they could heal next run instead, and they were always ok with that.
---
Makes me wonder why they even said 27th. I know EU is basically midnight there for release. Not sure about all EU time zones. But CEST 12midnight techniqually 27th. But still we are 8-6 hours behind that so 6pm in MA regardless. Being an American company I figured they would use the 26th as pr release date

---
This is why we have a beta.... so they see shit like this and can implement solutions. There are already rules in place for how layering works(guilds go on the same layer for example) and adding restrictions to how you swap layers shouldn't be too difficult. There are hundreds of ways they could fix what we see in the video.
---

---
You are not where you should be...
---
Mainly because of consoles. I doubt any pc user is buying physical copies of games anymore.
---
Layering worked fine while I was leveling, I think it gave a good balanced experience. But once we got to the special events, missing out on both Thrall and Ragnaros at the same time, it felt sad. I wonder why they couldn't spawn a boss on every layer.
---
Hopefully it won't be as problematic in live because a) the player base will be more spread out and b) special events like this 99% won't happen. I like to think this was also to test how layering works with a big population, so they can smooth out side effects.
---
And there is one thing I've learned from this. Twitch streamers need to be banned from advertising in chat. I don't mind streaming, watch some myself, but it got very annoying how some people spammed trade chat near the end. Granted that chat was far gone with all the INV RAGNAROS, but somehow that was more tolerable.
---
For some people it is. I personally like to be challenged and better myself to be the best i can be. But you’re right of course, some people don’t care about that and vanilla raids certainly feel epic and not as stressful and some people love that.
---

Jesus christ dude this is why we have a goddamn beta, so they can fix shit like this. There's so many fixes they could implement to prevent layer swapping at will.
---
There's a bit more nuance available than that.
---
Enough to fuck a server's economy.
---
I think it's a combination of getting better (know more / better tutorials) and Blizz that makes the game easier. But it was deadlier, but not as hard as the moths of the players.
---
To be honest, I thought it was harder in my memory than it now shows the beta.
---
Proof that Monks, DH's and Dk's were shit back in vanilla.

Also the Racials on Draenei, worgen, pandaren didn't even work. Fix your shit blizz. /s
---
I have only played in BfA. Can someone explain what is layering?
---
this is going to be really sad
---
it's really nice seeing the same guy in a level 40 zone that you grouped with back in westfall. Fuck layering anywhere other than 1-10 zones.
---
Me condemning his actions for what they are is instigating? I'm sorry if you're a fan of this guy but the way he *litterally said* what I said above to me is a toxic mentality. If you are finding enjoyment in keeping other people from enjoying the game, then that is not about PvP at all, that's just being a toxic person. I'm not calling for people to jump on this guy, i'm not saying anything more than my opinion: this guy is a dick for being like this and trying to explain it away.  
---
If you don't want to see that, that's fine. But don't try to flip it around simply because you don't agree with me.

---
One thing that added to the drama was the master loot system. This caused a lot of inequality, which in turn meant that a guild's more frequent players wanted to move up in difficulty before the rest of the group was ready.
---
In regards to the obvious layering issues, I really think we need to remember that the stress test was an opportunity for Blizz to play around with the layers, test out all the things that could possibly be done with the system, and see it's effects on an active server while people were playing on it. Now, unfortunately I didn't get to play, but as far as I understand the fact that it was a complete shitshow was mostly because they were testing it out, right? I'm guessing that on launch they will never have people randomly shift layers in the middle of fighting in a cave, however, I do see how accidentally zoning in and out of Thunder Bluff while questing in Mulgore would be a HUGE pain in the ass / immersion killer if the two zones end up having different layers.
---
Well getting 40 competent people to play at somewhat equal level is quite the effort. Even in the mythic guilds I’ve been in there are some serious underperformers sometime and that’s only 20 people :p
---
Vanilla raids are epic for sure, but in my opinion when you’ve seen them plenty of times they lose their magic. Stepping into BWL or MC for the first time ever was an amazing feeling, and I had no clue what the hell I did. It was glorious.
---
The first 60s won't have to compete with eachother for materials as they'll probably be on separate layers. Where's the fix for that? They won't even need to swap layers.
---
Layering is going to destroy the server economy.
---
Fucking hated what they did with "draenei."  After playing WC3 it just didn't make sense for them to suddenly be blue space goats.
---
There's a new stress test next week because blizzard didnt get to test everything they intended since they ran into the log-in issues so they focused on that on this stress test instead.

So basically when you are shaman you have engineering but if you are ret you don't?

As a mage you don't ever have to hardcast vs a enh shaman. and there's just simply no way you lose the fight. You can lose to paladins tho because constant dispells on yourself and survivability.

Druid - Nature's Grasp

What you're describing is sharding. Layering is something different, you can't layer a specific zone, the entire point of layering is to make 2x Eastern kingdoms or Kalimdor to avoid the issues that sharding creates.
---
Maybe, but I don't think so. There's something really fun about starting as a nobody with really shitty gear, and through hard work and many many fights, becoming an actually accomplished adventurer.
---
Just checked, I got it too. So hyped, hard to stay at work and actually work :D
---
Because everyone that picked Server 1 will only ever be able to play with people on Server 1 even with layering going on.
---
If I pick server 2 because I wanted to avoid streamers that were on server 1, then 2 months later blizzard tells everyone, "oh hey server 1 and server 2 are merging together" have fun it's going to annoy people
---
Also if they merge servers they have to come up with a solution for possible name issues. If I'm on Server 2 with the name Jimmy and all of a sudden we are merged with Server 1, I don't want to have to change my name, and I also don't want to be known as Jimmy-(server 2) and have to worry about whispering/sending mail to my friend Billy-(server 2) instead of whoever happens to be Billy-(server 1)
---
So you want sharding then. What you're describing is sharding.
---
In a few words... its like “stances” of the same world to divide the players.
---
That avoid 50 PJ’s trying to kill the same NPC in the release day... for example.
---
Layering is a way to divide the players into different levels so that the server load is distributed and the end user client is not lagging. Layering is not divided between different realms like sharding, but remains on the same realm, simply with its own "instances".
---
I hope this is explained in an understandable way.
---
I see, thank you!
---
When a rogue enters stealth it still plays the modern stealth sound and it's missing the "thud" sound when the action bar changes to stealth skills.

I based this on stream footages. Can anyone with a rogue in beta confirm it with known sound settings?

Same situation, same raids on farm, could not get the razorgore fight down.  Guild never broke up, but they did kind of gravitate towards pvp after that.

As usual there are those special few, that are loud and feel like spreading anything but love and understanding. 
---
I have been watching the streamers and man I'm glad they are there. And it makes a lot of sense that they got access. 
---
1. Generates hype (proven by the viewing numbers). 
---
2. When the top 10 classic streamers play, they have between 100k - 200k eyes on them that point out bugs with them, helping them find those bugs. 
---
3. It's not a large scale beta test to check if the content is good, cause we already know it is. It's a quality assurance beta.
---
For those of you that have the itch, check out the streamers. The most wholesome ones, and least toxic in my opinion is "Tipsoutbaby" and "Esfandtv". They are just nice folks.

Afaik Shield Block pushes crits off the table, you're right that you cannot block a crit because a crit cannot happen on a blocked roll.
---
When an attack occurs a primary roll is made to see if the attack is missed, dodged, parried, blocked or hits. If a hit is confirmed a secondary roll is made to determine if its a crushing blow, crit or glancing. after that comes damage.
---
This means that keeping Shield Block up pushes both crits and crushings off the table, since you're incapable of taking a full hit with SB.
---
Layering is a better version of sharding. Sharding is like zones being separate servers within a server, with a maximum number of players being visible to each other. This obviously eases the workload of the server. However, some people thinking sharding removes an essential part of Classic as you will probably not see the same people again. If you and another player (not in your party) transition between zones, chances are you will be put in different shards.   
---
   
---
Layering is better, because you wont see people disappear when transitioning zones or if your “layer” becomes too populated.
---
Eh, as a (dwarf) warrior, I had like a 70% winrate against rogues in duels. Granted good use of stoneform played a role in that, but way too many rogues panic at warrior burst and make it worse for themselves by popping evasion reflexively.
---
Sure u can have engi as ret, but as shaman you have 5-6 sec interrupt and a grounding. And you can deal dmg from range as shaman with shocks, while i was not able to get close to mages, even if i did i had zero dmg on them.
---
If your main focus is raiding then you want to drcudd if you want you spend most of your time casting 1 spell as a mage over and over (plus water pre-raid), or most likely being resto spec as druid.
---
Druid will have a really easy time gearing up in tier gear, but other gear will have some competition besides feral specific leather. Mages will most likely only have to compete against warlocks if your guild doesn't let off specs bid on spell power gear note. Just note that mages are most likely going to be one of tgr most popular classes this time around.
---
Hope this helps you decide

Correct, I dont care about people who wont be sticking around. Sorry I just dont. 
---
Minor now, Then we find an addon to hop layers or we start selling layer hops (which if this goes through im going to make bank doing) or farming rare mobs or quest mobs. Its only a non issue to you becasue you havent thought about the abuse this will see. 
---
Not seeing other players for 1 will ruin intrest, When you wind up on layer 2 all on your own what joy will be had. Then we can get into the end game of farming rare materials but I think we all know that would be terrible. 
---
If you care about a log in queue you never had plans to stick around anyway. I welcome to queue and packed starting zones and quest areas I honestly do. I welcome them becasue I know I had planned on staying around so not getting to max in the first week is not an issue for me, Ill take it at pace. Its classic not BFA. 
---
If you cant enjoy the social aspect of the game like just shooting the shit with people if they zones are too packed then sure layering is perfect for you, I would love to sit around and chat or hell level 1 raid hogger for a night fuck lets all run to org do some fun thats not on the schedule but I guess fun has no place in classic wow. 
---
I agree this single exploit of the system wont be the end but the death of server community will be. Why would I talk to player Z if im never going to see them again? At that point they are an NPC to me. 
---
There are tons of options outside of layering and you know it. We all know it. Im in the boat of leave it as it is then merge servers that die at the end of the month. We went through server merges before and they were fine.

* Im not sure if you are saying this is how it is or this is how they could do it but layering could last phase 1 they have already said this much so be ready for 3-6 months of it rather than just starting zones, God I will never complain about sharding the starting zones again even that would have been better.
---
* So would you limit it based on log in? IP? Character? Account? All easy to get around. Why bother limiting it if you are just going to be able to hop layers with an invite anyway? 
---
* Blizzard say a lot of things, Iv been playing a long time and I know Blizzards word means literally nothing, Not a month ago their word was "sharding in starting zones only" now its phase 1 next month its phase 2 but not world bosses, Week after its world bosses too etc etc etc. 
---
Really simply solution, Add at least 1 pve and 1 pvp server where its the real game without any of these silly extra systems that will ruin the game for players like myself. Im fine with the queue, Means I can have a bath and grab some food before I start to play for the night. Im fine with lots of people being around me the whole time becasue I love the MM part of MMO. What im not a fan of are fractured communities and easily explotiable unnecessary systems.
---
Honestly thought he brought up some really good points. If you watched the entire video you would have also seen the "sniping" clip with a little more context which really helped his case a lot. Seems pretty reasonable to and outsider with no skin in the game.
---
The difference is that it is probably more work involved merging servers that it is merging layers on an existing server. They might even have to do server merges manually for all we know. Merging servers can also create tremendous faction imbalances, issues with duplicate data, naming conventions etc. From a technical standpoint merging servers sounds way more complex than merging layers who share one common denominator for unique data - the server.
---
Why would you ever want to disable the glow?
---
The most important question.
---
or 12/6
---
"We" need it so that Blizz can save money and doesnt need to setup 40 servers if they can use 4 servers with each having 10 layers.
---
Easy money bois
---
Well, both views have their raison d'être. The ultimate classic experience would really be to wait 30min + for a mob, as there are 200 more players waiting for it. Or the client laggs or even crashes because there are too many players.
---
The question is whether this really belongs to nostalgia or whether 5-10min wait like 4-5 weeks after the vanilla release rather reflects the memory and the game.
---
Hey I'm not in the beta (yet) - but I've played too much Warrior on private servers doing ALOT of duels, thought i can share some insight.  I always start with sword/board for the opener, and rarely find myself switching to 2hander. Weapon swapping does reset your swing timer, so with a slow weapon (usually 3.8 sec) you're hurting.   
---
Anger Management + Booming Voice talents really make rogues a lot easier aswell.
---
Report this as a bug as you god damn should, it is a beta report things that dont work as intended and hope it is fixed before august
---
Because they expect a huge number of tourists that will try the game just to see what all the fuss is about and then quit in a week a two.
---
Sharding/layering is there to launch with higher caps than what the game is designed for (to account for tourists) and avoid ending up with many dead servers less than a month from launch.
---
Live to win on repeat

Okay
---
50 FPS in boralus doesn't sound normal for a 1070 with that CPU, I run a 1060 and get ~100 in boralus, you should be getting way more.  
---
Are you sure you're using the dedicated GPU instead of integrated ?  
---
Did you turn on adaptive power management in NVIDIA control panel ?
---
shrug, if the worst you can come up with is toxic you have nothing to talk about
---
Hard bass, true vanilla experience
---
Hunter has three levels to it really
---
Basic: You auto shot, multishot and aimed shot on CD, and make sure to Tranq any frenzy effects
---
Intermediate: You've got a weapon swing addon and time your aimed/multi's to right after you shoot as they reset attack animation to maximize DPS.
---
Expert: You do the above while also rotating in and out of melee range to get swings inbetween shots as well as the melee weapon (afaik) doesn't reset the ranged weapon swing.
---
My guess is that since the world is much smaller it takes less load on their servers. But idk
---
That's not how friends and family works. It's friends and family of Blizzard employees, not streamers.
---
&gt; do i have to resub to get into beta?
---
Yes.
---
&gt; are they still giving away beta keys or not?
---
As far as I know, no.
---
Yes, I want sharding for the low level zones only, rather than what is essentially sharding for the entire world.
---
RemindMe! 100 days "set brightness"
---
You don’t have to. You just need 50,000 followers on twitch instead.
---
RemindMe! 97 days “dothis”
---
Yeah for me the classes just feel so streamlined now. My warrior lost so much depth over the years I can't wait to be stance swapping for pummel/intercept. Swapping my weapons for shield wall etc.
---
RemindMe! 97 days do this
---
Yes, you need an active subscription to participate in the beta.
---
The second question can only be answered by Blizz, but the interviews show that there are very few keys left, if any at all...
---
The hype is big, but having a hype up for 3 months is difficult. Blizzard should have announced it like beginning of July. 1 month of play and 1 month of hype, that way ppl will not get burned out by watching streams everyday.
---
It was just a joke about saying that warriors are very easy, while in reality they was getting a rude awakening lvl 10-60. If serious, I really think that most people created what they are currently looking to play on release.
---
I never listen to anything other than the game.
---
Here is a bit of exploration around both continents during the entire day we had access to the stress test server. Going to all these places at level 5 was not an easy thing to do but that was a lot of fun for sure!

It really doesn't, i doubt you will even notice it. "Those people would have quit anyway" it's like a lot of people in this sub doesn't even want new people to play and enjoy classic, "wuh wuh retail babies can't manage the hardcore grind of classic" it's a 15 year old game just drop the fucking gatekeeping already, you aren't special.
---
Fuck knows, the screaming is annoying as fuck, I would not want to play with anyone who shouts into their mic when you kill a boss.
---
Another entitled zoomer steps up to the podium and gives us his valuable 99 cents.
---
Aaaaaaand we're moving on.
---
I have not configured it at all, not turned anything on or off. I’m sure I’m using the 1070 as my
---
Main. I get 100fps in ESO no problem. 
---
I get like 150-250 in open world no problem but the moment there’s a good amount of people fighting a world boss I start lagging a little.
---
I remember talking about the then upcoming TBC expac in chat about how they were gonna add new races for each side. They were speculating on what the Horde race was, since the trailer only showed the Belfs. I remember saying something like, "Whatever it is, they won't be Draenei. That'd be retarded." Boy was I wrong.

yet you need to point out huh? bring attention in that way and then call him a dick? dude you are clueless and a waste of time. keep rationalizing in favor of your own perspective and then be unaware of it.... again you blatantly called this guy a dick.... and you're not toxic for it? and then you proceed to post his video and effectively mock him and you're not toxic?
---
Fair enough. I just wish retail had more middle of the road content. There's only challenging content at end game. And honestly, I haven't raided real raids since Cata, but the hardest content was too hard for me. From WotLK to Cata, I don't think we ever got the hardest hard modes down of any dungeon tier while it was relevant content. It's like the easy content is just a boring time sink and the hard stuff is too hard.
---
You cannot grief in wow, it's actually impossible.
---
&gt; I've been farming ore and herbs during Legion with realm hop addon and nobody stopped me.
---
Realmhopping has been made more difficult a few times. But the convenience sharding adds to players and the savings it enables on the backend side just don't compare to some people farming nodes by hopping.
---
100%. It's the fact that you can move in between layers that's the problem.
---
I got two of them in two consecutive runs with my mage (I had cleared it like 30 times before, but then two in two runs). It was a shame it was unique 1h item back then and I sold the other one. After a while it became non-unique and you could dual wield them. Oh the times.
---
Class design is 90% of gameplay
---
I did a side by side comparison in the undead starting area, and the beta client is far brighter.
---
There is no such thing as tourists. People leave bfa in one week not because they are tourists but because the game is bad. When the game is good players quiting &lt; new players. When the game is bad players quiting &gt; new players.
---
I played at launch and while it was pretty packed the starting zones nowhere near pserver launch or stress test levels. The real population bottleneck came when all 3 starting areas lead to Barrens. The Crossroads was an absolute mad house.
---
If people's idea of fun is 6000+ people spread across 6 zones at launch, all fighting over a few handful of spawns so they can hopefully eke out enough experience to move on then they want a very different experience than I do on launch.
---
Oh gosh, Nothing I hate more than bad players that won’t admit they suck, esp streamers.
---
I was in the 450-550 range which was better than PS, but still. Reeeally hope there's gonna be an Oceanic Server.
---
Hehe
---
Love these inane replies. It's a beta, which is exactly why people should be raising these issues and starting a conversation about them. What do you think the purpose of a beta is?
---
I loved that they would sometimes make a long event out of it. The bodies would slowly show up over hours and it always stuck around for longer than I expected. Funny stuff.
---

So am i in? :/ i can’t check right now
---
Play shaman because Alliance is for pussies.
---
You just run behind it, nothing interesting there sadly :c
---
Hello and welcome :)
---
I'm not gatekeeping at all, it's simply a fact that there will be an attrition rate. You can insult me all you like over it, but facts are facts.
---
I'd love it if everyone quit retail and they all played classic. But that simply won't happen.
---
It really does cheapen the experience because I intend to be at the tip of the spear when it comes to levelling. When there's 20 other level 40s in the zone, and I don't see anyone, I'll notice.
---
They said Legion was the only not half assed expansion.
---
Completely apart from the fact that you should also enjoy playing, here's my recommendation:
---
What do your friends play? I think make it dependent on what they play, then you can level "better".
---
You will always find a raid guild and both classes are always needed. If you will play as a shadow, then probably not, but otherwise everything should always be needed.
---
Hell, I created a raid group myself in Vanilla so I could be the main tank and was taken over by the best raid guild on the server a few weeks later when my raid group broke up.
---
Remindme! 96days "ddooo"
---
Bullshit. Show me where they said only a couple of weeks. Blizzard always does this bait &amp; switch tactic.
---
Yeah its the same reason i quit, the rest of the game couldnt be carried by raids anymore :(
---
The technology isn't the issue, it's the game world. The game world cannot support 12k players, you can easily spin up a VM that can handle 50k concurrent players, but the WORLD in the MMO you're playing was designed for like 3-4k concurrent players, it cannot support much more then that. That's the entire reason for sharding/layering.
---
they could bid low, even 1 DKP....if no one else wanted it, then they'd get it. If they didnt bid, they didnt get it. Everyone had to silently bid for it.
---
I was on as alliance last night Aussie time and there were people in world chat sprouting all kinds of bullshit about where hoard were gathering and when you shift clicked the commenters they were nowhere near the area they were claiming so I'd be more inclined to blame the BS rather than the layering.
---
Thanks for posting these! As someone who didn't get into the stress test (at least this time around) I love still being able to see what went down, and it gives me hope for the spirit of Classic. I hope there will be just as much mayhem at the end of future tests &gt;:)
---
Also &lt;Stressed Testers&gt; made me chuckle lol
---
I won't comment on how much Blizzard cares, but it would at least make sense if they prioritize it less on retail because gold and mats are generally less important. Sure you still need them, but in Classic gold matter much more, so much that it is a core part of the game. You need gold to progress in Classic, on retail I don't ever farm I just always have gold when I need something really.
---
So of course they have it in their minds that you can exploit things on retail, but the priority list might look different. Adding to that, retails list of things to do is much bigger. I mean, alone class balancing is a permanent struggle, where Classic won't have those problems - they can focus solely on fixing bugs or exploits of layering.
---
You're forgetting about Felwood plants, something that you *have to* farm on the character you want to use them on.
---
Regarding the different methods, you're right and if you want to level one to be able to farm in a different way, so you're not always doing it the same way, then be my guest, but then you're violating the condition I had on my initial statement (i.e. for the sole purpose of farming gold) since there's other other reasons.
---
Personally I don't intend to farm at all (other than the felwood herbs which you can't get in other ways) You never earn good money from farming unless you're in a very secret club who knows of an exploit
---
The idea that anyone would think that the problems caused by massive overpopulation early in the game's life would be a *good thing* is just silly to me.
---
Blizzard is actively going to be removing all kinds of bugs and exploits that were present in 1.12, but wouldn't those also be part of the "ultimate classic experience"? Kiting Kazzak into newbie zones? Using sandworms to glitch into AQ before it opens? Walling jumping to invulnerability in WSG?
---
Yes It was removed because China didn’t want blood in their games
---
lmao merging a layer and merging a server isn't even remotely close to being the same thing both from a technical standpoint(i would guess) and from a practical one.
---
The variant was class loot, the 5 different rolls was competing for loot with 4 others of your class, and the slap on top was getting pally loot on horde. Oh and the whole less than 0.5 items of loot per person per raid.
---
God damn, Destiny really is retarded.
---
Who the fuck needs arenas when there is a 100+ player fucking warzone happening in Hillsbrad?  The best 2v2's, 3v3's and 5v5's in the game happen in Blackrock Mountain organically.
---
Also, has anyone even done the 1-120 grind recently? Even with Heirlooms that shit takes way too fucking long
---
I'd assume it will be, it was back in 2010 which is the earliest I've managed to find using archive.org. Under Code of Conduct for punishable offences;

---
Where is this intelligence?
---
It wouldn't have really made sense for Blood Elves to join the Alliance.  In WC3 they just got fucked by the humans, and they fucked over the night elves by freeing Illidan.  
---
Lorewise they had to go to Horde (though they did throw story out of the window with space goats).   
---
The only justification for them to go to Alliance is because they were pretty. 
---
Horde should have had goblins from the start though.
---
BFA has nothing to do with this, what's happening right now with Classic is unprecedented.
---
The hype is huge after people have been asking for this for over 10 years, a lot people have heard about it that never played this kind of game before.
---
It's not comparable to just quitting an xpac because it's bad, if you buy BFA you already know you at least like MMOs and/or WoW, this time there will be people who know nothing about it, many may like it but many will not.
---
But see you have no way to back up that claim, because it is impossible to factually back up. The known fact is that no one can predict the future and anyone can make guesses about what's going to happen.
---
Nope. Windows 10 doesnt like users tweaking their interface.

To be fair he didn't call anyone a dick he said "being a dick" there is a difference.. Sonii literally stopped what he was saying when he realized what he was saying was actually toxic and tried to backtrack and justify how for some reason it wouldn't be toxic when he does it
---
Never had an issue with this. I can understand folk saving for the big item .... such as the T2 legs as they only dropped off Rags, but thats then totally upto the raider to make this choice.  If folk dont want items, then thats their own choice. Others in a 40 man raid will bid, and will be successful in getting the items needed. 
---
With silent bids, not one can fk anyone over.  You bid what you think an item is worth to you. If it a a big upgrade and you Want it, bid High...if not, bid low and you might get it. 
---
Same with off specc gear, folk could bid really low....and maybe get it for like 1-5 dkp....their choice.
---
You gotta be fair this one. Although class design in BFA is currently.. really bad, people generally felt Life Tap to be archaic when combined with the more "refined" rotations. Even with the Mana Tap talent allowing for a maintainable buff on Life Tap casts it just felt really clunky and annoying to use. 
---
But that's mainly because the game has shifted in the direction that it makes Life Tap feel annoying instead of helpful. And even though all three specs are spender/builder they all three feel distinct enough.
---
" no real loot system to work towards gear" Are we playing the same game?
---
Right now it's way too easy to get gear. If you mean badge-like from wotlk etc. there's titanium residuum which gives you the highest iLvl azerite pieces for some reason.
---
I honestly think BFA would be a pretty decent game if it wasn't attached to what it used to be. The main reason people are mad is how it turned out, but without knowing what it could have been I don't think it would be as unpopular as it is now. A lot of people are mad (including me) because of all of the things we loved about the game has either been simplified or outright removed.
---
YES
---
Mate, nobody thinks levelling in retail is harder than Classic. When people say Retail is harder, they're referring to Max Level Dungeon and Raid design. Seriously don't know what's so hard to understand about this.
---
Because I dont want to Need 2 hours to kill 10 wolves in northshire when the game Releases....
---
and bear form to break slows, roots and can't be poly'd
---
Imagine that there are plenty of people who don't want to play an essentially pirated version of the game.
---
Honestly I would love to see M+ of ALL classic dungeons become a thing eventually hahaha so like 2 years from now running m10 deadmines or something at 60 Haha would be a cool way to keep things fresh and run hard versions of low level dungeons in vanilla. Iunno just me I guess
---
*sigh* this is why they have the beta. To test it. It's not supposed to be easy to manipulate. Software has bugs, you test it to fix the bugs. I would call this clip an unintended feature of layering, aka a bug.
---
I was added a week ago as F&amp;F and didn't get invited today so not sure what is going on exactly. They might be doing really small pre-locked waves of F&amp;F only.
---
anyone playing Overwatch is an incel
---
You're wrong. You don't need a big sample size for everything. The damage difference here is so big, that you don't need a big sample size. It's like finding the drop ratio on an item that drops 80% of the time, you don't need to do many runs to find out it's 80%. A scenario where you need a big sample size would be on a rare 0.01% drop.
---
Tanks and Priests are always needed. Guilds need several tanks. You can off spec DPS if a guild has a main tank. 
---
Play whatever class you like playing and worry about end game raiding once there, as there are tonnes of guilds and groups looking for all types of players.
---
Also, the Classic hype started building up ever since the Nost team flew over to the Blizzard HQ. That's a fucking long time.
---
so if an mmo is active for like 15 years, the story shouldn't progress?

Do you play retail? See if good guilds are looking to migrate to classic (they will need extras). Look at private server guilds that may have players not look to grind again/reroll (not very likely). Hit 60 fast and get in on UBRS/Strat/Scholo runs. Tell people you are looking. By fast I mean one week.
---
Blizzard has banned entire guilds for the action of a few members. So nah.

It was actually me

---
"I've got a flying machine!" - Gnomes WC2
---
Oh you mean exactly like the people who dinged 60 before everyone else back in the day? The only difference is it will apply to slightly more people.
---
And you don't even KNOW if they will be on separate layers. They've already said they are grouping people into layers based on stuff like being in the same guild. Grouping people into the same layers based on level isn't very different, they might do something like that. There's so many ways they could fix this but all you people are saying is "layering bad, there is no way to make it work. I assume they haven't thought of any way to exploit this so everyone will exploit it"
---
&gt;You can only move layers if your invited to group
---
This is the problem, people can easily communicate and exploit group invites, basically removing any restrictions on layer. It doesn't matter if you are *always* locked into the same layer, if a group invite can remove that restriction.
---
I've seen people talk about then adding restrictions to group inviting, for example a "cooldown" on layer jumping even with group invites, but that would be extremely annoying when you play with a friend, he logs off and you might want to play with another friend or similar situations. Essentially, any restriction to layer jumping will also result in restriction on playing with friends, which is just a horrible idea.
---
There simply isn't a perfect way to do this. Layering will, one way or the other, have some impact on the game. The thing is, doing nothing will most likely be worse. I don't want to end up in situations where most servers die after a month and we need mass merges. Who knows, I might be forced to merge with a realm full of famous streamers, something I'd *hate*. It would ruin the whole realm choice and then the obvious community merging damage is going to be annoying. Neither do I want to sit in several hours queue the first week because they made too less realms than needed just so they fit when tourists leave.
---
Yes, I get that people don't want layering, but honestly most people hating on it either don't have an alternative solution, or the solutions they have are shit and they just didn't think it through. I've seen so many people make condescending comments about how shit it is and how easy they can make a better system, yet their system would ruin Classic - they just didn't see all the problems with they "brilliant idea".
---
I made a few improvements for the second guide here: [https://youtu.be/XW2g3Xcucqg](https://youtu.be/XW2g3Xcucqg)
---
sad part is stress test is probably the most group participation we will experience though because it united ppl with one purpose.
---
Im sure classic servers are gonna be more lively than retail and pservers but i bet its only a matter of weeks before the "united" feeling is gone and ppl raging over other ppl tagging their mobs etc. :P
---
But we aren't China, and China has their own client since dead players are a tombstone there and not a skeleton and the undead have proper robes  (to hide the bones).
---
Unless all that changed in the last few years, but China used to have a seperate client.
---
There is a map addon, that replaces the normal map graphics with more detailed map. But guessing you are after a non-fullscreen map replacement.
---
The way my Blizz friend explained it to me is that waves are pre-locked/selected and depending on when you were added is when you get in. So people have some perception that random drawings are going on but it seems like they already pre-selected multiple waves of invites ahead of time and being added as F&amp;F just means you're guaranteed to eventually get put into a wave once all the older locked/selected waves are done.
---
to be even more fair, its perplexity. i would blindly bet 500$ that 99% of the people commenting on this post would be destroyed by him any day.
---
but yeah tips is extremely average at pvp.

Stresstest most likely. Looks exactly the same for me and I was in Stresstest.

Nice catch. I hope they fix it since seeing the flash and blood gives the combat a better feeling. Like you are actually doing dmg.

DON'T SAY BAD WORD ABOUT LAYER. LAYER IS GOOD, ION IS GOD!
---
two different games
---
My best advice would be the "Free Agent" approach.  Don't join a guild until you're lvl 60. Keep your options open and dont burn any bridges. Reputation is key so try to make a name for yourself during the leveling process either as a good healer, tank, dps, or just a friendly and helpful individual. Work on getting dungeon keys, attunments, professions etc.
---
Even the most hardcore launch guilds can fall very short of their launch expectations early on.
---
The first thing HC guilds do is /who 60 when they are looking to fill up their ranks during the first few weeks of launch. More often than not they will seek you out rather than the other way around.
---
I'm guessing your problem is actually "what if I can't find a **good** guild that needs a tank?" and that's a valid concern. While guilds will always be on the lookout for tanks and healers the competition for tank slots is much much higher.
---
&gt; with multiple layers is getting harder to control the devilosaur farm. the devilosaur mafia wont be a thing with layering.
---
Considering that layering will be active for around 3 months at best, while Classic will last for much, much, much longer, the Mafia will get a field day when layers get merged as soon as Phase 2 rolls around.
---
Probably like the runescape servers for oceanic where they're based in US
---
So if the system will inevitably be abused, how about we just don't do the system at all.
---
Groundbreaking suggestion, I know.
---
Damn, that sucks. I can't even bring myself to play BFA as a trial let alone fool around in pservers... Guess the wait must continue!
---
Solving the abuse of layering sounds like it wouldn't be that hard. Blizzard just needs to implement that you're locked to a single layer for 5 minutes when logging out. That way you can't layer-hop to abuse nodes &amp; herb spawns. Layering is basically more servers but just virtually instead of physical servers.
---
I don't get your argument about 3 layers 3k people on each. Yes then that server is "full" and new players will have to join a different server? How is that different from a server with 1 layer and 9k players?
---
And yes it does solve the issue of overcrowded zones, which they still will be btw but not to the same extent.
---
Same. I don't even think I played the live servers at all while the private server was up. Maybe just raids. The whole thing was so memorable.
---
Sure, or we just don't use layers at all so everyone can play with everyone.
---
Now that’s they’ve added another test for the same people on the 29th it might not disappear just yet. It’s what I took from the blue posts so we’ll see in time!
---
And they might just group people into layers based on levels, you don't know. The entire reason for layers is to not break the immersion the way sharding does, easy fix is to group people into layers based on guild(they've already confirmed they will do this and "other criterias") and level.
---
"Those people would have quit anyway when the shine wears off and the grind begins." - Yeah you're not simply stating facts, i mean you're right but you're being a dick about it.
---
Wrong, if you use raptor strike it should automatically switch to melee auto attack. It's a bug.
---
Yesterday I was questing in Ashenvale clearing camp and withint 30minutes I switched layers like 3 times and without my Voidwalker sacrafice I would have died 3 times because everytime I aggro'ed like 5 Mobs spawning right around me.
---
That why I fucking just want more Servers and not this Layering garbage! Just merge the Servers afterwards.
---
For me the last panel its just getting into the server with my main name.
---
Once i log in the first time, im going to take a big deep breath and just revel in the fact im back :)
---
I think it's funny that the people throwing around the words "incel" and "toxic" also tend to be heavily pro-changes, generally accepting of anything Blizzard does, etc.
---
They literally sound like pro-retail, anti-vanilla people from the official WoW forums. I have seen some people here unironically use the phrase "rose tinted goggles".
---
I also enjoy streamers, but any streamer (or prominent figure) who shit on Classic, and shit on the Classic community, should definitely not be invited to the party. Anyone who disagrees with this is almost certainly a 2017+ bandwagoner.
---
Just like they said at first that layering will only be used for starting zones?
---
Big lmao, they keep pushing and you people keep giving them ground.
---
I was in the stress test too and I only have WoW3. I saw somebody with closed beta access earlier had WoW2 and WoW3 but not WoW1. So I honestly have no idea lol.
---
ya if you read my other comment before the last one you would have seen I talked about time investment. fatsack about summed it up.. and I might add having a fatsack helps with realizing these things.
---
If you have any standalone graphics card and some 4-core processor, im sure you can find playable settings.
---
Thanks for sharing! Man, this is what I so miss about WoW, the massive amounts off people killing a mob, those big raids, that is a MMOrpg.
---
So glad we can do it all again. I miss the MMO and RPG aspects of WoW.
---
I....just....what???
---
Block the ip the layer is on??
---
Do you have any idea what you’re talking about?
---
What if he gets injured in the way? It may be 20-30yrs then
---
I wasn't counting TBC and wrath because they still followed the philosophy of old wow. I meant every expansion since cataclysm. Mists was also okay as it went more back to just being an explorer in a new land.
---
I think WoW1 May be from legion ptr and WoW2 is the closed beta and WoW3 is stress test I’m guessing, rip.
---
Yeah. That is what I was mostly concerned with. 2 or 3 tanks per raid, where you can have about 5 healers. Two or three of them priests. Tanks will be a more competitive role, where I don't see many jumping to be healers. Fear ward from dwarf would make me more appealing as well.
---
Well of course! Layering is a really shitty modern arcade "mmo"-rpg system, how can he not be dismissive?
---
&gt; make it worse for themselves by popping evasion reflexively.
---
xDDDD
---
Here's a very simple solution : restrict layering to only starting zones.  
---
Blizzard said it's to limit the chaos at the start, so why not simply have layering in starting zones ? And eventually capitals.
---
They said, they will expend the layers, and reduce the number of them as people spread out in the world, and demand lessens. That indicates it wont be around for long after launch, but you can also believe some shit conspiracy out of your ass. We will see i guess.
---
Yup seems like it
---
remindMe! 96 days
---
Its extremely rare to see a guild recruite tanks and extremely common to see then recruite dwraf priests.
---
It's not exactly like people who dinged 60 first, because there will be *less competition* for those materials. If you have 4 level 60s and each are in their own layer, they're essentially the only level 60.
---
From my understanding the entire point of layering is that once you're assigned to a layer those are the people you will be seeing until layering is turned off. So you won't be moved between layers based on level.
---
Druid, for putting all the beasts to sleep.
---
I agree, but Blizzard doesn't. 
---
Blizzard refuses to implement proper dynamics spawns, which we know actually works. There was a private server that launched with 11k+ people online, it was a shitshow but dynamic spawns made it playable.
---
The only reason it's bad on private servers because it modifies the spawn rates of every mob in the world, which is not the case if blizzard implemented their own dynamic spawn system.
---
Uhuh... And? I just acknowledge that they don't necessarily need to use said core's advanced features like DX12.
---
Its worth remembering that the stress test was just a single realm. There will be many, many realms at launch. If it can survive thousands of players hitting one realm (i say 'survive', as there were some problems clearly), then launch will be fine.
---
So its the same as beta on horde starting zones at EU times. Oh well, easy to levelup mining and engineering. Do a /wave every 10 minutes when you see someone.
---
the only things I can remotely agree on is the "terrible core system" in regards to azerite gear due to it being a system dependent on running the right content if you want the right azerite gear traits and "bad story" because, yknow, bfas story is kinda shit. everything else you've written it like you played the first month or so of bfa then unsubbed and go based off of "dae bfa bad???" posts on the main subreddit.           
---
like the other poster said, loot is so easy to get, and it's so easy to gear characters from so many sources (quests, wq's, world bosses, warfronts, island expeditions, professions, pvp, dungeons, AND raids), that you saying there's no loot system to work towards gear is insane.                     
---
        
---
and there's a HUGE difference between no man's sky and bfa. no man's sky offered so much shit and basically released as a single player exploration with god awful content inside of it.                
---
bfa is boring as fuck at max level but that's just simply cuz that's wow. max level wow there isn't anything to do besides train professions, explore areas you haven't explored, run dungeons/raids, and do quests you haven't done yet.
---
Yes we do.
---
I didn't see defence mentioned in your post. Not sure if it affects damage values or just miss/crit/crush etc
---
Stormwind is not a kingdom; it's a city. The kingdom it belongs to is called Azeroth.
---

---
What's the problem with doing that until Classic comes out though? I've played on private vanilla and tbc servers because those are the expansions I enjoyed the most. If Blizzard provided vanilla and TBC servers I would play on the official ones. Now that Blizzard will open up vanilla realms on 27th August I won't have a reason to play on private servers anymore. But until then there is absolutely no issue with doing that.
---
It's just like with accessibility to TV shows. Before Netflix and HBO came to Sweden I was pirating shows like crazy. Now since I'm subscribed to both since they became available I haven't pirated a show in years, because I was provided official access to the shows I'm watching, and I'm more than happy to pay the creators and providers to access them.
---
I played a Warlock from Vanilla to WOTLK. There's no being fair on this one, they've destroyed the uniqueness of the classes. Life Tap being removed is just a symptom of the problem.
---
And the information this guy provided was direct from the 1.13 stress test client, based on ACTUAL blizzard 1.12 data. You can 100% train swords as a paladin or warrior (2 hand or 1 hand) from Stormwind before level 10 with 10s. The databases and PServers you quoted are wrong.
---
Still, it's good that he mentions it incase a developer sees it and it can/is a easy fix.
---
so in 30 years he will be back.
---
Are they sharding/layering wow classic when it releases too? Oh dear god I hope they don't.
---
Amazing. It was 3:30am by the time I actually got in game. Majority of the 2½ hours waiting was spent on the character creation screen.
---
I have neither of those three things, so the joke's on you.
---
Sharding =/= Layering
---
I completely forgot about the cliques man. It brings so much memories. I now remember back in BWL, I was UD Rogue, our Rogue-team was like a cult. It was positive in a way that we helped each other for DPS min-maxing and decisions on gear but we also considered ourselves way above every other DPS-teams. What was funny too was when some guy from another class like a Mage would be a guest in our "cult" because he too considered all other DPS idiots. So yeah, conspiracy and drama was really a huge thing. But what I remember too is that most raiders were 16-20 back then, I'm 30 now and I guess people are older and gossiping less?
---
Pretty sure just casting drain life is better
---
/u/Trigabyte ask and ye shall receive :D
---
I thought I read this in the blue post and it said to contact support. Give it a try, who knows ;)
---
Who cares about upvotes? Weirdo. I just wanted to mock him for being so ridiculous.
---
Actually it is not, if we are being fucking realistic. Most people on alliance will go like this: 
---
 * Humans -&gt; elwynn -&gt; westfall -&gt; mix and mingle loch modan, maybe darkshore -&gt; redridge -&gt; duskwood -&gt; **maybe** ashenvale or wetlands
---
 * horde -&gt; durotar/mulgore/tirisfal -&gt; barrens, since almost nobody wants to miss barrens chat -&gt; stonetalon maybe -&gt; ashenvale/hillbrad
---
Nobody, except for those who **love** leveling to a teeth or are completionists, will do all the zones. Most people just want to do the minimum and dungeon quests while getting to the higher lavels and 60 as fast as possible. It's been like that on private servers as well for all those years.
---
welcome to the family
---
Is there youtube videos on how to do this? The only way I knew was the wall mount jump in Darkwhisper Gorge?
---
*I'm* being a dick about it? You're the one telling me I'm gatekeeping, I'm not special and I'm a dick. I haven't insulted you once. Look at yourself.
---
Put some gat dan clothes on
---
Has anyone noticed that hunter pets seems to be running all over the place? Looks really wierd and it's not how I remember it. Afaik hunter pets should stay in line with the hunter movements.
---
Its very rare to see guilds recruite tanks. You only need 2 out if 40 as tanks. Its common to recruite warriors though and they often need to oftank. Dwarf Priests are probably the most recruited class/role in game.
---
so awesome to see the level cap put  to 10 ;D
---
&gt; There is no such thing as tourists 
---
Hahaha. Yeah, okay. Just you wait and see how many people get to level 5 and hate it. We may love this game but it's absolutely not for everybody.
---
Yeah it was a totally different concept of champion iirc. You had to go through the whole argent tournament to earn the right to represent a city as their champion and even then I believe they had npc champions as well, so you were just a champion not “the” champion
---
Most of the clothing most be removed in order to assure the accuracy of the test results and that there is no doping involved!
---
You’re talking about Atlas World Map Classic (https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/atlas-world-map-classic), I guess?!
---
I’ve installed it aswell, very nice.
---
But yeah, I’m looking for a replacement for the fullscreen-map... hopefully a lot (enough) addon-devs got an invite for the beta ;)
---
cant he shield block or shield wall?
---
he didn't threw the whole encounter at the end by sheer luck
---
Alliance has fear ward, paladins and both factions get a blacksmithing 30s anti-fear trinket ...
---
You misspelled WOTLK
---
I'm in this picture! The warlock gnome Disturbia on the right side. Thanks for posting this.
---
maybe bear form?
---
The guilds will have the most resources anyway since they will buy them regardless how many there are and because they will have lots of farmers.
---
No problem, glad you enjoyed them. I'll have more come the 2nd Stress Test.
---
How can something so abstract be one of your favorite things...?
---
If your goal is to go around and fuck with the opposite side then go ahead and stream snipe all you want imo. Embrace being the asshole, don't try to pretend that you're somehow being honest or honorable with any of it. That just makes you look even more pathetic.
---
Your equipment sings a song of great pain.
---
Yes. Glad to see there are people who realizes that. I see comments like "vanilla was great because of the community, you had to interact with other people..." and so on and so on. While that may be true, current community (and not just WoW, it goes for the entire internet) is nothing like it used to be back then. 
---
Now I don't want to interact with other people online because of how, for the lack of better word, toxic they can be.
---
Tell your friend Retail is -&gt; that way! :D
---
They should just make it so you keep your spot on the layer for like 10-15m when you log off (just lke with the queues). Also do something to prevent easy layer hopping through party invites, maybe make it so you have to wait \~5m, or only in resting spots. They should also enable sharding on top of layering for the first few days\~week, because 3k in the starting zones is still a 3k, you wont be doing any quests.
---
And despite that, the meta for the past ten years of Vanilla p-servers has highly disincentivized Alliance Warlocks. The problem is all the things you mentioned add an extra layer or two of complexity.
---
People who want to min/max BGs in PvP will naturally go the easier / lazier route: Disincentivize Ally Locks.
---
mmmk
---
yep, layering needs to go
---
You got a better compromise in mind?
---
**&lt;AfterDark&gt; &lt;NA-PVP&gt; &lt;Horde&gt;**
---
**Introduction:** 
---
Hey, I'm collins, one of the co leaders of the newly found late night raiding guild &lt;AfterDark&gt;. I've been playing wow since 2005, I've had a blast and I've made several great friends along the way who will be helping me run this guild. Many of our members used to be serious when it came to end game PVE, some having server first boss kills, years of raid leading experience with hardcore guilds, and a good understanding of what classic wow actually is. Unfortunately we're not that young anymore so NO LIFING this game and grinding for hours for raid boss glory is long and gone. Many of us have careers, families, kids, and well a life...But this does not mean that we don't plan on being a top guild on our server! We just have to work a bit harder with our limited weekend time slots!
---
Which leads me to my next bit of information, what we plan to do.
---
**What to expect:**
---
This guild will mainly focus on the end game content, but at startup we will be able to provide, well not much, we're all broke and level 1. But we can hopefully give you a place you can call home for the start and end of your classic journey. We're a good group of people and we plan on pushing for level cap together, with leveling, questing, and instance parties. Once level cap is reached we will quickly push into End Game Content, with a very serious mindset.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
We will mainly be a late night weekend guild. Since we all work second shift through the week.
---
Saturday -11:00PM EST- 3:00AM EST (later if agreed on)
---
Sunday -11:00PM EST- 3:00AM EST (later if agreed on)
---
We will also be looking to expand on our times with a second group, which isn't recognized as a B Group, but hopefully as a section of the guild with their own raid times. This is if we can find an officer who is up for the task.
---
**If Interested:**
---
if you're interested in this guild, please join our discord, select your role, and say Hello!
---
**Discord:** [**https://discord.gg/CkbAFXE**](https://discord.gg/CkbAFXE)
---
P.S. we're just getting started, so please give us time to grow and help this guild become great!
---
Yeah, thats the one.
---
Somewhat Disneyian
---
Really good and informative.
---
The only thing that I would like to add is that you didn't put enough emphasis on how extremely good the Diamond Flask is.
---
It is by far the best reward from the ST-quest and is our BiS trinket for all sub-1 min fights through vanilla.
---
12 and unmarried? what a loser.
---
Dynamic spawns.
---
"Send nudes"
---
&gt;troll has a mortal strike type ability
---
Said like that it sounds imba af ! :D
---
You should precise it does no damage and only reduce healing by 20% ;-)
---
What is default?
---
On private servers Mages and Warlocks were the hardest for us to recruit.
---
Enhancement shamans doesn't really add anything to a raid that another spec/class couldn't
---
Feral tanks are usually suboptimal for raids, but have their place as their TPS (threat per second) is way higher than warriors
---
Feral dps can compete with other melee as Shedo has shown but is extremely try hard and you'll be hard pressed convincing a guild to let you do it.
---
Just say "the vanilla client uses xGB, while the classic client uses yGB"
---
&gt; The drama and infighting would escalate the more and more when the 'wrong' people would get geared lol.
---
Having avoided DKP ever since I started and only been in LootCouncil guilds and actively been on a few LootCouncils, reading this feels strongly familiar. People in WoW never change :thinking:
---
The old classic YT clip "This is why 11yr olds shouldn't raid".
---
weird, i was only in stress test and mine is WoW2
---
No. What he's saying is that you &amp; your mates will still be in the same layer but those specific horde/ally that was ganking you will be gone because you switched layers when grouping up with your mates.
---
Just make sure to be 60 prior to phase 2.
---
Unless you enjoy being ganked by roaming gangs of the opposite faction :)
---
Why? I don't get the hate for blood elves honestly. One of the best starting zones and for me, my favorite theme overall. The music, the magic, the colors, everything is great. A shame the city had to suck so much.
---
I really appreciate the time you took to write this detailed summary. Thanks. As an explorer / lore-oriented guy and not being able to pour all my free time into gaming, I might begin with a PvE realm character to make the exploration smoother... I guess I can always try a different class on a PvP server later on, if I really enjoy the game.
---
Why?
---
For reals, I hope that blizzard releases some collectors edition that contains a manual as thicc as the OG
---
rofl
---
I don't understand your logic. It doesn't matter if you are in a layer or not. If you're 5-6 levels higher than everyone else, then the mobs aren't stolen that often... and the /played 3 days you have to show off first!
---
Guess you're talking about the Bow of Plunder. It is just slightly better than the Venomstrike with 3 more top-end damage and 0.2 slower speed. That's nowhere near twice as much, check your facts, mate.
---
I have WoW1 and WoW2. WoW2 was the stress test. If I try connect to WoW1 it says, "No realms are currently available. (WOW51900309)"
---
He didn't need it and even if he had died at the end there they would have killed it anyway. Look not everyone can be super optimal but as long as they get the job done it doesn't really matter. 
---
It's like watching Method's world firsts and instead of celebrating the kill you instead nitpick who has played sub optimally.
---
It's been toxic since before then. The most toxic players are the most die hard as they are often the most entitled. I'm really excited for this game but having trouble staying subscribed to the subreddit
---
At least the timeframe is a bit better for EU this time around.
---
It turns out mine was just the full beta access!
---
It's no Ragnaros, but I guess this is the closest we'll get, the man said as he stared into the fireplace he just made.
---
Yes yo do but they reduced the amount of new beta keys drastically as they have the amount of people they need for testing.
---
So our chances are slim.
---
If you have X resource for Y player then 3X resource for 3Y player is the same, price won't go down.
---
On the contrary, if AH is not linked between layer then we have a problem since someone could jump between layer to gather resources then sell them all on the layer with highest price thus lowering the demand and devaluing the resource on that layer.
---
Nah you're just a moron.
---
The naga don’t I think
---
Classic is an adventure while retail is a race. Nowadays, it's expected to be max level in a week. In the olden days, every level was cause for celebration and everything is meant to be savored. As for arenas, they don't need to exist. You got bgs for organized fights and massive wars raging in Hillsbrad. Add Gurubashi Arena to that and you can organize whatever you want. He needs to learn to enjoy the little things.
---
No, it's either a sub OR game time. I got into the stress test with game time only, I think this proves that I could still get into the beta with it as well. Now then, since they decreased the invites my chances are pretty crap.
---
Depends how the reset happens. The problem with retail is the accessibility of the new gear. New update = everyone can get much better gear after a few days of farming. Mythics, PVP,... It all gives them the new top teir gear, which will give them upgrades on the first day the patch hits. Their work of the past months has been almost "for nothing".
---
In vanilla however, getting new types of gear with a content release such as a new raid, will not make alot of people upgrade all of their gear in a very short term. People will need to run raids multiple times (which are on a weekly reset), and even then it's up to RNG what drops, and if they get the gear (because they have to share with 40 people in the raid).
---
If you had access you'd see this on your battle net launcher https://i.imgur.com/A9vc8rh.png
---
RemindMe! 97 days do dis
---
Sick shoulders. what is that, 48 armor ones?
---
They should just make it so you keep your spot on the layer for like 10-15m when you log off (just lke with the queues). Also do something to prevent easy layer hopping through party invites, maybe make it so you have to wait \~5m, or only in resting spots. They should also enable sharding on top of layering for the first day or two, because 3k in the starting zones is still a 3k, you wont be doing any quests, especially without dynamic spawns.
---
Layering is not put into the game to deal with overpopulation at launch. (Same-server) sharding would have dealt with this fine. Layering is intended for long-term population stability.
---
You'll still have hundreds of characters competing for mobs in the starting areas for days after launch. Getting ahead of the pack is still a thing.
---
You went from probably to putting down younger people to putting down sharing to putting down the group tool. 
---
What’s interesting though is that you started with a probably and it turned into an absolute for the rest of your small excerpt...do you do that normally..?
---
Because the disparity between number of people looking for a raid guild to number of available slots in our raid for their class was greatest for Mages and Warlocks.
---
Hello i'm a mage, i'm aoe grinding. Let me kill this camp of 10 monsters, oh they're all dead. Guess ill just wait 5 minutes for them to respawn, oh nvm i'll just get someone to invite me to another layer.
---
so do you think raids are harder to be cleared due to those classes?
---
I was running my brother's warlock through SFK when it dropped. He took it and equipped it. Still haunts me to this day.
---
Private servers are responsible for Classic
---
I liked everything about TBC except flying mounts and also I didn't like outland in general. Most areas looked really bland imo. Nagrand was cool but the rest...not so much.
---
That is why I prefer vanilla over TBC. Azeroth without flying mounts is just more fun playing in.
---
This was discussed in the priest discord yesterday. Apparently the actual damage increases on pservers as well but the tooltip values always stay the same. So the damage increase is probably not a bug because something like this would be unlikely to be implement without proof but tooltip actually being correct might be a bug.
---
Feral tank and dps can be made to work granted you abuse pummlers like crazy.
---
Enhancement is completely useless and adds nothing while doing terrible dps. People say shit like "but but nightfall", shaman has literally the lowest uptime of nigthfall out of any class, they give zero utility to their group other than imp totems(which is a slight increase, that a totemspecced heal shaman can bring too if wanted), I would rather have a melee hunter, yes a melee fucking hunter than an enhancement.
---
&gt; What's the problem with doing that until Classic comes out though? 
---
There are people who just don't want to use pirated versions, no matter what. And regarding WoW there are just many many more who don't want to play on private servers-
---
Considering how many people are playing BfA, and most likely some are even enjoying it...I even know a person who does.
---
This is a very good point. Be among the first say 50-100 people to reach 60 and the guilds will be whispering you to come join them.
---
Also you'll have a great time playing with those other few people who managed to get to 60 quickly. Establishing your own little community :)
---
Unsure if trolling or serious...
---
Largest MMO, World of Warcraft Battle For Azeroth, is no longer of the RPG genre because....why?
---
It isn't. Find any law that states that breach of ToS is a crime.
---
It will still better having a system like that for the beginning atleast, it'll be gone after a small time anyway though, right?
---
Yup. People already ported questhelper to the beta vanilla server!
---
So then you're not leveling it for the sole purpose of farming.
---
While I believe it has its place. Yes, it should eventually leave the servers. However my main hope is if layering must occur at the beginning, then any party leader should stay on their respective layer, and all players added to the party are the players who ‘phase’ to the leader’s layer.
---
Tyrande freed Illidan, and the humans of Lordaeron--many of whom later became forsaken, scourge, or Scarlet Crusaders--were the ones responsible for the attempted genocide. Kael'thas actually helped Malfurion and Illidan save Tyrande, and then Malfurion told Illidan he was free to go, but to fuck off and never harm the Night Elves again. Kael actually seemed to have a lot of respect for the Night Elves when it was happening, and helping them save Tyrande could've helped to ease tensions at least a little bit. There were even some Belves advocating they stick with the Alliance in TBC. And they still had diplomatic relations with the Alliance before finding out their envoy was actually a spy. The reason they went horde was because the Alliance decided to be dicks to them while Sylvanas decided to help.
---
Dual wield for rogues
---
Yeah I was just added few days ago, so I assume it will take pretty long before I get in.
---
This will also result in 3 days played 60s, that's how private servers did it.
---
We need 1-5/1-10 phasing/layering and that's it, IMO.
---
Glad you liked it and thanks for the feedback! &lt;3 I mean its on the rocks so that should sell enough people but you are right =)
---
Don't sleep. Stack up on empty bottles. Ready your poop socks.
---
Private servers don't use blizzard dynamic respawns, they used scuffed every mob in the entire world dyanamic respawns.
---
Thanks for doing god's work. Can't help since I played Priest in Vanilla so I cannot compare but I do plan to Hunt the fuck out of Azeroth for the next years so thank you as it really seems buggy as hell.
---
&gt; expectations
---
that's the key word, this is what makes so many people unhappy in life.  they need to adopt some stoicism and stop bitching because it just makes things worse for everyone
---
The posts about people complaining are more annoying than the actual posts complaining.
---
They're gonna layer for the first month or so to let things smooth out and then disable it permanently
---
How many battlegroups? Of how many servers? What happens if entire battlegroups go dead? Will you enforce guild name and character name policies on an entire battlegroup? So someone with the name PaladinBob on Server A thats in Battlegroup 1 means that no other server in Battlegroup 1 can have a toon named PaladinBob? So now I cant make a name because someone from another server is using it? Not exactly Blizzlike. Layers allow for much fewer servers, and the number of layers AND their size is flexible, so Blizzard can spin up more layers or fewer ones dynamically. 
---
There’s no one solution. This is a tech problem and rarely if ever is there one best solution. Its obvious which you prefer, but others prefer layers.
---
Getting to the boss was harder...but still epic to down him after such a journey.
---
Why you gotta judge. Maybe he was waiting to take a fp

Just ugly people  dont like good looking ones.

Toxic
---
I didn't post this video, I just commented my opinion. And yes, I called him a dick. I stand behind that. He is pretending he's not what he is, as u/Ares42 below points out.  If he'd just embrace it, it'd be less pretentious.   
---
Did I NEED to point that out? I guess not? 
---
Oh and one more thing, you need to chill my dude. The sole fact we don't agree with each other doesn't mean we need to be so hostile. Your words spew agression. I can't help but feel you are a fan of this guy and somehow can't take criticism against him. Relax, man. Other people may see things differently than you.  
---
You're fully entitled to your opinion, as much as I'm entitled to disagree with your opinion.
---
Damn.  Nice! I somehow doubt mine is since it's offline lol :(
---
Also it would be nice if you linked spreadsheets of   your item lists in the video description.
---
Why time gate and use nerfed versions too? Bwl wouldn't be nerfed until after it wasn't top content. Confusing
---
Absolutely.
---
Probably not honestly, most people were already added by now, so you'll likely get in within a week or two.
---
I still don't get what layering is. Is it like instances some MMOs have that can switch if there's too much of a population? But I'm guessing this is automatic?
---
I think the idea of most people who played Vanilla back then were teenagers or even kids, with only a smaller part of the community being adults past 25 or 30 is a myth.
---
I used to think that as well, 1st because I fit that category you mentioned, currently I am 30 years old. Also, even tho I rarely asked the age of the players I raided with back then, I kinda assumed they were a little older than me but not much.
---
But now, I am getting mildly hyped for Classic WoW, I started to watch some videos, read some old stuff and I stumbled upon (allegedly) official data that stated that the average WoW Classic player was around 28 years old, sadly I can not find it to link to you.
---
But that doesn't validate your point, it probably even gives it strength...if the majority of classic players or at least the classic raiders will be returning veterans they will probably like close to 40 or if you are right 30 like me!
---
I assume that people will be away more mature and will lessen the drama a lot.
---
What I worry about is if the raiding scene on classic might not be mostly populated with returning vets like we are assuming but with people that come directly from retail that never played Classic, TBC and sometimes not even Wrath! Those guys will rage a lot (despite their age), because they are  formatted on different way concerning all things WoW and some details, mind sets and other things will probably make them go full drama.
---
That doesn't solve the issue of server problems because too many people are in one small area.
---
I very much doubt that pservers or most wikis would get something this crucial wrong.
---
I do mind it
---
Blizzard have stated they can house all the players in a single server, the reason they don't is specifically stated respawn rates.
---
Well there is arena (gurubashi) and you don't have to level up to 60 if you don't want.
---
Ok I'm ready to /who 60. Thanks for preparing me
---
It can stay, but ONLY if it's on until like big chunk of the population has spread out to a few zones.
---
I am not entirely confident that it will be. I have this nagging suspicion that we will see this happening far after the first lvl60 has dinged.
---
I didn’t  put down younger people lol, I just know a lot of kids who liked legion because it was so fast paced, they really like having immediate gameplay, there is nothing wrong with that.
---
So they will probably prefer classic.
---
And as for the lfg tool, it will definitely be more quite because it is already declining, al you see now are sellers and alt runs. Though I guess if ethernal palace comes out it will be active again.
---
But if not it will absolutely go more quite as people go onto classic.
---
I will play both so I guess I’ll see
---
You basically just described layering, sort-of.
---
I don't disagree, however Blizzard isn't particularly fond of people playing on them. I have no intention of openly admitting to playing on one on the official Blizz forums that's not only linked to my beta access but also my retail account.
---
How do you know the group won’t join the layer the mage is already in? Some of the arguments against layering seem to cherrypick issues.
---
This is impossible, because you can't keep player count consistent. What will you do when the players log off? Throw in some new people? Then what you do when forementioned players log back in?
---
Well, a server first or some big achievement the guild "worked" hard for for a few weeks, I can get it. But dudes being hyper after killing a random lvl 35 boss in a fucking beta that's gonna be wiped I'm like "what" ?
---
The flashing indicator can be useful to know you haven't suddenly stopped attacking
---
irony and sarcasm can be hard to detect by way of text. Especially since I have autism.
---
a simple /s will do.
---
Source?
---
It didn't look like they could during stress test.
---
I will as soon as I finish it =D I gotta give my bleeding eyes a little recovery time but I will post here when it is finished too!
---
I linked it below but they never said all of Phase 1. It’s at most until the end of phase 1, but the point of these stress tests is to know how many servers they need and what the new server hardware can handle. The layering will most likely be for a month to allow people to somewhat progress.
---
Vanilla launch was crazy. You couldn’t get mobs for hours. The game was considered a huge success and vanilla launch had something like half a mill in the first three months.
---
Classic will have more than that by a long long shot. I’m someone really excited for that vanilla flavour, but layering at the start just makes sense.
---
I don't hate the new orcs, I'm just constantly annoyed with how the hair and beards look. I want a nice, full beard. With the old models you get something like that, there's a short full-looking beard and a longer one. Their new model equivalents are awful.
---
At least the new orc reskins have better hair options, just lemme grind out that rep real quick.
---
They have a lot more than two.
---
https://i.imgur.com/mfNOqwh.png
---
Relax, dude. It's just a beta of a game you've probably played before and can probably play on pservers if you're that desperate. All beta progress will be wiped clean sooner or later, so personally I did not even sign up for beta, because I don't think I would have made it past level 5. I let people who really were in it to test it, stream/cover it, or were way more excited than me about the beta, get priority, and I'm fine with that.
---
Not only that, but the day after is a day off! (Atleast here in NO)
---
I am not playing casters ever, but I would have assumed the spell school level was only used for resist calculations, maybe for hit, and not influence damage at all. Like how weapon skill works for physical classes.
---
Druid will be useful as heals, battle res, or emergency tank depending on spec.
---
Enhance shammy isn't as useful but will still have a place due to buffs to windfury totems.
---
The arrogance of you fanboys is astonishing
---
This stuff is not guaranteed fixable it’s the entire point of layering
---
You *should* be mad and making noise about this until Blizzard officially weighs in, so they know this is important to us.
---
Blind faith in layering has gotta stop
---
Horde side you've got to deal with paladin dispels and priest's fear ward, which might not be as bad, but it's not significantly better either.
---
Nah, Blizz is. Without creating Vanilla back then pservers could not exists.
---
we will, and it will completely destroy immersion. 
---
Sadly, this sub won't realize the actual effects until it's too late.
---
Warriors are a hybrid class, this is not even a debate.
---
"if not better". Dude, I hope this is a joke. Legion can't hold a fucking candle to tbc or wrath. Everything cata onward went downhill and Legion was the nail in the coffin for wow. It's the expact that finally got me to unsub.
---
Spec: 
---
I9-9900k 4.9ghz
---
2080ti aorus with a slight overclock 
---
Classic: max settings 
---
Avg FPS - 330 (have to take limits off in settings) highs of 450 lows of 300. 
---
Not brilliant when you only have a 100hz panel! 
---
Retail: 
---
Avg FPS - 120, highs of 200, lows of 85 
---
Put a FPS cap of 100 to match the panel - in both classic and retail fans are not even moving, with CPU sitting in the 40-45 range. GPU fans not even picking in at the 30-40 range. 
---
Ps- these numbers are running on a 1440p ultra wide
---
I'm really looking forward to a level playing field. I play on and off, skipping whole expansions while returning for several month stints. Over time, when I come back for a fix I feel a bit stunted as compared to everyone else, with their wealth and hard won prizes (and rightly so, don't get me wrong).  But it will be awesome logging in to that clean slate, where all are poor and equal and I don't feel so much like the filthy casual that I most certainly am. Where the story is not of some galant I never really filled the role of, but the everyman/orc who has yet to prove their mettle. A game is afoot, my friends.
---
haha
---
Buy windows you broke fool.
---
i'm pretty sure that only reaches to in game terms of communication, see Rosetta stone addon(?) I think that was trying to decipher horde to ally if both partners had it. They cannot ban you over talking to someone on discord and "choosing not to engage" eachother in game
---
The Naga have the worst addiction problem tbh, they literally can't survive without the support of an old god... And they really REALLY want to rule the world.
---
That’s not at all how it is on pservers though
---
Did report this auto attack raptor strike thing. It does not feel right, but Hunter seems really buggy atm compared to other classes.
---
U got into Beta? IM SO JELLY
---
Every generation wants to call themself this.
---
I don't think you know what layering is.
---
You can either coordinate with guild members who don't need to layer hop on rotation. Or join the person who logged on last as they will join the newest layer.
---
AFAIK it's an on/off setting for full screen glow effect so no between.
---
I can cope with that. Because it's a roll of the dice whether the item I wants drop, but then IF the item I want drops and I get it. I have a BiS item until the next tier releases.
---
In current WoW I'm full close to full "BiS", but they aren't all Titanforged and some of the pieces are but don't have the gem socket upgrade and instead have Leach or Indestructable.
---
I don't want to run Tol Dagor every single day trying to get that dagger with a fucking gem socket on it.
---
Benefits of an account created the week of vanilla launch, I guess :) Hopefully you're able to get in at some point!
---
Ok.
---
Yeah well the thing is, if you quit at lvl 50 and have played very late Vanilla, you haven't really played Vanilla. Yes, you technically and literally started playing in Vanilla but you just haven't seen the game.
---
I've got a few friends who I convinced to start playing but that was like in mid-late 2006, they weren't 60 by the time TBC came out and they barely know anything about Vanilla, simply because they haven't seen/experienced it.
---
Tips is just a P-Server baby if you ask me.
---
If that’s planned for from the beginning it’s a relatively easy fix.
---
Introducing an entire immersion-killing software for this purpose is just....... ridiculous
---
Just because they’re giving us Classic doesn’t make Blizzard immune to stupid decisions. Layering is one of them
---
i never really thought about how much of the world was under night elf control, you always think of them being tucked away in the north west but they kinda have the largest territory :O
---
You notice how it didn't say gen y was one of those things to call people on the cusp?
---
Yeah, that's because it's a synonym for millennial, regardless of what you personally prefer.
---
Well said. 100% agree
---
If your name on your server is Serakh, and my name on my server is Serakh, and our servers merge, which one of us is forced to switch?
---
You can assume the stress test had more people than the average realm will have.
---
Damn, my mom just had to read this in my youth... "no wasted time", she would have said and then left laughing like a maniac.
---
No, casters have spell damage. Or at least it was like that. You only gain crit from agi
---
Even more sad is that blizzard devs are not smarter than average reddit joe.
---
There are so many blizzard fanboys on this sub who blindly support Blizz simply because they’re giving us Classic, as if that makes Blizz immune to stupid decisions
---
Why don't you try to explain what you think it is, and how it conflicts with what I wrote, in like one sentence?
---
I was incredibly excited to be a part of the stress test, but now that some of the hype has worn off I can list a few of the issues I've had so far: 
---
* Layering is still very much a work in process, but the sooner Blizzard can remove it when Classic launches the better. It *has* to be gone before the honor system drops, so I hope they can stick to their planned timeline. It's a bummer needless to say when you make a 30-odd people group to fight Horde in Durotar, and once the skirmishes begin all the Horde suddenly drop out of your layer. It's even more of a bummer when *half* of your own raid gets layered/sharded seemingly at random, but these are obvious kinks of the beta/stress test which can and will be ironed out. I'm still on the fence somewhat about whether layering is a price worth paying to ensure server stability and realm merges later on. It's an elegant solution to the problems that come with a big launch, but it's definitely *not* Classic (and I'm not a #nochanges person - I see WoW Classic as a remastering of the original game - but layering definitely makes for a noticeably different experience). I've not done much testing to see how easy it is to drop layers to find better spawns, so I'm going to tinker around with it during the next test. 
---
* I'm not sure if Hunters have the same problem, but Warlock pets felt somewhat unresponsive when I messed around on a Warlock. There was a noticeable one to two second delay when ordering a stationary pet to follow, and there were times my passive pet would be slow to attack my target when ordered to in PvP. Experienced Hunter/Warlock vanilla players will know a lot better than me, but it feels like  pets should be responding to commands faster than they currently are. 
---
* Wanding after casting requires two key presses to start wanding, unless you wait a second before wanding then it responds to a single key press as you'd expect. Wanding first requires only one key press, acting like (as one would expect) an autoattack. Retail like? I have no idea, but it definitely feels unresponsive. The thing is, Seal of Righteousness has this quirk in Vanilla where the additional holy damage is applied seperately to the white hit  (so the npcs healthbar moves twice after a slight delay). Judgement also has a similar quirk where there's a very slight delay between the animation of the spell and the damage being applied. It looks like a bug, but after old Paladin videos its definitely Blizzlike. Is it the same for wanding? I cannot remember. There's a lot of things I've (and many others, judging from all the complaints about damage values) misremembered about Vanilla, and it's easy to mixup the unresponsiveness of a 15 year old game with bugs.
---
WH OMEGALUL
---
Hi, /u/kidcudi93
---
Both pictures are with the graphical settings set to Classic.
---
layering is literally the same as same-server sharding.
---
You don't need consumes for AQ40 or even Naxx for that matter(except Loatheb). They help, ofcourse, but you don't need them and people barely used them in vanilla. Don't think i had to farm consumes for the entire lenght of vanilla until we got to Loatheb. Pretty much 0 protection pots used before then, no flasks, no winterfall ekos, maybe some mongoose pots but that's about it.
---
A blue weapon as a lvl 5? What is this? Retail?
---
I still do, albeit from Amazon, when a game we have a collection going for comes out.  Other than WoW Collectors editions this often means Civilization, Xcom, or The Sims for the wife.
---
Classic is Classic because of its immersion.
---
It’s the WORLD of Warcraft, not the layers of Warcraft.
---
Layering will be abused for resources, mobs, nodes and rare spawns. People will join random dungeon groups to see if they move to new layers then quit. People will try selling layers. Guilds will game the system.
---
Just because Blizzard is giving us Classic doesn’t mean they’re immune to stupid decisions.
---
[Its only gonna be on for a few weeks too a month](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow) at most, its just too help keep the servers up during the initial launch phase.
---
If you actually read the comment chain you are replying to, you could see Isaelia is talking about pre-planned merges, with shared name lists to avoid conflicts. So everyone can keep their name.
---
alliance bias again, they could have done all this on the horde faction too
---
Debugging on the beta is pretty likely - could also be anti-cheat software, anti-botting software and other verification checks that add to the data usage - or the fact it's a more recent client and b-net integration. You could do the check with BFA and see if that has similar results :)
---
But maybe do it wired and have some software detect the traffic instead so it'd not your limited mobile data that gets used
---
why do you think it was tough?
---
Bummer! You’ll get in soon enough. Hang in there.
---
Both pictures are with shadows set to Low (Classic preset).
---
I tried it on the stress test, and this code was available in vanilla aswell. Working as intended :)
---
How do you pre-plan merges if you don't know what servers are going to require merging? That sounds like a retarded idea.
---
For real. BC era leveling in Ghostlands is the greatest leveling zone for low levels.
---
Or Deadmines, min level is 10 for that too iirc
---
What if we can choose our layer and then cant move to another for like 1hour ? That way friends can choose to play on the same layer
---
You're right, it probably doesn't.
---
If you have 4 layers you could do this 4 times.
---
Conceivably, by the time you finish the 4th node, you might land back in the first and simply be able to cycle this non-stop.
---
If layering stays with Classic in its current form it will kill the games economy. People will literally sit at nodes like this all. day. long. and just farm.
---
I sWitCheD LaYerS SeverAl TimeS anD iT BuggEd OuT coMplEtElY, LayEriNg WiLL Be EXploIteD aNd RuiN ClasSiC. Yeah it's a beta/stresstest, they want you to break it and exploit it so they can fix it...
---
If I remember correctly yes it does
---
I did the same thing with frostmage level 49... Jesus both epic frost rings. Epci weapon. Epic head... Poor enemies... Having the same health as most enemies melee classes...
---
I don't see how that is something comparable to bills, spending time with your gf should not be a bad thing
---
Level however you want to. Don't seek validation on reddit either
---
I played since wow launch till wotlk (beginning).... no beta invite... im so jelly too!
---
At least if the MT is the GM there's a slimmer chance of him getting poached by another more advanced guild ...
---
This may be true in a guild full of new players but in a guild full of people who are experienced in BFA this is highly false. These bosses are very faceroll and with a competent leader, they would probably be 1 shots for most guilds. Especially when you consider the amount of information we know about vanilla now a days thanks to private servers
---
I don’t get why they switched from layering to sharding.
---
It seems like all they wanted to do was get an easy way to merge servers and avoid player name issues - and they gladly took it at the cost of player experience.
---
What the fuck? Old Blizzard would’ve never sacrificed player experience to make merging servers a little easier
---
Ughh got me right in my feels! My only weakness! How did you know?
---
*siiiiiiiiip* Ah Razorgore, they don't make Bosses like that anymore
---
&gt; If Blizzard wants to keep the retro train rolling, rereleasing TBC is the much easier route.
---
And it's also the much easier to TIME route.  All they have to do is release it in the year after a retail expansion.  Last year we got BFA, this year classic, next year the next expansion, year after that BC Classic and so on.  Allows them to slow the decay rate of subscriptions exponentially and also likely show some growth in there plus it gives the WoW stage something to talk about in off years at Blizzcon.
---
Isn’t it just because of the Intellect stat increasing?
---
wont happen
---
only in demo
---
only first few weeks
---
only first phase
---
Imagine entering a discussion and putting out examples of what is good about Retail, then immediately getting shit on for being a shill.
---
Just /r/Classicwow things
---
Not saying legion was better, but legion is the most fun ive had in wow since vanilla.
---
I only pray they name the PvP server (US and EU) Chromie. A fitting name I think.
---
That will happen and within weeks the world economy will be an absolute joke. 
---
Can you imagine the prices of flasks? Gone will be the days of actually working each week to pay for raiding pots and other gear.
---
Stuff will be DIRT cheap
---
Well, its not going to be like that in launch. Its beta for a reason, they for them to test that shit out. It really should only happen in teleports/other zoning like HS, logging into the server, joining partys etc. Havent played much of the beta, only like L12 atm. Never seen layering yet.
---
Haha too true. It's a shame what even 'reputable' news agencies do these day.
---
RemindMe! 96 days ”diarrhea”
---
5 healers in a 40m raid? try double
---
Beautifully said pflurker. Slippery slope indeed.
---
IF you don't mind me asking because I get curious about these things.
---
Why did you quite after TBC? Was because of the game? I also played Classic but tbh I loved TBC even more than I did classic...also Wrath was an amazing expac (things started to go downhill from there).
---
Did you quit MMORPGs or even gaming in general? If you didn't what game(s) have you been playing till this day?
---
I played Classic, TBC, Wrath and until mid Cata I never quit, playing daily unless I went on vacation or something like that. I also played other games in between but playing WoW you know how it is, your gaming time is almost exclusive.
---
Since late Cata until Legion I kept playing but I took huge breaks during content droughts...But since I love raids, its feature I value the most in any mmo, eventho I went from semi hardcore to pretty close to casual I was able to keep a decent progression on every raid until the end of Legion, with the exception of Firelands (was playing SWTOR) and Blackrock Foundry (I worked aboard during 6 months and coincided with that patch).
---
Last year Antorus was released on January I think (?), it was the last raid of Legion, I cleared on heroic and I kinda run out of fucks to give regarding current WoW state...I got married in last September and BFA was released late August so I decided to skip because of that and because to which I anticipated it was going to be (the reason I quit before anyway)...reading /r/wow guess I was right. It was the 1st WoW expansion I didn't buy and it wasn't there on the 1st day...it was a tough decision, but I guess it was the right one...I am sure a lot of people still enjoy it but I myself, almost don't recognize the game anymore.
---
Being able to experience classic, even if it ends being a nostalgic trip and nothing more, it will be breath of fresh air!
---
If you have the time, tell me what you have been up to regarding gaming and mmorpgs all these years!
---
Best regards,
---
Drevs.
---
Amazing! It was go orange it hurt my eyes!!
---
Not really. Just when said poaching occurs, the guild disintegrates instead of recruiting another.
---
That isn’t true. Layering doesn’t alleviate starter zone issues.
---
Sharding would’ve, but layering applies to the world.
---
Layering alleviates server merging problems. Something so insignificant yet Blizzard still decided to sacrifice player experience for it.
---
The blizzard we know and love is dead.
---
Bad enough.
---
After the N word, these are the N dungeon
---
Elaborate.
---
It is also continent-wide, and increases the total server population cap. Actually, the layers are supposed to each hold a vanilla-like population. So this would not help with overpopulation at launch AT ALL.
---
or potentially as long as the entirety of Phase 1
---
I'm going based on a video I watched of modern strata on pservers and how it can be applied to classic. They were saying in current speed runs they only use 5 healers. You're probably right though.
---
No, he only played P-Servers.
---
I agree, but after _fifteen_ years of heroic efforts..wouldnt that change lol? If you were around back in the day, people were EXTREMELY vocal about their character not getting recognition for beating these lore bosses or accomplishing feats. Now that we did get recognition and were promoted, people are complaining that its too much. What could they have done to make people happy? 15 years and 6 expansions of players killing bosses but not getting credit for it?
---
Old Blizzard would’ve never sacrificed player experience to make merging servers a bit easier.
---
Old Blizzard is dead. 
---
New blizzard introducing layering is the same as “don’t you guys have phones”
---
Graphic settings are set to Classic preset, Nvidia Control Panel on default, server time was 14:22 pm.
---
This is the same argument used all the time "don't worry they will change this, it's just *insert version here*"
---
it is a thing hehe, we were casuals with raiding moms, stuck on Vael for 2 months and we didnt break. If you are EU give me a shout, we are getting the old team back together
---
Wouldn't this just make the market more saturated and make the lotus's less valuable? Unless of course a select group worked together and did some price fixing
---
I think you're misunderstanding "vanilla-like population" for "literally every single person on a server in one zone at the same time".
---
Enhance. Both 2h (rockbiter until windfury) and mace/shield (flametongue). Really just depends what weapons you have. 
---
So you'll switch it up in the leveling process.
---
Especially the dogs!
---
The first few hours were rough, as expected. Outside of that, I had zero issues really playing the Stress Test, until I was running around in the Asmon raid.  Things are looking good fellas, be sure to participate in the next few coming up.
---
If you’re not done 8 days after the event starts, you’re probably not getting it brother
---
Remindme! 96 days "do this"
---
It gives you crit, but other than that no, wands don't benefit from ap.
---
Any time you log in/out you change layer
---
Any time you join group you change layer
---
People will randomly join tons of dungeon groups just to see if they switch layers
---
People will try to sell layers and top guilds will have potentially months to farm lotuses and other top tier resources, trivializing flasking and ruining the economy.
---
Blizzard made a massive fuck-up with layering and it needs to be repealed now.
---
And you can't compare that hardware requirements of WoW Vanilla that worked "with an single Core" with Classic that runs on a newer Engine. Hence it would be important that they implement the Multi-Core Features that recently got added to BfA.
---
It's mostly just a meme because ppl who roll female blood elves (and humans/NEs) tend to be incels that wanna role play as a hot chick cos it gets them closer to what they can't have irl. But I'm a bit bias due to Horde affiliation.
---
Holy bastard I love you for that
---
That map really gives you a sense of "medieval lands" and possibly "rivaling nations". 
---
What do you think is the best way to get a feel for this? Play the warcraft rts games? Or just reading all the quest and learning who is fighting against murloc tribes and who against, dunno, centaurs ..!
---
When classic drops I will test if there are really Amani Trolls in the green area on the north-east! This will all be fact-checked! ;D
---
RemindMe! 96 days "weather"
---
Yes, in vanilla there were "layer" limits near most of the map edges. Sometimes a mining node or herb was shown on map, but you reached the "layer" edge before you could gather the node and it would literally disappear in front of your eyes.
---
Same thing could happen if you ran beside someone, lets say example to redridge. They would disappear near the map limit and appear like 10 seconds later.
---
So there somewhat same kind of layers, but they were MUCH smaller (and they couldnt have multiple of them aka phasing).
---
I plan to stream snipe and chain sap all fucking day. All for that sweet sweet salt. It’s a non-issue. Don’t broadcast your location online.
---
Exactly this.
---
On the Lock pet issue. I don't remember how it was despite playing lock as my very first char in 2005 but I had the same prob leveling my gnome yesterday.
---
If I put it on defensive, the pet would start casting when mob reached me. On agressive, he would start casting when I started to cast, therefore being way more effective.
---
I also do not think this is normal. Imagine this on Voidwalker, you'd have to micro your pet if you tank with it so he doesn't pull the next red target (agressive behaviour). I just want it to start defending as soon as the mob turns to me, and not when it hits me. That's how it should work imo.
---
Man, wall jumping into Hyjal was one of my best memories back in vanilla
---
Is this confirmed by Blizz or just "tested in beta"?
---
Didn't Ion say that they need to refine the layering because it can be used for exploits? Don't count on that, that could also be a rumor, just heard it, not read it!
---
But you don't need a group in the beta at the moment... can simply log out, log in another char, then log in again with the main --&gt; 90% new layer. Can't imagine Blizz leaving it that way.
---
Polymorph your target until you leave, or ninja skin it faster than you.
---
Explain?
---
I’m aware, I’m just at work and can’t access the launcher for a while so wanted to know if anyone knew so I didn’t think about it all day haha
---
Many sheep's sadly.
---
That's the silliest argument I've ever heard.... people who get ahead of the pack get to be in an empty world layering or not, go check Joana's speedrun and count the amount of times he's delayed by other players past level 12.
---
I played more of TBC than I did vanilla, so I have more love for it I think. I just preferred all the class balance changes, new specs were viable, you had more spells and things to do in fights, etc. I also thought the dungeons and raids were just better in TBC.
---
I didn't realize that flying mounts were bad for the game at the time, but yeah if we had a TBC Classic server I certainly wouldn't be #NoChanges on that. I'd kind of really want the map to be designed in a way where it would work without flying mounts.
---
Every streamer youtuber makes this mistake, once they get too popular they forget to eat their humblepie
---
You could link a pool of servers, maybe like 6, and merge among them as necessary. It's not like this is a new concept, people have been posting this forever. But you'd also need to read it too.
---
 The general playerbase regardes the MoP versions of all three warlock specs as the best versions to ever grace WoW, and they were still plenty unique back then.
---
I just want to ask: what difference exactly is there from leaving mana behind with a class that never had to actually manage their mana usage over to using a builder/spender resource system?
---
Affli currently uses Soul Shards for burst windows with UA. It generates them randomly on Corruption ticks. Generally regarded as one of the worst versions of the spec currently. Has always excelled at council fights.
---
Destro, from a raw rotational viewpoint, is almost the same as it was in MoP. You generate small parts of a soul shard depending on your spells used and if they crit or not. You generate them slowly and spend them on the big hitter Chaos Bolt. Excels at two target fights.
---
Demo, currently, is all about generating shards ASAP and spend them ASAP and using them for the Imp army and Dreadstalkers. Without the stupid demonic empowerment it is actually a very fun spec, especially since we got molten core procs back, which cause demonbolt (soul fire) to generate two shards per cast.
---
The problem why classes feel less unique is because they decided to remove snapshotting by the end of MoP, thanks to them introducing simply broken trinkets. Affli has been a boring mess since then, with barely any management having to be done on single target and the only challenge being managing 3 or 4 dots on multiple targets.
---
Destro slowly comes around again.
---
Demo was definitely better with demo form and all that but the current version is fine, since you can sometimes have a ridiculous amount of imps running behind you during Bloodlust. Definitely the most fun out of the three specs, just as it was in Wrath for me.
---
Builder and Spender don't have to be "unintuitive" or a problem, as long as they are done well. The warlock specs of MoP and WoD are a prime example. And Life Tap is simply an, in this context, achaic spell that has no practical use except for being annoying to use.
---
guy its not about being optimal or doing extra 1%
---
esfand was amazing, so was the healer
---
getting out of the boss only mechanic is not minmaxing 1% edges, people say the boss dmg is undertuned but even if it isnt its wasting precious healer mana he got hit by blades 5 to 6 times
---
didn't they change that when they decided to call the planet azeroth?
---
Hi, /u/DekHengzt
---
Didn't they say the whole guild and membets will always be on the same layer?
---
You don't unless you group up. World PVP will suck ass. Fuck you Blizzard, fuck you.
---
Do we? Played on Defias Brotherhood - most popular RP-PvP server in EU, and it was dead. Venture Co was even deader.
---
I lost count of how many times he said "I can't do anything" when a mob was attacking someone else while taunt was up for several seconds. Even if it has a high resist chance, you should be using it asap.
---
Min maxing baby
---
&gt;It was almost an unwritten rule that every clique had their own private, often secret chat channels. 
---
Yep, to start you had class and role channels at a minimum. Our guild warriors had pretty insane power in the guild, and they used to shit-talk everyone. Thankfully my mate was a warrior and whichever warrior he told me was shit-talking the most tended to stop getting heals :D
---
So much of raiding was farm back then, even during Naxx progression, we still full-cleared MC/BWL and AQ. All of that was about 4 hours minimum, and we were really quick, but during that entire time no-one cared about being in the main voice chat except for the current progression fight. I spent most of the week in private vent channels, let alone what was being said in the chat channels.
---
I don't get the Vael hate though? For healers it was pretty easy, DPS was just DPS, while tanks actually had a really tough job.
---
\+defense definitely took effect in pvp so it would make sense if -defense also did, but i dont know.  
---
all i remember is that i used to duel my friend, an MT, on my rogue back in the day and it took a million years to kill him because of his capped defense and shit lol
---
They made it so monsters spawned faster, depending on how many players were in the vicinity, there were monsters that spawned in 5 minutes, or 1 second, depending on how many people were there.
---
It's a very abusable system, but I agree that layering is garbage.
---
There's nothing stopping people from not being in guilds.
---
Are you actually running on hardware from 1990?
---
It was pretty much garbage just better with a off hand or staff and cast life drain like the person said
---
Higher crit chance if a caster
---
We are all going to make it brah
---
This, because there are enough insane people who want this and have a guild behind them to pull it off.
---
I get like 75fps in cities on retail and over 120 during the beta and about 40 fps with 700 people at the stormwind gates
---
The game isn't for him.
---

/run SetCVar('nameplateMaxDistance', 80)  
---
Sets nameplate distance more than default which is like 30 or 35 yards
---
/run SetCVar('nameplateTargetBehindMaxDistance', 15)  
---
Same thing but behind the character
---
/script SetCVar("rawMouseEnable", 1)  
---
Fixes a very common mouse issue, for me it fixes camera spaz when looking around with left or right click. Also stops mouse in middle of screen.
---
Name pool, Each server is part of a server pool where guild and character names are shared.
---
So your assuming we will have, say 20k players on a server at launch, distributed across like 50 layers so each starter zone is 'playable'? How is this not just a crappy way to do sharding?
---
Yeah they are my favourite race! I love the lore of them becoming addicted to magic.
---
&gt;Isn't merging the dead layers forcibly being merged anyway?
---
Yes but it is seamless. You never leave the realm. You are in the same guild fighting along/against the same people.
---
&gt;Isnit confirmed that all the layers will use the same chat? Then abusing phasing will be even easier as you will be able to coordinate it with people using the in game chat.
---
I actually agree with you on this one. My hope is that Blizzard will somehow find a way to limit or remove phasing abuse.
---
&gt;You could just have battlegroups of servers that all share the same naming server and merge them when the population dies down, which is the same thing as sharding/layering minus the negative effects of phasing.
---
Now I'm just speculating here but, judging by past examples of Blizzard spaghetti code, this could prove to be a really big technical challenge.
---
I don't think raiding is going to be trivialized for the reasons you think it will be trivialized.
---
Months, not weeks. Months
---
Havent kept up with the news. Is this layering same as instancing? I was getting extremely hyped about Vanilla but this would definitely ruin the experience. No doubt about it. The key thing In Vanilla is the community, i wouldnt want To see people from other servers at all.
---
It’s worse than sharding. Applies to the whole world
---
Name the layers and have them behave like subserver you can choose
---
It’s a bit like the “Honorary Skritt” title in Guild Wars 2. Such a little thing.
---
Hi, /u/CapitalWatchClub
---
I guess, for collection purposes yeah.
---
It will be farmed by mages, guilds, everyone
---
Excellent post.   Love it.  
---
Brings back a lot of memories of raiding and pvp back in vanilla.  
---
I reached rank 12 back then (General) and I still wear that title today because it really was quite an achievement in vanilla.  
---
I was the warlock officer in my guild (we had class specific officers to help organise stuff) and we cleared MC, BWL and a large chunk of AQ40 before I changed jobs and became a bit more casual.   Great times.  
---
Even remembering how pvp was back then is cool.   You not only knew the other players on your team, you knew the players on the opposing side as well who were good (alliance scum).  
---
Hitting blacksmith in AB and seeing names you were familiar with was great.   Arrive, a quick /salute to them, then spend an entire AB competing over one base.   Tactics actually became a thing (and not just a massive Zerg).   
---
I’m looking forward to classic, but unless the community has a similar vibe as vanilla I’m not sure how good classic will be.   I have my fingers crossed anyway.
---
You seem fun! 
---
DEFINITELY don’t seem like a butt hole
---
Shadowmeld. Shadowmeld everywhere.
---
It's only enabled for the first month, there will not be a ton of end game exploitation.
---
Ive hears a lot of OG accounts haven't got in and some legion / more recent accounts have, unfortunately account age doesn't seem to be the predominant factor :(
---
Lv 8 twinking is a thing.  Just google some guides for that and work from there.
---
If it's a wipe everybody has to run back anyway.
---
The problem is when 2+ players die or only one but brezz is on CD.
---
Hey, people have been posting about flat earth for a long time too, but that doesn't mean it's a valid idea. 
---
Lets just link 6 servers and have name restrictions stretch across all of them. Then we can act shocked when two weeks into the game you have people spending half an hour on the character creation screen until they get stuck with Matudifacoas as a name.
---
 All just so that there wasn't even the slightest possible chance that there was some unseen system behind the scenes making it so that there isn't 4000 people in Durotar on day 1.
---
whyyy are u ruining the game with that resolution and graphic :(((( it was soooo beautiful on maxed out settings, its totaly worth putting out the money for a new computer, just my 2 cents.
---
You can get to Ratchet very easily by jumping down the shaman pathway. If you get the FP and HS back, you spend like 5 minutes and have a FP for the future. It's not that useful though, since you want to grind on foot anyway.
---
Ah yes the dungeon finder - running back the Blackrock dungeon. That was always a fun 10 min wait.
---
We had a pretty extensive DKP system we used all the way through vanilla and TBC, it was completely unbiased - which probably contributes to how the guild stuck together as well as it did for that long. It was basically an auctioning system and very extensive! Only exception is the main tank who would be the only one to get priority on tanking gear and could get into high minus DKP.
---
How to earn DKP:
---
- Attend raid earns X amount. 
---
- Progress boss kills earns the bosses value X plus Y for first time bonus
---
- Boss kill earns X amount if downed before. 
---
- Guild raid consumables (Food, pots, elixirs, flasks, resist gear) earns X amount DKP if donated (these the class leaders distribute before a raid)
---
How to spend DKP: 
---
- All items that can drop in the raids have a set minimum cost of DKP (determined depending on how good they are) 
---
- Anyone can bid on an item with the minimum cost as the minimum bid.
---
- highest bidder wins and gets the item, the price paid is deducted from the player's DKP.
---
This system rewarded active players who contribute nor just in raids but also consumables. The first runs could be extremely expensive where some just blew all their DKP away, and some saved up. Some people just bought a ton of stuff for the minimum bids as no one was interested in the items. 
---
Good:
---
Makes the player's decide what they want and how to spend their DKP, make choices consequences and all that. That can be a fun little extra thing.
---
Cons: 
---
Price inflation and people tunnel visioning that one good drop later on so no one would bid on an early tier loot and just save up, making some loot just become nexus crystals for the guild bank.
---
If you have a sensible guild it's a good system, but it depends on your guild and community in the guild :) 
---
Also check out the DKP 0 system, where all dkp added up equates to zero, it's a pretty fair one too ^^
---
We kind of need it too.. At least I know I would prefer playing on a layered server at launch and when the hype dies down still have an active server rather than have to start on a new server when my own is half empty three months later.
---
How many servers are they launching and how many people are going to be playing?
---
People's gripe with sharding was that it goes across servers, so you would interact with people with the reasonable presumption you would never see them again. That doesn't happen with layering.
---
turns out one of our officers still had whole website archived, including DKP addon ... and we plan to use it once more, including the guild name, tabards and everything!!!
---
Obsidian edged sword.
---
Such a cool looking 2H weapon.
---
Sadly nobody ever remembers it.
---
Well you’re getting layering regardless and all this whining about it is making me happy it will be so.
---
So you want to have the same name pool for 6+ servers at a time? Really?
---
&gt;RemindMe! 96 days "doo diss"

 RemindMe! 96 days "doo diss"
---
Whats hard to watch about it exactly? You guys are just talking shit
---
Don't they still exist in retail? Or am I wrong on this?
---
How? What was so bad?
---
agreed, sharding is fucking awful
---
Honestly, 100% chance he would have benefited from shield block in the last few packs and especially on Herod.
---
He was getting crit and crushed by Herod and the lvl 39s every other attack. Like taking 120-180 damage. A shield block would have first of all halved that damage, then done the 18 reduction. So more like 70-80 damage reduction every other attack. 
---
Let’s average it out and call it like 40-50 because he’d sometimes block a normal hit. Would’ve helped the healer a great deal. He should have at least used it during Herod enrage.
---
Hey, they made it through without it, but his almost intentional misunderstanding of the point of the ability frustrates me so much. I almost want to go through the VOD, make a spreadsheet of how much damage he took, and calculate exactly how much his blocks would be helping. He wouldn’t have been taking such huge, chunky blows, and wouldn’t have come so close to death so many times.
---
I appreciate that he did have to prioritise keeping aggro, but there were so many situations where damage reduction was more useful. Herod after enrage, for example.
---
Had a twink warrior with searing blade, shadowfang and artic buckler I wanna say?
---
Honestly felt like the cruel barb was only marginally worse than shafowfang
---
I've watched some Asmon streams because I didn't know the guy. I dont think he's a really pleasant person to be around. Bit intense, lacks humor, self-reflection and seems to be just an obnoxious know-it-better. I've seen my share of people like that in college. Just not pleasant to hang around. But I can see that can make you popular in stream-land.
---
Compare that with if people like Madseason would stream.
---
Absolutely. Was watching Sodapoppin around the same time (He was doing BFD if I remember correctly) and he was discussing streamsnipers. The following quote is paraprhased.
---
"*I mean it's going to be a problem sometimes. When I am Main Tank in my guild and the raid cannot physically progress forward without having me there, it's going to be annoying when I am late because people are ganking me.*"
---
He is playing a druid. While druid tanks are viable in Classic, assuming not only that 1. You're going to be the main tank for *all* raids but also 2. That you are invaluable as a tank in your guild, means to me that you really need to eat more humble pie.
---
Found the guy who doesn't understand how packets work
---
Int doesn't give spell damage, only spell crit.
---
Sure but players have „better“ to do now
---
Don't forget people phasing in and out of your shard right in front of you.
---
totally, I am sure they will remember it forever....
---

---
The only thing you're testing is my ability to keep my goolies limp.
---
literally every goblin town is marked by a point, i even gave booty bay it's own ships wheel looking icon to make it more distinctive
---
It seems like everytime they mention it, the timeframe goes up. They are too worried about a "smooth launch". A few days of hectic crowds won't kill the game lol. Literally nothing could kill this game, but they can sure as hell ruin things with layering.
---
It's eventually going to be a moot point.
---
Y'know, unless Classic is such a rousing success that they don't get to turn off layering within 3 months.
---
And if that's the case.... uh, deal with it. Nothing's going to change Blizz's direction on retail except Classic numbers higher than their wildest dreams. I *hope* that happens.
---
True, which is also fixed with layering.
---
Because he thinks it would be less embarrassing to die (blame healer!) than to lose aggro (blame tank), thats the real reason
---
The “18 block value lul” meme is just a front. 
---
Herod would’ve been so much easier with shield block. If he doesn’t learn the hit/crit/skill value scaling on higher level mobs, it’s going to be super frustrating watching him tank high level content. I’m willing to bet he’ll skip improved shield block too.
---
Didn’t they say they would end it before phase 1 ?(2-3 months per phase)
---
He prob won't make it for very long in classic 
---
If you're not excited for the leveling grind it will probably crush you, was something unique about vanilla, you actually had to earn your end game .
---
seek some professional help please.
---
I am stopping this now, since this is pointless. But think about all the people playing on the same server using layering. They'll each need a unique name too. The amount of people linked like this pretty similar.
---
The only good advice here is 1h + shield, he did rend and tried to hamstring, maybe he should had hamstringed first sure.  
---
"  When kited don’t chase, back off and either bandage or get range to charge immediately when combat drops"  
---
Thats assuming the rogue doesnt know what he is doing, every rogue expects this. He bandaged 50% of his HP, cant get more value than that, and bandage was on CD.  
---
" Use bandage early in fight to have it off CD when rogue vanishes or blinds to use his bandage. "  
---
He LITERALLY did that tho  
---
" Store rage"  
---
He is level 30, u know how shitty the rage generation is???
---
Still neee the source though.
---
Also, cleaning many keyboards is by no means a simple task. I’m not saying that to justify it, but I am way more relaxed about my keyboard than I should be. I’d never let it get *that* bad though. It’s horrible.
---
Yes! I was able to play on the stress server and had an absolute blast. I can’t wait to level to 10 next week 😊😊😊
---
Black lotus doesn't have specific spawn points.  Layer hopping with a 5 min timer would be much slower than just running around.
---
[Few more shots from the Asmon raid](https://imgur.com/a/eMd9Gr0)
---
&gt; Layering will result in resource exploits, rare spawn exploits, nodes aoe spots etc. 
---
Don't you think Blizzard tracks this down in beta (as seen in many twicht clips) and will fix this?
---
Blizzard is a fucking monster in finding such exploit abuser, trust me. Got suspended in the last 3 years for exploits which were only known by a few people (&lt;20). They have gathered enough expirience in the last 15 years.
---
Don't buy GT, basically only friends and family or content creators getting in now
---
It says Legion.
---
I dont think legion means Classic.  
---
But check your [B.net](https://B.net) client on your PC, and see if its there.
---
you arent getting to the beta no matter if you sub.
---
Since you will be able to change Layers, it will be abused, no matter what.
---
Guys, I don't think it's worth fighting over something that's just going to be in for a couple weeks. Those weeks will go by either way, and then it's not a problem anymore. I'd rather that they spend their time working on shit that's going to matter forever.
---
Ap lol
---
Hehe, I did that too, especially with herbs but also ore in Suramar. Starlight Rose was selling pretty damn well. I made insane amounts of by doing this shit like two hours per day.
---
When Argus patch came, there was also a place with basilisk before Antorus entrance that made me even more gold than Suramar. I was rich af during Legion, all thanks to realm hopping.
---
Remember he should store rage too, all of that rage that you generate at lvl 30 lol. The guy is clueless, this is the only factual comment.
---
Yeah, it wasn't much worse at all, it was just bragging rights. I remember alot of casters would use it aswell, just to have it, even though there were better options.
---
perplexity's skill is better demonstrated when he isn't duelling a drooling boomer with 5000ms reaction time
---
Yes but it's temporary. It adds a new 'layer' if one is overcrowded and later merges them into one
---
!RemindMe 69 days
---
It said legion yesterday when it was the stress test and I literally explained in the post that I’m not home to check my pc or I would do that...
---
The amount of people on one server is the same as the amount of people on six servers?????
---
Yea, it's probably best we stop this, because you clearly have fucking brain damage.
---
&gt; Imagine people randomly agreeing to join your dungeon group and leaving after a few minutes, just to hop layers? 
---
This will be an incredible nuisance and it WILL happen frequently. People won't realize this until they play the game after launch, at which point it'll be too late to change it.
---
&gt; The alternative being crashing the second you look at the cave because there are 600 people in it.
---
The server would have crashed long ago. You wouldnt just crash from looking at those 2000 people... 
---
The game would either crash your computer or the server. It woudln't just crash for only you the second you looked at 600 people in the same space...
---
Imagine thinking you would play along woo easy fun times 200 fps 23 ping oh no!! I looked at 6000 people and something crashed (you still havent told me if its the server or your computer at this point becasue it dosnt make sense in either situation.)
---
This sub is too full of retail players and spineless casuals. Expect every comment to be someone saying "Ehh its not a big deal, blah blah blah"
---
You people would not even be getting Classic if private server players hadn't explained why things like this matter. If you disagree with a hardcore private server players opinion, YOU ARE PROBABLY WRONG.
---
Every day is another top post about how bfa or "retail" sucks or is worse than classic, why alienate part of the community like that? That's toxicity. Surely we can celebrate the great things about classic wow without making direct comparisons to what is essentially a different game?
---
I wonder when they will start with big advertisements and how they will look like..
---
Nope
---
"Don't worry, it's just beta, they will fix it for release!" - Famous last forum words for many failed games :)
---
There are simple ways to make it so that it doesnt matter at all and i've explained these multiple times. Most of these fuckers wont be L40 before the layering is gone and they think it will ruin the game for the next 2 years.
---
&gt;So you want to have the same name pool for 6+ servers at a time? Really?
---
Yes... You dont get your name? Choose another. There are almost infinate names for characters out there that are not a random jumble of letters.
---
Deal!!
---
forsen1 Czech bajs
---
in classic it will be  acknowledged  by the other players and by u having OP gear to show and fight with
---
yeah, this is sad :(
---
...
---
You are just as clueless as the guy who made that clueless comment.
---
Ouch what? You guys are noobs
---
ferals tank fine. The dps is notsogood. The hybridy spec is a really fun one to play, too.
---
Shamans, I don't know much about. Except that getting windfury totem on your warrior is game-breaking.
---
math checks out....
---
Terrible in solo PvP, great with support.
---
Pfft fuckin losers with jobs and wives and lives *laughs in lonely*
---
&gt; Polymorph your target
---
Not possible in classic
---
So you can stop auto attacking without untargeting. What if you wanna stop dps on the mob but keep it targeted? Need the auto attack button
---
You are delusional, the rogue should always win.
---
5 minutes is still too high to farm nodes. 
---
The really valuable nodes are random and shouldn't be spawning in the same places across layers. 
---
If the black lotuses are spawning in the same places across layers that's its own problem that should be addressed.
---
"Clunky" is unironically one of the biggest reasons why retail is so trash. The playerbase latches onto these buzzwords that Blizzard uses and regurgitates them until the devs capitulate and gut another unique mechanic or "overhaul" another class.
---
They said it would absolutely be ended before phase 2, because it *must* be due to world boss spawns, *BUT* they expect it to be removed much sooner than that.
---
http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/78772-nameplates-visible-from-farther-distance/
---
Seems to suggest otherwise.
---
Not to mention that as a new raid tier is released in classic WoW, not ALL the items from the previous one is replaced even if you, after several months get decked in current contents BIS. Some MC items are still BIS when BWL gets out, some BWL items are still BIS when AQ is out, some AQ items are still BIS in naxx etc.

Noticed major inconsistencies on the animation (cast time) of auto shots during the stress test.
---
without quiver x= 0,5 (as it should be)
---
with quiver x=0,5/1,1 (as it should be)
---
if the player swaps from melee hits back to auto shots without swapping targets the animation gets twice the quiver benefit x=0,5/(1,1\*1,1)
---
if the player swaps from melee hits back to ranged - and also swaps the target the animation only gets half the quiver benefit x=0,5/(1,05)

---
Overpower doesn't proc off misses, it procs of dodges. While you will see more dodges as well while dual-wielding (due to the increased amount of attacks) it also scales with your reduced weapon damage. If you use a slow main-hand and a fast off-hand you can get about 130% or so more procs, which is good, but it's still not some powerhouse talent. 
---
It looks good because it's such a high percentage and it usually gives you a crit which is great feedback, however compared to enrage and flurry (which has similar proc-rates) it suffers from only being one swing instead of multiple. Even with the increased procs from DW you're better off getting enrage asap.
---
In Vanilla there was no disconnect under the world, it is from MOP to BFA so actually in Classic if you are disconnected under the world, it's a bug and we have to report it
---
A little hyperbolic, considering it will be gone quickly and not active in zones outside of the few starting ones and their level 10 counterparts. Besides shouldn't the "community" and famous "blacklist" that "totally" existed back in classic prevent people from abusing it?
---
Interesting that the Fireball from the Vile Familiar only hit him for 3 damage, while their regular attacks do 3~4 (doesn't make much sense that a casted spell hits lower than autos). On pservs their fireball do like 15 damage.
---
It's level independent. If there are too many players (say in level 5-25 range) then the whole continent) is layered. Or at least this is how they explained it.
---
Not at lvl 30 when you barely generate rage genius
---
if you loot the chest 12 times you turn it into the golbin there for a better trinket that doesnt have a level req so its very good for twinks
---
Strange, with 3 days played on beta, I haven't noticed it in any way shape or form.
---
Lol. Take your private server entitlement and go back to it. 
---
Blizzard already proved your version of WoW is incorrect and layering is not the end of the universe you whiners are making it out to be.
---
Anything from Ulduar onward blows any vanilla raid out of the water just on level design alone.

&gt;What the fuck? Old Blizzard would’ve never sacrificed player experience to make merging servers a little easier
---
The fuck they wouldn't. They said they didn't have the technology to do so at the time.
---
If you're not locked you're not locked. An excessively long timeout won't make a difference.
---
Logging out is already a big timesink compared to exploiting invites to other layers. It doesn't need to be that long before it's not worth it.
---
Most characters going all the way back to vanilla are just 2 or 3 buttons dude.
---
soon you will get shadowbanned also pal, kiss your reddit account good bye  
---
you criticise others and u have the audacity to tell them to kill themselves
---
Gr8 b8 m8
---
They're both retail.
---
Yes you can still get the weapons, one is really good for rouges iirc
---
I lol every time I see this comment
---
gamers complaining that vanilla was better, just to be ignored and get "You think you do, but you don’t" by 6 figures salaries profesional game experts
---
I'm 100% against Layering, but since Blizzard is using that system, we must try to understand it and have faith in the developers. 
---
It probably wont be able to be exploited to the extent that people are worried about. Go listen to The last episode of "Countdown to Classic", there's an interview with an IT-security guy who explains it so a 5-year old can understand the limitations and possibilities of Layering.
---
It's not a good system, but IF it can enhance the experience in a way that is not exploitable, it might be good for the long-term health of the realms.
---
&gt; Find Minerals and Track Herbs can be seen on other players as a buff. In vanilla it appeared on the side of your minimap and you could NOT tell when other players had it active. 
---
Are you sure about that ? IIRC, it was a buff that you had to cast, and you could only have one active at the same time.
---
As such, it's not surprising to me that you could see other players's buffs, and their current tracking ability also.
---
I mean... ok.. yes it kinda sucks if you randomly get into another layer but in the end... I value server stability and actually being able to play classic again more than having to see 500+ people around me except for cities and it otherwise destroying the servers.... As long as they are keeping their promise to reduce/remove it over time i'm fine with it. And in the end... as its already said.. its not crossrealm.. you will still only see other people of your own servers.. you can still form friendships etc. with layering.
---
If Classic ends up getting the playerbase people around here think/hope it will then most of them will not even have started playing on the first day. There's probably gonna be more people in the starter zones on the 30.-31. than on launch day since it's the start of the weekend.
---
It is worth. Tryhards will reach 60 within a week and completely exploit the system for farming herbs/ore. This will have a huge impact on the economy.
---
Contending with the desires and day to day life of another human being is all he's talking about... it depends how entwined your two lives are.
---
Not like any of that stuff really matters, Vanilla is a casual game no matter what you think the fact is layering is exponentially better than crashing, dead servers and dynamic respawns which ruin move rarity and immersion in caves etc.
---
Just deal with it.
---
The last episode of the podcast Countdown to Classic (#105) tells perfectly what it is.
---
How will this solve anything? You can still phase to farm lower level resources.
---
Can we just chill a bit? Likes yes, stress test and we’re not here to level all the way through... but to burn people for wanting to be part of the fun? You’re telling me people aren’t meant to be excited? They shouldn’t have cared about being part of it? The fuck is wrong with this community! Where’s the humanity part of it? We praise classic for being all about community but if this the sort of filth elitism, i hope no one finds this subreddit.
---
I’m excited, I’ll play it when it’s out. But man hating on those who want to enjoy the stress test? Get off your high horse. You see videos of people having a blast and everyone is like hur dur, shit on you, you shouldn’t want to have fun.
---
Incorrect. Players aren’t divided by levels. They’re divided by population. Once the main instance of the continent on a server is full, a new “layer” is created and players are put into it. 
---
Layers are filled and emptied as needed, and will be removed completely by the end of phase one, if not before it.
---
spam shouts
---
You can actually cheese the Rag fight a little bit by getting a fire resistance buff from one of the mobs near BWL. If you mind control him and stick FR on key people in the raid it makes it easier. It's not really necessary but if you're struggling on Rag it makes it an absolute breeze.
---
They can keep layering but only for level 1-10 zones for example, for a week or two IMO.
---
Once people get higher levels and spread out, it isn't a big enough issue.
---
did someone forcedm you to watch his streams, father?
---
How would you know who is on which layer though?
---
Haha, no, haha.
---
Mythics in classic, do you even realize how utterly impossible this sounds? Mythic is product of over a decade of streamlining content, QoL, and the complete removal of any and every RPG aspect of the game. Mythic is a direct result of class homogenization, made in order to give high end players something to strive for. It's simply a "glue" to hold the game together because there is absolutely nothing in between the beginning and the "end" in current Retail content.
---
This system should never see the day of light when it comes to Classic, to make them work would require a complete overhaul of the entire game.
---
You don't need mana when the boss is dead. More threat more dps shorter encounters less need for healing and you can bring more dps.
---
Ahhh ice fishing in Dun Morogh, that takes me back..
---
I don’t think you understand how layering works. You cannot just travel to an empty, pristine layer.
---
Layers are only created once the initial layer is full. Once the population of a layer drops, that layer is then merged back into the main population.
---
There will not be empty layers with fresh nodes. Any layer you enter will have similar populations as the one you left.
---
i once bought TBC in a shop and the guy asked me if i had the original and then went on to tell me about how crazy addictive WoW was  
---
in my head i was like "yeah i've only spent like 2 years of my life smashing WoW all day every day, can you please just shut up so i can go home and install tbc now?"
---
They do exist I guess? havent played since MoP. But back then people had nothing else for the head slot at that level.
---
&gt;This is misinformation.
---
I don't think it is.
---
There will be streamers on many servers that are able and will play every waking hour they have, with many having a lot of help from people watching them.
---
So if you're not as quick as them in getting the quests done (around 8 days for the raid reset) you're probably not getting it.
---
Fingerbutt
---
Weird flex but okay
---
But account age has nothing to do with beta access lolololol =[
---
They said in the post that they're going to use everyone from the first test. Whether or not they add more test servers for new people, we don't know.
---
don't forget roflmao please!
---
So much truth into this post, it brings me back to when I just got TF with the help of another guild while we still had to down Vael.
---
As you just said, trying to keep a "laid on" approach wasn't easy, because there were always blame wildcards to be thrown at on both Vael and Razorgore.
---
Among the many things and shit talks, I remember of one particularly, on Razorgore: I was MT of this guild back then, and in 2006 my 14y younger brother (11yo at the time) got to lvl 60 as a Hunter and got decently geared in MC. After watching the fights tutorials he came for his first attempts and got immediately put to the test in the kiting (first time ever). There comes two tries where he tested the waters, made a couple of mistakes and wiped the raid, immediately shit talk started with people moaning and blaming of his inexperience and him being there only cause I had "leverage" and he was the "MT's" brother, a young kid.
---
I tried to calm the waters giving him a couple more chances, as everyone made mistakes on their first tries, even our Hunter Class Leader, and as a brother I've been proud on how he put every other "more experienced" hunter to shame on the third, fourth and fifth try (and kill on the last) where he did a flawless and extraordinary job with his kiting/trapping duties.
---
That, the social aspect of Vanilla, is the only thing I bet no one of the "newcomers" or "newer players" of WoW ever even considered, 'cause it's all nice and dandy, until you get to BWL.
---
I remember when we first started raiding as rogues none of us had a clue what our ideal rotation was and only one of us was using slice and dice. When we saw how much better he was than the rest of us we all obviously started using slice and dice - seems moronic now but there really wasn't a definitive guide of how to play when you first dinged 60 and started raiding.
---
Well... obviously  it's easier for a raid to have 40 raiders with the best specs than 39 raiders with the best specs and one with an average/bad one but it's not like it's required to have 40 players playing at 110% to clear raids. Generally you're happy if half your raid is competent and half the other is just not messing up too bad at least up until Naxx.
---
So yes, probably all raids outside of hardcore guild will have a handful of players like this and will manage just fine. But don't fool yourself: guilds won't be actively looking for you so you'll have to prove yourself valuable in other ways.
---
“It’s only beta bro chill the fuck out”
---
“It’s only launch day bro they’ll fix it next week”
---
I see we’re back on the slippery slope that fucked retail WoW.
---
And they wont be spent working on "classic+" content. Do you honestly see Jeff Kaplan being moved from Overwatch or any other new game in order to make sure Classic doesn't derail? Nah...
---
Layering isn't up yet on the Beta. What is shown is sharding. Which only provides more support for layering.
---
You realize this is sharding, right? Not layering? This supports layers. Gotta love it when the evidence destroys the argument by itself.
---
Unfortunately no, the first one is for the stress test, the second one is for the next stress test. They said that everyone who was in the first one would be able to participate in the second test.
---
Looks the same to me.
---
My imp was and still is Nalmat. Also had a Ruptip.
---
Vanilla Hyjal always looked like this.
---
" Pre berserker rage ofc) also getting 5-8 kited is pretty silly, he should have thrown wep and take a step back and throw to prevent rogue from dropping combat."  
---
This comment keeps coming up and is stupid, you guys are assuming the rogue wouldnt correct his own position when the warrior would drop back, newsflash, this rogue aint terrible, he knows exactly how to kite.  
---
" Not having tactical mastery is bad as fuck. Even a prot tank should get tactical mastery, it's the best pvp talents you can have at 30 besides maybe deep wounds."  
---
Lol no, without trinkets a 5sec stun is way better, the only reason the rogue didnt get fucked by it is because he dodged it.  
---
" Using demoralizing shout would have helped him. 50%over power crit. 5% base crit. "  
---
He did use it, it missed.  
---
" Without tact mastery you are basically throwing away 10-20 rage every 10 seconds which is fucking terrible. Spec properly. "  
---
It wouldnt had helped him, he went berserker stance only once, there is no reason to be in it, you dont have whirlwind etc, and against rogue you want battlestance for overpower.
---
They’re pretty close honestly
---
With enchants too
---
They’re basically strong twinks
---
All of that trouble just to avoid layering for the first 6 weeks. Wow, that's the most autistic shit I've ever heard. I'm really thankful Blizz isn't listening to the community on straight up 40iq suggestions like this lmfao
---
What's the buff the french guy has?
---
Do it for the dirge's kickin' chimaerok chops, +25 Stammina Food
---
I know and that's why I think they need to fix that. People should all funnel in the same layer on later zones.
---
Idk what you're even talking about anymore, man. Nothing you said there had anything to do with most post.
---
Don't forget to take your meds.
---
You do realize a rogue SHOULD win agaainst a warrior right? Specially at lvl 30.
---
I hope my data of 2hrs jumping to the top of goldshire inn was useful
---
So frustrating to watch as a tank player
---
Where do Warlocks shine the most, PvP or PvE? With the debuff limit I feel like they don't have enough damage or utility to excel in what they do? I'm unsure about this opinion and was hoping to get some feedback. Thanks!
---
Do you really think it's adequate to compare viewer numbers of a stale old game everyone can play themselves with the hot new shit nobody can play?
---
How are people unironically using the temporary vabilla hype as a gauge of how successful the game will be?
---
At least aait till a month after release to see how many people stuck with it. Day 1 I guarantuee it will be flooded with players but how many stick around for even lvl60 remains to be seen.
---
They said legion was the only xpac that didnt half ass the hero aspect. So they are talking about one aspect of the game, and only comparing it to other expansions (see recent) where the player is treated as a grand hero. Reading the post might help
---
How was he bad, lets see your knowledge
---
Only if you assume that they are actually going to 'fix' it and that its not how they intend it to work. Which I dont.
---
That's the point, people requesting to join and will leave 10 sec if they realize they're not transported to a new layer or leave 2 min if they are transported and can get their black lotus or w/e
---
eagle is stam+int. you're thinking of falcon
---
Demo shout got resisted every time and spamming battle shout wouldn’t do it by itself
---
Yea because people never quit and sell their accounts, ive sold 5 of my accounts, everytime i quit i sell it.
---
I was fighting on the horde side, thanks for the most fun I’ve had in a long while on WoW!
---
I won't lie. This has been 100% me, for the last week or so.
---
Layering is very immersion breaking, that's what I'm most annoyed about. Whole areas can suddenly change all mobs and players, becoming crowded or empty depending on which layer server you or they were sent to.
---
At the very least they should make layer changes extremely restrictive, delayed and controlled so they don't just "happen" nor are abused, nobody should be able to ever do a quick layer change.
---
Pick the class you want to play, and have him pick a class he wants to play. don't try to min/max the choice ... you spend way too much time on this shit for it to be anything other than the class you want to play. Similar with races. Some racial abilities are slightly better than others, but just ignore that and pick the one that you like better.
---
If you're leveling up together as a group (that's the most fun!) then ... if you want to play sometime when they are not online, start a second character (of a different class) and play that one instead. That way the characters that you're playing together stay the same level. (Later on at the level cap, everybody catches up and you can pick which character you want to play in any given situation.)
---
Please stop whiteknighting massive companies. Layering is unnecessary when they could just open two new servers.
---
Thanks, i forgot which was which, tho to be fair now that i think of it, youd want agi spirit in the context of priest
---
It's not exploiting to travel to another layer by party invites, how in gods name are people going to get banned for that?
---
Omar Akbar, praise be upon him.
---
Its easier to imagine than to ignore imo. Roleplayers have to imagine all sorts of things, and slightly elevating their position in their head is fine, but its really jarring having to ignore every named NPC screaming champion. In the ideal world yeah you could choose and the game would be designed twice over for both aspects, but if you need to have a slight inconsistency to improve the overall experience thats not a big deal
---
I might be wrong, but i remember back in the day being quite annoyed by the fact that the tooltip damage of spells didn't change based on anything other than the rank of the spell.
---
That sounds like a logistical nightmare. What happens if all 6 servers within a group that you planned on merging are all high pop and another group contains 6 dead servers. How do you merge that without collision? go.
---
Yes ninja looters will get a bad reputation. However, you don't want to be known as the guy constantly complaining about ninjas in world chat.
---
There are some people on my no-group list because they either just won't shut up about it or because their definition of ninjaing is "I wanted that item, how dare he roll!".
---
Yeah, I've noticed this sub has already more "Blizzard can't do wrong" people than r/wow these days.
---
I appreciate their passion about Classic and how they response to feedback. I'm not a hater, I can admit when they do something right. But people defending absolutely everything, even this, might be the ones ruining Classic in the end, just like BfA during alpha and beta when people like Towelliee were defending it everywhere they could. Those people were probably the ones defending Blizzard when Diablo Immortal was announced.
---
MHYSA! MHYSA!
---
Now make it to Stratholme!
---
Why are people mentioning this? He is an Orc, you ever played vanilla? He has 25% from racial + 15% from talents to a total of 40% stun resist. Still people are like "lOl He ReSiStEd StUn"
---
Speaking of gateway computers, I just had a brand new gateway crt monitor delivered and it looks great ingame haha
---
in dungeons, i like a mage? sheep, aoe/kiting potential, decurses, and free drinks.
---
Was doing a "speedrun" and it only has a few minutes respawn time :). Hope I didn't ruin his day!
---
Based
---
2 sets of 7 data points that have zero overlap isn't significant?? I don't want to run the numbers but this is a very significant result. You're looking at means of \~12 and 8 with SD's of \~1. You're looking at a p value of \~0.0006 saying these are statistically significant.
---
This is so accurate that it’s sorta fucked up
---
REALLY!?!?!?! He resisted a few stun with 40% stun resist? NO WAY!!!!!!! Its almost like he specced that way
---
Did you just assume my generation?
---
It’s garbage.
---
https://youtu.be/zvjBwiKN_gY
---
I don’t think he used shield wall once in the 3 hour run
---
These are speed runs. Their goal is to kill bosses with minimum time possible. That means getting as much DPS as it's possible. Besides, speed runs are mostly done by people who are already confident in clearing the raidand who have the equipment that drops there.
---
With 40% stun resist
---
This is the one and only reason retail become boring really quickly after a new expansion. The raids are great, the dungeons are spectacular for the most part, m+ makes it challenging and fresh each week and there are alot of things to progress you character even in solo content... Too bad none of it mattes as soon as the patch hits though!
---
ID be fine with catchup as it was in wrath, you got like one tier old gear for a whole days worth of farming, maybe less, dont remember. But getting 4-5 pieces a night is just boring after a while.
---
&gt;To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will  also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account.
---
If you go to the website, it looks as though they're saying that only people who have an active sub will be chosen for the stress test. I'm certain that people who haven't played on live for years have gotten beta invites.
---
Lol its getting turned off a few weeks after launch. Stop being all doom and gloom.
---
That’s not how it works. Layers are only created once the initial one is full. Any layer you enter will have similar populations. You won’t be put into an empty layer with pristine nodes all to yourself.
---
No point reasoning with this lot, they're just a bunch of crabs in a barrel.
---
Tell us what he should do then genius
---
Negative, I’m assuming corporate has the final say. The only keeping them back is the backlash of the playerbase - they’ll will get away with we let them and no more. We are apparently used enough to being charged for demos and betas (and other half finished products no doubt) that we’re fine with that particular corporate cash in. Hell we’ll write it off as generous and defend them for it. In fact we will write nothing less than “they won’t make any more money on it after because it’s 1 sub” as if it was all a gift from our generous overlords. 
---
You believe what, that EA is different than blizzard? A popular opinion no doubt, made so by the deep desire to have it be so. Meanwhile blizzards CEO is as shitty as anyone and the company does things like make record high revenue years, then fire hundreds of the people who made it happen. 
---
If the devs of classic manage to keep the design philosophy authentic to vanilla I will applaud them. I wont pretend that charging for a beta is somehow good business conduct, but that’s a different kind of support, not me being against the game. On the contrary being vigilant against corporate bs is the best thing we could do for this game and the industry, but sadly it seems the notion of good business conduct has been swept away with modern twitch and gaming culture.
---
Look at his username.
---
No it wasnt you scrub, he healed 40%
---
Any proof that’s how it was or are you just throwing out how things “should” be? They’re twinks with full consumables, enchants, and buffs.
---
The amount of warlocks on Classic will be very high. 
---
I think alot of players will be suprised on the role warlocks will have to perform in pve. You are a support class, and you will start increasing your dps (if your intention is to compete dps meters) once you raid AQ and Naxx. IF you raid AQ and Naxx. So be aware that the first year (?) unless you really like that role, you will have a different feeling untill then imo.
---
Pvp should be fun in an organized group. Also solo farming is great, and its a Top RPG class imo.
---
PvP for the majority of the game they are among the strongest classes and the soul link spec is probably universally the strongest PvP talent spec in the game, they have good aoe damage in dungeons, but for raids they are kinda below average until higher tiers of content AQ/Naxx where they quickly become top tier.
---
There's a blue post, you can prob find it on this sub.
---
maybe but they still tried to log on and stress tested the servers by doing that
---
Please stop, you are cringy and obviously clueless, warrior want dodge for overpower......
---
I remember wearing bloodfang for a while in vanilla my memory could be wrong but you could easily be in most of your bloodfang into AQ40.
---
Nexie sure is giving us max exposure
---
Many people will, in fact, give a shit, I've seen these things happen a bunch of times from Vanilla - Wotlk.
---
Yeah 2 more servers are totally going to house 5 million people making their characters at the same time.
---
'OHHH BUT VANILLA DIDN'T HAVE LAYERING'. Yes, it also didn't have 90% of the playerbase start on the day the game came out. You're fucking stupid if you can't grasp something this simple.
---
As other posters said, yes you can. However, there are parts of the chain that require a raid of 30-40 players to complete. Most guilds might struggle to get players motivated to do these parts done for your benefit alone (as from memory, only 1 person can do each part at time)
---
I mean yes, but you also have that in retail and it wasn't my point :-)
---
I meant that by the time you kill ragnaros or whatever else evil beings there are, even in classic you'd be no longer a common man, but a hero. Which goes against what the guy said to whom i responded to. If the game acknowledges it, that's very nice for the immersion in a way. But in an MMO, there are more heroes than commoners, which is immersion breaking again.
---
So that aspect isn't something which is worse in retail than it was in classic.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "This, need!"
---
&gt;Please stop whiteknighting massive companies.
---
Please stop projecting and shut the fuck up.
---
Since ever, a good rogue destroys a warrior all day every single day. SPECIALLY at lvl 30.
---
Look, I was having so much fun during stress test. Like really, even level 5 PvPing was more fun than anything I do in BfA these days. And that old world, just running around the old Orgrimmar, meeting Thrall. It was so good.
---
With that being said, this is my only complaint. I get it they have to use it on release, however I hated it during stress test. People outside of OG waiting for duels were literally disappearing in front of me. I saw a whole raid group dissapear too. I hate sharding on retail, and this looks similiar.
---
People defending even this should seriously think for a second. Defending and excusing everything might ruin Classic in the end.
---
I think that will all still be true. There could always be a bug or something. But I think that stuff was all true originally, and the intent is to keep the mechanics the same as they were.
---
There will still be War Efforts that will timegate it further though, right? IIRC even after all the War Effort requirements are hit you will have to wait 5 days until the gate can be opened, and I don't think the War Efforts will be completed in 3 days, even with people hoarding items beforehand.
---
This is just 1 opinion though, if the servers don’t work on launch day there will be thousands of people calling the game shit, leave and never come back to it.
---
You don’t know what’s “best for raid” (I don’t even really think you know how the game works) so who the fuck are you to tell anyone to do anything?
---
No, they didn't.
---
Please pay attention to context.
---
Vanilla is clunky because that's just how it was back then but the gameplay is slower, so it doesn't feel that way. That's also part of the reason why almost nobody is bothered by CDs being on the GCD, the other being that CDs are rare and have long ass cooldowns.
---
With Cata the gameplay got simply faster. Haste started affecting more and more, first rotational spell cooldowns, then the global cooldown. CDs were taken off the GCD to allow for smoother rotations that could keep you on your toes, making the gameplay all in all faster.
---
In addition to that, the warlocks got revamped completely with MoP where now each of them had unique spenders and builders, making mana management (which warlocks never really had to manage unlike other mana classes) essentially usless. And Life Tap was just a leftover of a past design.
---
I also want to remind that the general playerbase agrees that the MoP versions of Warlocks are some of the best specs the game has ever seen.
---
Had they taken Life Tap off the GCD it would have just been spammed as soon as warlocks lost a bit of mana. They also couldn't turn back to the very slow gameplay of the earlier versions of WoW, so the best way to handle it was to remove it.
---
The biggest reason why retail is "so trash" right now is because Blizzard still wants to cater to every person in the spectrum of their game. Rotations in MoP were too complex for a lot of people and still were in MoP. The easy access to damage meters then allows for bad players to cry that it is unfair that they can't just do the same damage good players deal and Blizzard eventually gives in, which is how we got the current classes. In addition to that, Blizzard suddenly decides that the game should slow down a lot while also making rotations completely uninteresting due to snapshotting no longer being a thing and the most exciting spells being talents that are often worse than the passives you can choose there.
---
If Blizzard catered to the middle ground, the people that manage to reach at least the 50th percentile of their specs, the game wouldn't be in the mess it is right now.
---
And clunky is not a buzzword blizzard primarily uses. The community in WoW and especially other games uses it far more often.
---
Ok, thanks for the info 
---
:D

Plural of sheep is sheep not sheeps.

RemindMe! 96 days doodlidoo
---
I got in and tried out the beginning of my leveling route last night.
---
Orc is objectively the best race in WoW in terms of racial, there is just no argument against it.
---
So if you can play orc for your class, then you play orc.
---
Wotlk was Hearthstone
---
We got it done within 8 days on a server with a population of 150-200ish. So I’d be surprised if it lasts longer for any server. The war effort may take longer than the quest part
---
Its correct some spells damage scales with level.  
---
SBolt rank 1 damage is: 12 + Level * 0.40 to 17 + lvl * 0.40
---
This. This so much. I have a group of friends that are all going ham on this game as soon as it releases and they all talk about raiding, end game pvp, etc...
---
Me? I'm mostly looking forward to leveling. Gear mattering when you level, old talent builds, AOE mage farming, exploring....Just having a blast.
---
I'm probably not gonna level to max in the first few weeks, I want to take at least a month (even with intense playing). I want to enjoy  it as much as I can.
---
That's what I was looking for. Thx!
---
Mate, dont give attention to the haters, focus your attention on the positive. Also dont say things like "im the best at X" even if it was true, you know how people take things like that. Instead of saying it show it. :) Peace
---
I'm seeing an image of a dude looking down. My gf has no issues with me taking time to enjoy the opening of the servers, I'm sure a lot more are the same. just saying that if the gf is part of that category something isn't well.
---
I stopped playing during WoTLK and only came back to try BfA. So I can't comment on Warlocks between those 2 points.
---
Life Tap may have become an archaic spell, however originally it was a defining, unique aspect of the Warlock class.
---
Sonii is such a drama queen cry baby. Who the hell cares what he thinks?
---
Met two people very quickly and did the journey from Teldrassil to Stormwind, exactly like I did more than ten years ago. Great occasion.

My guess is they never intend to turn it off. They wanted to reduce server costs so they've continued to improve sharding.
---
is the doomguard summon quest in classic or bc?
---
And if I enslave it how long will it be my pet?
---
Imagine not starting in defensive stance in a duel against a rogue. The duel that happened afterwards against the warlock is even funnier.
---
Did someone say alternate timeline?
---
It is as important as the othe cot instances
---
Yeah I think I’ll look for a guild with back to back raid nights (May be pretty common with no dual spec). That will save on respec costs because I enjoy healing quite a bit.
---
For what type of content? For raids, if you plan to go into a hardcore guild, you will have a bad time. If you play in casual guilds, chances are that they will take you, especially if the raid is under farm.
---
For other types of content, they are fine since they are flexible. 1shoting people with ench is fun.

Will depend on what server you're on and so forth, but don't underestimate how quick it can be done.
---
Don't forget, to be able to even have the slightest chance at this you'd need to be in one of the best and fastest guilds on the server you're on and you'd have to have been chosen by the guild to get the questline done and get the rewards.
---
Ragnanus?
---
This is so True. I remember in kingdoms of amalur:reckoning you start out as a dude (unbound by fate) and every enemy poses a threat, but by the time you hit the 3rd or 4th zone you are already a fate bending god that can oneshot anything that gets close.
---
Still a fun game though, highly recommend, just dont craft anything.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "Douthat"
---
It sure didn’t make good progress.
---
First of all,  who cares if the ms warz doesn’t out dps fury, it does out dps mages.
---
By your logic then, the mages are being selfish for being present in the raid in the first place.
---
Taken to the logical conclusion, your min max strategy should involve nothing but fury warriors (since they have highest dps) and I would assume either priests for horde or Paladins (since they are most efficient healers)
---
I have given you several different arguments explaining why your reasoning is wrong, and you just keep re-staying the same indoctrinated nonsense you learned on the pservers.
---
You didn't exactly missed the boss spawning event - that one not only happened at the end of the 2 hour stress test, but it also happened again at the 24h end of the stress test. And it will happen again at the 2 hour and 24 hour marks of the next stress test on 29 may and the other upcoming ones too.
---
I honestly don't think I'll miss anything.
---
No - I told you your generation.
---
Looked like a pretty good duel to me.  There is a reason rogues held a majority on servers back in the day.
---
Well there still is a difference between what i described, and sharding. Sharding is multiple shards intermingling, layering is solid chunks of players tied together, but only to an extent. 
---
Im sure from an IT perspective, its much harder than "just layer the zones 1-30". However, it wouldn't be impossible. It would effectively be sharding in those zones, but with the quality of layering, where there are certain layers people are generally tied to.  The issues sharding causes are being jumbled around planes of existence like an ethereal slinky, which "layering" for 1-30 could solve. And then you get the other plus, where 30+ is un-layered, where most community driven gameplay starts.
---
The event at the end of 2hour stress test happened again at the shutdown of the servers - at the 24h mark. They'll do it again for next stress test (29 may) - same 2h and 24h.
---
&gt;Don't you think Blizzard tracks this down in beta (as seen in many twicht clips) and will fix this?
---
Not if we dont complain alot and loud enough, trust me.
---
Wtf happened to the option in the menus
---
I thought so too.
---
Have a look at one of the top posts in this subreddit.
---
A streamer mines a node, relogs on his level 1 alt, logs back on his main and the node is back there to be mined again. People are already exploiting “layer-hopping” as we speak in the beta.
---
Give this man an award.
---
Found one of the snowflakes
---

---
Transmog and dualspecc
---
Fair enough! Thats why I created this post!
---
Let me ask you this, didn't bother (as an example) having this great looking red set on your super powerful character and then your boots are green or something? A total contrast with the rest xD
---
For me personally its annoying! Ofc back then, I wouldn't even dream with a feature like  transmog so it wound't bother me that much.
---
I like cosmetic stuff on RPGs, I might be super biased tho!
---
Won’t be that way. In classic, you’ll have to group up with others for some quests. Community and reputation matters. People are just nicer.
---
And they'd fall from the sky one by one to form the ad
---
I mean 15 threads a day for possible Classic+ or nay other kind of changes, and you are worrying for something that will exist only temporary?
---
If you’re melee. If not, it’s useless.
---
Imagine believing what Blizzard says in 2019.
---

Simple fix renamed version: "Unending" breath.

Tracking dropdown menu on the minimap.
---
This is the most accurate and honest answer.
---
Server launches are fun. No one is going to be bothered a week later. but if they keep sharding longer than a week, it can actually have consequences on the games economy and be unfair for people.
---
:( sad
---
What a great read. Hope to read more from you.
---
I think it's just the inherent flaw of an mmo. Either you'll be unimportant forever, so that you can do all the fetch quests and there are no heroes wherever you look, or the npcs respect you for the hero you are, only worthy quests available, but everyone else is a hero too.
---
“Oh looks like server populations didn’t all drop by 50-75% a month after launch, sorry guys, we can’t turn off layers”
---
Pretty sure it's just a buff in retail now, not an actual piece of equipment.
---
I miss being actually hyped for the Halloween event. Leveling alts with the buff candies and bobbing for apples always just felt good.
---
I am going healer as always, no dual specc its a pain!
---
"Pocket Healer LF Farming Group"!
---
Exactly. Are people getting doxxed? Swatted? No? It's just words then? Okay stfu babies
---
And sealed iirc. Wasn't there a space you could jump between the door and the entrance from the top?
---
First off, where are you finding this "excessive sharding/layering" because I have not seen it at all in my experience on beta.
---
Second of all, what's your alternative?
---
Next stress test is up in 5 days and everyone previously invited is also invited so you can continue the test and make a new thread :)
---
What does it actually do?
---
That is the IDEAL, but its not working like that at all right now, as you can see in clips on the frontpage. Again, you are going of Blizzards WORD here, a company that is only interested in your money, and nothing else.
---
That's what I pray for.
---
where's that other one?! tha one with the min-max priest vs. the average chad who gets into raids "because of great personality" :D anyone link?
---
It looks like the mountain is the body of a derpy wizard.
---
Depends on how you see things.
---
When i play RPG, i make choices and these choices sometimes aren't pretty. In WoW i like to eventually learn how high end gear looks like so i can tell what Joe did by simply looking at him.
---
In PvP it's like "man look at this guy, he has Ashkandi!", so... do i fight him or flee?
---
It's immersion, and i value immersion more than anything.
---
While layering will almost feel like different servers until they merge them few weeks after launch, it's also important to realize that's why they've done the stress test, to mess around, adjust and observe how layering works with a real (and big) population of players.
---
Oh? My mistake
---
Premade group/raid finder, I’ve always hated having to waste my time with bad players because of a lack of information.
---
I will also miss mythic raids and mythic +, I’ll miss trading actually difficult end game content with hard leveling content that will only last me a short week.
---
I’ll miss dual specs, having to buy gold to be competitive in both PVE and PVP is really restrictive and unfun.
---
I’ll miss arenas. Having a ranked PvP system is so much better than the grindy vanilla system that really only measures your ability to find a party that plays around your availability. Personal skill should always be the biggest factor IMO.
---
how do you suggest people monopolise it and thus drive up prices with layering?
---
Man that really seems impossible without being someone popular like a streamer, it's basically a 1 in 40 chance that you can participate and you seemingly only have one shot at it.
---
They say that, but I'd really like to get my hands on one of those "Wombats of Slaying" now. I need it.
---
Orc because of the lore. Come on the coolest Heroes are orcs and you will get that for the Horde feeling.
---
I heard that clip was taken out of context and it actually took quite a bit of trial and error and relogging (and probably luck for the node to be in the same spot on each layer) for that to be possible.
---
Either way, he proved the concept that it can be done I guess.
---
Where/when did you notice layering in the stress test? I couldn't even get in at first, tried 16 hours later and the orc starting zone was absolutely perfect. Loads of people still fighting over mobs and grouping up to kill them, but not to the point where the game was unplayable.
---
The streamers and their popularity confuse the hell out of me, too.
---
"I'll show them what real toxicity is!"
---
Fuck that. I want more Asmongold clips! /s
---
&gt; All of your time ~~in World of Warcraft~~ is wasted time
---
I dunno, I like looking at a high level player in Orgrimmar and just by looking at their gear I can instantly tell that they have put in some serious time and effort on their character.
---
Time enjoyed is not time wasted.
---
Nearly all the content in current WoW is a walking simulator.
---
Countdown to classic had a network security specialist on to explain, in a frustrated tone, in detail, his hypothesis for why all the above would OF COURSE be impossible. Layering would NOT be dynamic like sharding, not always just trying to balance out populations by shifting characters around. Your toon would be almost hard-tied to one layer except in specific circumstances and t would be hard to hop around to exploit resources. No problem!
---
Then I see this video, showing he was wildly optimistic and talking out of his ass...
---
Then when classic comes out ,scale difficulty and exp by 30% so it will take players longer to level
---
research things before talking about them  
---
its only for initial phase, otherwise you would have dead servers everywhere and they would have to merge things which would screw with the char and guild names
---
Great work OP. All remember to report this and issues like this. Maybe post it too the blizzard forums as well?
---
My current wow account was from EU launch. Had one older account in US beta + US launch, but lost logins to that ages ago. Got in to the beta on my EU account.
---
What else do i have, on top of the release date creation ?
---
\- CE's of first 5 expansions
---
\- Blizzcon virtual ticket to every event ever ( and with that to last blizzcons classic demo ).
---
\- Hadnt had a wow sub in the last dunno 5-6 years. Resubbed for 1 month just a chance to get into the beta.
---
Because we can. Also we can kill the bloodhoofs so they die..can't kill pur ooy king bud.
---
When you see people having fun with what they do, instead of cold „professional“ copy-paste responses.
---
I agree with you. Having a healer that pays attention to you and a decent main tank makes warlocks laugh at mages and makes them really strong for classic, precisely because of Life Tap. 
---
But as time went on and on (even as early as wrath), the class as a whole revolved less and less around it. It's only natural as time goes on I guess.
---
It's only natural for it to be a culture shock for someone like you, who didn't get eased into the slow removal of Life Tap but Blizzard doesn't help either with how many gameplay problems Retail currently has.
---
Man, I don't think everyone who makes female chars is an incel, or views it that way at all. I make female characters often. I just figure I'd rather look at a female character than a male. I don't really read into it that much.
---
Seems to easy then mate, lvl 30 doing a 42 plus dungeon and taking fck all damage lol
---
who's the first to 60 on a merger? communities will have different pvp and pve progressions, economies and completely different set of players
---
I mean is it really a surprise? It could be tbc or wrath, and if you give people a free game with lots of hype they are going to play it in launch. If people here want to shit on BFA launch week really isn't going to mean anything. If BFA wasn't empty that week classic would have to have had one of the worst marketing campaigns of all time.
---
&gt;RemindMe! 96 days "/console WeatherDensity 3"  
---

---
I remember back then, not wishing for transmog because I couldn't even grasp of the idea but I remember talking with my guild that I hope for some sort of dye system, that the gear would remain exactly the same but you could dye it.
---
You coudn't do it to tier sets or "meaningful" gear if thats makes sense, but some random off parts just to match the rest.
---
Again this is (was) me being who I am, and thats probably why I love transmogs so much.
---
Wait what? Did people did get different stress test times?
---
And you're wrong. I was gen y long before people started using the term millenial and half of the definitions of millenial don't even include the year I was born.
---
Not to be a douche, but i wonder why you even (if you) want to play Classic? Just asking.
---
Couldn't they have brought in 10 people? That should be the cap in 1.12 right?
---
dual spec  
---
i wont be playing a healer because this doesnt exist in classic  
---
miss me with that extra grind to pay respec in order to grind  
---
most needed role in game is buttfucked by terrible game design, miss me with that
---
Yes, but I ignore them just like that
---
Fair enough, I guess. Was this confirmed by Blizzard?
---
why do you feel this is better than layering?
---
Reading!?! But I'm angry now!
---
Noone does heroics on live everyone e does M+ and this isn't close to being as hard as M+.
---
The stress test was basically several realms, that you would phase between depending on which group you joined.
---
That's a decent way of reducing the lag in a 24 hour event, but for weeks after launch, it will cause a lot of issues.
---
It's about the community being spread out, not seeing all of your realm at the same time.
---
For a long time T1 is vonna be god tier
---
Hey. We get to go to 10 this time! I just hope people start at the beginning (although the time is weird). There was some frustration with people not getting in, but that was actually part of the test.
---
On the stress test it was wigging out and really just looked like scuffed sharding. Feels like there was like 10k+ people on the stress test all crammed into starter zones, so maybe that made it wig out, but I’m worried.
---
It is obvious you are more interested in other expansions because frankly it’s obvious you don’t know what you are talking about with regards to vanilla.
---
Considering the fact that min maxers like yourself will likely burn out on the leveling process (it’s much more difficult to level in vanilla then it is on retail) I would not be worried for MS warz to find raiding guilds.
---
I suggest you stick with the pservers instead of playing classic.  You sound like a neckbeard, since after 14 years you somehow still have so much time on your hands to learn the classes more throughly.  As such I suggest you stay as far away from the general public as possible.
---
hoard mats, play the casual playerbase to be your bank.
---
Impossible for them to gather the mats in question so they are forced to comply.
---
It's purpose is to knock crushes/crits off the attack table... not for the 18 damage it blocks.
---
50-75%? How is that sustainable at all when someone else can also be running a bot 24/7 to undercut the undercuts?
---
Dynamic respawns would have been the best option to maintain big, healthy server populations and staying true to vanilla wow without implementing an easy abusable system.
---
Can someone please explain what layering is? obviously I know what it is, I know everything. I just feel bad for those of us who don’t know what it is...
---
Bajs interested in Classic WoW FeelsOkayMan
---
Clearly a bug.
---
The problem is we don’t know the specifics of their intended functionality in the above case. Maybe they’ll allow people to keep relogging to exploit nodes. We can’t be sure it won’t be possible at launch because they haven’t explicitly addressed all these edge cases outside of fairly vague reassurances.
---
Yeah the lighting is really messed up overall. I think this is clearest on the character screens and login screen..  
---
One thing I really wish Blizzard would fix, but they will overlook it.
---
lmao people keep dropping the Devilsaur Mafia like they'll actually stand a chance on anything more than a private server with a niche crowd.
---
I dont know if you have been around for BFA release but KNOWN BETA ISSUES were not fixed by 8.0, in fact most of them were not fixed by 8.0.
---
"Its just the beta, it will be fixed by launch"
---
"Its just the first patch, it will be fixed next patch"
---
and it goes on and on. Blizzard is aware of a lot of things but that doesnt mean they give a shit.
---
Asmon plays a character on his streams.
---
Also "lack of humor" is pretty subjective.
---
&gt; watching him tank high level content
---
Yeah you're not going to be watching him tank much of anything since any dps with half a brain is gonna pull threat off his clicking/rending garbage tanking. Even with Salv.
---
no changes :(   :)
---
Its not outrage. Its concern, major difference. It's also impossible to tell what the effects and extent of layering will be, in a \*closed beta\*. And yes, the answer \*is\* to open up realm transfers, but thats a really shitty situation when you have a realm splitting up 2 months into the game, because Blizzard had a 12k cap at launch, and 50% of those people stayed, more than anticipated. Also, as much as people will call me elitist for even suggesting the idea, queues are a good way to manage this as well. If most servers are still rolling 6-8k overall 1-2 months in, perhaps having the server as an \[in queue\] status will deter extra people from starting new lives on that server.
---
I'm not trying to dog you or anything, but that response was really dramatic, when I'm just here to talk about and discuss the future of my favorite game, mate. And there are very real situations that Blizzard might not account for. They do have some undesirable failsafes for the \*contingency\* of high sub retention. But they're just that, failsafes, that have their own issues tied to them. I don't envy Blizzard either, because doing nothing means a likelihood of many dead realms, or 5hour queue times, and nobody wants either of those. But I think a happy medium between nothing and full-steam-ahead 1-60 layering is best for the game.
---
Sacrifice player experience? Wtf layering is a way to improve player experience, I don't wanna fight over the same fucking boar for weeks at release.
---
Why is he trying to charge in bstand when hes clearly in combat? :&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Yeah, because dynamic respawns CANNOT BE ABUSED. 
---

You weren’t on the stress test, were you?
---
What if I don't?
---
Hopefully they'll fix this.
---
Had a few situations yesterday on the stress test realm.
---
Weirdest situation was where i got invited by someone i didn't even see. I joined the group and got on the same layer so i saw him.
---
I asked how he invited me, because i didn't even see him.
---
He told me he was seeing my character.
---
We ended up playing together, but there were multiple situations where a whole camp we just cleared instantly respawned.
---
Oh, I'll be avoiding the arena. I don't want to get killed by my own alli buds, Im here to wipe my boots on some horde faces =D

Why is he toxic? The prompt literally asks you if you're sure that you want to destroy that specific item. That streamer is pretty brain dead if you ask me.
---
I was wondering the same, most of the things he lists are the CORE build of the kind of game WoW is currently, nothing against it, its just not for me.
---
So if he likes that, he should be happy or at least happy-ish with retail.
---
You always get the same rep, the only thing that's reduced is the XP.
---
Well said! Cheers!
---
Was just basing this on OP's comment:
---
&gt;each time I tried a private server it was a bit dead.
---
Yo, I can’t believe they a whole game based around the vanilla hearthstone mobs. Boulderfist Ogre, here I come!
---
Well thats simply not confirmed and you have absolutely bo evidence to support your claim.
---
Nostalgia, I’ve been playing WoW since early 2005 and have been raiding ever since(small break around WoD for college.) looking forward to raiding casual Friday/Saturday in classic and world PvP during my retail downtown after the current raid is on farm. Should replace a lot of my dota time for my downtime/casual game.
---
&gt;  staying true to vanilla wow 
---
Because having 500 people stand next to the same mob waiting for it to respawn instantly and tag it is "staying true to vanilla wow"
---
&gt; easy abusable system 
---
[Citation Needed]
---
i see what you like
---
They used to do max level beta geared toons for some betas, I've been thinking that if they want to test raida outside QA, they might just go that route.
---
&gt;  I was gen y long before people started using the term millenial
---
No shit, because it was a placeholder term before the word millennial came about.
---
Gen Y and millennials are same generation. There isn't anything to discuss - you are simply mistaken.
---
Also in my 30's, btw.
---
You're only going to be able to reserve 3 characters.
---
Oh damn, a bunch of 10s fighting level 17+? Sounds fucking funny.
---
We're all just waiting for the heat death of the Universe anyway.
---
The only difference is if you make it to the restaurant to watch or not.
---
I got wow1 and wow2 and i got no beta access.
---
Yea, they cannot if done right. A mage that pulls ahead of the leveling crowd because of Aoe-Farming will not be effected by dynamic respawns because he is ahead of everyone else. DYNAMIC respawns, not just faster respawns.
---
you beat me to it
---
Because instantly calling someone "retarded" because they made a mistake is toxic.
---
He assumed that it was a confirmation window to use the item, I assume he's new to the game and learned from it, everyone had similar moments like this, I used to think that you can't socket any new gems if you already had one socketed, does that mean I'm retarded? No.
---
HELL YEAH, LEVEL 10!!!
---
Now the WPvP will be even more fun.
---
&gt; The amount of warlocks on Classic will be very high
---
Speculation at best and with no contextual information other than everyone has a huge one for leveling speed.  Most people pick with their guts on the leveling experience then you see a massive drop off around 40s when they see if the class is actually what they wanted versus the leveling experience they wanted.
---
Couple of small things for me:
---
* Mining and herbing nodes being 1 use until respawn, sometimes farming was a chore if someone was on your route.
---
* Quest items in your limited inventory, nothing like a few troll nipples with a 10% drop rate stopping you picking up something useful/valuable
---
That's the test though. The actual beta is for leveling testing.
---
You can paint your walls faster with these bigger gnomes.
---
or shield block. or shield wall. or healthstone. or bandage. He also kept running into the bladestorm at the last tick and was continuously taking 250 dmg each time lol. They didn't even close the door behind themselves and pulled a mob because of it. They got carried by the healer
---
Name wise how is that different to layering?
---
I'm gonna roll a female dwarf priest so are you implying I'm into small chubby chicks? &gt;!actually, I'm...!&lt;
---
Would you rather be level 1 with zero exp for a week because you can't do any quests due to all the mobs being killed before you can even tag em?
---
Bajs invited to the Beta FeelsOkayMan
---
I can't speak for the closed beta servers, but on the stress test servers I noticed quite a lot of odd things happening in the ~12 hours I spent on it.
---
Most of it happened in the starting zones. I was buffing people and handing out bags/food/etc and quite literally I would change layers for no reason. I'd go from a layer with 50 people around me to just 2-3, completely randomly. I'd say it happened at least 10 times.
---
Another oddity was when I found a group for Rites of the Earthmother in Mulgore. Any time one of my party members stepped into Thunder Bluff then tried to come back out, he'd be on a different layer. I had to kick him and reinvite him to get him back on ours.
---
I dunno if any of that is intended behavior or the server rebalancing but it was definitely jarring and noticeable when it occured.
---
Not a bad idea, mate. Would help prevent some layer hopping for nodes.
---
ghostlands was THE place to get geared up.  Belfs came out of their secondary zone much better geared than anyone else in the horde back then.  Killing Dar'khan (i believe) had a sick 2h sword for my belf ret pally in BC days
---
No, 15.. If he left 15 years ago and it's 30 away, it's 15 left for the trip back.
---
Nothing fake about their reactions dude.
---
AOE loot
---
Are you kidding? I’m gonna stand on that roof showing off and being awed with the rest of the server m8. Genuine epics are coming back!
---
There have been a lot of screen shots of people talking with blizz cs saying this same line, but it's just frustrating b/c so many people on reddit and discord self report their accounts are from 2004 or EU 2005. Makes it hard to believe Blizz
---
wat
---
Yup. Them old school "we care about you so we fuck with you" vibes &lt;3

Only being able to group up ever 4 hours would be devastating for a social game like clasdic at launch

RemindMe! 96 days "look through this thread"
---
I think I’m going to vomit...
---
Again, nobody understands how layering works.
---
Layers are only created if the population of the initial layer is full. Layers are not sharding. They don’t just exist waiting for players. If the initial layer is full and you’re put into another one, it will have a population already.
---
This goes against EVERYTHING vanilla wow stands for, god damm
---
Region and Faction?
---
It wasn't a place holder. Its what my generation are called. Just because we're a really short generation doesn't mean you can lump us in with you millenials. You're probably only like 32 or something.
---
good meme, call the hypocrisy out
---
Maybe on paper, but you know full well that it doesn’t work like that in practice. Obviously some layers will have smaller populations than others. 
---
The point is you can check 5–6 layers for a rare spawn or w/e by just getting invited to them, and people won’t hesitate to abuse that in order to get an advantage.
---
You are seriously overthinking a meme.  
---
But now that we are at it, how long have you been with your girlfriend?
---
RemindMe! 6 hours
---
What about the horrible player experience that will last for weeks, maybe months without layering?

Layering will for as long as it in be a horrible user experience.
---
I'd prefer lag over layering ☹️
---
Also while it's fun to shit on Tips remember most streamers have this attitude. Many think they're PvP/PvE gods because they're semi decent around other streamers. It's like thinking you're good at a video game because you win against your friends in split screen and then getting stomped in online mode all over again.
---
yeah but he still needed to wait 30 years for him to come back
---
nein
---
Meanwhile being called "The Champion" in modern WoW feels like an insult or a downgrade.
---
Not only that, but at the beginning (of at least the alliance side) you still were enlisting in the army against the undead scourge just like everyone else. The only thing your hero status got you was to cut to the front of the line and people recognizing you for your fame.
---
Oh damn! I forgot about that! Totally!
---
Why do people want to no criticism of retail? I don't understand this. Does it HAVE to trigger you to hear negative things about retail? People are free to criticize whatever they want. You don't have to read it.
---
So we are back to unplayable servers at launch which die from lack of players in a few months...
---
It's from a video where a guy looted all the loot off garr and ventrilo went ballistic. 
---
"Fucking pally loot never drops, that fucking ninja took everything "
---
Long time ago memory sucks might be wrong.
---
You will *not* see “5-6” layers per continent. That would mean a population of 15k at least on a server. Blizzard has already said servers will have blizzlike caps.
---
Layers are filled once it reaches server cap, then a second layer is made.
---
I often seriously tell people that there are only 2 real challenges to vanilla wow: the time sink, and the management of 40+ people.
---
The actual fights are easy, it's the time and people management that's hard.
---
Opinions differ. As I said I can see people like his streams.
---
You're right. But I think if you talk to people everywhere there's a huge difference in "feeling" between the two, with people saying that stuff in classic seems more rewarding.
---
Why? Doesn't make sense does it? Well I think I might know why, and I'm going to make a stupid analogy to explain it:
---
When you accomplish stuff in retail it feels like....When you go to a faire or a shooting range and they give you that pre-standard gun and tell you to hit the BULLZEYE! It's hard, it requires a lot of practice and you do feel good after you achieve it! The faire man will even give you a cool prize! Its cool! It's a great day with your friends, you laugh and have a great time!
---
But it doesn't feel like an adventure, it's scripted and predetermined. There's no magic to it. Everything is carefully scripted for you. From your group, to the quest that leads you to the dungeon, to the dungeon itself.
---
In vanilla, it was a lot more rough around the edges. No where near as scripted or "polished" in that sense. And sometimes no where near as difficult. This particular thing was so exciting because of respawn times mostly. They had one shot or they were fucked and clunky aggro mechanics will make it difficult for dps to blow things up (along with hit rating etc).
---
So it feels like an adventure. Like you're doing something that you shouldn't! The game is telling you all the way you have NO place there! It screams at you that you shouldn't be there! You can't even hit things, get the fuck out!
---
So yeah.....That's why i think vanilla has more of that magic.
---
There have been polls, where warrior rogue and mage are top 3 picked class with warlock as a steady 4th. Asmongold Made one poll aswell and warlock ended 3rd before mage.
---
Warlocks are beast in lvling sure, but if lvling would be the main prio, we would see way more hunters and less rogues. As rogues are considered the worst lvling class due to warriors beeing able to hamstring kite.
---
Spoken like a true female NE hunter :D Alliance incels coming out of the woodwork to downvote on this one! Just kidding guys, though the reaction is actually making me think I'm onto something....
---
One stress test service with who knows what kind of cap. It is not indicative of how a live server will work.
---
Term so real it doesnt vene has wikipedia article lol
---
Perhaps this is not working because access to beta has only 2, maybe 3k players. At the same time on same server there is a lot less people. If that's what you hope for when it will go live and if that's what you expect to happen if it will go live, why even bother making Classic WoW in the first place?
---
It's unending as long as you recast it every 10 minutes.
---
Yeah, Cata revamp old world quests was when they started actually promoting you to ranks and calling you "savior of azeroth" and whatnot. 
---
I could never get behind Class Halls in Legion. It's like... okay, im the leader of my class... yet so is everybody else here? What now?!
---
Lol yeah if you think about it that's true Haha
---
Lol. Nice addition. Always good to see the jump-in from the random condescending guy who alludes vaguely to his keen ability to judge expertise. Yawn. If I need someone to be my financial assistant I’ll let you know.
---
Did they specifically put thrall there as an attraction to get as many people there as possible?
---
Classic is the real wow
---
For me Legion, after they fixed annoying stuff, was the best post Cata expansion. Hell even with the annoying stuff it was more fun than BfA. Story, artifact system, class order halls, raids. So much fun content, unlike BfA. Even legendaries were fun to play with after reducing that RNG aspect. In my opinion artifacts + legendaries + tier sets + netherlight crucible made so many classes really fun to play.
---
This is the reason why BfA is such a huge disappointment for me. It feels like a much worse version of Legion.
---
&gt; If the goal is to bring back classic as it was , they should avoid such a massive change to core game. We want to feel like we are in one big world without xrealm, sharding or layering
---
Yeah, let's put 3000 people into the starting zones with a Queue on top. Make it unplayable for the first week. And watch the realms die, as 2000 of those people leave the game after the first month or two. While everyone else has already picked their Place.
---
The true vanilla expirience.
---
Found the toxicity
---
Sweeeeet!
---
RemindMe! 95 Days
---
Hahah, realised I wasn't in a Clique either, wasn't even in the "British" clique.
---
Was the Main Tank of the guild would come on do my thing have my input here or there then logged in one day and had been made Guild Master so ended up as GM of a guild I didn't have any "friends" for almost 8 months untill Naxx crippled us as our players started to get poached.
---
&gt; is it worth playing some wow now
---
Unless you're referring to the beta or a pserver, no.
---
Don't forget various types of administrators. Probably them doing the reboots.
---
Maybe they shouldn't have made quests and leveling such a huge time gate on the content people wanted to do.
---
Probably close to 3 months (the expected lenght of a phase). Blizz said they aim to remove layers before phase 2.
---
I am happy-ish with retail, and for the life of me cannot understand why people can’t enjoy two different games. Why the hell does it have to be one or the other?
---
And for reference I hate the lack of leveling  and open world difficultly in BFA, absolutely hate the current class design, dislike the titanforging aspect, LFR difficultly etc.
---
Just another bullshit Blizzard lie, like the dance studio!
---
Won't really need that when you're fighting everyone else for mobs, but it's a good idea.
---
This is not true for classic.
---
Yeah, actually being able to quest and fight mobs sounds horrible.
---
Odd, I’ll have a look later I suppose but the numbers probably don’t mean much.
---
Because druids have a lot of utility already.
---
"addons will destroy vanilla" lmaooo :&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Say theres 3 open layers. Jimmy is in Layer 1, and whispers Emily whos in layer 2, for an invite. Bam. Jimmy just traversed layers. Then Jimmy wants in on that layer 3 action, so he whispers Billy. Bam. Layer 3 action. Rinse and repeat, just keep cycling through for respawns/re-nodes/escaping imminent PVP/looking for PVP to engage in.
---
Just saying, layering *can* work, but it needs lots of anti-abuse mechanisms.
---
you should not have any problem at all to get your hand on a pc that can handle classic for that amount.
---
Sure, are you gonna cry about it? Lmao
---
Or you're somewhere in the middle. Middling NPC's respect you, and you're their go to for a problem, but the masses and important lore characters dont know that you are that guy because you are one among many. You're powerful and accomplished, but not a celebrity or racial leader. NPCs can respect me without hamming it up. Anduin knowing my name, or quest npcs being respectful is recognising accomplishments, major lore characters screaming CHAMPION at me every time i go near them is ludicrous. Even if i was a lore hero, they would know my name, so there is no scenario where its not comically bad writing that just makes you cringe
---
One of the biggest differences with Vael is how the tank meta is so focused on threat now. In classic every decent guild will have a max threat specced warrior or a feral druid chaining pummelers tanking Vael, so the DPS should never need to hold back at all.
---
Gone are the days of telling your dps to wait for 10+ seconds or 3 sunders before attacking.
---
I actually think layering is probably worse than sharding (opinion). Since based on what I've read it's sharding for a whole map, instead of per zone. Here's where it can go wrong.
---
Say there's 500 players duking it out in WPvP in, let's say Hillsbrad. Maybe this is causing some performance problems, and so it wants to split some players to a new layer. But now a whole new instance of the EK continent has been made. Players can play the system to get into that layer, but in a now entirely empty zone and take advantage.
---
I think, what they need is a sharding system PER ZONE PER REALM but one which truly only kicks in when there's a large number of players in specifically that zone. Enough that if they split the population randomly, there will still be a decent amount of population and thus competition.
---
I feel like the root of the problem is, that Blizzard just doesn't operate servers with the concept of login server &lt;-&gt; Realm server &lt;-&gt; world server any more. Zone shards are like the old instance servers, and players from any realm can be assigned to a zone shard. I bet that they just don't have a world server concept any more. It will work better for a scalable cloud system. But, is absolutely not going to reproduce a classic experience.
---
So, the question is what system CAN they make that will work with the (presumably) cloud setup they have, but will reproduce a classic that we'd be used to.
---
My personal opinion is that they should do zone based sharding (yes evil to even say it) but with a FAR higher threshold than current retail. They should also limit it to the current realm (not other realm players).
---
Here's the problem. That will cost them more. The reason they use sharding shared between all realms in the same datacentre is that, it just makes sense. They would need far fewer server resources to maintain say 50 realms for which the population is evenly spread between shared zone shard servers spun up "on demand" as players move from zone to zone. Rather than each server, having world servers for which some might well often just be sitting idle.
---
I suppose my TL;DR point is, it's not quite so easy as demanding no changes here. Since the systems they use have moved on a long way over the years.
---
Yeah, meant Layers, as in german these two words (layers/levels) are the roughly the same.  my bad.
---
I think it was BC (could be vanilla) when this happened because I can't remember the exact location, but it was a dungeon near a Faction Neutral town in a desert like area, anyway, I was a Hunter and an item I could use for an upgrade came up so I hit need on it, the other guy who also needed it was so pissed I won the item my first time seeing it.  Good thing it was a random and not a guild member lol. I cant wait to run dngeons and raids and never find the items I need :D ah vanilla 
---
btw if anyone can remember the town, it had a fair amount of goblins in it with a circular cage in one part that was kind of like a fight pit.
---
I criticize retail myself. It just gets real old to see the kind of low thought meme level comparisons I've been seeing in general chat since about WotLK.
---
Sure, I can just not read it, that solves any toxicity problems. I'd rather be a part of a community that enjoys classic though, so I'll voice my criticism in the hopes some people understand it. You don't have to read it.
---
Haha, I didn't downvote you, but this sub is a mixed bag when it comes to comments. Seems like some people just downvote everything they see.
---
I started on a male orc rogue, and sometime near the end of BC I got over the fact that Belfs were Horde now and made a male/female paladin, shit I probably made 1 of every class I could. I ended up staying with the female belf paladin. The animations were too good, I liked the way armor and weapons looked on her.
---
I've never been like hard-rule, gotta play a female. It just tends to happen more often than not.
---
Because it would be overpowered to have all the utility of bear, cat and moonkin.
---
Everyone was a bad player at some point, no one starts out a god. It’s not in the vanilla spirit for an IO, if you want to weed out the new players then join a guild with that elitist mindset and play within your community. I can imagine IO has made it so elitists don’t need to be in a guild or social anymore which is a shame. 
---
IO will be a massive thorn in the side of Classic I imagine. I understand it’s use but it should stay in retail with all the other QoL changes/addons. 
---
TL;DR if you want to be elitist and avoid the bad/new players, join an elitist guild. Simple.
---
If the population doesn't dwindle like Blizz projects it will, we will have layering for all of Phase 1, which was the only limiter they've given in any degree of certainty. That can be 3 Months, which is really the entire 1-60 journey for alot of Vanilla fans.
---
Post saved!
---
Helping the devs test tech makes the time spent feel valuable no matter what you're actually doing in the world. Dying/fighting/exploring/running w/e activity you can think of might be measured in some way. And it's all in the spirit to make the end product as best it could possible be.
---
It's also a great way to connect with the players. Seeing Omar teleport Asmon up into the air, letting gravity kill him was hilarious. Seeing all manner of bosses spawned around the world was hilarious because we've not seen it since tests back in vanilla. Their messages about characters being deleted, just perfect. I didn't even get access and thought it was fun just witnessing it via reddit threads &amp; streams.
---
It's something players have yearned for - to connect with the devs who shape the game so many of us love.
---
I did, but apparently soda didn't
---
came here to say this
---
A layer is still supposed to be one vanilla servers worth of population, undead starting zone will be one of the most crowded places on launch :D
---
every guild had 'THAT' guy who was guaranteed to screw up on these "kill people around you" machanics. We just had 10 people yell his name to move the fuck outta the way, sometimes it worked too.
---
Probably deleted to mimic release.
---
Was waitin for this
---
Nice ultra
---
RemindMe! 96 days "Weather density"
---
You could have more realms divided into groups (like battlegroups), once/if pop diminish you merge realms in these groups with each other. Names of characters are shared between realms in these groups. This makes server costs higher than with layering and more work for blizz who instead opt for the cheaper and easier solution to their problem. Now instead we get pop split even if you pick the same realm and broken eco thanks to layering.
---
Yes the whole world getting layered is stupid in the first place. Your suggestion makes sense and they should at least try that in the beta. Redridge should be layered too and major cities .
---
Bwl was never a guild killer lol
---
Only stress test FeelsBadMan
---
But was so much fun even with level 5 cap. And they already announced the next stress test with level 10 cap PagChomp
---
Um I'm all for hating toxic players but wtf r you guys talking about. No 30 warrior beats a 30 rog... ever... bis lmao.
---
I wish classic becomes the main WoW game. I'd love that. Imagine having more players than retail? It's possible but unlikely. Yet I dream.
---
Sin’dorei Warblade and the Wanted ring were everyone’s dreams by level 20
---
I hope it’s a bug, I don’t mind the idea of layering but seeing people from other servers that I will likely never see again just removes the fun for me.
---
Please try to use your brain. Your name is Bob, some other guy's name is Bob. You merge the servers, who's gonna change his name? Or his guild's name? Layering is a necessary evil, period.
---
You do realize that the shard sizes are meant to be similar to vanilla server sizes meaning no difference in population what so ever compared to vanilla. The issue with layering is the possibility of abusing it to phase away from pvp combat or possibly reach more mobs or proffession nodes, not population sizes. The layering solution is not perfect, but stop brining up made up issues...
---
No, Blizzard said the LAYERS will have blizzlike caps.
---
Yeah, nah. I don't want my name to be changed. I'll take this over that, I'm afraid.
---
&gt;Because having 500 people stand next to the same mob waiting for it to respawn instantly and tag it is "staying true to vanilla wow"
---
But thats exactly why there are dynamic respawns, so you dont have to wait and competing for tags get minimalized. Staying true to vanilla wow means that a server is a server without the possibility to 'phase' or 'layer' out whenever you feel like there is too many people around you or not enough black Lotus spawns.
---

&gt;Why is it that nost did dynamic respawns and suddently it's an acceptable change for everyone.
---
Nost didnt do dynamic respawns at all IIRC but tried 'layering' as you said.
---
&gt; RemindMe! 95 days "/console WeatherDensity 3"
---
What about all those tanks that claim they tanked Nefarian by standing in the middle of the room and spamming BS to players and pets back on live? BS gives a flat amount of threat per target buffed, its not hard.
---
Dynamic respawns are based on server population and how fast mobs are killed after spawn. Aka when mage kills them all after spawn instantly they will respawn by the time mage has mana to do it again.
---
Looking forward mostly to roleplaying in the old zones, like even Hillsbrad Town hall will get attention, Southshore will be a good hub, Stromgarde, and parts of old Lordaeron.
---
Will be great times and I think many role players missed out on vanilla myself included, and we end up going to old zones that have mostly been changed, and wishing they didn’t.
---
Good times to come for sure.
---
omg why did I not think of that
---
People used it to tank Nefarian P1 back then.
---
I'm progressing on mythic Jaina, and I'm also a huge vanilla fanboy but the myth that vanilla raid are harder is just ridiculous lol
---
Well I know it’s a different game. But more people play RuneScape classic than runescape last time I checked.
---
But then friends won't be able to play together. People won't be able to trade and so on.
---
&gt; Oldschool wow had dead servers and nobody cared.
---
Complete bullshit.
---
&gt; Not if ~~we~~ Blizz dont ~~complain alot and loud~~ get ~~enough~~ less money, trust me. 
---
fixed that xD
---
Saw this and checked my e-mails - I got so hyped when an e-mail from blizz popped up...
---
Jebaited by the Overwatch free week T_T
---
btw someone knows the name of the addon doing a circle with life and mana bar ?
---

---
Ishnu alah weary traveler.
---
What does "arcade" mean in this context?
---
&gt;It wouldn't have really made sense for Blood Elves to join the Alliance. In WC3 they just got fucked by the humans, and they fucked over the night elves by freeing Illidan. 
---
And in WC2, the orcs burned down Quel'Thalas. WC3, the Undead almost annihilated the elven species. And they have been in a permanent state of war against Trolls for thousands of years.
---
"But those were different orcs/undead/trolls!"
---
Yeah, so were the humans under Garithos.
---
Blood elves being neutral with loose ties to Undercity (only because of Sylvanas) would have made actual sense.
---
And the game has to be on 4 CDs, not a DVD.
---
Could you actually download the client back then? I don't remember.
---
The slippery slope is a logical fallacy. Why are you proud of being a retard?
---
I mean, the highest competition on mobs will be at launch, when people will compete on the same questing mobs. Later on this will heavily (and naturally) decrease. Thing is, there are ppl raging now too and will always be - it's just a matter of what kind of story you want to look at. That we see a lot of positive experiences shared on reddit/elsewhere it's ok (and it's really great), but they're not the 100% of the experience - negative stories just don't gain traction (or upvotes) these days -- later on we might have zero positive stories to be shared on reddit on one specific day and that's the exact moment where negative experiences will surface. Plus, it's all fun and exciting at the beginning, once the time passes it will naturally die down.
---
Whats a the URL lol?
---
Layering prevents unplayable zones and dying realms. But let's turn it off, because it might result in more herbs &amp; ores in the first 2 Months.
---
Those pesky retail players are ruining our game!
---
Honestly, I was just telling my friend about how asmon and esfand were discussing this idea of putting bounties on people which could be cool.
---
But then it immediately devolved into "WhO iS BesT NinJa LoOtEr" 
---
So disgusting.
---
Definitely  agree on raid sizes. My best raid memories are in 10 mans like Kara. Everyone gets to communicate and have a bigger impact. I'm still looking forward to the epic feel of 40 man raids though.
---
&gt;  I guess before that I was just spamming buttons, so got ashamed and right after I really started to learn and understand rotations including my class in raids, builds etc.
---
What rotation? Its just SS or BS, how did you ever manage to fuck that up?
---
I'm gonna admit it, I don't like blizzard, but I prefer them over you #nochanges nostalgia twats. You are literally advocating for dead servers over disappearing veins, which are supposed to be bugs anyway.
---
What classes will you do next? Rogue would be awesome. Good stuff!
---
You have got to experience the bad times to really appreciate the good times. This is directly correlated to life experiences as well.
---
At this point I am about to start hiding all the posts with the words toxicity and streamer in the titles. 
---
It’s getting really annoying.
---
I’ve got an i9 @ 4.9ghz and a 2080ti and was only getting 30fps on max setting in the city, there were a lot of people on screen though 1k+? Everywhere else the FPS was fine. I think an older rig may still struggle to run when a lot of things are going on.
---
Comes down to trust and nothing else. It's on you if you don't trust them.
---
To get a soul shard does the enemy you kill have to be near your level or can you get drain any level mob?
---
Hardiness usless if you're not melee? Lmao
---
Yea why not just open “two new servers “ that will be dead after the initial hype and people stop playing for whatever reasons .
---
He was very rage starved since a lot of his attacks missed and thus needed basically all of it just to keep aggro
---
... Are you in the beta? Because I received the full 250 rep (with 62.5 cascade) for other factions’ starting zones as a level 30.
---
Hi, /u/AuerX
---
Do they become better just because of their new gear from those raids?
---
He did address why he didn't use shield block - it was blocking 18 damage. The rage was better spent elsewhere. What he didn't know was that forcing a block made it impossible for the mobs to crit and do crushing blows.
---
&gt;Everything cata onwards
---
Everything started going to shit near the end of wotlk. 
---
I’d say about 3.2 onwards, the game went to shit.
---
ICC was a great raid though,  I think after that’s when I started to loose interest. 
---
What I really started to miss about wow was:
---
Lack of interesting items. Everything was just perfectly neatly itemised. You had your set of shit you’d go out and get like a shopping list from LFR.
---
Stats stopped meaning anything, mostly on gear.
---
Number inflation. Especially when we got up to the point where we started hitting like 60ks and saying “is that good? I dunno” .
---
When they scrapped separate loot tables for 10 and 25 mans, started taking the same item and started giving it different versions of heroic or whatever. 
---
I was looking at some Vanilla loot the other day. What ever happened to “equip: increases chance to hit by 1%” see that’s something I can get more excited about than “equip +4372 haste and +423 intellect” because I have no idea wtf those stats do.
---
I remember that feeling when you've worked your ass off to get through a dungeon only to wipe on one of the final bosses and find that the trash is respawning. The worst was probably Blackrock Spire.  That's why it was always preferred to have a warlock in the party to soul stone one of the rezzing classes. Then if you wiped on General Drakkisath, people were told not to release.
---
I remember once wiping in the arena, using the soul stone rez. The tension as we worked toward Drakkisath was palpable because the cooldown on the soul stone hadn't reset and if we wiped on anything again, the run was basically over because nobody wanted to work through the trash again.
---
It's not jaded, Blizzard has very recently been moving the goal posts on sharding. First it was only in the start zones for the first few days, then it was the entire world for a couple weeks, now it's all of Phase 1.
---
Imagine *not* expecting them to say "hey our current shitty networking technology still can't handle more than 4k people playing seamlessly so we'll have to extend layering into Phase 2." 
---
If they're willing to sacrifice the leveling experience, early game world pvp, and the early economy then a couple of world raids don't seem like a gigantic leap for them to take.
---
Cant skin it if you dont loot it
---
No, you get that CC resistance that also works on bosses, and I think orc have bonus damage on their pets so its not useless for warlocks/hunters either.
---
and I am not sure if the attack power racial works for ranged in vanilla, but does for sure in TBC which makes trolls obsolete.
---
&gt; But thats exactly why there are dynamic respawns, so you dont have to wait and competing for tags get minimalized. 
---
See, that's the thing, when there's so many players it ends up with people literally standing sorrounding instantly spawning mobs and battling for tags as seen here

Sick samplesize man, 1/2 and that's the one taht was clipped.. can you find me a video of someone doing it with anything near consistency?
---
&gt; Nost didnt do dynamic respawns at all IIRC but tried 'layering' as you said.
---
Nost had dynamic respawns, not from the very get go, but within the first week
---
I like the game so much better without transmog. The fact that you literally cant distinguish if someone is a fresh 120 or a full bis decked out raider by looking at them really takes something away from the game for me. In a lot of cases you cant even tell if someone is max level or level 65 without having to actually check.
---
They've said layering is only meant to be active for the first phase and possibly first 3-4 weeks so don't get your hopes up of exploiting it end game for too long. Tidal Charm, pets etc are good ideas, end game gathering stuff you'll probably only get like a week or two to farm and there will still be others with the same idea competing with you.
---
I think one of the reason is that game is playing on client 7.1 (Legion). You can change your graphic options into enchance mode or something, Which increases the textures little bit and lighting in the game.
---
You could still go to an inn or group with people on your layer though.
---
not a fan of getting reset to 0 every time by some super faction thank you
---
Day one and 2 in our guild no one said anything but 2004. We have some retail players now
---
If I recall correctly the enemy needs to give you xp to be eligible.
---
Vael is just standing still and doing a rotation without overaggroing. It's not even a tight DPS check.
---
So each layer is then aprox 8k players. Interesting info, i like it.
---
Everyone was crying about that though
---
RemindeMe! 96 days

It happens the same if one layered server still have huge pop when the layering should be gone. And it happens the same if one layered server happens to be full of tourists and left blank.
---
M+ is endgame content, leveling dungeons are leveling content. Are you daft?
---
I wanted to upvote to make this more visible, but was kinda sad that I was the one resulting in the post not being at 666 upvotes... sorry
---
Has to be near your level. Pretty sure the exact terminology is "Yield experience or honor", as far as the kill is concerned. The target also needs to die from the damage of your Soul Drain spell, which can be tricky.
---
[https://ninjalooter.net/](https://ninjalooter.net/)
---
Shouldn't males do more aa damage anyway
---
I tried to explain to people how layering will multiply the resources available.
---
No one understood and downvoted me. Imagine this same thing with Rich Thorium Veins, Devilsaurs and Tubers / Herbs.
---
Play on the biggest server with the most layers. Speedlevel your character, get max herbalism and clean out Burning Steppes. Cycle through the layers by getting invited to group by different people. Repeat the route around Burning Steppes.
---
Easy stacks of black lotus by the time layering is taken out.
---
The entire point of sharding and layering is to duplicate resources. They can't simultaneously implement a form of sharding and remove these repercussions of sharding at the same time.
---
That's cool man, you do you. Female character models and animations are pretty good. I'm just out here having fun.
---
And Thursday is a national holiday in The Netherlands. Ascension day, so yay me :D
---
No it shouldn't. Attack power is physical damage whereas wand is spell schools. I donno how it worked back in the day but I just highly doubt it.
---
No evidence, just experience and common sense ;)
---
Blizzard is now introducing realistic traits! Male's will hit harder, but females will heal for more!
---
How is a mage supposed to do that on a populated server while everyone is leveling? Only if they pull ahead of everyone else and as I said above, properly working dynamic respawns then shouldnt effect him anymore. How they did it on LH was very scuffed, the devs even admitted so themselves.
---
The only WoW is Classic WoW ;)
---
Won’t lie, he’s got moves
---
The stress test is a 26 hour event. Their wording on its confusing because they talk about a monitoring window between 4-6pdt Wed and thur. The server was up 4pm Wednesday to 6:15pm PDT Thursday.

Wholesome strategy Guide ❤️
---
I personally despised the legendaries: 
---
“Hey look! You’re super special, have this super special weapon, just like everyone else who’s also super special.”
---
Ps : “this weapon is so special, you never need to worry about receiving weapon loot upgrade either. Enjoy your best in slot weapon, it’s effectively one less thing for you to worry about”.
---
I mean what’s more badass:
---
As a paladin to go and find the corrupted ashbringer from the four hourseman. Or that big ass soul blade thing from bwl that everyone rushed to get a transmog of, 
---
Or just to ding max level rock up to your train and he given a short quest for a bis weapon that you and everyone else who is your class will now be using?
---
I get why they did it, but it just wasn’t....
---
Fun in my opinion. 
---
If they really wanted to do something cool like that, they should have done it on another item slot such as relics or trinkets, something that wasn’t quite as obtrusive or necessary but still gave a little customisation.
---
I do sympathize with that, I even feel the same way sometimes. But while you are looking at scenario of some character that is low geared, with low progression into the game character but still looks like a champion (without merit). I am looking at the opposite scenario, a guy far into progression, currently raiding the highest demanding content but by unlucky circumstances their best in slot items don't match that well and he looks average and sometimes it even looks like a clown.
---
lol, they gave gear to people who performed worse? If anything it should be the other way around.
---
Truth.
---
It has to be dual specc as everyone else says. Or atleast the possibility of respeccing without it costing a fortune. Playing a healer or a tank can be a real pain and if you want to both pve and pvp it really sucks not having it aswell.
---
Also not too much a fan of 40 man raids, you are just kind of forced to bring a lot of deadweight and people who dont really work at the char.
---
I for sure WONT be missing transmog tho, as cool as it is looking the way you want, I really think it was damn awesome in classic that you could see what gear people had, and getting a new great item really showed.
---
Above the play button in the app a new drop down bar will apear.
---
he relogged and changed layers. They have to make the layers much less dynamic and more "sticky" if this is to remotely work
---
Did you also have a mom who was like "Computer bad. It glows so it must be full of satan."
---
Not a fan of real money bounties, would rather have them be gold.
---
why no one tried monk ? :(
---
No they don't. They deserve it if it drops.
---
I’m wouldn’t mind some advise either.  
---
Also keen to play warlock but am also unsure.  I like it all.  DoTs, pets and nukes.   But I’m guessing I’ll need to compromise somehow and focus on something.
---
are those numbers consistent every single time or fluctuate? could be just a simple delay in the combat log. Auto shot "cast" doesn't get reduced by haste btw, only the "cooldown" gets reduced by haste. For example a 2.5 speed bow with 10% quiver would give you a total speed of 2.27 seconds. You would have a 0.5 sec cast, then a 1.77 cooldown period between that you can cast other stuff and move as well. I'm really interested to see more about this though. I've made a list of hunter bugs that you can see just below in this subreddit
---
Of course they can. Blizz can ban you pretty much any reason they want to, it's their IP.
---
If you don't want it to be short lived, play the game at your own pase and don't care if someone hits 60 when you're lvl 15.
---
Sombody got full T3, and you're in T1 only? Don't care. If you though, wanna do rush it all then that's okay too, cause you're playing at your own pase.
---
Hf.
---
Oh and also no frankenWoW, thanks!
---
Anyone who doesn't like layering is welcome to come to the pserver and suffer attempting to complete basic quests because 15 people are all trying to do the same quests in the exact same area
---
People who complain about sharding clearly haven't played a day one vanilla server. Blizzard are putting in the best solution possible to the problem, it's not perfect but it's the best alternative we have.
---
Man it would really be sick if they released a bunch of content post naxx, I really hope they add like tonne more zones and raids. I am really *BURNING* for that.
---
I think it's supposed to be a Savannah. In which case tall, very dry grass makes sense
---
1. Their aesthetics don't fit into the Horde.
---
2. Their culture doesn't fit into the Horde.
---
2. They're an almost extinct species, but the player population on almost all realms went towards 50% blood elves on the Horde side.
---
3. They had been at war with 3 of the 4 other Horde races and should harbor at least as much resentment towards them as towards the Alliance.
---
5. They adopt the faith of the Light towards the end of BC, which makes them fit even less into the Horde.
---
Enh until 40, then Ele is viable
---
2h rockbiter or 1h fast flametounge, both viable. I prefer 2h so i can earthbind kite.
---
LS and ST are your most efficient abilities, use them a lot, keep 5s rule in mind as mana is tight.
---
Look around you
---
They actually tried multiple times to go back to older mechanics.   
---
Remember them trying to remove flying?   
---
Remember them trying to make leveling more meaningful?   
---
Remember them trying to bring back class buffs?   
---
All of that stuff was received negative by the playerbase. You have to consider that most people that are playing retail dont want a classical mmo, they want an arpg. Otherwise they wouldnt play WOW.   
---
Retail is a lost cause not because Blizzard is unable to stir the ship, but because the playerbase likes the current course. Maybe classic could lead to a design shift. I highly doubt it though.
---
I don’t want it.  But I also can’t wait to play and want to play day 1.   So I’m probably ok with it for a week or two until population spreads out a bit.  
---
I can’t imagine how annoying it will be if starting zones are laggy and overcrowded.
---
You can do something like 7/21/23
---
WIth improved life tap in affliction, demonic sacrifice in demo and Ruin in destro
---
Love this man’s perspective. Always thoughtful and measured with something interesting to say.
---
This comment is so good. I can't even tell if it's trolling or serious. That's awesome m8
---
In release you would just get an invite from a guild member in a different layer. Said guild member would be in a different in-game guild (subguild) that is locked to different layer than your subguild. 
---
This is possible because guilds stay in same layer and people in a party have to be phased to the same layer.
---
They are up in arms you dumbass. That's why people test this in beta and point it out.
---
... who then, 14 years later, is extremely addicted to her tablet and facebook lol
---
Interesting! I didn‘t know the zone but: how did they find a way trough the invisible wall? Is there a way as a level 1-5 character in classic to jump through?
---
There are no dots, only shadowbolt.
---
and forlvling you put up like corruption, siphon life and then just wand or spam drain life
---
Which means that the server will have blizzlike caps. Anything over the cap *WHILE* layering is implemented will be create a new layer.
---
You’re saying the same thing.
---
All right, we will look into it if that would become an option.
---
&gt;The target also needs to die from the damage of your Soul Drain spell, which can be tricky
---
Nope, that's for Imp. Drain Soul mana regen to proc. You get a shard regardless.
---
I had a nasty habit of not paying attention and getting eaten by Knuckle and Luz lol
---
Yeah I’m sure the stress test was more fun than anything you did in 10 years in the game. What did you do? Run around a starting zone as a level 5. Stop with this shit
---
It is impossible to know how many will keep playing after the initial 1-2 months of release has passed. I played in vanilla and I have played on many private servers aswell and I can tell you this: Nothing is more depressing than a dead server. The goal of layering is to handle a potential drop in populations due to retail tourists returning to Bfa. I dont like the idea of Shardning or laying either, but I dislike the idea of 50 half-dead servers even more. It is better than to have 10 PACKED servers with layering that will still have a sustainable population even after the initial rush dies down.
---
It is a needed compromise.
---
This statement just drips of entitlement.
---
Could just change that to be based on zone/area population
---
I think it was changed in patch 1.10
---
Fire Warlock one shot macro:
---
/equip Firestone
---
/cast Immolate
---
/cast Fear
---
/cast Soulfire
---
/cast Conflagrate
---
If you Crit they die basically.
---
Yeah, I'm not a fan of the current layering, where you get dropped into a random layer and get swapped around all over the place. At least you should be put permanently in a layer/group to avoid manipulation and get a sense of community. If this is the case you should be able to know where you play and choose which group your in to play with your friends.
---
Schololol
---
Low effort memes arn’t criticism of retail.
---
I play both.  Classic excites me more but retail is better than Tetris.   
---
It’s your time.  If you don’t mind playing some retail before falling in love with classic, that’s up to you.  Nobody here will mind.
---
Welcome home, friend
---
If I remember correctly Blizz hinted that what was once called server now the closest thing to it is called shard. And what was before called server name is now simply not much more than "character tag". In other words, from tech pow the thing known as server is completely gone.
---
If you're so worried about blizzard lieing all the time, just go play a private server because you will never ever find peace playing a blizzard game again.
---
Mine's more of a religious nut now. I still sometimes get scolded for gaming, since "it is below you to spend your time like this, there are much more noble ways to spend time". Imagine getting this as a grown adult.
---
What is dead may never die.
---
yeah... but THAT is something completely different! She doesn't \*waste\* time, she \*invests\*...
---
RemindMe! 96 days "wow"
---
&gt;See, that's the thing, when there's so many players it ends up with people literally standing sorrounding instantly spawning mobs and battling for tags as seen here
---
Yes, that would be the case for the 1-5 zones on launch day only. Still the way better alternative to ~~sharding~~ layering in game for god knows how long. See
---
&gt;Staying true to vanilla wow means that a server is a server without the possibility to 'phase' or 'layer' out whenever you feel like there is too many people around you or not enough black Lotus spawns.
---
for why.
---
&gt;Sick samplesize man, 1/2 and that's the one taht was clipped.. can you find me a video of someone doing it with anything near consistency?
---
I'm not going through all the clips from streamers with classic access from the stress test, but rest assured that there was alot especially from tipsoutbabys channel too, he tested abusing the same shit but with group invites instead of logging out to easily get into a new layer.
---
See, I know we're not getting dynamic respawns and layering will sadly be in the game no matter how much I complain on reddit. All we can and should do is increase the pressure on Blizzard to fix the stuff that goes wrong and keep the time that it is in game to the absolute minimum. Otherwise its not going to happen.
---
You mean Esfand and company, Esfand was the one streaming
---
Gangsta rap made me do it
---
xrealm bgs were a thing in 1.12 so i have no problem with it.
---
siiiiiiiiiip.
---
I have nothing to add , I juat wanted to drink.
---
Upvote then fool!
---
Boring, repetitive gameplay. Just like games in arcades, like space invader for example. All it is is shooting ships coming down towards you until you die.
---
Very similar to retail wow.
---
The chest had +12 stamina and an on use ability that produced a shield last 30 seconds or 4K damage. 
---
It was possible to obtain two, just for the plus 12 stamina.
---
The best way to obtain it, besides paying for a boost, was to set your alarm clock irl for 3am/6am during the working week, log on and immediately loot the chest then hope no one else had the same idea. Yeah it could take a couple of weeks or months.
---
“10min breath” just isn’t a sexy name for a spell.
---
If population spreads more out layering will be reduced right (less layers which are full)? So what is the reason you don't want it then?
---
no need to worry with classic as you will have neither xD
---
That's because all accounts that are not starter edition contain legion if you have an active sub. And have not purchased bfa
---
I wouldn’t worry too much about missing out of beta access. Everyone will burn out of classic at some point, it just means you burn out a little sooner. There will be events in classic, heck they could be doing these stress tests to see if they can raise the server caps after launch (because you wouldn’t want a stupidly high number of people in the starting zone anyway).
---
This makes me want to play classic and watch LOTR shame i have to wait for Classic!
---
Nice. Thanks for clarifying that. It's been such a long time; I honestly couldn't remember if this was the case or not.
---
"Best warrior on NA" gets absolutely rekt. What utter trash. I mean, I respect him for what he does for the classic community. But don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk. Embarrassing.
---
Would be a nice concept in a full loot pvp game.
---
Let's say I'm a $100 ninja looter, I get killed. Big time. I just have to res sickness heartstone. Meanwhile I still have the item I stole.  
---
But it's a fun idea!
---
Well they were pinched between new mobs and respawn in the big gated corridors , if they died they would surely need to redo all before reaching herod again
---
Yeah as far as I know they got their own client, so it shouldn't affect us
---
In terms of OP, totems will cover stuns most of the time.
---
I think the stress test proved we would need it outside the starting zones as well.
---
I don't know how every thread like this goes from 'Wow that rogue is pretty good' to 'oMg StEamEr sOOoooO bAhd, lEl W0rsT wArRioR NA'
---
Seriously, just quit trashing people. He lost a fucking duel, get over it.
---
Fair. Its not unlikely, and I guess i do understand your frustration at that point.  But I'll still contend that its not a big enough issue/injustice to complain about (not saying that you specifically are complaining, just the population in general).
---
That's the hard limit, if server populations decline to normal numbers the layers will automatically merge down to one/multiple layers won't ever be created.
---
That's how I understood it at least.
---
Than concussive blow? You lose rage generation, you lose rage maintain... tact mastery and anger management are so good they out weigh any prot talents for pvp.
---
What does this have to do with layering?
---
You want the real Vanilla experience? Play on a CRT monitor. Haha
---
It's clear you don't know what layering is by this comment.
---
Horse. Earlier. Cheaper. Running sucks - especially because I did it for years back at launch.
---
Okay then you are blatantly wrong? Not sure what you expected here, you can find that this is wrong very easily
---
Not worth playing retail. Do not play Battle for Azeroth. The only things that is still World of Warcraft is the name. Everything else about the game is... something else.
---
I see me!
---
&gt; rereleasing TBC is the much easier route.
---
Here's a thought- would Blizz take this chance to *leave flying out?* I'm trying to think of content that would be *impossible* without it, and off the top of my head I'm only coming up with two things-
---
- Druid epic flight form quest required you to get on top of mushrooms in Zangarmarsh...but with no flying the quest wouldn't need to exist so this doesn't really count.
---
- The Oculus? People on my server used to just abandon it anyway if it popped as the random heroic...
---
- Netherstorm would be problematic
---
Anything I'm missing?
---
Have you played a lot of MMOs? If not, don't go down this hole.
---
WoW is one of the most no-life games there is.
---
Sharding places you with people from other servers though
---
Layering doesn’t, if I heard this right?
---
I mean, that’s a pretty big difference if you ask me. But yea, hopefully layering won’t last more then a week and never come back.
---
They never moved the goalposts because they never promised anything of the sort.
---
They said they would *like* to have it only in the starting zones at launch, but it was never a promise and it was never set in stone.
---
That was only Scholo, Strat and BRD that got changed to 5 players then. The rest of them still have the cap of 10 that was set in patch 1.3.
---
entitlement is the right word. Its sad, and its what this entire thread is about.  Its pervasive in not just reddit/r/classwow culture, but culture of western society all together.
---
You expect soda to be humble? He's trash and somehow thinks he's good. He said on stream the other day that if you hate streamers you are just jealous of them.
---
you're arguing with a blizz drone, they have room temperature IQ.
---

That was the point of the stress test. See what works and what doesnt.
---
What bosses stuns are you resisting in vanilla?
---
I had this theme, along with a metric ton of malware and viruses!  how innocent I was, i feel this screenshot is missing LimeWire!
---
Lotta people don’t know T is the default auto attack button
---
u/d0nt-worry-be-happy great post, you should do a v2.0 post for the Twin Emps in AQ40. I think that was Vael v2.0 in terms of difficulty jump and requirements of coordination, it really tested casuals who didnt understand the mechanics.
---
I was in a massive Alliance (Number of guilds who banded together to raid, Australian based on NA servers), and we had so many people that people - like me - had to wait in a queue to get into raid. BWL was one of those when almost everyone showed up because it was the most lucrative thing in the game, each raid member would get hundreds of gold per run so it had really high attendance even when we were doing AQ40, when suddenly spots would open up for me as people didn't want to do progress fights. You captured many of my experiences in raiding vanilla, the chat channels and role cliques, class/talent arguments etc. but I think that is also what made raiding then so special at the same time.

probably not unless you reclaimed it from someone else using it and they opted into beta access on the blizz website already
---
I couldn't even get into the stress test at first so can't comment there, but tried again 16 hours later and what I got was perfect. Orc starting zone with enough people that fights over mobs and kill groups were still a thing, but it was still totally playable. Didn't see a single person vanish to a new layer. If that's layering in action, I'm sold. Still don't want it for more than a few weeks but for now I trust we won't.

monkeynews walked straight into the twilight zone.
---
No, a server consists of multiple layers( at least in the start). If a server has 3 layers that each have blizzlike populations(2.5-3k) then the server in total has 3x that.

I'm trying really, really, really hard to care about *your* opinion on what is best for *Blizzard*. I just can't do it. Sorry.

Until lvl 10 you dont get resurrections sickness.
---
Apart from guild banks, nothing.
---
Fears mostly, which a lot of encounters have.Or random stuns like the mr Smite in deadmines.
---
I am sure there are a lot more, but its the best racial utility in the game.
---
&gt;The reason they went horde was because the Alliance decided to be dicks to them while Sylvanas decided to help.
---
The probably weakest storyline in the entirety of Warcraft. Them "being dicks" to the blood elves was an envoy sent to secretly observe the results of an arcane sanctum blowing up.
---
I'm surprised anyone was allowed to reserve the name SERVER
---
I will miss not having layering as in actual Vanilla WoW. :(
---
It's more a reputation thing, if people see your name come up on that site as a ninja looter people might put you on ignore or spread the word etc. 
---
Get a bad rep in the community and you will find it hard to get groups for anything.

The first 10 hours, I was able to kill 3 Young Nightsabers. It wasn’t until the last few hours, when most players moved to major hubs, that I was able to complete the first Teldrassil starting zone quest. 
---
The Human starting zone was a little better.
---
Yea it is gett8ng ridiculos
---
Please, can you stop telling people to think for themselves? This is reddit.
---
They say mid is lvl42.
---
Layering could and probably will kill the classic.
---
Layering is just sharding from modern wow. They can enable minimum shard size, cross realm anytime they want in classic. Shards/layers cant handle more than 100 people without lags and 200 people without disconnects in one location.
---
I remember when I was a kid in late TBC, my sister wanted to play an "explorer class". I told her that's stupid and there is no explorer class. But she just went around uncovering parts of the map and gaining xp along the way, killing mobs for xp as she went.
---
Looking back I was the fool for thinking there was a "correct" way to play.
---
&gt; it's just a betaaa
---
&gt; it just releeeeased
---
&gt; it's only phase oooone
---
&gt; it's just phase twooo
---
&gt; why are you all leaving for new accurate pservers? don't leave me alooooone
---
Thanks for all the great posts (and one really dopey one). This gives much to think on and gl to all in classic.
---
Never. I honestly don't follow any WoW Classic streamers because I really believe they're pretty much all trash and the embodiment of the toxicity within the WoW community.
---
Scratch that, I actually think wowcrendor is a decent person, but I still don't watch him stream.
---
Yeah, the effect is unending, as long as you have the buff. Just like you get +x stat from all sorts of buffs. It lasts forever, as long as you have the buff.
---
the only problem i see with laying is farming professions at endgame. being able to get the same ore/herb 2-4 times in a row.
---
then you just step outside with a group and kill level 4-5 mobs instead.
---
Imagine using your brain and not having the game tell you what to do.
---
They don't solve the server stability issues though.
---
And I also THINK a layer only has people from your realm anyway. You won't be seeing people from different realms in the same layer. Which also helps keeping the sense of realm community a but more solid I guess.
---
I thought walljumping was long gone?
---
What are you talking about? Layering will be over the entire realm, not just certain zones.
---
Can swim there.

RemindMe! 96 days " do this"
---
totem auras are only group wide
---
That is a restriction on playing with friends. What if you join a friend, then after a bit you want to do a dungeon, so you might join some other friends, or maybe some friends of your friend. You can't join them. They might also have CD on their "layer jump". Or what if a friend logs off after you played for 20 minutes (maybe he already played 2 hours before you came online), then you can't join new friends for 40 minutes.
---
There are many scenarios like this where it would be really annoying. Remember not everyone can no life 10 hours a day. Sure, if you play a lot then it might not seem like a big deal, but many people can only play an hour or two a day, so then it becomes quite a big deal to wait maybe half the time you have for WoW just to be able to play with friends.
---
The solution could be something like 10 minutes or something really low where you can hardly come into problems with the social aspect, but then it would still mean you are able to farm some rare mats waaaay better than you should. Remember there are only a certain amount of layers, so no cooldown on layer jump or a small cooldown is kind of the same result - essentially as long as you can get through all the layers before the first one you visited respawns the mat, then it is the same result. For example take Black Lotus, it has a respawn timer of around 1 hour or so (don't take me up on that). If there are 3 layers, then a 20 minute cooldown on layer jump would not actually do anything, because you can still cycle through all the layers and get back to the first layer just in time for the respawn.
---
I do believe just a short CD like 5-10 minutes would be great simply because it might discourage a lot of people from abusing it for small things like easy to obtain mats (like copper ore). But it would not really solve the big problem, which is abusing the system to farm rare materials unless you have a long cooldown, which goes back to my first point of ruining the social aspect of the game.
---
What about a magic carpet ride from Stormwind to STV where you fight flying teapots on the way and solve crosswords using missiles while listening to a robot monkey reading Shakespeare?

Stop.

So switching for disarm, also losing I think 32 rage is pretty fucking drastic. Imagine having a talent that said gain 30 rage in a 1v1 duel. That would be required for every warrior.......
---
Secondly, with good movement you can't be 5-8 kited like a toy. The better player will always take advantage of 5-8 kiting. Since the weaker player lets himself get caught in it.
---
And saying this talent is so good it just did nothing cause he missed. Tact mastery would garuanteed around 30 rage this fight, concussive blow gave him nothing...
---
He should have concussed on the intercept so that there would be no dodge chance. Having probably around 70/80% chance to avoid concussion blow makes it a very meaningless talent.
---
Also having demo shout miss doesn't mean you stop demo shout... it does if you are rage starved cause you don't know how to spec

What really? If that's the case then that's awesome! Too much private server I'm afraid xD
---
May not be 100% true if there’s log in issues due to the vast amount of people trying to play classic lol. Some may just go back to BFA for a few days. I sure hope not though
---
The stun is scripted, not an ability. You cannot resist a scripted event in a dungeon.
---
No I'm not unfortunately, I assumed it was like this because according to prior knowledge and multiple forums it does give deminishing returns if your more than 5 levels above the quest level. I could be wrong however
---
Wonder if I can get zygor guides running?
---
Because Asmongold takes the same amount of damage like the level 60 in the video, but is crushed/critted all the time because of the Level difference. and a crush does 1.5x the damage of a normal hit and a crit does 2x the damage. And i was 20 back then, and good enough to kill 13/15 in Naxx as MT, probably still shit compared to today, but i'd say good enough to see the huge difference to back then.
---
mabe the  dungeons damage is corrent compared to 1.12 and the dungeons then were completely nerfed, also the last char i leveld was a mage before AQ release so i never seen this dungeon in 1.12 on the right level. But if this is the case, then i am clearly against a 1.12 version and wish they use an earlier one. Else for me the dungeon part doesn't feel like classic, if you can mindlessly pull what you want and the healer can go afk without issue.

And? Racial only affects yourself...
---
Yikes. Retail is still a very good MMO, and the raids and dungeons are the best end game content in MMO history. 
---
Just because it doesn’t personally appeal to your casual tastes does not make it universally bad.
---
Stress test. It's a fun even for people in, and gnomes are fun. Actual population will be different.

So what "skill" is represented? It sounds like it's purely cosmetic. (Just words on the screen that don't mean anything.)
---
yeah, sure. But the point is if you abuse or use it.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
It's something you can expect out of an arcade game. Streamlining the entire game as much as possible, removing as many obstacles as possible, in this case players, and making the entire game as action-y and quick as it can be.
---
This is why layering/sharding, call it what you want, is used. To make every player able to fly through everything quickly without any players getting in the way.
---
so the more orcs the better

I could buy weapon train at level 5 in the stress test, as a paladin (not polearms though). I thought this was locked until level 10?

---
Am I wrong in understanding that in 1.12 at any given time there is one Black Lotus node with the potential to be in 4 different zones with an hour respawn rate? So maybe the first person to get a black lotus can do this assuming they all spawn in the same location for the first time across multiple layers, but after that if Black Lotus spawns are randomized across different zones this really shouldn’t be an issue. I can’t imagine that the lotuses spawn in any sort of pattern. Only referencing this one material, not other herbs or ore nodes.

---
Level 1 raids, mass pvp, etc are the pros. But on the regular having 100+ people dedicated to this one guy poses issues for regular zones.
---
Me and a friend did this in... tbc or wrath. We used to go to each other’s house during school holidays and we one day decided to do it. We raced each other to finish all the zones, but saved some to do together. It was so much fun. Exactly what classic was, and what I hope it will be again
---
Raids are the only good thing left.  
---
And I am not a casual.
---
it's like that on p servers too
---
But it is though. They didn't move the goal posts on sharding except for removing sharding as a possibility. Layering is not the same thing and is the result of the community outcry against sharding. It doesn't have to do with a technical limitation, it's a gameplay limitation.  
---
People need to chill regarding this. This is not the final version of layering, it's the first time they're testing it large scale. It will be improved upon until release.

With the exception that there are no constraints on naming across multiple realms, realm identity remains intact and you don't have to plan a merger that is sure to backfire.

Trying to understand why this was downvoted.
---
Yes, you can still do it and it will also be easier to do, because you get rep faster from farming the raid as opposed to farming the 42000 Silithid Carapace Fragment to get to neutral.
---
I love your idealized view of humanity but its simply not the way people are motivated.
---
Thing is how do you know which layer you're in? Not exactly something saying you're in layer 1 or 2.
---
Is this a bug?
---
Oh stop
---
Sure they can. They can lock characters to a certain layer so that if you log out and in again you're on the same layer and it requires 5 minutes of inactivity offline in order for your "layer-lock" to reset.
---
The party invites is a bit trickier though. Although I'm a 100% certain that either the community or blizz will figure out a solution for that problem aswell.
---
Packs after twins are even worse, a real nightmare
---
It will be, they’re just testing layering right now so of course it’s not the same as launch. I don’t understand how nobody has picked up on that. There was even an admin message about messing with some things to test layering.
---
But why would it kill classic, can you explain?
---
&gt; I love them, but it would've been cool if they joined the Alliance and the tensions between them and the other factions was explored. Especially the Night Elves, for obvious reasons, and the Humans, who many Belfs would probably dislike for the whole abandonment and attempted genocide thing.
---
Nah, just give blood elves to the Horde, never explore the massive cultural differences between a highly advanced metropolitan culture and a primitive tribal one, and pull some fucking blue tentacle aliens that are literally aligned with the avatars of goodness out of Metzen's ass and give them to the Alliance. That is the Blizzard way.
---
No, that is not reductio ad absurdum. He provides a valid counter argument.
---
Consider the following, very similar sentence: "it's extremely unlikely one person will become a millionaire from taking part in the lottery once", which is true.
---
I’m sure the hype for Classic Cataclysm or Classic BfA will be immeasurable.
---
Yes that, but Asmon is also a bad classic warrior tank.
---
Well, going by the current info of 3k layers / continent, they will have 1 kalimdor and 2 eastern layers at the same time.
---
In 1-10 STARTING zones i suspect they will use phasing on TOP of layering to keep things under control. If thats the case and there are maximum of 1 or 2 layers in higher level areas you are better off just riding around than constantly trying to change between layers.
---
I wonder if people remembered to include the Wombat of Slaying in the level 30 BiS lists.
---
"casual taste" implying bfa is not casual, and classic is? and yes its universally bad. And in fact its not an MMORPG anymore, its a singleplayer game
---
&gt;you can find that this is wrong very easily
---
Then so can you.
---
The last official mention of the client they were using that anyone else here remembers was 7.x, what was the current retail client at the beginning of Classic development.
---
The burden of proof is on you.
---
less phasing bs on pservers
---
When they announced that TBC was coming out I was still new to the game. I had originally thought that Outlands was going to be an entirely new 1-60 leveling zone with two new races added to the game. They would add new raids even harder than Naxx for endgame. A few months before release I realised that it was from 60-70 and everything in the current game would become irrelevant. I was really disappointed like you that everything was about to be worthless.
---
Uhm... You don't make sense. You are implying that I am playing on private servers for ages, studying classes like autist but at the same time saying I will burn out of lvling?
---
Thats just a weak excuse for saving money at all costs if even garage hosted private servers can host stable servers with 10k+ people all in the starting zones, and youre telling me Blizzard couldnt do that? Idk, if that means we wouldnt get Classic because it would be uneconomical, fine, but at least complain loud and much so layering is kept to absolute minimum.
---
I think changing layers from grouping should only happen when you're in the same zone. No practical reason exists to change layers otherwise except for exploits.
---
I don't think changing layers should be possible at all if you're solo. Just let the layer over fill anyway and funnel new players into the new layer and prioritize people in groups changing to low pop layer instead of transferring solo players in game.
---
No I mean when you corpse run and want to click accept there’s no cd on first death to ress (pservers has 30 sec which triggered me)

Mob speed was different.

Different spawn locations.

Latency was fixed number.

Ship loading screens were wrong.

Didnt know if people stealthed or layered.

5 minutes on empty layer.

People were much more toxic.

Wait, I think you’ve got something here!
---
One of the last times I played, I got kicked from a group because they wanted to jump over a barrier and skip half the dungeon. It was my 1st time in there and I really wanted to see it all.
---
The problem that wasnt present in Vanilla or pservers. Overcrowding of early leveling zones.
---
Private servers also had dynamic spawn rates which screw up the economy way worse than layers and allow groups to infi-spawn mobs to grind.
---
Blizz isn't doing dynamic spawn rates, therefore they need to shift the players or else you would never be able to kill anything, as nothing would be alive.
---
My way of taking advantage of layering is being able to play on Day 1 without 5000 other people killing the boars :) Its getting removed after the first "phase" of classic.
---
Female gnomes look buff or something, their arms look way bigger than they did back in the day.
---
Looking at them from behind at a 45* angle looks weird.
---
It's clear something is needed. The game would literally be unplayable on day 1 if Blizzard did nothing.
---
The population problem. Everyone who has a wow sub can play classic, wouldn’t this potentially be so many more people than play on privates?
---
The main difference I saw when crawling through the files is that they use the new 'casc' format instead of the old 'mpq'. Aaand it contains many assets from retail like HD models, demon hunter tatoos and horns, etc.

Why do people want retail to fail? Surely its detrimental to classic if it fails.
---
You don't know what you are talking about. A layer with 3000 players is way worse than 10k players with dynamic respawn. 
---
800 orcs and trolls are supposed to wait 5 minutes for Zalazane and every Mottled Boar in Durotar to respawn? Hah, that's a good one. 
---
With dynamic respawns you actually get shit done.
---
Ragnarose
---
This is not the same as making the game action-y and quick, lmao. This is just simply ALLOWING players to play the game as it is, together with the other things I've mentioned.
---
I also experienced the random layer shifting. However it didnt happen too often and when it did it actually helped me complete quests faster.  And i believe they said in game they were going to force layering on players in order to test at the beginning of the stress test.
---
There will be much more people playing on an official server than on a private server. Also the stress test showed that they are having trouble if a lot people try to login and play on the same server,
---
i´ll roll a druid then and we´ll see who dies of boredom!
---
You call for no changes, but accept every change they make without thinking, commenting without thinking. i don't get why that many go and say nochanges and defend all changes. 
---
further down is an explanation that they might have more or less the same armor even with leather on the 60 (around 2.5-3k both) but the lvl 60 has twice the healt, which also goes into calcualtion of damage absorb. " DA = (player health) / (1 - (% damage reduction given by armor in decimal form). "
---
but maybe in 1.12 the dungeons are dumbed down already, and then i would say no changes, give us the dungeons they were before. but if you want changes, it is your decision. but  dont go around screaming this words without thinking.
---
In no world will warlocks be more played than mages, populated yes but I fully expect mages/war to be fighting for most played at 60
---
I'm so glad that instant quest text is a toggle. I left it off and I loved reading along while the text was being "written". Way more immersive than I thought it would be, and not annoying at all. I am definitely not rushing to 60.

It's like this in retail too, though. At the beginning, you are an adventurer. As you complete quests and level up you eventually become a commander of your faction, which makes sense.

[Please explain how in your mind how this example of BFA is casual or single player?](https://youtu.be/K_KAJm1jISM)

And yes classic is the much better casual experience, the slow pace makes the casual aspects of the game like leveling more challenging.

So, they're different games fundamentally now. As someone on the beta who played some vanilla, but primarily from BC onwards. They're just different. Mechanics are different, how classes act is different. The only thing the same is the interface, the base graphics and how you engage in combat  (loosely).  People who say "Classic is the real wow" is not really right, it is - original WoW when it launched, but the game has evolved. They are both world of warcraft, just at different stages, with gigantic differences. Honestly you have nothing to lose by playing retail - it's free up until 20, it's a LOT easier early on compared to classic early leveling. In myopinion it's too easy, quests are forgetful. Quests in Classic (again this is speaking from early on) are more drawn out, careful not to pull more than a mob or two. It's both slightly more tedious and engaging. It's soothing enough that you can chill, partially turn your brain off and mindlessly slay these mobs, but not quite boring enough that you want to quit. Except maybe when you don't get that drop of 5 thingimajigs after 45 minutes of farming mobs; or when you level up 4 levels without any item drops so you are now being killed by mobs the same level as you that you need to kill for a quest.  TL;DR - They're different games, play retail till 20 for free.
---
And the night elf who ambushes the player character, dropping the papers that reveal the envoy as a spy. And the sentinels in the Ghostlands who are setting up military camps, spying on, and attacking the blood elves as they try to retake it from the Scourge. If one country found out another country sent spies, who were straight up attacking government officials and citizens, that'd be grounds for war.
---
Please no. **We need layering.** I could not complete the first Teldrassil starting area quest until a few hours before beta was over. 
---
Being able to do stuff in the game is more important than you being able to see 100s of people all trying to kill one single mob.
---
That's not layering it's cross realm.

My best experience with Wow came from exploring the world such as visiting exotic places such as Gadgetzan, Booty Bay and more, sharing experience with fellow adventurers and fight through challenging dungeons with them.
---
I don’t have much experience with raids, I hope to try them but I am mostly there for the journey.
---
You have to remember that Layering is not an intended long term feature of the game. You may be able to exploit in the first month or two but after 3-12 weeks (I think those are the numbers) they will fuse layers and only have one functioning layer per realm.
---
Then the thing in the video wouldn't happen. This is sharding
---
Drive by buffing lol
---
You need to do vertically in the air to compete with gold selling bots.

Disc priest
---
They could use the same layering tech to prevent starting zone crowding if they made layers have dynamic pop limits.  For example 150 player limit at launch = avg 25 players per starting zone. Let as many layers as needed be created for the initial surge. Raise limit to 300 players per layer after 30 mins (avg time to lv 6) and distribute new players to original layers.
---
Keep raising the limit like this throughout launch day until layer limits reach the final vanilla pop limits.  Collapse layers throughout launch day as needed.  Second day will have the layers/limits that will exist for the remainder of the month or so until they collapse them all.
---
And they could spawn same number of mining nodes, herbs and important mobs regardless of number of layers. Then you can change layers, but it doesnt help you at all.
---
I still use titan panel. Surprised to not see CTRaid though

That's not How Wow classic should work.

Then you'd have to meet up somewhere nullifying being able to escape pvp, farm nodes or look for respawns.
---
Layering will only be around for the first few weeks.

They expect a large population drop off after launch and don't want to merge servers in order to counter the resulting low population of each individual realm. Consider a situation in which realms launch with vanilla retail like population caps, this game isn't for everyone and a large chunk of the launch day population can be expected to quit resulting in an underpopulated server. So their solution is to hugely overpopulate the servers and handle it using layering so that when the mass Exodus of players is over and the population stabilizes there will still be a decent population.
---
This wasn't a problem in retail because the game was expected to grow after launch and not shrink. It wasn't (as much of) a problem on private servers because people have to actively seek them out, and therefore a higher proportion of players are likely to be enthusiasts rather than casual tourists or retail people just dropping in to check it out, so the population drop off isn't as severe as something that is out in the open and only requires a retail sub.
---
I reclaimed mine about a week before they announced the new beta. I added time and then opted into the beta when they announced it. I got a beta invite the day after the streamers.
---
Yeah they scale very well,  cos, ISB, ruin, shadow weaving DS ask give fantastic damage boosts on top of having excellent spell coefficients on life tap and SB.
---
Honestly the biggest thing that holds them back early game is they have no + hit talents and hit gear is rare until you can get bloodvine
---
The biggest one for me was the look and feel of the game. When I played on Pservers, even with my new gaming PC, the game felt very jumpy. Character animation and Camera especially. 
---
As soon as I opened the Beta client I could immediately feel the smoothness of gameplay. My framerate doubled and I could truly see the benefit of my 144Hz gaming monitor. 
---
The best way I can describe it would be “ultra smooth”
---
it makes her politics ironic, that's for sure  
---

Flex the muscles 💪
---
my thoughts are that it's the same thing and virtually nothing will be addressed by the time the game launches, what you've seen in the beta is what you're going to get until they decide to remove it

As someone who was not raid leadership when 40-mans existed— is there a way to make it so everyone benefits from the time spent to alleviate the blow to not getting drops for a while?  Aside from the points part of a point based loot distribution system?
---
I look at it from two perspectives: psychological gain and real gain.  Also think about short-term gain and long-term gain.  Take a moment to prime your mind and think about a job.  You work and you get paid and you use that money to buy things you need and like.  You work 5-10 days and get a paycheck depending on your pay schedule.  During that time you know you’re going to be rewarded from the paycheck, but it’s not immediate (long-term).  It’s also guaranteed.  Between that time though you are spending time and energy and the return is not immediate or short-term.
---
I don’t want to be so bold to say raiding is like a job, but let’s pretend it sort of is because it has: required commitments, hours, preparation, and execution.  
---
At this job you do these things so with an input you expect an output.  The more input with little to not output, this clearly impacts both the psychological gain and real gain.  
---
Yes, in a DKP or point system you earn points.  These points are what you gain over time for a more long-term gain to get something with permanence: gear.  However during this time you might see little to no short-term gain for making the raid commitments with those time and effort resources.  The psychological gain is you’re having fun, your team is progressing, and you’re moving towards a goal.  But the real gain may be zero.  Real gain being in-game resources such as consumables, gold, mats, or gear.
---
Has anyone considered the expenses of essentially paying all participants of a raid in some way shape or form that benefits everyone even if it’s little to maintain the short-term, long-term, psychological, and real gains?
---
Whether it’s guild bank distributing consumables, gold, or mats as a payment to all involved—it might help alleviate this type of feeling where you go weeks on end without seeing any of these gains.  Even small rewards go a long way, especially ones like time savers (e.g. providing consumables for their next run or gold to buy them, which in turn saves them time. Time and money being highly valued resources.)
---
TL;DR
---
Is it possible that a guild bank can be lucrative enough early on to somehow give short-term rewards to all raid participants to avoid burnout for those in this situation or who do not see a piece of gear for weeks while committing hours to raids?
---
How so? Layering will link a huge pool of players, same as a pool of six individual servers would.
---
Dead servers is probably the main reason, they know that many people are going to try classic for a few weeks and quit
---
There were different crit chance, dodge chance, ranged AP and max mana values for character with identical stats. Even freshly created level 1 character differ in those. Also tauren +5% max hp seems to be calculated differently. They have more hp in the beta than they get on private servers.
---
And yet I can totally understand why this would work now.
---
Think about it we have a lot of very knowledgable players, and a large player base, that is specifically looking for challenges they’re not getting in retail.
---
Low level dungeon content sounds fucking amazing in my opinion. 
---
I’m excited for vanilla, but at the same time, I can’t help but think how much more exciting it would be if we had some sort of vanilla inspired bastard where things that didn’t make it in to alpha, did make it in to vanilla. 
---
Or even if a couple of the newer races or class combinations were thrown in for cosmetics. 
---
Or if the talent trees were a little more interesting, like how gutted the crap in wotlk to give the illusion of choice - it didn’t necessarily work and they gutted it with expansion #4 and forced you to pick 1 of 3 perks every 15 levels but it was cool whilst it lasted.
---
I realise it’s a slippery slope because I basically think cherry picking certain tbc/wotlk aspects would make the game extremely fun... for myself. At least that’s what I would like but as one player I appreciate  not everyone shares my opinion. 
---
I do sort of wonder how long it’ll be until everyone is running around in full t3 with naxx on farm, one shotting everyone else and having completed vanilla, and saying “hey what’s next?”
---
Given the complexity and size of the gaming community nowadays, I don’t think this will take long at all, the only limitation will be weekly raid lock outs and RNG loot drops. 
---
I mean we already know how the dungeons work. It’s not new any more, people aren’t going to spend hours trying different tactics: they know how to spec and gear and use spreadsheets and they’re just gonna load up YouTube for boss guides, have a conference call on skype or whatever, stream it on twitch, and get shit done. 
---
In that respects.... it’s gonna be a pretty short journey.
---
&gt;There will be much more people playing on an official server than on a private server.
---
Thats why there is going to be way more than one server.
---
&gt;I want it gone quickly too but it is a good solution for the first week or two.
---
Definitely not good. And its not going to go if people take everything that Blizzard says as granted. Stop defending layering and attack it as much as you can if you sincerely want it gone fast.
---
Unending breath belongs to da Undead
---
&gt; flying
---
Nah.
---
But yes for LFG.
---
No you're right. 200 IQ. They only do it to ruin the game. Blizzard actually hates you.
---
He tried it a number of times after that and it didn't work. So it could be he was just lucky with the respawn there.
---
Makes me miss Raiding Ironforge by sneaking in through the mountain lol
---
&gt; How they did it on LH was very scuffed, the devs even admitted so themselves.
---
People have here praised that solution as superior to layering. Both have BIG problems and dynamic respawns break the levelup WAY worse than layering does.
---
You can do it on live, you just have to stand on the window sill or against an outer wall (i.e. closer).
---
Basically the rested zone boundary is a bit off.  Probably true to vanilla.
---
* 10 servers \* 3 layers = 30 servers
---
* layering will cause controversy that launch will be anything but smooth
---
* there will be dead realms because of layering
---
Given the fears that joining groups in order to hop layers to get to a specific one, shouldn't it be considered *positive* that you don't know who will join whom? It makes intentionally joining and leaving groups to jump to specific layers less predictable and therefore less viable, after all.
---

Stop sperging then you won’t be called a sperg?
---
RemindMe! 2 hours
---
You win some, you lose some. There are going to be these types of groups in classic also. Hopefully there'll be a community change of mentality and actually have groups that talk and ask if anybody is unsure of how the dungeons works.
---
people don't know how hard core the 19 think bracket can get!
---
fishing every Sunday at the STV fishing competition on a level 19 trying to catch rare fish for the Lucky Fishing Hat  (+15stam).
---
Farming rep with Timbermore Hold to get the Furbolg Medicine Pouch.
---
Getting 12 arena chests at STV for the Arena Grand Master trinket. Sometimes farming for 2 of them as they are not Unique.
---
I even know a 19 twink rogue called Dirtybishop who got exalted with Shatari Skyguard to get an epic trinket from the vendor (it was later patched in the next two weeks known in the twink community as the Dirtybishop hot fix).
---
Me too, man. I guess my age is showing. Its a bummer if that ends up being the reality. I'm happy for the unique experiences I had at that time and I should leave it at that.
---
I think the difference with layering is that you can still interact with your entire server as you'll change layers with time, so combining the layers isn't as drastic as combining two different servers.
---
That's a good point. Legion would have been an amazing end point to wow and a good place to add classic and discontinue retail with promise of UoW which links to starcraft. This is 100% a good idea with no irony in my voice at all.
---
thats still in game on Live, there is an invis wall there, but once u break it you can still get to that quel thalas 
---
the true belf starting zone would probably be a flat undeveloped plain or part of stratholme (uninstanced)
---
This was a thing back in WoD too. I used it to farm rares in Pandaria for reputation tokens
---
 RemindMe! 96 days “/console weatherdensity 3”
---
Wrath was the beginning of new WoW for me. TBC was the only expansion that still felt like vanilla even though they made many mistakes in TBC.
---
How could your understanding of it have worked though? How would you have been able to group with your friends who lucked into other layers on character creation?
---
Basically yes. They don't have a lot of base stats in their talent trees which hurts, and the way their abilities scale from stats really rewards high gear levels. Warlock probably scales the hardest from gear, only Warrior really does more.
---
I feel like this mentality doesn't really exist in the modern incarnation of the game.
---
It's all about instant gratification, and I miss having to work my ass off for X or not having a sign-posted route from 1 - 120 I feel obligated to follow.
---
Yes a 5 second stun without trinkets is pretty fuckin brutal in duels, against a rogue you stay in battle stance anyway, u might switch ones for intercept, at lvl 30 u dont have berserker stance skills
---
One single week of sharding would prevent that you god damn insane person. Go on and convince everyone that sharding for the entirety of phase one when theres hundreds of players at level 60 layer hopping to farm Devilsaur Leather and High level Herbs/Ore. Oh wait, me saying that is pointless because you obviously lack the understanding of the game to realize why that is against every tenant of recreating authentic vanilla wow.
---
Imagine you wait for this game for *years*
---
You have to fend of the "muh nostalgia zoomers", the haters, the naysayers etc.
---
You reserve your name
---
You get your friends to play
---
Its 10 min before launch, holy shit
---
You are all sitting on discord, excited to play
---
Itsgonnahappen.gif
---
You make your Orc Whatever, and...you cannot finish the starting 1-6 level quests for the rest of the night because tagging 1 boar is nearly impossible. 
---
All the hype, gone, all the excitement, in the toilet.
---
I am against layering, sharding, whatever. But to get it in the first few days would be optimal just to get that clog of people through and spread them out in the world.
---
The people who literally coined the term generation y disagree with you.
---
&gt;In August 1993, an Advertising Age editorial coined the phrase Generation Y to describe those who were aged 11 or younger as well as the teenagers of the upcoming ten years who were defined as different from Generation X.[4][5] According to journalist Bruce Horovitz, in 2012, Ad Age "threw in the towel by conceding that millennials is a better name than Gen Y",[1] and by 2014, a past director of data strategy at Ad Age said to NPR "the Generation Y label was a placeholder until we found out more about them".
---
&gt;You're probably only like 32 or something.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Oh I agree lol, it's just that we've seen layering work differently to how some people assumed it would. i was more asking if people preferred layering or sharding right now.
---
That has an easy fix: lock you to a set layer when you're phased into it for a set period of time. Like half an hour or more.
---
The overcrowding in the Night Elf starting area was terrible. I couldn’t complete the first quest until a few hours before the stress test was over and most players had moved to major hubs or stopped making new characters.

"Old Expert Streamer DESTROYS the MYTHS about WASTING your time in CLASSIC WOW". BRUTAL TRUTH!
---
"Classic LOOOOOOL"
---
\-J. Allen Brack, 2017, probably
---
So, any strategy relies on having to randomly get invited to groups and hope they are in an advantageous layer? This sounds like an inefficient way to game the system. How would you even know if Black Lotus was up on their layer or which random spawn had it? Seems like you would be flipping layers and then having to check all the nodes, but you wouldn't know the timers on that layer so you might as well just run a route in one layer and hope you can pick it and time the next. 
---
Seems like the "best" strategy would be for a consortium of guilds to try to monopolize a layer so they could farm the layer without competition. If they can field that many people they can just camp the spawns.
---
I personally think we're in mountain out of a molehill territory with layers, but if people want to rage, ain't nobody going to stop them.
---
Since we’re playing 1.12, I doubt the Wolfshead Helm stacks with Furor. It was changed somewhere around 1.8.
---
layers let streamers play the game on their own personal layers and not have to worry about getting trolls.  it's good esports.
---
How the fuck are you having 6 times the normal people on a single server? Layering is within servers, it's doesn't mix people from different servers together.
---
Yeah, because i have seen each of those systems in place and they all have flaws. I just dont see the first 1-2 weeks being that important in the big picture. If some mage gets into L60 and collects 200 black lotuses, well good for him. The fastest guys ALWAYS get a head.
---
Have to do something, i dont want to recreate original wow vanilla launch either, it was a huge shitshow.

Your comment was referring to the entire game...
---
I’m just saying there are challenging and social aspects to the game, but they are locked behind end game. I agree that they need to bring difficulty back to lower levels of the game, I’m just simply correcting you when you insist that BFA has no MMO elements or challenge.
---
Hope that makes sense.
---
Why no? Personally I think the original wow was amazing but I definitely think it is being over hyped to the point that there will be an initial rush to play and fall off shortly after. I don’t think that’s a silly thing to assume from blizzard and they should definitely prep for it.
---
Different types of mobs have different movespeeds and aggro radius.
---
Hunters deadzone is apparently larger. 
---
Regen and all character stats are slightly off.
---
Using a weapon swap macro made it impossible to switch weapons until logging back into the game.
---
Even with the layering as they had it tuned in the Stress Test, it was not enough in Teldrassil. I was not able to complete the first quest as it was impossible to find Young Nightsabers.  I even rolled a hunter so I could try to tag one as soon as one spawned, but I rarely saw one spawn myself.

---
It absolutely is. Literally the only challenges are gear checks.
---
Remind me the last time Raganaros or Thrall showed up in Stormwind on retail..
---
This is exactly what I was looking for! &lt;3
---
&gt; The first 10 hours, I was able to kill 3 Young Nightsabers 
---
This sounds more like a personal problem since most people were able to get out of the starting zone (lvl 5) within an hour of playing
---
&gt; Yes, that would be the case for the 1-5 zones on launch day onl
---
No, it stays that way for weeks, the only thing changing is the level at which it happens.
---
Moo was super far ahead of the zerg on that server launch, he got in really early and was tag-leveled from level 1 and still... defias escort was literally impossible for him to do, dynamic respawns were hitting so hard that you couldn't progress through moonbrook
---
I felt this until I got beta 🌚
---
Yes! Running around looking for candles in mines and making a mini raid group to kill hogger and a rare spawn was truly amazing
---
After 4 Days i'm lvl 50 and have 2-5 Weeks left to farm all the rich nodes i could possible want? Thats a nice way to ruin the economy from the getgo :-) Amaze
---
Echo chamber. In a similar vein, the 'in thing' is to shit on streamers. 
---
e.g. Tips getting absolutely slaughtered. I wouldn't be a fan and I'd be the first to admit that I wouldn't be the best at pvp but any time he streams he just gets shit on.
---
i.e. questioning how he even got a beta, how can someone be so bad at games, he has no clue, etc. etc.
---
I like this sub for classic news but my main take away from here is to avoid whatever server the majority of this sub decide to play on. Thinking about grouping with some of the toxic people in here would spoil the experience in my opinion.
---
I know I know. I'm just sad I didn't get in.
---
Would love to have my old 19" Samtron CRT and a REALLY loud ATI X850XT  back to game on.
---
Because it doesn’t fit some random dudes 15 year old definition of the genre
---
See that’s what I’m not going to miss about vanilla: not getting your basic ability until much later. Like retribution paladins without crusader strike.
---
And controversially I’m not going to miss spell rankings either. 
---
Kind of wonder what they’re going to do with the “broken” stuff like reckoning bombs one shotting etc.
---
why is esfand so fucking annoying though
---
#nochanges
---
Wrong. 
---
For example, what cannot happen is you see a mining node on the minimap, walk towards it and as you start mining it, it vanishes because while you were mining, you were shifted to another shard where the node wasn't there.
---
Can't happen, layers cover an entire continent and are "stick", so unless you group up with others, you'll never leave your layer unless you log off / on or take a ship to the other continent.
---
So, now that we have established that layers are not "same system like in bfa", what was it you were about to say?
---
Mind explaining what you mean with point 2 and why you think we willl have dead realms because of layering ?
---
&gt;Thats why there is going to be way more than one server.
---
We don't know how many we will get. I am from EU and will likely play on a german server. I doubt there will be many more than 1 or 2. I hope I am wrong though.
---
&gt; Definitely not good. 
---
It solves server issues and overcrowding issues at the same time. Seems pretty good to me.
---
&gt;Stop defending layering and attack it as much as you can if you sincerely want it gone fast.
---
Why? I am just not being a hysteric like so many people here seem to be. Also I am not defending anything. Layering has advantages and disadvantages. This is just how it is.  I personally would like to have it active for two weeks or so and then gone. There is no need to "attack it as much as I can", lol. Giving your honest opinion and constructive criticism is way more valuable than any amount of mindless screeching.
---
Mythic+ is a result of those bad design issues. Every dungeon is a copypasta with 4 bosses designed to be speed ran in 30 minutes to fit into the Mythic+ framework. Sure, it can make those dungeons more interesting, but it doesn't make those dungeons good. Vanilla dungeons felt expansive, like a D&amp;D session. Modern dungeons feel like a story scenario. I mean to each their own. We can all love what we love. But I can't think of any dungeon run other than my first modern Kara run that left half the impression that my first BRD run did.
---
"Hi, I'm a Ragnaros, I'm like a man just less advanced and my anus is huge."
---
Some. I haven't tested this quest yet, but certainly 2 of four quests which had an interactable object had a reasonable respawn timer (under 15 seconds). If I get a chance at the weekend I'll roll a gnome and let you know.
---
This remembers me of „jedi knights jedi academy“. Back in the day we used play solo on pvp maps and created like 200 skywalkers fighting against 200 sith (with cheatcodes). My pc died every single time but it was glorious. Btw if i remember correctly you only needed like 20 stormtroopers to kill luke
---
Most people will probably just ask in world chat to join a grp for x dungeon to get ported to a new layer, gather their resources and leave the grp afterwards
---
Hidden
---
If people can't endure to fight over Mobs with a couple thousand other people they could sit out for a few weeks and maybe change their gender or whatever weak people nowadays do.
---
I partly agree.  
---
It really depends on who you're playing with. Most mechanics, as you've said yourself, are really easy. It's all about coordinating 39 other people and ensuring their perfoming like they should. That was hard for me even in 10-20 man raids during legion / bfa. I'm probably too nice haha.  
---
Anyway, a hunter shouldn't have too much of a problem of kiting mobs and laying traps, an offtank should be able to taunt in time for vael. People have BIS lists for items, theorycrafted and approved guides for every class and many YT channels providing information. If they don't perfom, it's simply gear.  
---
That mage in your example vael fight, where he sux due to low damage, how is that his fault, depending on spec, he spams a singe ability...he can't suck because he has no choice, no agency. The only influence are his gear choices, if he even has them, and the aforementioned information sources cover that pretty well.
---
U got any bêta keys dude?
---
Hi, /u/yuengs
---
I feel for ya. Stay strong.
---
haha what? I never saw that. If you get DI'd though you're frozen in place I thought? How would razer go about breaking the eggs
---
Does that mean you like flying but dislike lfg
---
Yeah... plox gief betah!
---
Correct. Flying was the greatest thing to ever happen to WoW, besides spec switching.
---
He’s one of the original 3 classic WoW designers and did most of the work for all of the original classes
---
That particular quest area was never playable on high pop PVP servers.
---
No worries, I've moved out, so I don't really hear much of it.
---
Are you drunk?
---
&gt; You make your Orc Whatever, and...you cannot finish the starting 1-6 level quests for the rest of the night because tagging 1 boar is nearly impossible.
---
This or 8 hour queue.
---
No you don't understand. It'll *LITERALLY* kill Classic if we don't have server issues for 3 days because of 6000 people being in Durotar at the same time, or some braindead server-pairing-but-totally-not-sharding solution that makes literally zero sense to anyone with more than 15 iq.
---
Nope. If you will die second time too fast, you probably will have cd on ur corpse.
---
if there's 3 layers it's more then likely that whoever is inviting you is on another layer, either way it takes 5 sec to check if you're transferred to a new layer and if you're not you just ask someone else to inv you.
---
Don't make it out to be something difficult, it's very trivial to abuse the system and everyone will be doing it.
---
Vanilla had a population at launch of less than 2000 players per server. 
---
Private Servers knew this will be a problem with their servers having players above 10k at a time. So they implemented "dynamic respawn" which didn't really work anywhere as expected afaik. So there has been so many exploits for leveling way faster with that system and it even destroyed the economy because of mobs just spawning way to frequently if you know what you were doing.
---
So what could Blizzard do?
---
* Capping servers at 2000 players?
---
   * In  this case we would have a population of 2k players on every server, and the experience for the people leveling would be more or less OK. But there would be REALLY high server queues for a few HOURS for people to even log into a server. In the long term this would result in dead servers, because they would have way too many servers on launch.
---
* Layering?
---
   * As far as we know, layering will be in the game in the first few WEEKS. This is an idea from Blizzard and probably not fully implemented yet as they are testing it out at the moment on the beta and stress servers. Layering would be allowing a good server population of about 8k Players while dividing the server into about 5 layers. A player will be placed in a layer automatically on login. You can still communitcate with people on your realm but on other layers normally. If you join a group with people, all your group members will be placed in the same layer. So this system, as it is INTEDED to be, seems like the best choice for all of us. Of course there has to be improvement so that you cannot simply logout and login to be in another layer and mining or herbing the same node on different layers. But Blizzard knows that and they will implement something against that.
---
If they implement LAYERING the RIGHT way, it is a good system. If they fuck it up, it is bad. But i believe Blizzard will handle this, and we all need to stand behind Blizzard to make the best out of it.
---
I did the quest on the stress test server,
---
the items were respawning quite fast, i'd say around 30 seconds
---
People wont be sent off to other layers randomly. New players logging in after layer 1 is full will login to layer 2, when layer 2 is full, new players will log in to layer 3 etc. Reversed effect on logout I assume. 
---
They stated that you will only be able to change layers by grouping or joining a guild.
---
So if you are in westfall, you will be with the same people except for a few who joined a group with someone for another layer. If you relog though you might end up on another layer.  (hopefully you are locked to a layer for a fix amount of time after logging out) 
---
The beta layering is not functioning as they want to right bow according to Blizzard and they are still working on it.
---
RemindMe! 95 days "/console WeatherDensity 3"
---
Do we think warlocks (and paladins) will be more popular on classic retail than they have typically been on private servers, since blizzard announced they would be using the old mount system for classic retail. (The riding skill being cheap and the mount itself being the majority of the cost)
---
This thread makes it feel like implementing a solution like layering is something trivial, and that everyone could do it.
---
Man, Asmon used to be one of my most dislikes streamer, kinda still is. Really starting to like the dou that is him and Esfand x)
---
I'll never be able to invest as much time into this game as I was able to when I was in college. I won't be able to become a hardcore raider again, staying up all night and watching the sun come up while learning fights. Then again, there's no mystery with this game again. That's why I can't find that happy medium of playing casually, but also finding a guild that won't have too many issues progressing through content. We won't be doing speed runs, or getting "world firsts" in Classic, but it won't diminish the amount of enjoyment I'll get out of the game. If anything, I'll probably enjoy it more, because hardcore raiding was the single most thing that caused me to get burned out from this game many times.
---
It’s much more difficult to level in vanilla than pservers too.  Sorry if this wasn’t clear, I keep forgetting I am talking to someone who never actually played vanilla.
---
I know. I thought my title would be fitting for some crappy youtubers to take. It's obviously a joke.
---
The first phase could be 3 months away.
---
That’s 15 weeks of layer hopping.
---
Sure, it wasn’t actually 10 hours, but I was at it for at least 2 hours before I gave up. 
---
Layering is supposed to help with this very issue. And as they had it tuned, it wasn’t enough. They need more layers to make the experience a bit more enjoyable for everyone, not just for who is fastest at targeting and has the fastest attack skill. 
---
There were so many people there it was impossible to find Nightsabers. 
---
Eventually a few of us grouped up and did the run to Stormwind instead.
---
I encountered the same thing, and was so confused whynothinf was happening in our durator raid group for ages. Then, all of a sudden we were switched layers (after hours of being in this group together) and there was all out war.
---
Something's wrong with layering, despite it being the most appropriate solution
---
You're a legend!, thank you :)
---
It's only a small issue but it did seem unnecessarily annoying.
---
SL lock is the best 1v1 class/spec combination.
---
How does breaking their monopoly make them richer? lmfao
---
&gt; People are complaining about something that will be temporary 
---
Is this supposed to invalidate the complaints? Are we not allowed to complain about things that are temporary?
---
In your opinion.
---
Wonders if blizz tests back on their 1.12 server and say it's true that males have a hidden bonus in strenght and females have a hidden bonus in intellect.
---
Then we'll also gender min/max.
---
Or nobody can play with anybody because the servers crash consistently for the first week
---
Same here. Personally I think it felt okay while leveling, although I'm not sure they actually needed to layer the night elf starting zone. There were enough people that the place felt crowded and you had to wait for mobs, but not unbearably so, which was a great balance. 
---
I don't know if some of the rollback issues were part of the layering, so I can't really comment on that. Happened once in Darkshore and took me back from the Grove of the Ancients to Auberdine, but that's it.
---
My one complaint was near the end where half the players had fun with either Thrall or Ragnaros, while a bunch others (myself included) were stuck in layers where absolutely nothing happened. That really dampened the mood and highlighted one of the biggest weaknesses with the system. Hopefully they'll figure that one out for the next stress test.
---
It really seems to be the norm in the current game to be anti-social and speed running all levels of content. Its very unfriendly and just not fun
---
Caster mobs are correct in Classic as opposed to any Pserver.
---
Casters on Pservers would constantly cast their spells. But anyone who played vanilla knows that Casters would cast a Fireball, then punch you 2-3 times and then load up another cast. This means that on Pservers, caster mobs are much tougher. 
---
You can test this on the casters in the starting UD area.
---
Yes. Blizzard have said there were critical issues - these will be looked into. This was the reason for the stress test.
---
CMV: speed leveling is lame
---
thank you, that's great. Glad to see they've improve some things while keeping it 'Classic'
---
Any other improvements that you've noticed?
---
Cheers
---
Warrior vs Paladin is almost impossible to win. They can survive for so long (blessing of protection, divine shield and even lay on hands).😅
---
Well yeah, that's the problem. You can't have layer locking and the ability to group with random people / your friends / your guildmates at the same time.
---
The only content I want after Naxx is TBC. 18 months after Classic launch should do.
---
Out of curiosity I whispered someone on the beta server and he responded...
---
I feel that flying kind of ruined the open world to an extent. And it is what birthed LFG. Why would you need to go to a dungeon if you were just flying over all the threats and all the world objects anyway?
---
What separates an average warlock from a great warlock?
---
No... but my wife on the other hand...
---
Word problems, amirite?
---
I believe there are private servers that do custom content if that's what you desire.
---
they are in game but they just tell you the name of the dungeon and the recommended level range, a bit later on they made them into a basic version of LFG where you had to go click on them or talk to an inn keeper to queue for set dungeons and then they were changed to the versions we know now
---
But layering is a tool for the initial wave of people and only layers from your server, it is not a server merging tool for the unpopulated servers. If a server dies it will probably just be dead like it used to in vanilla. 
---
\+ Layering is removed after probably 3-4 weeks, so-called "phase" 1
---
I love WoW, and Blizzard for making the game. I’m just posting here in the hopes they take all view points into consideration when adjusting things, based on the data they have collected. 
---
No need to get defensive. :-)
---
Great post!
---
Not sure about the first item on your misc/petty list. Isn't the troll mage using an addon for the difference in style/font? I remember using something similar.
---
BIG TRUE
---
Absolutely not.
---
I am posting because of the misinformation from people.  A lot of people are assuming layering is here to stay, when it is not.
---
Out of 10 posts, 1 has legitimate complaints and the 9 others do not know how layering is intended to work.
---
This would be nice yeah. But someone has to invest in it and get a mod to sticky it.
---
No layering shit on private servers
---
Just like anybody except for the sweatiest of NEETs being completely unable to play because the starting areas are so bogged down it takes 4 hours to tag one wolf or boar.
---
This doesn't make any sense. none of your points are true.
---
Blizzard hasnt event got back to me. I need to remove my authenticator to add a new one. Been waiting two weeks for a reply. Hard to sub when I cant log in to my account.
---
You need to switch to defensive for disarm on intercept. It's just as if not more effective than concussive blow...
---
Keto diet, learn it and live it. Fast for 12 hours have a little dinner and get back at it. Avoid any and all sugar and carbs, the first step to preparing for wow is making sure you take care of yourself first! Good luck friends
---
&gt; Why would you need to go to a dungeon
---
Because the dungeon is the content. Walking on the road is not.
---
People didn't want sharding because they didn't want people popping in and out of phase all the time. Honestly the sweaty nerds on this sub will never be happy so Blizz should just do what they think is best.
---
I was coming here to lament my misfortune at never finding the Wombat of Slaying only to find you beat me to it. Kudos to you.
---
I loved exploring in classic, probably one of my favorite things to do in most games but WoW especially. With this newer engine in classic though they have removed the ability to glitch jump up hills and mountains which is one of the main ways to see some of the coolest places like the Ironforge Airbase. Kinda sad really I was looking forward to going all sorts of places and seeing things I missed previously.
---
After clearing into AQ40 with one guild, them breaking up and reforming - we had a mix of new raiders/undergeared raiders etc... as raid leader I set a few goals for the group. No AQ til Nefarian was dead, no Huhu til Rag with no sons happened.
---
This helped us really push our veteran/geared players to keep playing MC to help the lower guys gear up, pushed the lower guys to learn the fights and get into the spirit of raiding with consumables and preparation, and really bonded the group together at that point. We killed rag the first week, but didn't get Vael down - so the next week we cleared MC again, killed Razorgore then called the raid - we still had an hour of raid time left - and told everyone to bring their A-game for Vael the next raid night. Everyone showed up prepared and on their game, and we walked through everything up to Nef in that next raid night.
---
This group stayed together all the way into Naxx and through most of BC, despite the cliques and side groups, we motivated everyone to a common goal. New raiders wanted to see stuff they hadn't before, and had the old guys helping them out. Old raiders wanted to start progressing like they were before and had the new guys eager to learn and research how to be better.
---
Hi, did you see the crepuscular whatever humanoids in Silithus ?
---
In Vanilla, they were added in a later patch, so I was wondering if they would be present in phase 1.
---
I think it will be quicker to level this time around. Many areas and quests are known.
---
For me personally it would be quicker since my English are considerably better which means less time on Thottbot.
---
jesus christ
---
It happens literally every single time. The only surprising thing left is that it still surprises some people.
---
In other words, old people's brains are too slow to keep up with modern games so they resort to 15 year old games which don't require mechanical skill because it was purely designed as a time dump.
---
Amen to this.  The number of people who try to skip all trash they can, when it'd take like a minute to kill them and remove the risk of a a wipe is astounding.  It's a big reason I always find myself tanking;l when I tank I pull all reasonable trash, none of this jumping skipping garbage.  When asked why it's simple:  The time it takes to kill that trash is less than the chance of a wipe if someone asspulls or gets feared or something into them.  Stop being a moron.
---
the holiday events were such an awesome part of WoW. the first time I experienced something like this was in Ultima Online during a christmas event. They opened up a new shard specifically for it and you could either be a reindeer or a human who looked like santa clause, they dumped you in a city and let you just go around murdering each other, reindeers vs santa clauses.
---
in WoW, the christmas events and halloween events are probably my favorite. the easter one is pretty fun too.
---
I mean literally everything on this sub is google-able. Get a grip
---
In Vanilla the command /script PetAbandon(); would reset the warlock's pet name and remove all its learned skills.
---
Can someone on the beta can confirm this behavior still exists?
---
No it’s part of the problem.  Did you read what I said about content being a reward and you shouldn’t be able to see it unless you earn it?
---
You're making a lot of presumptions here considering we don't even know exactly how the layering is going to work.
---
That’s my point... consolidating everyone into 1 server (many layers) they won’t have to deal with dead server anymore. Sorry for not being clear on that.
---
[Well...](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/75636236/for-me-it-was-tuesday.jpg)
---
layering will exist only for first few weeks so people can actually do anything in starting zones that would be overcrowded otherwise
---
I didn't do it as any part of achievement or XP (this was pre-achievements), but towards the end of vanilla, I definitely would go on world tour trips while I had downtime on non-raid days. I'd start at the northern or southern-most tips of a continent and just run through zones until I reached the other end, enjoying the scenery on my way. 
---
When you didn't have flying mounts making it easy to traverse long distances on a straight line, just the change of landscapes, colors of zones (felwood being green, durotar being red/orange, etc.) , designs was a magical experience.
---
you wasnt found of world pvp?
---
You're missing the step in there where the community incessantly whined for ages because sharding wasn't "vanilla" and how Blizzard needed to find a different way to fix overpopulation in starting zones.
---
imagine calling the game you paid for a 'time gate' to raiding.
---
Quest rewards that gave money was about 5x higher. I had 1.5g by level 5 lol
---
I ment physically travel to the dungeon.
---
&gt; I feel like this mentality doesn't really exist in the modern incarnation of the game.
---
The modern game doesn't give one solitary shit about the world content being even slightly difficult, and when it's not difficult, it's not rewarding, when it's not rewarding it's not compelling.
---
The modern game has reduced world content to a time-sink between you and your goals.
---
I played a warlock in classic.  I really enjoyed it because there was thing like infernal and doom guard you could cast and either use as your pet or release it in a low area or something like that. The summon is good, (yes mage portal probably better) also have pets which are fun imo. Oh yes “free” mounts.
---
I've heard Blizzard is excellent when it comes to listening to player feedback, is that true?
---
sounds like you know more about it than me i was assuming a fair bit. i do recall asmon saying he wouldn't be able to play on a pvp server way back but maybe he is one of a few or even changed his mind
---
I was hoping a mod one put one together to combat the influx of posts regarding layering.
---
Constant posting of misinformation about layering is harming the subreddit.  Pretty much spam at this point.
---
I hated how no one realized that you can throw the buckets to other players and form a big line to reach the other side of the inn.
---
\*rage on\*
---
I disagree. Flying makes the world feel empty. They're something magical about traversing the world to go to a dungeon and complete quests.   
---
Walking adds depth and causes events to happen much more naturally like world pvp
---
An entire week hunting for kodo leather?!?!?!? HELL YEAH!!! I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT CLASSIC! Let's do this.
---
Correct, never on a private server. I've only played on official servers because I have seen private ones be taken down and I don't want to put time into a character that can be lost.
---
This hunters are crazy. Too much loot will do that to you
---
I wholeheartedly disagree, the stress test was an accurate representation of the launch experience and it was fine. It's supposed to be crowded, that's what makes it a mmo launch. With this layering there is the middle ground of being able to level at a reasonable pace while still having the feeling that it's a big MMO event. 
---
I don't want them to layer the zones to an extent where everything is spawned right before me on every quest I do, because that would mean the layer sizes are so small it won't feel like an actual MMO.
---
I think the layer sizes on the stress tests were adequate. Adding more layers won't make it more enjoyable for everyone. It may make it more enjoyable for you, but I for one don't like compromising on the MMO aspect of a game like wow.
---
Oh! Ok, I get you now, like there would be 1 server and a bunch of layering instead of a full server list? :)
---
Quality Post.
---
I think this is still going to happen, they have said that a single layer should be able to hold the same amount of people as was on a vanilla server.
---
Yes of course. My entire point is that this is not the final version we will get of layering. If the same issues persists/haven't been adressed by say mid july then I would start to worry. I think it's important that they state that they're aware of the issue and are working towards a solution so that we know they're working on it.
---
Just need to group up for those initial quests.  It def took longer than normal but got to level 5 in less than an hour, so it could have been worse"
---
Hes about average and good enough for pretty much all classic content. I'm expecting to play with tanks of similar skill 99% of the time when classic launches.
---
&gt;It’s much more difficult to level in vanilla than pservers too.
---
Because...?
---
Too bad barely anyone does this and instead the game is basically ruined for everyone because of people that rush everything. It will happen with classic too.
---
Let me be clear, I am not upset with people's differing opinions.
---
I just want the opinion's to be based on facts, not people raging over things they clearly do not understand.
---
We need a mod-stickied posting detailing what layering ACTUALLY IS, and have the conversation live there.  Much better than seeing a post about layering every ten minutes.  Regardless if the post is pro or against it.
---
Yessir I'm estimating at least 4 months for myself to reach 60....leveling was so much more time consuming back in the day.  Even knowing all the quests by heart from making 15+ max characters over the years I know the grind I'm in for.
---
Yeah, the big issue is that no significant amount of newcomers will join the game after a few weeks, so there really is no way to balance out the population development. 
---
So they really, really need to get the initial population right so there's a chance the long-time population stabilizes at around vanilla levels. Personally, I think this will go wrong on a few servers.
---
T R U E
---
The problem with LFG is not with the instant teleportation, its the lack of community because you are playing with a pool of 6m instead of 6,000. So you can be an ass, not talk to them, kick them, etc.
---
https://www.google.com
---
Grouping does not help, as you need to collect collars. Now you are in a group doing round robin loot for a mob which can barely be found. :-)
---
did you have the stress test invite as well or just a completely new invite?
---
I was going day 5 too but wasnt sure
---
He's right though : dynamic respawn implies a respawn that adapts to the number of players.
---
What you're  suggesting is just faster timers for respawns.
---
Yes of course, steamers aren't non profit organizations so any  "donations" are taxed.
---
Lol sure this is a problem if it were here to stay. But until it's removed if people want to go through the hassle to log out and back in for every possible node spawn, they can be my guest.
---
" A casino where I always win. That's boring. I must really be... in HELL!"
---
&gt;there will be dead realms because of layering
---
Mental gymnastics at work, lmao.
---
The technical limitation I refer to is how the game lags up and freezes when there's a large number of people in an area. If you watched any of the big streamers playing on the stress test server, it was an absolute shit show. Even with the primitive form of layering they have enabled right now.
---
Private servers don't have these problems, which is mind blowing. These are amateur projects completely outperforming what Activision-Blizzard can come up with.
---
Blizzard's networking tech is completely fucked. Instead of fixing that, we get a bandaid in the form of non-classic sharding.
---
no one wanted to fight a soul link warlock because they were just so hard to kill. warlocks could also stack stamina bc of life tap, so on top of soul link they would have a lot of HP. i absolutely destroyed mages as a warlock. they would die before they could even get one spell off especially with a felhunter interrupt + fear + death coil combo. the only trouble you could run into is a good, geared warrior and sometimes rogues, or if you're alliance there's always the fear of getting windfury procd. warlocks, warriors, and rogues are top tier pvpers as all 3 of these classes don't have to worry about running out of resources
---
how do you get on the F&amp;F list, my understanding is that was from being related to or knowing someone that worked with them, is this correct?
---
&gt; They're an almost extinct species, but the player population on almost all realms went towards 50% blood elves on the Horde side.
---
They shouldn't have made the rest of the Horde races as bent-back ugly mofos then.
---
Ah just a coincidence then lol!!!
---
Honestly these people saying we should merge servers are straight up fucking morons. So far, I've been told:
---
* Blizzard should just merge servers as needed, and people can pick new names (retarded)
---
* Blizzard should pool together servers ahead of launch so if/when they need to be merged, there's no naming conflicts (retarded)
---
* The amount of people on a layered server is going to be the same as the amount of people on 6+ separate servers, so merging them is exactly the same as collapsing layers (***MEGA*** retarded)
---
And all this just to avoid what is undoubtedly the best solution to a unfortunate problem: layering/sharding.
---
For real, don't try to explore all of Kalimdor at level 20 tho.
---
We have Google Earth now. It's much more fun.
---
I never leveled alliance but at least 3 of the early quests for undead is just to kill a certain number of mobs.
---
Personally, I still fail to see an long-term issue here.  Yes, as demonstrated, people will find a way to exploit layering and this may cause a disruption to the economy.  But Classic is going to last for years, not months.  In the end, the extra resources will run out and the economy will stabilize on its own.  I feel like this sub would benefit from looking at the bigger picture and the long term.
---
They didnt. They just stopped putting out quality questing and leveling content.  The vanilla leveling experience is fantastic and its filled with content people want to do.
---
&gt;Because the dungeon is the content. Walking on the road is not.
---
This is precisely the attitude that led to things like LFG and LFR. Flying mounts are functionally no different than LFG in that regard.
---
You people are legitimately mentally ill...
---
I’m afraid not, but i didnt exactly look for them either. Cenarion Hold however was missing the NPCs affiliated with AQ quests and gear so that’s at least something.
---
Its still a bit unclear of how it works exactly, we know what they are aiming for but the way its works is still a bit vague.
---
Its simple. You cant chat with people on a different layer. Which restricts layer hopping to just friends
---
It's a crying shame too, because the zones, music, and lore are all stunning. Imagine if they kept that Classic mentality while embracing the elements of the game that have genuinely taken huge, positive strides forward?
---
The rest of the Horde came first.
---
My mum did, but in later years she has conceded this standpoint because she (a pretty high up director role in a big international company) went to a lecture where an IT professor said that “the children you scolded for sitting at the PC all day are the people we need in the market right now”. She even let me build computers for my younger brothers and is very grateful for my supposedly “wasted years” as I’m their primary tech support now. As a girl I was always embarrassed about my interest, but she supported me going into an IT field and I feel like I am where I should be. 
---
I mean, WoW may not be how I learnt much of anything, but it was the start of an interest that’s really shaped my life. I think glowy Satan had a good effect on me.
---
Getting back to the almighty blackfathom deep was terrible XD
---
No? Gnomes are significantly better for PvP
---
I may have much rather have been invited to the beta...but the stress test was an awesome time.
---
Wish I could get my memory of classic wiped out by the pen from Men in black, the shit I’d give to be able to be naive and not know what to do or where to go again.
---
The journey to level 60 was its own game, the people you met made the experience.
---
That’s fine and well, and we will have to agree to disagree. 
---
While I agree that it’s nice for it to feel “epic” based on the number of other players I see in the world around me, It is not enjoying to have such artificially created contention on such a small number of mobs. A compromise would be to drastically increase the respawn rate of those mobs. 
---
The reality is that likely neither of our opinions matters in the grand scheme of things. :-)
---
Ultimately, I just hope Blizzard makes decisions based on the data they have.
---
An employee has to put you on their list basically. So you: 
---
1.	Have to know someone at Blizzard
---
2.	have a good enough relationship that they use one of their F&amp;F slots on you
---
It's always possible they'll invite more people of the attendance numbers for the first one wasn't what they anticipated.
---
Nice!
---
Thx for the quick answer.
---
“Fine.” Not being able to log in for the first hour, taking 30 minutes between tagging wolves in the starting area. Sorry we have vastly different definitions of fine. It’s very possible to have layers in the starting zone to be full enough to feel like an MMO AND small enough to keep the login serves stable and quests completable. 
---
You wanting the rest of us not to be able to login is simply not a reasonable perspective.
---
Netherstorm had bridges for the most part at least. The only real problem is Tempest Keep, if memory serves. It'd take way too much work, but I think it'd be interesting if they released the expansions but just didn't update vanilla mechanics. We get the same timeline, dungeons, raids, etc. progressing forward but keep the old talent system, abilities and speed of vanilla.
---
love all the opinions here based on 0 data and analyzing that took 3 seconds of semi thinking on the toilet
---
Yeh
---
Perhaps itll be beneficial for you eventually.
---
PogChamp
---
Do you mean six months in the game when layering is disabled?
---
One button, one action per client is okay... so it's not stupid?
---
There is literally nothing to stop someone from using 5 hunters and pushing "one button" to send 5 pets at my warrior while I'm farming and then pushing another "one button" to send 5 arcane shots at me. 
---
How is that fair? How can you honestly defend that?
---
Searched through previous patchnotes to see what patch it got changed but i couldnt find it.  
---
Read that it was BIS for feral druids up untill later in TBC where it got changed, havnt heard of this change happening in classic.
---
The healthier we are before going down this rabbit hole, the longer our bodies will endure.
---
I unfortunately didn't get into WoW until late TBC, but I remember getting tired of leveling and just taking off running down one of the roads in Feralas to see where it went. I went through a few zones and died a lot but it was fun.
---
I have never been able to recreate the sense of wonder of running around in WoW for the first time and exploring all the different areas. It was my first time in an MMO, so pretty much every concept was new to me. 
---
Someone in a thread I read a long time pointed out that it's impossible to recreate that feeling once you've played least one MMO and seems to apply to me. Tried to play a couple other MMOs over the years and never got that amazed wonder of exploring just for exploring's sake.
---
I think it's usually the tank. That stuff is what turns people off tanking usually. If you have all of that knowledge you probably play a lot so you're probably a tank for all of the perks. 
---
Not always but usually
---
I loved it in tbc because of the undying mobs , best punching bags for weapon skills
---
lol. Nah.
---
????? No, layering literally has none of those problems because you won't have the guild or naming conflicts.
---
I got layered away from my Sarkoth kill. Had to end up killing him twice. Luckily he spawned again right after the layer moved me
---
It’s only going to be enabled at the very start to address stability. Once people spread out and the initial  classic rush is over they’ve said they will disable it.
---
Basically. It was a crucial part of original Wow's for the first 3 expansions. The sooner Blizzard realizes its not the game but the social interactions it will continue to struggle.
---
It works, and 100 is the max allowed value.
---
Here are two screenshots, one with max value set to 30 and one with max value set to 90.  I tested higher values and determined 100 the highest.
---
Point of reference is the player character near the entrance of Splintertree Post.

---
Yeah, that would be nice. Then grouping would help. :-)
---
It layers players on one server.
---
It does now allow more players to be on a server than would be normally allowed.
---
That feels akin to chicken chaser for those who have played fable
---
Because XP is converted to money at max level, which for the stress test was lvl. 5. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
It was a stress test, it's meant to stress the servers....
---
I know you are an autist and might have difficulty using google.  Here’s one quick example (literally from this sub) 
---
https://youtu.be/WtR0fT3Hz3M
---
Also we should default to my opinion when comparing vanilla and pservers since you clearly have no experience with vanilla and therefore can’t make an informed opinion comparing the two, whereas I can (having played both)
---
The idiots having meltdowns over sharding are to blame for this crap. They're trying to find a middle ground but this could potentially be exploitable at higher levrls. 
---
They should just do what everyone was freaking out about. Shard aggressively up to level 30 zones, rest do nothing. Do server merges if necessary when the population drops, and tell the nerds who lose their character name tough luck.
---
This shit's going to be hard abused on every server. Just create different guilds in each layer. Jump between layers farming each black lotus / rich thorium / tidal charm / whatever. People are already doing this on beta.
---
It's way too easy to gain a big advantage. Players aren't going to just ignore it.
---
Ah, so you're just here to argue semantics so you can be """right""".
---
Blocked.
---
Anyone know if we will be using our lv 5 chars? Cause I most definately went to Razor Hill at 5, bought the best armor and weapons I could then proceeded to Northshire with 40 others with intent to kill, maim and grief. I might have to remake my char as he is broke af.
---
Oh yeah a tabard from a dungeon that will only be cleared once and gives no stats and will be wiped at the end of beta, they need to earn that
---
There's a lot of misinformation because Blizzard hasn't detailed exactly how it will work. They've only set out their aspirations with the system, such as staying on the same layer for your entire session. The system as it is on the beta right now mostly contradict those aspirations, with the layering "misbehaving" so to speak. With no clear detailed answers as to what is actually supposed to happen, it's easy to get confused as to what will be the case on launch. 
---
&gt;  the 9 others do not know how layering is intended to work. 
---
I guess my point comes in here, intended to work=/=how it will actually work. It changes quickly with layering, first it was only supposed to be the starter zones now it's basically up to the entire first phase. The ONLY thing that people have to go off right now is the Beta, where it is absolutely NOT behaving as blizzard "intended" it to work. 
---
I'm sure this post will get replies saying "wElL iTs OnLy bEtA, tHeY wIlL FiX iT" but with that mentality we may as well just close down this subreddit for 3 months and hope for the best.
---
This Subreddit: Stop complaining about layering, it's magic, it just works.
---
Meanwhile every day we find the most trivial and basic exploits that I don't think anyone assumed would exist. This person simply logged on and off and switched a layer.
---
Maybe this is how they sell it to us.
---
* They need to perform sharding. The community is against it.
---
* Introduce something worse than sharding. The community is against it.
---
* Compromise with the community by offering sharding. Community begrudging accepts it.
---
Back in 2004 we had queues which motivated people to move off of overcrowded servers. If they are just going to add layers without a queue, everyone will flock to the most populated server, which probably means they won't be able to remove the layers ever.
---
But people won't have to fight with other people over some mobs at lvl 1!
---
Thats pure convenience! Maybe in the future we could make it even more convenient, something like a full armor set that gives Bonus-Exp? That would be great!
---
Right, it'll be far worse on classic.
---
I think it is actually 20% ish of the server is usually warriors but not all get to 60
---
Care to share any source?
---
I hear people used it in TBC, and it works on all pservers which use 1.12 itemization, so I'm curious what makes you so sure it was changed.
---
No I think he replied to the correct comment. Yours is the one being a pissy bitch boy whining about a streamer, right? Yup looks to be correct.
---
RemindMe! 97 days "do eet"
---
Thanks for the answer anyway.
---
I won't ask you to wipe again in the next stress test, but if you know someone that wants to check \^\^
---
Which ones? Arcane mage, maybe...
---
If they get enough reports about high level players of the opposite faction not engaging each other while going after other people, they can give vacations to those involved.
---
It's not like it would be happening and no one would notice.  Enough QQ on the forums would make people aware it's happening, and then more people would report the parties involved, due to the jump in awareness.
---
It might be something that would fly under the radar for a little bit, but eventually enough people would complain about it. And if the people in the little cartel were dumb enough to use the chat boxes to tell people not in the cartel to fuck off and go somewhere else, that would be something Blizzard would be able to action on.
---
&gt; "Where a game is too easy, where progression is assured, [the game] is wasting **all** of your minutes - rather than the few minutes that the setbacks are wasting. Because if you're engaged, and challenged, and accomplishing - [the game] is not wasting your time."
---
This right here. *That* is the sign of a brilliant game designer.
---
Been saying that this is a shit system, way worse than the original idea of sharding ONLY in the starting zones but the blind blizzard fanboys cant accept the facts.
---
Well, without layers it would be literally impossible to level for the first few days unless you were a sweaty unemployed NEET that could sit at your computer for tens of hours at a time to "get ahead of the pack". 
---
Private servers got around this by cranking the mob spawns up to 45 out of a possible 10 which had a whole host of other issues. They chose the worse "dynamic spawning" option because they didn't have access to the sharding/layering that Blizzard does.
---
Variety only gets so far, its the social interactions that are the real draw of WoW. Having friends to look forward to after work or school and able to level and grind gear together is what kept us coming back.
---
Hey! I'll be playing Classic fairly casually as I won't have much time, and thinking about what class to play I've realized I need to play something where I won't have to farm for respec gold. I like both PvP and PvE so I'm looking for a role and spec that is at least somewhat viable for both. Class wise I have always been a reroller so most classes are up for consideration, the only ones I've ruled out are really Warrior and Druid, so no need for the "play what your heart desires" kind of comment.
---
I realize Warlock is very gear dependent in PvE which is a drawback for me as a casual, but aside from that: is there any or a few specs that are decent for both PvP and PvE as a Warlock?
---
Well, praying to a imaganary tooth fairy is a waste of time aswell.
---
The Pro on this is: Private Servers will be amazing with all the Data in an year when Blizzard launches LFG and Heirlooms for "convenience" to Classic.
---
I still remember seeing another hunter with a wind serpent back on my first character. I asked him where he got it and I believe it was the barrens. 
---
You better believe 12 year old me took a day long detour from stormwind to go and find one of those serpents to tame. I felt so awesome when I finally had one.
---
layers aren't separate servers.
---
It wont be a problem since my toon is already in the zone. I will definitely check on that next thursday for you!
---
I wasn't aware dungeons had a cap of 10.
---
I knew about UBRS but that's it.
---
There's a server's population on a layer, roughly three thousand people I don't think it's likely at all, we aren't even sure if they will prioritise friends on the same layer. You'd be spending time whispering people asking for an invite (you aren't avoiding pvp and you're wasting time you could be using moving onto the next mining node) when you're not even sure there is another layer existing on your server.
---
Sounds like it's being blown out of proportion to me.
---
Not being able to log in has nothing to do with layering. The login servers are seperate from the game servers. 
---
Moot point.
---
Thanks for clearing it up.
---
Cause if its public then those servers will be ruined economically and the streamers will be carried by there viewers. But at the same time I want to know so I can avoid them.
---
SL locks are good duellers. Rogues are the hardest matchup but with all cds up you can kill them as SL. Any other spec than SL, you will be struggling against rogues in general.
---
SL is personally fun in BGs (tanky) but in organized groups/premades its not that good (lack of range/dmg/burst). You usally need smruin or conflag (deep destro) for that. As a warlock, be prepared to tank melees in BGs because you are an ideal, immobile target for them (and hope for a healer behind you).
---
SL can be paired with affli (nightfall) or destro tree (shadowburn; but putting points into instant corruption).
---
SL locks are nice for duels in front of towns but in wpvp things can turn out differently (hunters can kite you to infinite, mage/rogue can simply disengage and leave you there etc).
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0OMrgWBNK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0OMrgWBNK4) This is good overview
---
No i'm not. You're just misremembering. The largest part of the vocal crowd just wanted queues and server merging. Blizzard decided to "fix" something many would see as a natural thing during launch.
---
I can understand why they want to fix it, but I don't agree with their attempted fix.
---
It wont be a problem since my toon is already in the zone. I will definitely check on that next thursday for you! Im pretty sure we will keep our toons
---
I take this as a great sign! 
---
As someone who got an invite but got hit with the PTR account bug and didn't get to download the client, I was somewhat disheartened when Vrakthris locked the thread and said we aren't getting in. Just reading the line " we will be including **everybody** who was invited" really felt like the community manager \*did\* listen and carry our concerns up to the developers.
---
Right now, I'm loading up the client for May 29th.
---
Faith restored!
---
That's kind of ironic, cause as a rogue you literally just equip a dagger and spam backstab on Vael.
---
I disagree completely. When you wipe repeatedly in deadmines or RFC you’ll get your memory back real quick. Vanilla is not as easy as you seem to think. Played it for years. Current WoW is A 2 button auto clicking everything. Really bad compared to the thought and effort you can put into vanilla fights. Way more than spamming 1-2 abilities repeatedly. 
---
WoW has gotten dramatically  worse. They wouldn’t be releasing classic otherwise.
---
From talking big to "yea.. i hope"
---
so many people don't realize layering is only going to last a couple weeks, just until most of us are a high enough level to start spreading out into the world and not spending hours fighting over tagging start zone mobs
---
For some, they are. Like...why do you care so much about them? Are you concerned about the effect it will have on popular opinion of retail or something?
---
Exactly, you could just avoid them. The worst thing would be if they dont tell people right away and you happen to be on the same server. After that people start finding out and swarm the server.
---
Nope, you're wrong. Unless there's a mechanism that makes herbalists or miners more likely to end up on a particular layer, the amount of herbalists and miners on a particular layer will tend towards the statistical average the bigger the cap per layer gets. 
---
Example: If you have 20% of all chars being miners, 20% being herbalists, and 60% being neither, and you pick 5 players to stick in a layer, statistically 1 would be a miner, 1 would be a herbalist and 3 would be neither. If you picked them at random though, it's fairly likely that the result wouldn't be like that.
---
However, if you picked 500 players instead, it gets way more likely that you'd see something like 100 miners, 100 herbalists and 300 neither.
---
This has nothing to do with economics, it's just basic stats.
---
So true man. This is so so true I'm cracking up
---
and will all rise again on Wednesday!
---
Racist. true, but racist
---
What if going fast is what I enjoy about the game?
---
Most of the 'anti-streamer' sentiment comes from:  
---
1. Streamers put on this pedistal as some god-tier by their fanbase.   
---
2. Streamers can often come across as obnoxious to someone who only sees clips.  
---
3. Seeing nothing but streamers in the video clips
---
The Breath is ABSOLUTELY unending.  The BUFF, however, is not.
---
The knock-on effect of this will distort the economy for 6 months - a year if no-lifers are smart and trickle their stockpile back into the market allowing prices to rise.
---
Another strategy would be to immediately liquidate a portion of your stockpile to raise capital and then use capital + your remaining supply to manipulate prices.
---
Hard to fully imagine what the impact of a year of dirt cheap high end consumables will be - but it won’t be good. The most serious effect will probably be that regular players will see a marked decrease in their ability to raise gold through gathering professions because prices will crash before they even hit 60.
---
This cuts deep...
---
You can't just do this on demand, I tried it just now and ended up back next to the bear I just killed and the node was not respawned.
---
It was never stated it would last all of phase 1, but def not longer.
---
In a interview one Said it would be a couple of weeks or so
---
We had a group of horde stuck in Northshire abbey's kobold cave too, constantly mass rezzing and trying to get out with a horde of level 1s bopping them before they could escape.
---
True, however then you hit level 20 and then - you go kill Quillboars in the Barrens or something? Basically, you completely forget about your homeland for the rest of the game. Really jarring.
---
The raids have always been good. The problem is Blizzard played to their strength and made the raids the casual content instead of making professions/open world stuff good.
---
Horde, US region, raid time and days are TBD but we're leaning Saturday and Sundays.
---
And here, folks, we see the second personality of the top commenter revealing itself. It is one of many, and it is only by pure happenstance that these two personalities collided. We shall learn so much from this chance encounter of this WoW player with multiple personality disorder.
---
I might be, just thought it was odd that's all. Almost 6 years by now.
---
&gt; its the social interactions that are the real draw of WoW
---
They won't keep players engaged on their own either. I mean, unless you *really* want to bang one of your guildies.
---
And from experience, a guild held together on *those* relationships is the guild that will fall apart the quickest lol.
---
The playerbase is very conflicted on most subjectd tho. They can't please everyone and sadly the casuals are usually larger in number but less active on social media.
---
so many people are going to be signing into classic on day 1, a **LOT** more than they were on vanilla's launch day. layering, which is only going to last a couple weeks anyway, means you won't be stuck in a queue and won't be spending hours in the starting zone trying to compete with others to finish the quests there. to put this in perspective, 200k copies of wow was sold on the first day. MILLIONS of people will be signing into classic on the first day.
---
Awww...I was hoping that was true. Been checking out pserver to get my classes in order for classic and man, you stay broke forever on a pserver.
---
Remind me to avoid people like you in classic. 
---
Negative af. If you don’t like classic and only have bad things to say, why are you even playing it?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-18XgsnvNQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-18XgsnvNQ)
---
Blizz themselves has said, it's only going to be active as long as neccecery. Yet you would rather first have unplayable and then dying servers just to prevent lvl 60 leather farming. While the majority of the population is still bloody leveling.
---
Let's be honest here, the only people who this threatens is the no lifing ones, who are going to rush for the server first. And even then it's just the first 2 months out of coming years of this game's existence
---
What? Server load and stability have tons to do with it. 
---
I couldn’t login because the server went offline or was locked...
---
Does that mean I can't yell "suck on my rotten balls!" when I'm bashing in a gnome's skull with Ironfoe?
---
Well this is only volume 4 so there is 3 others full of flag capture, base crunching, hogger slaying music
---
No. 1.12 did not nerf any dungeon difficulty and the damage is correct as it is right now. I am starting to suspect that many people like you just refuse to understand that many parts of vanilla were just straight up easy. Yet, because you were a bad player back then and had problems clearing some content it doesn't mean it's suddenly wrong. The damage values are exactly correct, it's just that players have gotten better. 
---
You can claim "oh they must've dumbed it down" to make yourself feel better for just sucking back then (we all sucked, don't take it so hard lol) when in reality the content is just not as difficulty for players that play WoW for over a decade now and understand how most mechanics work. So as a result you want to change the game so it FEELS the same despite us clearly just being better at the game. I do NOT want any kind of changes and just the same game as it was. I do not care that most players are better now and will have an easier time. The game is still great.
---
Well the whole goal is turn the situation from _critical_ to stable. By taking out Darkhan Drathir or w/e, you’ve disoriented the Scourge forces in the Ghostlands and can now show the Horde that your people are worthy, and can contribute to the war effort.
---
Needs Steam wheedle Cartel. Otherwise love it!
---
Thanks for testing it!
---
Do you have an idea if this was possible in vanilla? I don't think it was but neither did I even know about commands like this back then nor did I find any evidence online.
---
I found [this](http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/78772-nameplates-visible-from-farther-distance/)
---
So I assume it didn't work. I wish this thread got a bit more attention so Blizzard might have seen it and could investigate.
---
Thanks again.
---
Thanks for the laugh mate
---
I have beta. I'll test it out for you, and can link you video evidence of what happens.
---
Filthy horde scum
---
Play any game long enough and you will start to develop the mindset that the game should only be played a specific way because its the fastest or its the best whatever.
---
But we truely forget that games are meant to be fun not done for efficiency, play however you like and let nobody in game tell you otherwise.
---
Goes for any game really.
---
&gt; The largest part of the vocal crowd just wanted queues and server merging.  
---
I disregarded those people because they're honestly completely fucking braindead. Having a 10k+ person queue on every single server for the first week only to have your name and/or pvp titles taken from you a year down the road because they need to merge servers is a fantastic way to kill Classic.
---
Now this is a criticism I can get behind.  I totally get this thinking.
---
I do agree, this is a beta.  This is not excuse though, they are probably testing different things.  I would still error on the side of what they've officially said.  That this will be temporary.
---
What Blizzard needs to do to be successful is to make great games that people want to play, and be confident enough in their own vision to follow through without external pressure.  You can't make the game all things for all people.
---
"Listening to fans" is what gave us flying, LFD, LFR, cross realm and sharding.
---
Thank you. Someone else just replied and confirmed that it does work but more attention and evidence is always good.
---
Well some people want to actually play the old school quests. And yes killing wolves and shit in northshire is a really important quest for me.
---
And surprise, when wow came out it was not as popular as it is today. So layering is necessary to make it really feel like vanilla, because classic will 100% have more players on day one than vanilla had back then and it will have less servers likely. 
---
Without layering there would be a queue 100%. IF you need a few hours to get into the game you cant step outside and kill higher mobs. 
---
So god damn calm the fuck down about layering. We will not be on a private server with just ~500 people playing.
---
*projecting*
---
there's a direct correlation between Activision merging with Blizzard and WoW introducing a lot more casual mechanics which killed the feel of it being an MMO. my only hope is activision stays far the fuck away from classic because if they had their way there would be paid lootboxes for chances to get legendaries
---
Fake news
---
lots of people think that yes, and lots of people think it did. there is no way any game could progress (in 15 years!) in a way that everyone likes.. retailbashing is extremely cringe and boring now.. just be happy classic is gonna be released and find something else to be butthurt about.
---
Why are you people even playing classic wow it all you have to say if negative things?
---
Go back to retail if you like it that much.   I consider is boring trash compared to anything released in vanilla, and I know I’m not alone.
---
Yeah I've had numerous quests where the area was pretty populated but the quest items were always ready to loot.  Killing mobs for quests on the other hand...
---
Well i am not using it for pvp. 
---
A defence could be that Its allowed?
---
While I agree with you 100% i unfortunately think layering is here to stay and anyone who rushes to 60 before they (hopefully) take it out will be the ones benefiting from manipulating it.
---
I was never able to get into other MMO's after playing WoW
---
Then do that, no hate.  I'm in the same boat.
---
RemindMe! 2 Months
---
I see your point but it's kind of different. If there was a negative reaction to changes Blizzard made, I would argue that it could be because retail is used to a certain style of play and changing that jarring. However, for Classic you know exactly what you're getting and it's because it's supposed to be that way so people are less likely to have an adverse reaction to it.
---
So theoretically, let's say you have a massive Horde raid consisting of multiple raid groups. 
---
They all hop on a zeppelin for eastern kingdoms. Is it possible then that groups could end up in different layers?
---
Speak for yourself, I still adore vanilla despite it.
---
Flying was good in BC and wrath had some cool zones where flying felt well done (icecrown and storm peaks). It was good in BC because flying mounts were so slow unless you wanted the epic mount speed. 5k gold back then was a huge amount of money for most players so most people didn't have epic flying. Ground mounts and flight points were still much faster than flying around from zone to zone doing dailies for over 80% of the players. That said flying is terrible these days. It definitely limits social interaction a lot and makes the world much smaller.
---
Understandable, but this is what these tests are for - layering *should not be doing that*. Glad to see you're reporting it.
---
It should move invited players to you, and not much else.
---
Just because the servers said "offline" in the realm selection doesn't mean the actual game servers were offline. During the stress test the server was "offline" for half an hour but the people who were already on could play fine without any lag during that time. 
---
Again, login servers are not the same as game servers. They're kept seperate for a very good reason.
---
Don’t you mean the game is annoying?
---
I know fully well, that's why I don't indulge in such foolish things.
---
WoW's success ended at Cataclysm when Blizzard stupidified the skill trees. Of course there were many other gripes but that was the big one for me. 
---
Nuking all my characters talents that I had spent a painstakingly absurd amount of time creating caused me to unsub. Sure I came back a few times for a month or two, but I always wanted Vanilla back.
---
Classic has to be catered to the old skool in all of us if Blizzard wants it to succeed.
---
We want the grind, the slower pace, the insane challenges, needing our community, being able to hold players accountable, being able to have semi unique talent selections, Rare hunter pets that are better than standard. We want a complicated game that rewards us for perseverance.
---
What? Blizzard is charging money to play World of Warcraft? Since when?
---
Yeah I feel the same way, normally I'm a horde loyalist but... pallys and stuff
---
I agree but at the same time disagree.
---
MMORPGs from the ground are meant to be social, and dungeons were radically different back when I played vanilla and TBC as an unfriendly environment meant the dungeon run was doomed to fail. And gathering up groups was usually the biggest hoop.
---
With the LFR tool this became so accessible that you didn't need to be friendly anymore. And having a daily dungeon for marks or some smaller upgrade typically was the best when it was executed in a timely fashion. I'm not an advocate for LFR tool, I absolutely hate it. I also value my time and chatting can be done before, or after the dungeon. Lets say, a good balance keeps it all nice :) Perfectly so, as all things should be.
---
Stop and smell the flowers
---
My favorite was the PTRs, specifically the one for AB we had a war exactly like the one that just happened on beta in Arathi just more laggy. The Naxx PTR was awesome too, free characters ready to raid, we only downed 1 boss though lol.
---
I've been hearing a month or so, maybe more. If it wore a week, I'd be more okay with it.

Code changes anon. And glad to see that you think blizzard is  incapable of nipping this in the bud.
---
Or we just accept layering for the first couple of weeks and have fun with the game
---
You've got plenty of time to figure something out before launch. :)
---
there are posts every 30 seconds for random requests of all natures about how they should change classic
---
in many ways i hope they stick to their idea for classic and dont listen to the community too much
---
it is my favorite raid of all time ... it would be so damn interessting to know how it was intended in vanilla
---
I feel it's kinda like pick your poison I can see benefits for both sides
---
Healing in 31 balance isn't bad either. You get the manna reduction from both trees, and the only thing you miss out on by taking Moonkin Form is having Nature's Swiftness. Overall, gear is more important to your healing than spec when it comes to healing in full resto or in partial balance.
---
Nothing from the "current" game but there will be things I miss from previous expansions.
---
I am with you my dude, that's what I think is the good thing about it.
---
Are you gender-fluid too?

A few people said Omar was messing with them, but small groups of people not in the main cities.
---
*ah shit he we go again*
---
Yea, don't seem to like layering that much but still early to say I guess. Let's keep our hopes up!
---
they made a version of wow where thy tried to listen to all the casuals
---
how exactly is BFA going?
---
Ok, now tell us dishonestly
---
Man I can't wait to be on a layer. The thrill of having 2-9 other worlds parellel to your existance interdimensional merging into yours is so vanilla. Really brings me back.
---
Played WoW since March of '06 and raiding Valley of Trials from the cave was the most fun I've had since TBC. Also maxed fishing, cooking, and made 7g crafting Lesser Magic Wands. Had an absolute blast.
---
And yet Google tells me gen y was used first and that millenials first appeared in a book in 1991. I guess your source is wrong.

All of these were taken on the last day of the test the last photo is during the GoldShire invasion from the horde that was fun as hell reminded me a lot of the old days
---
A beta with bugs, how peculiar.
---
I don't doubt that this will be the case. It's going to be nuts.

Casual Guilds will never see a rich node or a black lotus. Trust me, after years of vanilla private Servers, there are Excel Sheets, Viber Groups and Skype Groups with every Node (Time taken, aprox. respawn, by who) for every single Black Lotus and Rich Thorium on the Server
---
This^ retail wow sort of tried to give everyone everything they wanted and eventually that led to gameplay becoming hollow.
---
Protip: If a cute girl from your WoW guild asks you for a dickpic, ask the gay guy in the guild if he's had the same request, he's the only one who will tell the truth.
---
If there are more dickpics, your guild has become a time bomb. Be very worried. True story.
---
Oh god I did t even think about naming
---
That's not a moral dilemma.
---
Talent spec, and +shadow damage gear.
---
Yea they just announced it, 3 hours earlier start though (wooo only 9pm GMT)
---
That's what they originally planned, sharding in the starting zones. But they clearly didn't want that.
---
&gt;I'm an entitled twat  
---
&gt;My Mommy and Daddy stuck their fingers in my butt  
---
&gt;I'm on reddit! I'm important and my voice is heard!  
---
&gt;I live on reddit because I'm an anti-social dolt   
---
&gt;All I can do is be negative because my existence is shit  
---
&gt;Why did I die alone?
---
And I’m saying as someone who has participated in every expansion release(4+ realm first etc.)and sincerely enjoys the race I have never participated in a launch as bad as that stress test. The idea that some people have a 30 minute head start is pretty unacceptable to me, and then when the masses login the quests were not completable and I was lagged out for a good 10 minutes initially logging in? Sorry but no this stress test could have gone way better.
---
So essentially we should be like the Rohirrim... Riding in to save the day with the named hero who gets all the praise. Which is basically how it used to be.
---
That shit's not relevant to a vanilla boy.
---
This. Launch should feel overcrowded.
---
And lots of player will be like, screw this, I'm not wasting my time. They might wait a day, or a week, before trying again. Still overcrowded? Try another server. Others will power through it.
---
People need to stop treating this like a single-player game.
---
Same stupid thing here... /cry
---
It’s easy to listen to a fan base when you have a template for a game that was successful. There is nothing to experiment or try different with classic. They have no internal conflict with new systems to test or try so they can easily address any concerns the community has. 
---
That said, the way the classic team has been communicating with the community has been great. You will see this carry over into the live game. Hell, it already is to a degree with 8.2
---
I'm not saying I like the casual approach, I'm a TBC-baby. Just stating facts that they can't make a game for both casuals and non-casuals and sadly most hardcore vanilla players grew up and don't have the time to invest in a hardcore game. New players nowadays are so used to QoL stuff from other games that it won't attract as many new members as the casual approach does.
---
I dislike BfA aswell. Just because of the poor class design tho.
---
I can’t decide either. I’m leaning towards Alliance but I love PVP and if it turns out Horde is way better at PVP in classic I’ll probably roll Horde.
---
level 1-10 next week same time but 3 hours earlier - they didnt get enough info due to all the login fuckery at the start
---
everyone with access to this one gets in
---
Everyone knows who coca cola is because they continue to spend millions year after year... Otherwise they would be like rc cola... Sure, everyone knows rc cola exists, but why would you ever get one over a coke. Coke is better. Advertisement says so.
---
Some people seem to think it's cross realm, it's astounding how people can understand so little and assume so much. Stupid people being stupid I suppose
---
Interesting perspective, but there is no 'truth' when it comes to what entertains people.
---
I mean tips didn't do too badly, especially considering perplexity is one of the best players of the rogue class hands down. Not a bad duel all in all.
---
Why are you worried about meeting a human that shares the same interests as you? Is everything OK? No one really cares about your purple armor.
---
The various soul link specs are mostly for dueling, which in battlegrounds usually means sitting on your arse by one of the bases and waiting for a rogue to jump you. He'll get a nasty surprise of course as you can easily dispatch him, but you can't do much else. 
---
Conflag is really fun in world pvp because you can blow people up really quick, but you have very few defenses against a rogue or warrior who jumps you. 
---
SM/ruin works perfectly fine in battlegrounds where you have a wealth of CC, peels and nuke damage. Your shadowbolts will hit like crazy, especially if you have a shadowpriest with you. You can use curse of tongues on casters, curse of exhaustion to peel, fear, death coil the flag carrier and so on. Especially as Alliance they are powerful because I'm fairly sure the only dispeller Horde have are priests, whereas Alliance has paladins. Curse of Exhaustion is really nice too and can only be removed by druids and mages, mages like usual worry only by themselves and you'll have a hard time finding one who wants to decurse the flag carrier, druids are rare. I've only seen my curses and dots dealt with by pretty serious premades. And that's on private servers where you would expect people know a thing or two about the game.
---
SM/ruin also works perfectly well in raids, especially on progression because you buff your group with stamina. DS will increase your damage by 2-3% at most, not enough to outweigh gear, skill, luck etc. It is better though I won't deny that.
---
Lastly, if you have any intentions to PvP you should really get engineering. The only other profession that give warlocks something unique is tailoring with Robe of the Void which is ludicrously expensive and not much better than Robe of Winter Night which everyone can get, and the Bloodvine set bonus of 2% crit which is really nice, makes the set BiS until T3. I wouldn't say it's necessary though unless you're in a hardcore guild (and that's fine btw, play however you want!).    
---
The other professions are not very useful. There's always someone in the guild who can make potions and enchants. Rather have engineering which just completely revamps your class in PvP and to a certain extent in PvE too. The rocket head alone will stun another player for 30(!!) seconds. That's long enough to eat/drink, grab a smoke, empty the poopsock and still charge up an allmighty soulfire crit in his face.
---
Blizzard didnt create great games because they listened to the fans.
---
Once you start listening to the fans it means you have problems.
---
Ok but that would make grouping with friends on other layers not work?
---
No quest helper eh?
---
The spell isn’t worth buying.
---
Imagine that the server you're playing on is a big, grassy field with lots of cows. Now imagine that there's an enclosure on this field where the cows roam about and graze peacefully. The enclosure is the layer, and the field is the server.
---
Now imagine that the farmer has so many cows that the original enclosure fills up and the cows have to go some place else. The farmer adds another enclosure so that the cows have some place to be.
---
That is essentially what layering is. Each layer is an enclosure on this imaginary field while the field is the server.
---
Back in vanilla i was horde. Now im going alliance to experience the game from their perspective. Im like 80% sure im going to be a human rogue.
---
/u/EsfandTV
---
Since I know you are active here and this thread isn't getting much attention maybe you could bring it up on stream or something to spread the word?
---
You don't say. I just wanted to point out, that Blizz makes a difference between using a legit duplication method or if you're abusing game mechanics.
---
I definitely agree with you, and if you read some of my most recent comments you'll see that. I only meant to point out that his point about Legion is super irrelevant
---
I know for a fact that this will be me too. I'm always unlucky with sharding or layering.
---
As I am from germany, I did not try to log in during the stress test in the middle of the night.  
---
But last evening I did and the servers were still there, so I played till level 5.  
---
It was still crowded but I had no problems logging in. I think because most of NA was still at work. ;-)
---
BUT during my session, there were a couple of global server messages (the yellow ones), where Blizzard employees told us they plan to make some tests with layering and how it behaves and we should not be suprised if strange stuff happens the next hour.  
---
After that I was thrown in a new layer a couple of times. Interestingly a couple of players overread the server messages and directly started to moan.  
---
So for everyone here again: It was a stresstest. They tested. After that they used the server to make some layer testing shenanigans. That does NOT mean, that you will be thrown constantly between different layers. Only a group invite will do that during your session.
---
If they stay with the limited approach and we get rid of that after a couple of weeks, I see no need for incense.
---
NO CHANGES! Actually, fuck that, I don't want to wait in line for hours because they respawn so slowly. I see this as a great change.
---
Wait !?
---
Are you the Grim guy (undead rogue) who made some of the best Vanilla Rogue PVP videos ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWNt\_8xcOZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWNt_8xcOZw) ) !?
---
We agree lol so idk why you are throwing a fit
---
ToC??
---
speak for yourself man. I played all of retail vanilla and have played it extensively the last ~3 years on private servers, it has not gotten old and tiresome for me, i absolutely love it.
---
I may have misread the Wowhead comments.
---
He's saying you wouldn't have to change your name if the merges are planned from the beginning because servers intended to be merged would share one naming pool.
---
Well, the world record 1-60 is 116 hours.. so at 3 hours a day playing the most efficient route possible to 60, it would still take six weeks.
---
And fact of the matter is, most of what makes wow classic isn't the hardcore levelling, so I'd imagine the average player is going to be coming in to 60 well over 200 hours played, taking months to get there.
---
I was hyped.  It was like experiencing launch day but without the stress because I knew it was all going to get wiped the following day.
---
Save it, my dude. Let the hype overflow.
---
&gt; negative stories just don't gain traction
---
i hope that at least old vanilla players wount be negative, we finally back into this great game, i cant imagine being salty over something that happen 14 years ago aswell.
---
That entirely depends on the skill of my group. I’ll be playing with most of my guild from vanilla so we likely will clear most encounters first try (barring gear checks). I fucking hate retail... I’m just not delusional about how “hard” classic is.
---
Only if you're swapping into groups on other layers more than once an hour. How many people are going to be doing that in the first few days of the server?
---
I haven't seen this level of false advertising since the case against The Never Ending Story.
---
for sure this is possible, I started several times on a new server during classic. You just have different goals than other players.
---
Go level/quest in a group... that’s the point of an mmorpg.
---
bro its the end of the world if a kid gets a few extra copper mines...
---
Why is the second option retarded?
---
The 1.12 client is crazy rough around the edges. Whenever I mess around on later versions it immediately jumps out to me how much smoother the game was in later versions.
---
Can't wait to play Classic as it was meant to be.
---
Classic is about the journey. Retail is about getting to max level asap and there the fun begins. So, yes, you should play it and you will have fun even if you never reach 60.
---
Have you ever tried the immersion add-on? I think they're working on a classic version. It's really cool.
---
Because once you take the first sip of that sweet sweet refreshing beverage, you're going to love it forever.
---
I was only raiding heroic casually at the time and our roster consisted of only 2 strength melees (a ret and me) the other guy got it 3(the first one was from LFR) times but every time he got it it warforged a bit higher than the last  so he couldn't even trade it to me
---
As an Orc, Durotar -&gt; UC -&gt; WPL and you can probably get down to the Chillwind Point area and go further down the road until there is an opening to make it to the river. Once you get to the river, no mobs between you &amp; Scholo.
---
Can agree. Tested is aswell and the spawn rate is WAY better than on pservers.
---
If
---
My mom played they game herself. She played a hunter and went through the classic grind herself.
---
She's 62 and thinks BfA sucks and wants "old WoW back."
---
She's happy for classic, won't be so happy she has to get her stuff back.
---
They probably figured that ''10 minute breath'' didn't sound as good
---
Yeah, it would be the queues that would be killer. Perhaps even worse than the first time. At least if I was in the game, I could run across the continent and get a couple levels with exploration XP and get some FPs.
---
It's my understanding that those addons were removed because it made the group finder much more difficult to use for someone without the addon, not because blizzard has taken a hard stance about being able to shard hop. That's what their public words were, at least. I am a cutting edge retail raider and enjoy the game very much, so it's definitely not me trying to hate on retail. They are just two different games at this point. Almost two different genres of game
---
Yea.
---
Lots of people freaking out because they saw Alpha or Beta players.  I'd bet money that those aren't actually separate servers, and rather they're different layers.
---
Just because they're listed as Realms in the Realm list to us, does not mean it's actually a separate realm.
---
People will always assume the worst though.  Even if they are other servers, there is probably a good reason for it, related to testing.
---
he's right, but of course mark is playing a female night elf......
---
I think it was Final Fantasy Tactics where Woman were better spell casters and Men were better with physical. I always thought it was nice flavor.
---
I respect your points. I worry about the community too - Reddit and forums are prime spots for bitching and the incentives seem to be to do so (as Blizz has been listening to bitching lately). I hope people will be happy after launch, but really, those who are happy will play the game and those who aren’t will come here to bitch. 
---
I’m going to be playing, even with sharding - which I was more on board with before my stress test experiences and this clip.
---
My concern in the above comment was that we can’t know blizz will fix this. We don’t know it’s a beta bug and not working as intended. That’s what worries me. Maybe they don’t need to elaborate on this (like I say, I’ll still play and so will most people) but we can’t respond to these concerns with “it’s beta, trust blizz to agree with our conception of layering and change it to that”
---
Layering is a beautiful magic majestic flawless solution. It simeotaneously allows you to be with your guild, friends, party, and also magically supports faction balance. The twitch video of somebody simply logging in and out to exploit mining? Fake News. Interdimensional parellel universes is the vanilla way.
---
They don't need to know. They can earmark merges to start with but they can put the merges into motion reactively. It's not like they have to lock the merge dates before release, just the same as they haven't given us a hard date on when layering will be gone.
---
I can verify it existed then and does work on live classicbeta at the moment. There's even an addon that does it for you https://willitclassic.com/view/8kI7vBtKGabX50sNAro8
---
&gt; soul link spec is probably universally the strongest PvP talent spec in the game
---
It really isn't. It's debatable whether it's even the best warlock PvP spec. It's strong in 1v1 and that's about it. There's a lot of sides to PvP and the spec only excels at one of them. The dot+tank playstyle is worthless in BGs and other forms of group PvP, and SL DPS is downright awful for the first half of vanilla. It takes a long time before there's enough spell power available to make the spec feel good even in 1v1. SM/Ruin is a much more well-rounded spec that can do well in all forms of PvP, and while it's more vulnerable to rogues and warriors, it's just a much more broadly useful PvP spec unless your sole ambition is to be a dueling god.
---
Classic is fine for casuals, even if it takes you forever to reach 60 guile’s will always run mc for bindings, priest item for benediction and hunter item for the staff and bow so even if AQ is out by the time you reach 60 you will still be able to do all of the older raids, plus people quit and join all the time so you’ll never be the least geared person, I say go for it
---
there should be something like this
---
but i sort of think what happens if you say in zone chat anyone want to do deadmines and someone asks for an invite but are on another layer
---
i think maybe just a 5min cooldown would be better
---
Most people didn't, after they went on air at blizzcon and explained it.
---
Where is that place ingame
---
This is amazingly insightful.  As a tank in a server-first raiding guild, I can vouch for all this.  We were good enough not to stumble too much in BWL, but all of this began to play out in Naxx.  Very well written.  Thanks.
---
Quest items are shared loot... so questing in a group (especially on ‘collect x items’) is a must ;)
---
How do you delete someone else's post?
---
Trouble with Flying, is it kinda brought in some negative gameplay, for instance, if you want to go somewhere, you no longer have to plan your route, instead you just mount up, hit auto run, point yourself in the right direction and go AFK for 2 minutes. Another problem is it trivialises questing and node gathering, with flying, you can just touch down for 2 seconds and kill/collect whatever you need, mount up again and disappear.
---
Same things I always listen to while gaming. A mix of game music and whatever else I feel like listening to at the time. Could be Joyner, or Logic, could be Pinkfloyd or Korn. Could be LoTR soundtrack. Its like a box of chocolates, never know what im going to listen to.
---
INB4 there was never an issue and they are pandering to players. You actually got played for a fool. The servers will crash day one anyways.
---
I was considering horde but then I realized that paladin is too stronk and should probably play alliance out of nostalgia since i played that in vanilla. Would really want an undead rogue and tauren warrior though. Guess I can't have it all.
---
finding mobs solo in the starting zone wasnt that bad when i played last night.
---
Just like she invests in MLMs and calls it a business
---
I don't agree at all. The quest text is garbage. The characters do not exist. Everything is a shopping list. The amount of dialogue and exposition is sparse. As a game it's obvious that text was a late edition to the game. It oozes none of the quality of games like Fallout, Planescape:Torment or other games that have a heavy text emphasis. I love playing those games specifically because they are well written with interesting characters and stories.
---
If people loved the content so much then why were power leveling guides so popular. They've always existed and it''s because many don't enjoy leveling but enjoy the end game content.
---
Classic, out of all the expansions, is the most convenient game for people in your situation. There's always enough things to do, and the things you do and complete do matter a lot, which makes it all worthwhile and fun.
---
That said, they can sometimes take quite a bit of time. Be it exploring, completing long quest chains, completing dungeons or even raiding.
---
If we're talking 1-2 hours per day, you *might* be able to do most parts of the game, but it would take a lot of months to get there. As for raiding, you probably wont be able to make the time and participation, but raiding isn't a requisite to fully enjoy WoW Classic.
---
Additionally, Classic will not have any real 'new' content, at least for the first ~2 or so years. You wont miss out on anything crucial. HOWEVER, WoW is also the type of game that's extremely rewarding if you put in unhealthy amounts of hours into it.
---
So, in conclusion, I think you'll enjoy Classic and its relative slow pace given your available time, but the  more you can play it, the better :D!
---
EU - PvP Server - Horde - Community (help me name it)  
---
Question: "Do we focus on PvP or PvE?"   
---
Answer: "Yes!"  
---
Hey,   
---
we are looking for folks who are going to dump lots of hours into ClassicWoW. The idea is to form a very competetive  community (guild) while having a good time together. We are not looking for pretentious Assholes. We are looking for decent human beings who love the game and got some social skills as well.   
---
We require you to  
---
.. have played WoW at some stage before.  
---
.. look up your stuff.  
---
.. help each other out.  
---
.. listen to advice/criticism.  
---
.. have a functional mic without heavy noises or stuff like that.  
---
It would be helpful if  you  
---
.. level to 60 within 10ish days.  
---
.. have some vanilla raiding and PvP experiences (private server or real vanilla).  
---
.. are already planning for Classic right now.  
---
We don't have a website, we don't have a name yet, we don't have a dkp system in place yet, make sure to contact me so YOU can take part in it and form the best community ever.
---
So, you are saying 5% difference of mob damage and health that would end up with 1 more drink every 20-30 minutes is 
---
&gt;much more difficult to level
---
right? And yeah, I played in tbc, while, elites and quest gain is nerfed after 2.3 (I don't remember which patch it was back when I played), regular mobs are the same. And your mind can't even wrap around the fact that even if lvling is different to a large degree, there is also another important variable - class with which you are lvling.
---
Hello guys! I was thinking about what a best choice of profession for Warlock?
---
For example I would like to raiding time to times so I take tailoring for gear, but what more or there is some other choices more profitable than this?
---
And if I take tailoring I still have 1 primary profession to choose, which one you recommend me?
---
Thank you guys &lt;3
---
Yeah that’s absolutely fair, towards the higher echelon of skill destruction if far and away better in BGS etc.
---
My comment was more tailored around the play style/skill of someone that even has to ask the question if that makes sense. And SL spec is simply one of the easiest and strongest specs to play.
---
With time Blizzard has forgotten what MMO means when they write story :)
---
We know that Warlocks are beasts when they get to the later tiers of gear.  It's been said that they are practically unbeatable 1v1 when they hit tier 3.  But what is world PvP like for a fresh 60 warlock without much, or any BiS?  Are they still really good?  Or do they really suffer at first and the main payoff comes much later in the progression?
---
&gt;I don’t want it.
---
found the guy that didnt spent 20 minutes standing around trying to tag a quest mob with 40 other people doing the same...
---
This shoul be forwarded to the developers. 
---
I know dynamic respawn is a controversial topic but if it was in at launch I don’t see a problem with it.
---
If it's anything like vanilla stats then warrior will lead by a large margin. I remember seeing pie charts and such back in the day with warrior vastly out numbering the other classes. Competing for 2nd place was rogues and mages being neck and neck. Druids being the least played class in the game.
---
&gt;It wasn't (as much of) a problem on private servers because people have to actively seek them out, and therefore a higher proportion of players are likely to be enthusiasts rather than casual tourists or retail people just dropping in to check it out, so the population drop off isn't as severe as something that is out in the open and only requires a retail sub.
---
It absolutely was a problem on the bigger private servers because even though they bumped the population cap to over 13k, that's like 5 vanilla servers btw, they still had thousands in queues, up to 50k on a particular one. This is 100% what will happen on day 1 classic without layering. I don't want to sit up all night just to watch a 50k queue slowly going down. On that private server it was so bad that you could wake up, put yourself in a queue, go to work/school, get home, eat and you're still in the queue. And god forbid if the server crashed then you can do it all over again.
---
a really high percentage of vanilla wow are mob part collection quests for which you are effectively punnished for playing in a group
---
&gt; it'll be gone after a small time anyway though, right?
---
Ask any retail player how much they trust Ion's word about anything...
---
Obviously xD it's just the screen shot included a headshot of all the races playable in in non vanilla wow (for reference, I know) and it was the first time I've seen a dranei pic in YEARS.  I played WoW from Vanilla to the end of Cataclysm.   I was a die hard alliance boi, but I just always hated the Draenei.
---
I thought they looked goofy, the crystal theme did nothing for me, their entire history was just about how everybody beat them up all the time, and I hated the Lore retcon that they weren't evil demons anymore (because Metzan literally forgot he had already given them an origin).
---
And then years later when we finally got Worgen, man it was such a perfect "monster race" for the alliance.  I absolutely loved it.  And anytime I got close to starting to like the Draenei, I remembered that the alliance was supposed to get Worgen in BC, but they scraped the idea for the Draenei instead.
---
I'm super hyped to go back to Vanilla wow, and I'm pretty glad there wont be any of those big blue doofuses clomping around Stormwind.
---
I'm still on the fence. From vanilla all the way up to BFA I played alliance. in BFA I started as horde. I'm torn between feeling nostalgic about vanilla days as an alliance character or seeing things from a new perspective as horde. Ultimately, it will come down to what my friends play and they are leaning towards Horde.
---
Nothing keeps you from playing the game as a casual, absolutely nothing. Crowded starting zones? Just wait a few days or even weeks or play on a low population server. Having to be the first in line for anything doesn't really fit with the mindset of playing a game casually at all. It seems more like those types of players want the real deal, but are not able or willing to go the extra mile anymore. Longer leveling / gearing etc., well, as a casual, you'll just get to enjoy all those things for longer. Where's the hurry?
---
If you can't invest the amount of time you would like to in a game due to your responsibilities in life, that's unfortunate, but changing the game to cater to you will just result in a BFA 2.0 and all the players who wanted vanilla WoW to come back will end up going back to private servers, until 10 years down the line and after a few "you think you do, but you don't"s, new devs will announce Classic Classic WoW to fuck it up all over again.
---
Sad that you chose to delete your reply so people couldn't see i wasn't arguing semantics.
---
Go Horde bro. Say no to soy.
---
It was renamed to  cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor and it gets capped back to 2 every session
---
    /console cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor 4
---
Yes, thats exactly what i had in Mind. 
---
Some Items also will be out of reach for Casuals. For example Edgemaster Handguards were around 1.5k Gold on private Servers, because People from "high-end"-Guilds had the Money for it.
---
People underestimate the Influence of this on the economy because on retail the last couple addons professions weren't that strong, while on Vanilla you'd make Alts just to have that Profession in your "portfolio"
---
Imagine that people get enjoyment out of different aspects of the game and that raiding has no relationship to quest errands. The game plays completely different in raid content.
---
So private servers are actually more difficult than real vanilla? Funny how people always bash them for being the opposite.
---
I'm not going to say there won't be assholes in Classic, caus there obviously will. But when you spend and hour and a half getting a group together and then running to the dungeon, you're gunna be a bit more patient with minor things. Wotlk onward had people leaving dungeons/kicking over a lot more minor stuff because the level of investment is so much lower.
---
This is my opinion as well. Can you hop layers? Sure. Is it an efficient use of your time? No. I don't think there will be more than a handful of layers on the most populous server. As for the economy, it should all be at the lower levels and it should come out in the wash. More people will be able to level steadily with layers, so there will be a bigger market for the additional materials.
---
Thanks for the input. Not that I don't believe you but do you have any proof that it worked that way back in vanilla? I just want to be sure. I found a couple of old threads on arenajunkies where they talk about it not being possible.
---
I grouped up with random people all the time. Got quests fairly easy that way. Everyone accepted. And god it felt so satisfying clearing an objective of a quest. I hope launch is gonna be the same way.
---
&gt; wildly optimistic and talking out of his ass
---
Sums up most of the people defending the current implementation of layering too. The amount of misinformation flying around is really disturbing.
---
When you bomb the bugs in the tunnel to Fankriss.. slideshow fps
---
Not a bad idea from a naming point of view. Terrible idea from the initial point of view: preventing full servers and empty servers. It might transform empty servers into medium ones, and high/full pop ones into...colossal disasters should two of them be merged.
---
Being able to tank a 5 with Voidwalker makes you a great warlock.
---
Remember the best stats in Vanilla : 50% Stam 50% Int is the best repartition. Gives you infinite mana with connexion and nice Spellpower.

For the rest, since you're mostly support until AQ, be a pvp god, learn to micro fel hunter, always have a full shard bag.

Your nice post literally brought a tear to my eye. Thank you.

Horde side looks like its gonna be. Shamans are popular and undead warlocks. Hunters are less popular in horde because of night elves.
---
There are conflicting comments on Wowhead regarding this.  The most upvoted comments say that it does stack with furor as of patch 2.1.1 which would coincide with people's memory on the topic.
---
In addition here is a 2008 ownedcore article talking about combining this with the furor talent, so it should work on classic and if it does not it is a bug.

He does know that it blocks crit and crush, people have been telling him in the stream for days. That’s part of why his response in SM arm was annoying, he was being facetious.
---
 I was there spamming it at him in chat along with many others in stream, all throughout the week since he started tanking, and you can find him verbally reading out and responding to that point in earlier VODs. I believe SFK and SM GY. His response was that the mobs he was fighting were same level and so only had like a 5% crit chance and no crush chance. 
---
This was a fair point at the time, but when that didn’t apply in SM arm he just went back to pretending like the normal shield block value on normal attacks is the point of shield block - which it’s not.
---
I honestly doubt it will be so much trouble this time around. After all, stuff is quite well known and especially people who raided recently in WoW retail should be able to tackle BWL easily, as it is mechanically less complicated than heroic raids.
---
What does it do?
---
I have to disagree. In modern WoW you have a lot more viable ways to actually level. You can level by just gathering stuff or doing pet battles for example.
---
&gt; It's all about instant gratification, and I miss having to work my ass off for X or not having a sign-posted route from 1 - 120 I feel obligated to follow.
---
With the modern level scaling I don't think that's the case anymore. You're much more free to choose where you want to level and can play through zones even with heirloom gear and don't outlevel it in the middle of the main quest line of the zone.
---
Yes it's much easier to get to max level than it was in Classic. But the "play the game however you want" approach is still there and I'd argue even bigger than in Classic.
---
!RemindMe 96 days /Console commands classic wow

Blizzard has 15 years of subscriber data.. They know what works and what doesn't.. all they have to do is follow the tried and tested methods that raked in the most subs (WOTLK BTW). Follow the money like any other business.
---
tried /stopattack macro and it fixes this issue, thanks.
---
I'm actually planning to be one of the first level 60s on the server. I'm in the process of perfecting my speed leveling route. Ty all for the info
---
I chose stormwind, but I spent the most time in ironforge. Hard to decide between the two.
---
id love to play horde but stormwind is home , IF second after that
---
This was back in a time of hyperbole, but also before a time when "literal" didn't meant "not actually literal", so maybe not.
---
except vanilla is an amazing game for casuals and non casuals, so i guess they already made it right the first time eh
---
Why would you need anything other than live to win???
---
Sad I can't upvote this post twice. Spot on.
---
Sat on the dock with one other person as the server came down.
---
Classic didn't even release yet, all the phases they planned take at least 2 years, why does everyone care what will happen after?
---
This was the original plan. First few weeks, starter zones only. This made _perfect sense_, because at level 20-30 (days worth of leveling) all the tourists will have quit anyway, so the rest of us should get the full experience. 
---
But Blizzard is convinced that seeing players phase as they enter a new zone (which happens anyway with capital cities, apparently!) for the first two days of leveling is apparently more jarring than not being able to see all the people you play with for the remaining two months of phase 1.
---
I don’t think this was anything to do with Activision, the merger resulted the Activision being renamed to Activision Blizzard. This shows just how much weight blizzard has when it comes to its own decisions making. Blizzard have just made some poor choices is recent years, they seem to be getting back on track now though.
---
Despite warlocks and paladins not having to directly "buy their mounts" they still require a tremendous amount of effort and materials to get. Some may view it easier to just get the gold and be done with it.
---
You're not wrong, entertainment is subjective.. But not all forms of entertainment posses the same level of engagement. I think what Jordan is saying here is that the level of engagement in games, such as dark souls, creates for an entertainment experience that is far more rewarding and fulfilling than a game that doesn't challenge you. There are people that are definitely entertained by BFA, but it's hard to imagine those people experiencing a similar level of fulfillment that someone may experience when playing Classic... It's not impossible, and may vary person to person, but I don't think modern wow does a good job at creating difficult, entertaining experiences that feel genuinely rewarding and satisfying.
---
Read their comment again.
---
2h Fury was more than viable, I wouldn't sweat that.
---
1, 2, and 3 always bothered me the most. I’m glad they aren’t around to ruin Horde purity this time!!!
---
I think that the night elves are not that far into Feralas , they really only have the island -   most of it is Ogre-land and center-right part is tauren?
---
I wish they would just stop adjusting things.
---
It would be easy to simply have server groups that share a name pool in preparation for possible future merges.
---
Your comment doesn't really address why server merges are a bad idea. They don't need to know how many players will be playing after 2 months because they can trigger the merges reactively (just the same as they can't give us a hard date on when layering will be gone). Avoiding dead servers is precisely the intention of merging, so I'm not sure what the relevance is supposed to be of the rest of your comment.
---
You complain that people here aren’t constructive while you throw around insults. Ok. 
---
On launch with layering these mega servers are going to be producing enough high level resources for 10-12k players, half or more of whom will never reach 60. Assuming the population eventually stabilized at 3-5k per server by the time layering ends, the economy is going to be giga-fucked for a year minimum. Guilds are going to have flasks on everyone in the raid and the already trivial content will be even more trivial. Players relying on gathering professions to raise gold will find its not worth the time. Those who did get ahead will be ahead permanently. 
---
That is the objective issue with layering. I understand the problems it’s trying to solve, but you have to be honest about the drawbacks too. If layering were used but not applied to 50+ zones the damage to the economy would be mitigated by 80-90 percent.
---
That is a very good point!  It’s very possible some people got in for an hour or two before the bulk of the users were let in, so they never got to experience trying to find Young Nightsaber collars when the starting areas were truly overloaded.  To those lucky few, the currently tuning might seem adequate. :-)
---
it was a good test of the login servers. hopefully they are more resistant to ddos attacks compared to vanilla or tbc   
---
and i just realised, we will have to keep those to things separate now instead of interchangeable as classic is not vanilla
---
Buddy of mine mentioned that Majordomo spawned on our layer, and he has an ability that teleport people into fire in MC. So that's what it was. Too funny.
---
Im sure that warlock will be super popular on horde, because of 16 debuff limit, knowing that warlock is op in pvp late game, undead warlock is cool and because people are scared to roll alliance warlock because of the will of the forsaken. PPl are most definately playing more warlock than back in vanilla.
---
How do Warlocks compare to Hunters in soloing end game content? Ex: world bosses, BGs, making gold, etc. Class fantasy is also important to me. 2004 player excited to return home!

&gt;In my experience it was Princess Huhuran that mercilessly destroyed guilds.

Why, tho? That boss was very easy as soon as everyone got enough resist gear and that resist gear was important should be clear for everyone who cleared MC and BWL at that point.

technically that was put into the game during Legion
---
1. Always carry 25 soul shards on you and replenish while grouping. One healthstone --&gt; one soulshard for everyone in your 5-man, 10-man.
---
2. Until DeathCoil (instant-cast, 3-second horror effect) you're a sitting duck while leveling. Take **engineering** or buy swiftness/free action potions. The stun from bombs, rocket boots, Swiftness Potions, anything really, will help you deal with open-world pvp.
---
3. At 60, you'll use your **imp** 75+% of the time in groups for the Health Buff. (It stacks with Priest Fortitude.) 5-man groups might be a bit disappointed if you  say you can't because of your demonology spec.
---
4. You an solo basically **anything** if it can be feared. Also, once you get Curse of Exhaustion, you can kite basically any elite as long as they don't leash   
---
back to their spawn point.
---
5. Once you get your epic mount quest, the parts to summon the final quest in Dire Maul are worth \~250g or more. You can charge warlocks for you to start the quest event in Dire Maul, which saves them gold.
---
6. Curse of Recklessness reduces enemy armor, but it ALSO makes them fear immune. You **can semi-safely fear enemies in dungeons** if you pay close attention and put CoR on them when they get to close to other mobs. Right before the mob comes back to kill you, put another curse on it and Fear will resume.
---
7. Tailors can make level \~40 shadow damage gear called Shadoweave. At about level \~50 there's a Felcloth set.
---
8. If you put Curse of Tongues on an NPC that /yells (like a boss fight or something scripted) he will speak in Demonic gibberish.
---
9. Soulfire is a hilarious ability that does a lot of damage in PVP if you can actually cast it.
---
10. Engineering again. If you plan to PVP, definitely get it. The parachute capes let you jump off buildings/cliffs in AB/WSG. The Net gun is OP etc etc
---
11. You would be shocked what demons you can cast Enslave Demon on. (Always use Curse of Shadows first to weaken them). I've enslaved 40-man outdoor raid mobs near Lord Kazzak.
---
12. Once you're in blues you can solo the "back door" of DM east. Some people complete a portion of the Warlock epic quest this way. Most of the packs of 3-4 are demons or elementals so you can banish--&gt;enslave an elite--&gt;kill the 3rd one.  
---
13. First Aid is particularly powerful since you regularly convert HP --&gt; Mana

Just because he has 'grim' in his username doesn't mean he's *the* Grim from Vanilla. The original Grim played on Al'Akir (EU) and I believe he was German. Well, at least he loved his Rammstein, lol.
---
Either way, I'm sure Grim inspired literally half the Rogue population, and the other half being inspired by Mute and Kishkumen (World of Roguecraft).
---
Fucking legends.
---
So as a hardcore player you are ok with a 5 button rotation? LFR? LFD? Those are the things they changed for casuals, they made the game more approachable and you can do stuff within 30mins. While you can still push high M+ and mythic raids as a non-casual. Lvling speed or gearing speed is pretty much irrelevant, except for newcomers.

I'm in my 30s and just found out about Asmongold. I think he's pretty entertaining and his arrogance is a large part of it. But I'm also 90% sure it's a bit. This becomes pretty clear the more you watch.
---
It is indeed a really nice thing but you shouldnt choose your class on mount cost, and I played at the time.
---
There will be lots of frustrated PvE warlocks since damage isnt really their thing, people picking it for PvP will have tons of fun though. And on Paladins, well you cant go wrong with paladin. Pain to level, but rewarding in every way at 60.
---
brutal, poor kid. He needs instant gratification and content frontloaded for him, he cant play real WoW
---
It certainly was strange, although they quickly became my favorite alliance race and my Draenei warrior has my second highest /played.
---
Everyone should play Classic. Simple fact.
---
I desire a wombat of slaying.

I really enjoy this dudes twitch, and his appearances on Countdown to Classic. Thanks for sharing!
---
It’s pretty easy to complete at 35-38, his group composition is great, every group member is heavily twinkled with all blues close to BiS and enchants, they used full consumables, and as far as I’m aware those players had all been playing for over a decade. I know asmon and esfand played since vanilla.
---
Casual groups are still going to wipe from dumb mistakes at the appropriate level.
---
I'm not sure if I agree. A casual is someone who can't spend x hours a day to invest in a game. So they basicly can't do dungeons or raids in Vanilla. So yeah they have the RPG of the game and PvP.
---
&gt; With flying, you can just touch down for 2 seconds, kill/collect whatever you need and leave.
---
Oh no. The horror.
---
How would you hop into each layer doing this method without being crazy lucky? If my understanding is right you can only switch layers if you happen to log into a new one as its created. 
---
or maybe being invited by a friend to another layer, which sounds like you'd have to be lucky to even set up/be time consuming
---
I can understand being skilled enough to pull this off, but won't people have a hard time DPSing?
---
I started classic back in the day level 60 dwarf warrior. Then been horde since burning crusade I may switch back in classic
---
I really really hope not. It will only be hell for the first week or two. It just starts to feel like watering down the game when these kinds of changes are posed.

---
It's for preventing servers dying when tourists leave, not an alternative to sharding, which aims to keep a particular area playable when lots of people want to play there.
---
I can accept layers because I know without it the people who will still be playing 3 months in wont be spread over 20 dead servers.
---
Phasing could actually be counterproductive for long term populations because without it BFA players might just give up and jump back in bfa at launch with the intention of checking it out later once the servers calm down.
---
Did someone hurt you?
---
Eve is on a league of its own, but even amongst mmos it’s not for everyone... but yeah, I don’t know if any game where the community (the players) matters as much.
---
&gt;  no quest helper,
---
Already an addon for that
---
The raids are plenty hard for the middle guilds. Even BWL can be a challenge for a while. Not every guild will kill C'thun, definitely not every guild will kill KT. It requires quite a lot of dedication to kill these bosses and they are harder than you may think.
---
I thought weapon skill mattered, but from the max state.  For example, a level 30 fighting a level 40, it would be 150 vs. 200 regardless of your current skill with the weapon.
---
With all the commands posted here I wonder if we can look forward to an "enhanced interface options" addon
---
Not when a massive majority of that population is level &lt;20 tourists who never actually interact with the economy in the first place. No impact for them, massive impact for higher levels.
---
That's how I remember it in Vanilla.
---
Why would I be okay with that? A game that gets "layered" into different difficulties to cater to everyone for maximum casual money is shit. Nothing should be changed for casual players that the original game didn't already have.
---
Not a huge fan of this whole classic buzz, but I have to admit that this is one of the few things that was truly way better in classic.
---
This is also further enhanced by the fact that up until Naxx you don't even fight Characters of the original games (I think) while you were killing characters left and right since then.
---
engineering fills in a lot of the gaps in the class. If you plan to PVP at all engineering is wonderful.
---
I leveled engineering while I leveled, which made it a much more tolerable experience for me. Idk if I'd recommend that though, since it's time-consuming/expensive.
---
Stick to the same toon and you will be able to. You wont do AQ40 and Naxx but everything else you should be able to make it.
---
I mean this really has almost no value.  Folks were making human characters so they see the GMs put on a show, that's going to skew the data badly.
---
But the argument was farming mats at end game. Not first few days.
---
More so this problem that wasn't in vanilla: A large chunk of people (who just want to go see what the game looks/feels like before they go back to their modern game) who artificially inflate server populations and then leave empty realms behind them.
---
According to the beta, entering a city can also change your layer.
---
A new layer being created or destroyed can also change your layer, obviously.
---
It's just a streamer that *want's* them to add it. Newsflash - they said they wouldn't mess with that, deal with it.
---
It’s actually totally possible. At the start of bfa sodapoppin had a raid of 40 monks, and chain spammed ring of piece on a single player for over 30 minutes. They didn’t kill them, just spammed 3 ring of pieces in a triangle around the player not letting them move for a long ass time.
---
If that’s not grieffing idk what is

I think this is what most people defending this flawed implementation think.
---
Fantastic explanation
---
Also the priest is specced as holy right? usualy priests heal on shadow spec, since its  the best for leveling but it gets the job done
---
Edgemasters/Alcor’s etc. yes normal players will not be able to compete with the gold held by day 1 no-lifers and their ability to farm gold will be decreased by low materials prices. 
---
There will also be a cascade effect in PvP because no-lifers will have their epic mounts almost immediately and regular players will have a decreased ability to farm gold. There will also be more consumables used in PvP which could change matchups.
---
Gold selling will be more tempting/lucrative.

Most of us did. There were more of us upstairs dancing on top of the main structure.

Just playing on whatever my friends play on. Luckily I dont have to make the choice.

Not only that, but it also relies on having a huge international server where there are no real off times.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it has been stated that layering won't be in any area that you could get Devilsaur leather, right?
---
"It's just beta" doesn't work with Blizzard. Never has. Point out the flaws early and _loudly_ or nothing happens.
---
Agreed, but they did. Sadly the old expacs weren't casual friendly.
---
Just add a debuff, that you cannot switch layers for 5 minutes after mining a node/picking an herb. Make it a visible buff so all the \#nochanges nerds freak out about it.
---
at the time in 2005 i knew plenty of "casuals" who played only a few hours a week, and they got along with their dungeons and raids just fine. stop being hyperbolic about vanilla commitment requirements.
---
Just play! The majority of people will give up between level 15-20 anyway, if that happens to be you too - due to IRL commitments or whatever else - there is nothing wrong with that.

Do you actually think players spend the same amount of time at every level all the way up to 60? Have you even played this game, even on retail??

I met a nice Ukrainian and a nice Canadian who wanted to make a party with me. We ran around Deathknell for a bit before I buggered off to Brill to log out until sometime in August. Everyone was pretty cordial except for a few naysayers about Classic hype dying sometime in September. I can't say they'll be wrong, but it also doesn't matter. Not worried about other people.
---
If the respawns are slightly higher for the starter zones it’s a good thing. But honestly it wasn’t that bad on the stress test. Got out of the starter zone in like 45-50 minutes, only 15 minutes longer than usual.  Not terrible.
---
That was the only aspect of them I hated.
---
I doubt it. More likely is that they release TBC or they make new servers with custom content. You can't really add more content after Naxx because by that time you are so crazy overpowered it just wouldn't work.
---
!RemindMe 96 days sorry Mr bot
---
Because they hope that Blizzard will start developing classic further instead.
---
Yeah 264 is rather decent. To those saying it will be faster this time around, well, yeah. But not that much faster. I just recently leveled a rogue to 60 in 7? Days I think it was. Or 8. Either way, close to 200 hours. Yeah it's not WR-pace but a rogue is also not a hunter.   
---
200 hours is a quick, focused on levelling kind of time. It took me about 2 months to achieve, and it's definitely semi-hardcore (~3 hours everyday, 5-6 on weekends, you'll hit 200h at exactly 2 months).  
---
If you're thinking casual, 3-4 months to  60 is much more like it.
---
It's just not true that a casual player can't do dungeons or raids in Vanilla.
---
It's possible to choose several answers.
---
New to Vanilla, this looks amazing.  Saved!
---
For me transmog is one of the reasons I stopped playing wow. In classic you could easily see someone's accomplishment by the gear they wore, and if fashion was important then well make the tough choice of looks vs. Function. Gear mattered in older expansions, it's not interesting anymore if the only thing that matters is the gear score.
---
Yeah from classic beta yesterday , just removed ui and max graphic :)
---
queues is a good point, they could easily alter what keeps that info into also holding the layer number. Would be an easy way for them to go about fixing it by tying the two together.
---
Oh good creeper failed dev Mark Kern is back!
---
Man did you even watch the video.  He is a developer and he thinks its for sure a bug
---
Imagine, you are max level, want to run a dungeon, but have none online in your friendslist or guild that wants to do a dungeon with you. How long does/did it take to make a group and complete said dungeon? Does all of that happen within 1 hour?
---
I hope at least one is a bit more EU friendly.  I could only try a couple of times to get on because it was midnight in the UK and I had work the next day.
---
I started early vanilla and didn't hit level cap until mid-TBC. I hated questing with an absolute passion, and so 99% of my game time was spent actively avoiding it and doing dumb shit.
---
Did you watch the video?
---
Pretty sure in Classic it’s only 300% of normal breath time iirc
---
I think he means that area
---
I thought he was hard to watch and not for you.
---
yes
---
Hi, /u/coatsman98
---
Op didn’t finish leveling to 5 and cut out his character frame out of shame.
---
No those are 5 int 5 spirit green shoulder from  shadow fang keep quest . I was prety hyped :)
---
Wow. This is the first practical way to implement layers that I’ve seen. I exploited sharding tons on retail and was worried, and this would legit fix pretty much every issue I have with it
---
Man no one watched the video. Or know who mark kern is
---
Lvl 1 druids run out on mana before kill lvl 1 mob on p servers, beta they did not. At least on northdale
---
You stupid or just pretend? People across layers share names. Which is the same as X number of non layered servers to share names before they are merged.
---
8 boar livers.
---
Yeah they’re mostly specced appropriately for dungeons rather than levelling too, everyone respecced at 30
---
&gt;A good compromise to the issue is a 20-30m cd before you can change layer again.
---
so then you can't play with your friends on your server if you have cd and they are in another layer? seems shitty as well
---
IDK how to properly link things. This is from U/SockofBadKarma. This changed my mind. Maybe it will change yours.

"Lok'tar Ogar, brother!

Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal efficiency. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job done. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking survive, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara and Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! For the Horde!"
---
In this one case, yeah. There's a video comparing a bunch of different mobs
---
Windfury bro! As a caster though I'm 100% with the pallies.
---
I find it incredible how so many of the ideas that were implemented in cata and later are actually from this period.
---
Got a great memory being like 13 and exploring the Burning Steppes as a level 15ish gnome mage. Some level 60 asked me wtf I was doing, I said adventuring, he just said “cool” and asked to join and we made it all the way up to Loch Moran.
---
Fuck I miss those days.
---
Let's say I have 1 hour a day I can play wow. Tell me how I can make a dungeon group, run there and complete it. Let alone form a raid. Nowadays you just queue up and get in a dung/LFR within 15mins and complete it within 40mins
---
I disagree on that last point of yours though. The game was so much more than just raiding. And casually raiding Molten Core, ZG, AQ20 and even a bit of BWL did happen.
---
Different generation. My parents also hate gaming and think it's waste of time. Thanks to my mom, I actually got into gaming because we got Win98 PC when I was just 6 years old.
---
Lmao I love this team, team classic wow blizzard is gaining my trust back
---
Listening to fans is how we got retail. 
---
Most good games are good because a company had a vision and philosophy and they stuck to it.
---
Thanks for saying it
---
Imo it's worth leveling since you wont have to spend money on your 40 mount anyway.
---
Because you have interaction between the layers, they are not impenetrable walls like different servers are.
---
Hopefully a final beta build won't be too far off what gets released. So the add-ons should transfer over without too much issue. Just save the config files for them and make sure the character names line up or change them to do so
---
Hi, /u/Ladaric
---
Im playing 84 hours in the first week.
---
This is such a zoomer post.
---
There is still interaction and movement between layers, unlike different servers.
---
so you make a date with your casual like minded friends to do dungeons or raids at specific time. tadaaaaa.
---
voidwalkers have a decent amount of threat gen. I believe the idea is to have the VW tank a mob, some CC on another mob/s in the pull and everyone jumps on and blows up the last one. By the time the first one is done, the voidwalker should have a decent threat level to sustain some DPS against its target.
---
We did this a few times in LBRS when we'd have a tank DC or have to leave. Finishing out the instance for a Ony key instead of having to re-do the whole thing was awesome with a great warlock.
---
It should be, the quest rewards we're bis for many 29 think classes.
---
Casual = 1 hour a day to x hours a day. Not necessarily someone not putting effort into getting BiS.
---
Lol
---
Legions approach to story telling does not work in whats meant to be an MMO, everyone is the leader of their class and everyone runs around with iconic lore weapons just for doing the intro quests. It was insulting to anyone who isn't braindead.
---
*was
---
This.  So much this.  The final straw for me was when they gave everyone Ashbringer.  Oh!  You're the Ashbringer.  Everyone's the Ashbringer.  It ruined it for me.
---
I usually pop trinkets and spam prayer of healing on group. Then just spot heal tanks and other dps with max rank greater heal. Can get some crazy hps by doing that.
---
or buying it in a physical copy.
---
Lol, i coudn't log in in the first hours, I got constantly disconnected. But I managed to login in the last hours and it's worthy it. Tirisfal Glades was overcrowded, it was impossible to do the first quests alone, so I grinded the spiders and bats until max level. The interaction with players was the most fun I had ingame since a long time. Can't wait to Classic launch.
---
&gt;Stress test  
---
&gt;People complain about server/login/performance issues
---
You got to be kidding me. Are these dense people seriously going to be the ones playing Classic?
---
Thunder Bluff&gt;Darnassus&gt;Stormwind&gt;Undercity&gt;Ironforge&gt;Orgrimmar
---
That's a joke right? You think that no one would notice several thousand new people 6 months after the server starts?
---
!remindme 3 months
---
What if said person doesn't care for the social aspect and doesn't have friends or a guild? It's just a fact that Classic wasn't that casual friendly
---
YOU HAVE AWAKENED ME TOO SOON, EXECUTUS!
---
Imagine if classic indeed progresses and there's no vanilla/tbc servers anymore and we're in the same position again of petitioning and crying for vanilla lol
---
Instead of the default quest UI it replaces it with a box in the center of the screen where the text writes itself out paragraph by paragraph and it advances slower. You can speed it up by hitting space. Makes it feel like a more RPG style quest
---
"Who cares if arcane crystals and black lotus are worth about the same as copper ore, a year after Naxxramas is on farm their prices will stabilize with the drop in population."
---
It's not just that, it's the fact that the rogue who just ganked you that you want to fuck right back up is now gone in the multiverse, never to be seen again.
---
You're stood outside of orgrimmar wanting to duel but there's fuckall people there for you
---
Implementing this piece of shit IS the long term issue, since it's evolved from "Just starter zones first few days" to "Covers all zones, lasts phase 1", it's not at all a big step to go "Layering makes player experience better, doesn't go anywhere" and that's what we're fighting tooth and fucking nail to stop.
---
ActBlizz will take the whole arm if you offer them the hand.
---
it sucks slightly
---
i really want to level with a quest helper of some sort but i highly doubt a good one will exist
---
well i doubt any type of quest helper will exist that helps after level 30
---
"I live in reddit because I'm an anti-social dolt"
---
Posts on reddit daily. Okay sure.
---
Very sound advice. There will be a huge adjustment to a world with less need to do dailies and mission tables and all that. You'll have some prof cooldowns and that's about it. The rest is gravy. 
---
*All you got to do is make out outta here (Retail) and it's all gravy. Every day the rest of your (Classic) life, GRAVY!*
---
I see only three possibilities:
---
1. hope for beta access and set it there.
---
2. copy the settings of a player who has already prepared it (Joana maybe)
---
Prioritize the settings.
---
for me it will probably be the third variant. So I will set up the first addon, then wait until a downtime comes (wait for questmob / flight time), then the next addons. I repeat this until everything is set up correctly. the defaultUI has to do it until then.
---
(min max crowd) "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
First of all, if you have 1 hour per day, then you'll have more than a full year worth of leveling in front of you, assuming that you really play 1 hour per day every day, which doesn't seem realistic. So clearly this type of "casual" that you are talking about does more seem like someone who plays Bejewelled on their phone.
---
I think we have completely different views of what a casual gamer is.
---
3/10 bait
---
The way they've described it, your wpvp example should never happen. Layering should never automatically switch someone to an empty layer from a full one. It fills one up and once it's full, it starts filling up a new one. If they start to empty, they can merge layers, which should be the only time you'd switch layers without being invited by someone in another layer.
---
Clearly something is wrong from the video. It could be a bug, or could be the expected result of them fiddling with settings during the test. But unless they're mischaracterizing layering, I don't think the issues you're worried about are particularly likely to happen.
---
 **Swedish raiding guild &lt;Sublime&gt; EU Horde** recruiting for classic
---
**Who are we and what are our vision?**
---
Sublime are a bunch of players that played together since the release of World of Warcraft and cleared pretty much every content the game has offered us during those years. Some players has left us and new players has joined however the “Sublime-spirit” has always been the same. We reunite now in Classic for the nostalgia and clear all the content once again!
---
**Who are you and what do we want from you?**
---
It doesn’t matter if you are a new raider or you already have killed Nefarian 1000 times, we welcome everyone! What we in Sublime promote the most is that you are open minded, willing to learn the game and game mechanics and motivated to perform during raidtimes
---
Our goal in Classic is to clear all the 40man content without having to put excessive time on it, we understand that there are family, work and school that sometimes need the priority instead. Our primary raiddays will be Wednesday and Thursday 19.00-22.00. The rest of the week you are free to do whatever pleases you.
---
**Lootsystem**
---
We promote active raiders! Even if its a progressraid or a farmraid. As lootsystem we will be using a modified version of Suicide Kings which encourage the raider to show up on every raid. We wont force you to pass on gear cause it fits better for another class, however some exceptions will be needed to (like mainspecc goes before offspecc, and some items will have Tankprio).
---
Even though your not interested of raiding there is always a spot in Sublime. We have alot of players that enjoys doing dungeons, PvP or 20man raiding.
---
If you think Sublime is a perfect fit for you, please send your application [Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-bl-HqMXAYAvaqE4mvgvPeAWoNpgpRyercP4uzVYEuIDe9g/viewform?usp=sf_link)
---
If you have any questions please join our: [Discord](https://discord.gg/yv4kpRV)
---
Night Elves have one.  It is the Ban'ethil Barrow Dens.
---
Yes, yes it does.
---
It was a shit post. BFA is more than likely still pulling in more players than any other MMO, and there are people who enjoy playing it. More power on them if they do. I think that WoW at it's worst is better than most games. 
---
I doubt given the community outlook of it being a very poor expansion and near the half way/tail end of it that it's getting a whole lot of people buying it though.
---
Because maybe it is difucult for your high IQ to get that 6 is just an example number. 
---
Or maybe the idea of layers is to accommodate the tourist so after the initial influx the servers to be left with healthy pop (close to max server concurrent players). Just maybe the idea that one layer will be close to one server comes from the simple fact that one server worth of population does not need layering :)
---
the only things hard on raids at vanilla is managing the guild.   
---
Getting the roster full, scheduling, loot distribution, getting a trusty guild bank.  
---
the pve by himsef is quite easy, the true challenge is not having your 40 crybabies guildies drama destroying your guild.
---
Cry more you fucking baby
---
Yeah it wasn’t bad after that initial launch period which is the issue he is referring to.
---
27 min and 4 s [https://imgur.com/a/NLjMtB1](https://imgur.com/a/NLjMtB1) usually landed around 35 min. could probably get it down to 20 min if you get a good layer but considering how it looked during stresstest i highly doubt that.
---
I “only” got to 6
---
Did every starting zone twice, ran an Orc to UD starting, ran and UD to Orc starting zone and a Troll to Tauren starting zone
---
Running an Orc to UD starting zone only took 15 mins, so it’s no big deal at all if you wanna lvl in another zone, at least if the zone you run to have a trainer for the class you are
---
Pretty much what everybody has said, just get invited to groups and leave afterwards. Also if you gather a considerable amount of mats, save them for when layering is finally turned off, I would expect prices to go up then.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "BRING THE RAIN"
---
Which means leveling fast is valid too
---
People complain about 1-button rotations, but that's only really a problem in raids, where everyone is specialized anyway.  The rest of the game, you use far more of your class.
---
I did get ganked a few time questing there yesterday hehe
---
Bro this is why I stopped playing GW2. Literally every dungeon had some obscure glitchy skip that let you bypass most of the dungeon. If you didn’t want to do it then you were wasting time instead of just enjoying the game
---
Bore off you utter egg
---
On beta right now, you can change layer randomly by moving into a new zone, happened all the time yesterday, this is probably a bug or something they are testing, but it is happening.
---
Mark Kern is the original designer of WoW and he if anyone would know what is true vanilla or not. Having long respawns in the starting zones would be the real change, not the other way around.
---
Did I say they'd remember it forever? No.
---
But what they will remember is the good tank / the good healer, add them to friends, and be willing to play with them again the next time. That was an almost daily occurence for me in vanilla wow, and it was a great place to make new friends and work together in game. Hell, I made a few IRL friends from doing that, and we still talk occasionally. That's over 10 years ago. 
---
If you continue treating Classic WoW like retail where you just speed through everything, ignore everyone, and never talk, you're probably going to be shunned and not invited much. Go have fun with your groups instead of acting like bots.
---
That's actually really cool, i will definitely try it out!
---
Remind Me! 96 days "do this"
---
Ret Prio... so Esfand...
---
Sadly i didnt get to try this, i kept getting ported back so i decieded to do the best i could with questing and killing.
---
you ask a guildie competing in the brawl to invite you
---
Cant wait to ask my guildy for an invite after I get ganked so I go to a different layer. 
---
True vanilla experience.
---
Casual is anyone who doesn't commit/invest a lot into a game. Atm retail sadly offers them something to do. Which Classic didn't. Once again I'm not saying I like this, but that's how they get more people into the game.
---
It's just a big shard, and seems exploitable.  Still run into the same problems that you can log out and log back in and suddenly see different people.
---
I edited my post with the link to a short [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/WealthyCuriousAardvarkAMPTropPunch) of me testing it out.
---
If you have any other questions or want something tested, I'll be glad to help.
---
They definitely need to stop being led by sales and marketing. Vanilla was a dev-led thing. The company now is run by MBAs and lawyers.
---
TBC is probably the least likely option. Nobody wants it and it would be an insane amount of work for Blizz as opposed to new content.
---
Just because something is permitted, doesn't mean that it should be.  
---
You are unable to provide a single upside to multi-boxing that doesn't benefit you at the expense of the server. On a small scale, its not really a big deal, but what happens when dozens of people are multi-box farming?   
---
Multi-boxing hurts:
---
* The economy: inflation, item devaluation, etc.
---
* The community: elite quest? Just do it yourself. No need to get help / meet people.
---
* wPvP: extremely lopsided encounters. Farm spots will be easily overrun by multi-boxers.  
---
In the end, you're gonna do what you're gonna do but its still scummy.
---
For launch me and my mate will duo level as Lock Warrior, we want to do an "old school" LAN. 
---
Are we able to get to level 18 (for dead mines) in our first 12 Hour session?
---
It’s crazy to me when I listen to people like Asmongold say “My guild will be 60 by the first week and the 2nd week we will be running Molten Core” like bro...just enjoy the journey. The 1-60 grind is a whole other game in itself, and tbh, my favorite part of the game. Why rush to the endgame?
---
Delusional retail players are going to get their ass handed to them day 1 of Classic, and I'm gonna be laughing at you.
---
Grouping is the key to victory, focus on killing quest.
---
Imagine having all of the benefits streamers get in game such as free shit from their viewers, an easy time getting groups together to help them out with quests they need to do, preferential treatment when it comes to beta access, guaranteed items already promised to them (such as guaranteed first hand of ragnaros for many streamers). Not to mention their irl monetary gain from playing a video game... and then crying when theres one negative to streaming and everything doesn’t work out for them 100% of the time. Stream sniping is part of streaming, don’t complain about it.
---
&gt;	Your realm cluster solution sounds like it is exactly the same as layering but you’re banning groups/guilds from grouping through clusters.
---
Right. Otherwise known as different servers that, if needed, might one day merge. 
---
&gt;	By doing this all you’re saying is that they aren’t the same server at all, they’re separate servers with just a shared character name list so they can be merged
---
Shared list would be dumb. How was this handled in other server merges over the years?
---
&gt;	The problem then is that people have to control which cluster they are on, and you have the exact same problems as servers do- people flock to some and desert others.
---
You don’t have to control anything. You decide after the fact to merge a cluster if it’s needed. If people flock to a cluster you don’t merge because the servers are healthy. If a cluster is deserted you merge.
---
It's a joke you fucking berk.
---
Go outside and socialise more and you will understand sarcasm/humour you egg.
---
Well I can agree on most of what You're saying, and I know it's true, but on the other hand I can't get rid of this feeling that Blizzard is making games easier for them to become more accessible and I don't think that's listening to fans - I think that it's contrary to what fans actually want. And I need to straight something there, by saying "fans" I'm not thinking about every person that plays their games - fans are people that are someone more than just a user of a games, fans care about certain franiches and what it to develop in a proper way.
---
If we go by this logic (which I kinda agree with) vanilla FFXI is the greatest game of all time and no other game can come even remotely close.
---
PVE: Utilising the flexibility of your talent trees and builds. DM-Ruin and SM-Ruin are great, but do you know what an Implock is and how to optimise it beyond 3/3 improved Imp? 
---
PVP: More complicated, warlocks are very nuanced in PVP and the differences between good and great are harder to point out. Proper pet micro is a big one though. Particularly the Felhunter since landing the right devour magic can win you an encounter then and there, but rage starving a warrior with your voidwalker sacrifice or seduce-soul fire memeing someone need to be in your mind too.
---
Also knowing how to abuse your massive kit and survivability to waste your opponents resources is important, because unlike other classes a warlocks chances of winning increase as the fight goes on. For example, in duels against a mage you should make liberal use of Curse of Tongues - they have to remove it since it's an autolose otherwise but the globals they spend decursing aren't being used to hit you, meanwhile the globals you use casting it still have dot &amp; pet damage ticking. Additionaly you can spare &amp; recoup the mana costs, they can't.
---
They don't have to lock in the merges pre-release except for the purpose of the name bank. If there are two big servers, why merge them? The only consequence there is that names were unnecessarily taken... not a big deal.
---
U don't have the move speed buff + some moves are immune to curse of exhaustion/fear.
---
You can't kite 40-man things across continents like hunters can.
---
Silvermoon. However, it's not on the list, so Darnassus.
---
You know, the whole social aspect of finding a group is a real drag, maybe Blizzard could come up with some way where people wouldn't have to talk to eachother.
---
well my Fall semester starts on the day of release, so I'll look through all my syllabi and gauge whether I have any work due at the end of the week. If there is none, which is doubtful, or if it is minimal then I plan on farming hard during week 1. 
---
Luckily for me this is my graduating semester and, since I've completed all my major specific courses, I was able to choose a pretty relaxed schedule. A well deserved respite!
---
I hope not
---
Why won't he do either of those raids? It's not like there is a deadline to do anything in classic. Who cares whether he gets there sort after the content releases or a year later? Guilds will be forming and doing the content for as long as the servers are up. It makes absolutely no difference whether he does the content around release or 5 years later. It isn't a race.
---
Be in Blackrock mountain
---
See Alliance with Bloodfang gear and Perdition's blade
---
My inner Tauren Shaman just got some real PTSD
---
Maybe like now. 
---
/1 for all and you have then to invite the other players for them to see Hogger.
---
It isn't with Esfand talking at all...
---
Asmon and Esfand are best friends.
---
Asmon gets annoyed by not being able to do stuff and it spergs him out. You must be very new round here.
---
Yeah this whole optimism thing seems funny for something so critical to the game. It's sucks in retail and beta but they will definitely make it not suck!
---
Completely disagree.
---
By that logic everyone is or was retarded in your opinion, thus = toxic.
---
Go to r/wowservers for private server discussion. This sub is specifically for retail Classic WoW.
---
Yeah man you get a Y I K E S from me!
---
Cheer up you fucking egg.
---
hinterlands are ungoro are the best quest zones in vanilla if ur horde
---
It’s the community. That’s the magic that retail has lost but classic fosters.
---
Horde was better at Warsong Gulch only during vanilla days. They would win 2/3 of the time on that one. Arathi alliance would win 2/3 of the time. Alterac valley well those never ended. So not sure how horde was better at pvp.
---
And the converse is true too:
---
It is totally ok to log off and do something else if you aren’t having fun in the game.  That grind will still be there when you get back
---
My Wrath guild died on Sarth 3D of all things. :))
---
Thread like this point out that there is no subsistute for the best solution of hard server caps without any sharding / layering technology.
---
It was too jarring for the immersion moving from one zone to another and getting 'sharded' to a new world.  The people around you disappear, the weather might change, it really is noticeable.  So they invented layering so that in the course of just running around the world would be seamless and immersive.  This of course leaves some of the original problems with sharding such as what we saw in the OPs video, while taking out the ability to cap it to low level zones.  I hope they find a solution, but I don't see one that doesn't kill the immersion or leave exploits available.
---
Can someone paraphrase? I'm at work, can't watch
---
I disagree completely. Send me the footage of you clearing all the dungeons first try when classic comes out. (You won't). You're gonna wipe more than a few times. 
---
You people have seriously forgotten Vanilla wow, or you just never played it. You're in for a nice surprise.
---
&gt; Always carry 25 soul shards on you and replenish while grouping. One healthstone --&gt; one soulshard for everyone in your 5-man, 10-man.
---
Also keep in mind that if you have the talent points in Improved Healthstones (or whatever it's called, in Demo), the Healthstones stack. Which means that with 3 warlocks in the raid, you will have to coordinate so that one of you is 0/2, one is 1/2, and the last one 2/2 specced. Chances are your tanks will want all three 'versions' of the healthstones.
---
Me and my friend reminisced about a heroic dungeon during TBC where he had to go BRB for, essentially an hour as a minor "emergency". He told the party with 2 other randoms (ran it with 2 friends) and everyone agreed to wait.
---
1 hour and 30minutes later we resumed and cleared the heroic. We all waited, cause getting a new tank mid heroic run would mean essentially the same amount of time spent. So might aswell wait and clear when he comes back.
---
If you've played the zones and are familiar with the quest starts etc yes it's very possible
---
holy is the preferred pvp spec, they are extremely powerful, mana efficient good healing, excellent blessings, super good cooldowns and the get plate and a shield
---
That sounds awful... literally exactly what they said they wanted to avoid! Hope it's a bug.
---
We're in a whole threat about classic because of things like that. Flying kills world PvP. Blizzard has even said it was a mistake.
---
Different teams this time. The devs working on classic see actual pixels on their screen instead of dollar bills
---
thank you
---
Soda turned down a big sponsorship to stream the classic launch instead.
---
Snacks before bed can cause heartburn, though.
---
Ah bummer.  I get it though, PvP can be a bit rough if you just want to get on, level/quest, and enjoy the game.  If you change your mind,  hit me up and we'll do some ganking of our own!
---
Just watch Asmongold visit this subreddit and the WoW forums. Literal manchildren crying over the fact that Blizzard "prioritized" his beta invite and stress test login.
---
https://youtu.be/2Wt6-4Bc_UU
---
Names can be shared acros several servers. Same as layers. And again as layer you have no guarantees what pop will be left after tourist leave. In both cases (layers or preset merges) you can have big and small pop servers left.
---
[https://youtu.be/iYLIVvtkRDA?t=1555](https://youtu.be/iYLIVvtkRDA?t=1555)
---
Tips out mentioning this on classic cast.
---
Yeah I was gonna say that my email said that two hour window which I assumed was the only testing time. Hopefully they word that better next round of testing. I hammered the login server for an hour and half then gave up. Oh well, hopefully I get another chance before release.
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
I assume the maximum is 100, then. At least someone else in the thread said so. Do you have an idea what the default value is?
---
You can breathe as much as you want for 10min! What's the problem!?
---
Sounds like a case for Lionel Hutz.
---
And most, if not all of this, was lost.
---
8/27 can't wait.
---
I’m glad I wasn’t the only one that avoided questing haha. I was in my mid 40s when TBC came out, and then only got to maybe 65, I didn’t actually hit max until LK

They only spawned the NPC's in certain layers. Nothing to fix.
---
It is an incredibly good set with some of the best set bonuses you can get for a rogue.  The only true upgrade from it is bonescythe which is from naxx, the 2.5 set is alright if you can't complete the 8p bonus from bloodfang.
---
Yeah stonecore is the one I remember being particularly tricky to find, they must have changed it in pandas cause I can't recall any corpse runs to those dungeons

[Here is my pic of a "staredown" between Horde and Alliance](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/557619093877030923/581128434739052546/staredown.png?width=1029&amp;height=579) on the border of Elwynn and Duskwood. We held this little island like champs, but as soon we over extended the Horde took advantage. What a great time we had.
---
May 29th is your next chance, there's a blue post about it.
---
And thank you for your tear, I'm so pumped for people returning and caring for a social experience again I can't even put it in words! I love vanilla WoW so much and it's not only for nostalgic reasons :D
---
Because you could get a pool of servers that all have perfectly fine populations (and thus nearly every sensical name is taken within hours), or a pool that all have terrible populations, or any mixture thereof. Trying to guess what servers will need merging ahead of time is just a stupid thing to try and do.
---
For me the private servers are brighter
---
people barely even used the tbc lfg tool, /2 spamming was still what most people did.
---
Holy crap! Yes, trying to get the wolves in the Human starting zone was just as bad. I lost count of how many circuits around the zone I completed before I finally got the last one I needed. :-)
---
Then after that it was the Kobolds and Bandits. 
---
The only zone I actually was able to complete everything in a few hours was the Gnome/Dwarf starting area. The respawn rates there seemed to be much better than NE or Human zones. It still took me several hours to get to level 5, but it was enjoyable, as opposed to the NE and Human starting areas where it was several hours on just the first quest alone (NE), and several hours on the first 2 (Human). 
---
I would be happy if it was tuned to a point where it takes a few hours to complete the starting zone. No one should be stuck in the starting zones for days, or come to decision “I will try again in a week”.
---
Yeah that's it. You can also pull far enough, put VW on it, and if aggro is taken, instafear the mob while VW will taunt again. 
---
Definitely possible in all 5-man lv60 instances to finish them like the lad above told us. Lots of bosses can also be VW kited, if you have enough dps/snare and a skilled enough heal/lock to keep the pet alive, you'll be OK. That's what's so great about being a lock, you're the ultimate jack of all trades at Vanilla. PvP beast, PvE ok, TP master, Rez stone on a real raiser... It's definitely not for min/max player, but if you want to be able to do almost everything, it's the class to pick.
---
Yes, a prototype that took 2-3 years to perfect with a whole dev team behind it.
---
This is pretty great. Lore won't change my mind, but I do like it.
---
indeed
---
i was so excited for a second (; Silly me
---
repost, this was on frontpage for a long time
---
Jesus christ, I've thought about this so often but never actually tried it because "why would it suddenly be a mechanic now?" goddamn.
---
Same here, I'm also going to pick up some professions + fishing and cooking and level it all up together :) I don't see any point in rushing the game anymore. Been there, done that. Now it's time to chill and enjoy every little thing on the way.
---
Yes dynamic spawning is a must have only retards want 5-6min spawn timers in the starting zones.
---
Yea on Nostalrius I have some vivid memories of some of the longer marathon-type dungeons (mara, brd) where we take active breaks to get up and bio, get a drink etc. No one sits down for a full BRD clear and expects to sprint through it.
---
Yeah and original Vanilla game dev mark kern agrees with us and says they had code that increase spawns in starter areas for this very reason https://clips.twitch.tv/MoralAntsyWalletFrankerZ
---
I’ve always had this attitude and hated the race to endgame or only playing the meta game min/max game. I fell in love with WoW from exploring the world and taking it in how I choose. It really keeps me going 15 years later.
---
The easiest way to fix this problem would be to only allow layerchange when the group is in the same area, this way several people would need to be in the same location before changing layer, stoping the quick farm and quick invite on alt accounts.
---
GG I was the Scarlet tabard.
---
Do they really have territories, though? Goblins run towns and markets and the like, but they don't have a standing military to actively patrol and defend a region like the other factions here do.
---
Besides, war is good business when you're selling the weapons, not using them yourself.
---
That definitely wasn't how defensive behavior worked in vanilla. Micro-ing your pet was necessary on warlock at least.
---
What a chad
---
The subscriber numbers over the years seem to indicate that that's not how they successfully get people into the game :-)
---
I think your view of what a casual gamer is is pretty dismissive. Maybe this is how it is today? I can't say. I would not ascribe this 1 hour per day rule to how to label someone as a casual player. Plenty of people back then only played on the weekend, a few hours here, a few hours there. A bit here and there during the week, but not with any sort of daily routine. We had a few casual players in our raiding guild, who attended raids every other week or so.
---
It's an MMORPG after all, I don't think someone playing Bejewelled for a few minutes during commute should be considered a casual player to base any sort of judgement on.
---
&gt;On launch with layering these mega servers are going to be producing enough high level resources for 10-12k players
---
I'm sure plenty of level 10s will be snatching up Thorium, that's for sure.
---
I'm happy to admit that there are potential drawbacks to layering, but your primary complaint here is fixable by Blizzard just reducing the zones that get layered, which I'm sure they will do if necessary.
---
On the other hand we could just not have layering and know for a fact that the entire launch is going to be a shitshow that will permanently impede the success of a server type many of us have waited over a decade for.
---
Its realm based. During the Hakkar In Stormwind shenanigans in the stress test, there were whispers offering groups to join the shard that Hakkar was in.
---
Maybe i'm still in denial, but i still am of the opinion modern MMOs just aren't nearly as interesting to explore as older ones. I remember playing EQ then WOW, and in both games just running around and exploring everything was kind of magical. 
---
I feel like they left enough mystery in the world that you didn't really know what you were going to see, and in WOW's case the environments were gorgeous and varied that it always interesting to see what you'd come across next. 
---
I think the way MMOs are made now make them much more like focused set pieces that you get walked through, rather than interesting worlds that incentivise you to explore. In addition, there are so many QOL features these days to streamline the process that they don't really allow you to soak in your surroundings before you are already moving on to the next area. In WoW you could be a single area for weeks before you are done with it and are ready to move on and explore a new zone. It's hard to really get attached to a zone when you only spend an hour or two there before moving on.
---
it was always laughable that they didnt have the tech
---
i believe they also indicated they didnt have any of the data a few times which was clearly bullshit
---
I distinctively recall furious fans on forums after every expansion Blizzard made telling Blizz they make bad decisions. I don't think retail is a product of Blizzard listening to fans, I think it's the exact opposite. I think Blizz is still swimming on a wave Vanilla WoW made and even if numbers were bigger with first few expansions they never actually made same impact as with the 1st game. They lost their initial vision of how games should work long time ago, and it's not fans who made decisions to make the game easier. I think it's Blizzard trying to make game easier for casuals.
---
I didn’t know about this. Thanks for sharing the link!
---
I honestly don't understand what you're getting at. Yes, the stress test had problems with logging in, but that has nothing to do with the layering technology. The login servers being under huge strain and not able to handle the capacity does not mean that the game servers lag equally as much. They're seperate for that exact reason. 
---
&gt;Sorry but no this stress test could have gone way better.
---
What is your definition of a "good" stress test? Everyone being to log in flawlessly without any lag or any problems whatsoever? That would be pretty pointless, since it wouldn't put the servers to the brim of their capacity. The point of a STRESS test is to STRESS test the servers. I think the stress test went great, I'm sure they got very valuable info on where the bottlenecks are, what causes crashes etc. That's the only thing that matters in a stress test. It's not a demo for you to test out.
---
Ahmen.
---
It is funny if you think about how Blizzard worked against this. Since TBC and even more since WotLK your leveling experience was guided by questing in dense packed hubs. Sure it has its own fun but I personally prefer Vanilla's scattered points of interest around the world.
---
Well your first mistake is picking Alliance.
---
Beyond that you have to decide what server you want. PVP, RP, PVE.
---
After that dont rush things. If you guys want to get to 60 as quickly as possible then look up a few guides and go at it. But there is no need to. Being you are playing with a group maybe you guys could get some professions to help each other out. If you are going Mage then Enchanting and Tailoring is a good combo. Youll be able to make a Wand at level 5 (if you get Enchanting level to 20 I think) and you can enchant your friends gear as well. Maybe he goes Alchemy and Herb so you both have mana and health potions. 
---
Also GET FIRST AID
---
If your friend is undecided in what class to get then a Lock is a good pair with a mage though know you would compete for gear. A Warrior and rogue are other good options.
---
Anotherway to enjoy your time is dont be a dick to other players unless they deserve it. On Classic reputation means alot (probably not so much at the start but later on in game). Dont ninja loot is the main thing. Stealing mobs and nodes is kind of a dick move but it happens.
---
Above all else though...explore. There are alot of great zones to go to and things to find. Talk with others. Join a guild or start your own. Enjoy life.
---
Yeah classic uses a modified bfa/legion client, it's not the old vanilla one. I'm actually kinda thankful for this because the vanilla client couldn't play sounds in the background, switching tabs was annoying with the music and sfx always cutting out lol
---
Naming conflicts is one issue that arises from merges. That wont be a problem with layering.
---
Yeah, it's a great add-on, I played Legion with it enabled and read every quest. Everything made much more sense. I'm gonna try to keep the game as Vanilla as possible when it comes to the add-ons, but once Immersion is out, I'm definitely going to install it.
---
I like it. Not 100% convinced about adding a UI element to do this (immersion etc), maybe a phasing/sharding-like transition could be done, but restricting layer-hopping to specific zones is a great approach I think.
---
You could also allow this at meeting stones in front of the instances. Many instance portals are guarded by elite mobs, so there should be a way to meet up with your party members before zoning in.
---
I don't care what "layer" it's on. If Rag is in SW on layer 1, and rag is NOT in SW on layer 2, then it's just sharding with extra steps. I walk into stormwind and see just a crowd of people, yet others can see a raid boss? So could they attack these mobs? How is this not just sharding?
---
No one can solo endgame world bosses. Those are reserved for 25+ man raids. If you are talking about Elites, then you can definitely solo those as long as they are not immune to Fear.
---
In BGs warlocks do well assuming you have someone to peel warriors (and generally melee) off you. So if you stick with a group you can do massive damage (multidotting) and if you are Soul Link specced you can generally survive openers from rogues long enough to either Death Coil/Fear of just receive some heals.
---
For making gold, warlocks lack the more 'unusual' strategies that are available to rogues (pickpocketing everything in BRD) or mages (AoE grind in Dire Maul), but with a deep Affliction spec you can multidot and farm mobs like a madman. Also, the Epic mount quest will cost you around 650g, so you are already saving something like  350g just by being a warlock. Or, you can pay a small fee (100-200g) to another warlock that has already done the quest and he can carry you through the last step without having to buy the expensive reagents/items.
---
Wish I wasn’t a broke college boy back then. I know a couple guys in my office who did the same. Get reAdy for more gains my man. Beast of a stock through all of the turbulence since sept-oct. pump to 34 was just for protection purposes. AMD TO THE MOON
---
Ngl that's actually pretty neat
---
Flying makes the world and your relation to it irrelevant. The world should never be irrelevant in an MMORPG. Introducing a mechanism that allows players to bypass the world was a step on the road to the game as it is now - played entirely from your city of choice. Teleportation everywhere is the next step from flying over everything.
---
It's actually rooted in culture. In contrast with eastern culture, western culture looks for instant gratification and always seeks to go straight to the point or the solution.
---
There is little care for living the actual process and being part of it.  
---
We don't want to wait with patience and think embracing such thought is wasteful.  Also art in the west is appreciated much differently than in the East. 
---
I'm the end both cultures are valid and there are people who are attracted to different philosophies.
---
Its good for boar slaying but need some variety on the grounds of battle!
---
Do you not agree?
---
My god does this bring me back.. I was on the horde side of that server as well.
---
Amazing
---
Thats my worry too. Everyone will flock to the server Asmon and Soda are playing in (heck including me). Judging by the insane numbers during stress test even with layering, I'm quite worried.
---
Right? 16 year old me would have no idea to try this out.
---
I forgot about CMs when I made the original comment as well, so it definitely had to be it. Couldn't imagine doing a ghost run back while timed hah
---
I remember reading something along the lines of them not keeping versions x patches back, which just defies belief.
---
Or don’t use addons, and fully appreciate the ‘classic’ feel everyone’s been saying they want.
---
I Only experienced vanilla through private servers (so I was experienced unlike OG vanilla players) but my first charcater (rogue) took me 3 month to get to 60 and I think a whole monty was 50-60. I was also playing everyday and quite a bit too.
---
hes literally the reason we have wow at all. they were going to cancel the project while it was in development but he convinced them to finish it. he was one of the original devs for vanilla, so saying "hes just a streamer who wants them to add it" is the dumbest shit you could possibly say. not saying that i want dynamic respawns or anything, but if one of the guys who helped write the code is saying that its wrong, its probably wrong. or it was changed at some point and he wasnt informed on it because he doesnt work for blizzard anymore.
---
Ye I don't like sharding but I can imagine hating 6000 queues and 3 hours to complete the first quest more
---
Old Org and Old Stormwind.
---
I don't think many people are going to be getting to end game within the first couple of weeks. Some are, sure, but you can't design an entire game around the top .001%. However, and I'm sure Blizzard understand this, the layering system will need to be tweaked depending on a whole host of different factors, and should be preferably removed as soon as it's feasible to do so.
---
This is equivalent to telling a story by starting at the climax.  We start stories with exposition; we introduce setting, characters, and conflict in order to impart meaning to the story.
---
Forcing players to physically travel to the dungeon entrance encourages players to socialize before diving into the action and also lends greater weight to the dungeon itself.  Pacing is important.
---
If you want endless hack-and-slash, play Diablo.
---
Why do I have a distinct memory of Warlock pets only speaking demonic and then only later having little bits of dialogue when summoned?
---
Before those fans were furious about a change was probably years of other people asking for that change
---
&gt;The subscriber numbers over the years
---
Is exactly why they did all of this. People started leaving, they needed to change stuff so MORE people would start playing the game, hence make it more casual (also because of imput of the community, like adding LFD) This turned out bad for them as the game is very casual friendly now and none has to invest time in it and taking breaks isn't punishing.
---
If They listen to You then they will listen to community actually :P Imo most of community right now wants Wow Classic to be as close to the Vanilla as possible (not to alter it), check all the topics that compare vanilla to classic, ppl post comparisions all the time (model sizes, how much damage mobs do, how much damage classes do etc. etc.). And that's what fans want - and If Blizz listens then wow classic will be saved :)
---
The amount of people that chose IF surprises me.
---
Nah, if you only like half of the game, you should go somewhere else, not the people who like both.
---
This is for the first time ever i actually went to a PS... wanted in, didn't get in, might as well get some practice and remind myself how some classes work in classic
---
Is it /qui in France? Or is all the scripting/console command stuff not translated? I imagine the latter, but it would be so much cooler if it's all available in multiple languages.
---
I like how you believe it
---
Let's see, rapidly declining playerbase as these features were removed. Hordes of never classic steamers now addicted to classic and saying on stream these are key factors in their change of heart. Yup, romantic spin doctoring and it always has been.
---
Big if true. I never knew you could do this.
---
For a long time looking at this image I thought you meant you caught the dwarf.
---
Hold up.... nothing is better than getting the Wombat of Slaying
---
Dude he mentioned that he put a bug report in to the team, i think they will listen to him
---
Yeah, I was thinking about engeneering, but I see it's more for PVP or WPVP. When if you have tailoring you can craft bis gear you need and bags which is so important for warlock
---
Meh, I don't know still have a lot of doubts about which profession to take.
---
But, anyway thanks for you response, I still have time to think, let's see what other members will write here.
---
Peace!
---
I wonder if there will be a “Goldshire Inn” streamer. 
---
Much less interesting without Worgen and Draenei though....lol
---
Best wow player
---
Ofc it was useful, its better for it to be crashing like crazy during tests than on the actual release. The crash recovery system sucks though... it rolls your position and equipment back like 10+ minutes, if your bag is full the stuff you had equipped is sent via mail and if you dont pick it up by the time of the next crash say bye to them xD
---
You're supposed to remain in the same layer with the same people unless you specifically accept an invite to a new one.
---
&gt; realm hop
---
This is a similar, but unrelated game mechanic
---
&gt; i think we can both agree that economy is not an exact science so no one will know if there will be a trend towards average.
---
It's exactly because it's not exact that my reasoning works. It's pretty much completely random, which is why it will end up relatively well sorted when you apply it to such a large number. 
---
&gt;this is reductio ad absurdum to prove a point.
---
No, it's basic statistics.
---
That's how i look at it tbh.  It's my "discount beta" till aug 27th.
---
Except the number of users on a given layer and the number of layers in each server is variable, whereas binding servers at the hip from the beginning is a completely inflexible choice that could lead to real problems.
---
I think the Vael fight outlines why it's so important to turn your guilds into a community.  To make sure that everyone feels like part of the group, and feels loyalty to that group.
---
If you've been stuck on Vael for a month, not making progress, people are going to start jumping ship, taking gear with them, and thus reducing your future chances.  If you're a DKP guild, every time someone appears to "blow their load" everyone gets super suspicious of their motivations.  If you're a LC guild, everyone starts to become super suspicious of the loot council, are they funneling loot based on perceived loyalty more, are they trying to buy loyalty of people who might be planning to leave with loot?  If someone thinks they're not getting loot because the officers think they're looking for a new guild, then pretty soon they're going to be looking for a new guild regardless.  If someone does get loot from an LC, then leaves anyway, people begin to question the point of having a LC at all, since a LC's primary stated purpose is to get the absolute most value for a guild out of available loot by prioritizing progression over merit and choice.
---
The most important things for getting through vael are, in my opinion.
---
Having someone willing to parse logs so you can scrape data from them, determine what the problems are, who is, if not at fault then, most able to help fix them.  Talk to those people, and help them solve the problem, rather than merely tell them "your damage sucked, even when you had BA, get gud or you're out of rotation next week".
---
One of the secondary reasons I won't do LC is that LC guilds can't encourage people the same way a DKP guild can.  A DKP guild can say "No DKP if you don't flask for vael" or "Double DKP for the DPS class who improves his damage most from last week", etc.  All a LC can do is that kind of non-commital vague promise that middle management bosses use when they want more work out of their subordinates to do extra work for no extra money. 
---
 *"Hey, I was wondering if you could come in on sunday.  We've really noticed how hard you're working, and it looks like a team leader position is going to be opening up in the next few months.  I've been floating your name to my boss for it, and I really think you're the perfect fit for the job.  This could go a long way toward ensuring that you get the promotion."*
---
In summary I believe...
---
They key to holding a guild together when stuck on any fight is making progress each week, with people leaving feeling proud of what they've accomplished rather than ashamed of what they haven't.
---
The key to making progress, is finding out after a night of wipes where you're lacking, and working, as a guild, to shore up those deficiencies, with the people who are prepared helping those who are not to become prepared.  (If two people are stuck in a pit, and one manages to climb out.  What gets both of you out faster?  The first guy looking down and saying "Come on, I did it, you can do it. What's your excuse" or the first guy looking down and saying "reach for my hand, and I'll pull you up."
---
They said in the Blizzcon panel that they only found ONE copy of 1.12 data in a backup of a backup.
---
It was a miracle that this happened at all.
---
In some cases - maybe, but in most i don't think so. You and I are a fans too right? And we want classic, and we embrace it right now. Isn't it the best argument for my case? Fans have spoken: we want unaltered classic, and I don't remember any time when I asked Blizz to make something easier, I don't remember much posts about making some things easier (where there any when Naxx came out in Vanilla? I don't think so... and this raid was ridiculously hard).

Together with 100's of others, starting from SW to the Arena, to Booty Bay, getting killed by Gorlash... Epic fun &lt;3 Recorded my \~12h experience, witnessed all major "events", did all the fun stuff and more.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "no idea what this does - but do it"
---
Heroic dungeons arent leveling content.
---
For one, layers that disappeared or were otherwise inaccessible resulted in players trying to hearth and getting "instance not available" or something like that, and may have been the reason why so many people had "World server down" despite other players still being in-game with no problems.
---
Oh OK I thought they had wipe everything after 24h. Thanks again.
---
Stay on live then. Thats the raid machine
---
they may not have kept all the core code for every patch and version but trying to make people believe it just all got totally deleted and not a copy was in existence was pretty funny. 
---
there is a difference between having the server executable and having the code that generated them (and the core code behind all the actual server side stuff).
---
but they certainly would have had at least a couple versions of both

---
listening to fans is what got us to BfA in the first place. listening to fans is the LAST thing they should be doing. if they focused on just making the game fun rather then trying to accommodate the game for every possible demographic, itd be in a way better place then it is right now. people just need to accept that not every game is going to be a game they can enjoy and if they dont like it, move on.
---
I also thought about a CD, but 5 min is way too short. Then you’d still be able to run a round of your chosen farming route, then change layer and start over. 
---
IMO it should be more like an hour.
---
They suffer at first without gear, but not as badly as Warriors. You can still do decently against other casters but you'll get stomped by physical damage.
---
What I \*think\* might have been happening is.. Perhaps with so many concurrent players there's usually several layers in operation on beta. if you logout/login you won't change layer. But if you change character it might well re-assign you. So I think the character swap is just a way to force another selection.
---
If that is the case then it's an exploit that, hopefully they're now aware of.
---
I made my choice almost entirely on how much of a pain in the ass each city is to get around.
---
I gave Stormwind first place, simply because it's all basically one level and everything is in its own section.
---
Thunder Bluff is probably second, because it's similar to Stormwind in that it is made of compartmentalized sections connected by bridges. But TB has at least two levels, and the bridges are more of a pain than Stormwind's to navigate.
---
IF and UC are tied. They share a similar style of layout, and they're both big circles with each section on the outer edge. IMO IF is easier to navigate but it also is (it at least feels) much bigger. UC is smaller but for some reason in all my years of playing I can still never remember where each section is.
---
Darnassus is fifth. All that water makes it hard to get around. There are also multiple levels, and nothing is in a convenient spot. The fact that they sort of section things off is nice, but overall it's not a very good layout.
---
I say this as someone who has been a Horde player since vanilla: Orgrimmar is an absolute mess. Multiple layers, caves, sections that don't make sense, a complete lack of symmetry, and not one but two(!) back doors for easy Alliance access.
---
It may seem to people like as if he was shitting on layering(?)
---
Retail would still be shit if all bugs were fixed. The bugs arent the problem with Retail. They are literally doing what they should be to get things working, and you're here bitching that it's a slippery slope into...bad systems? Please, the paint goes on walls, not in your mouth.
---
Then again, eastern countries *love* paying thousands for mobile games so...Eh.
---
It's not all Black and White, but I do agree that atleast Germans are very good at not wanting to be inconvenienced in games.
---
HE DID IT FOR THE MONEYYYYYYYYYYY
---
More realistically; he didnt' want to play a shitty game for money, and doesn't need the money. Lol.
---
If you're taking tailoring the most logical complement is enchanting since they both don't require a gathering profession.
---
As a rogue I am going horde because I don't want to deal with orcs
---
It's funny how many of people in this topic actually want Blizzard not to listen to them :D
---
IIRC you used to be able to do something similar with spell effects, warlock raining fire and mage's blizzard used to look crazy at high settings
---
Wait, is this real? Can we get some video evidence?
---
Joke's in you, I actually plan to fall behind.
---
I think i'd go the one step farther (as you have in your second paragraph) and say capital cities only.  That way if youre looking to group up for a dungeon or whatever youre quite likely going to be heading through the same town and can meet up if you want to, or if its for RP purposes you can meet up to make sure everyone is together, and then it 'locks' you there.
---
I personally am not one of the people thats big against layers (i do think its a decent way to mitigate the issue of huge interest early on, with the potential for desolate servers later), though i'd like to see them take some precautions like these to prevent abuse.
---
I know its only going to be phase 1/for a short time, but some basic stuff like this could really help.
---
I personally do not care if it's just for launch and only temporary.
---
I guarantee there will be more players this time on launch for Classic compared to Vanilla.  It would be an actual shit show without it.
---
It should NOT be permanent though.
---
If you don't understand why some sort of solution is required for the problem of overpopulation in early zones then honestly you're not worth talking to.

I really appreciate the effort that you put into this guide. Saved and bookmarked it for future rewatches. :)
---
RemindMe! 96 days "more stuff"
---
Do warlock pets have the same problem ?
---
Who is trying to group with people they cannot see in game more than once every half hour if they aren't exploiting layers?
---
Like I said, I convinced a streamer to test this out on a Gazer in Shimmer Flats, and it does indeed work.
---
This is just embarrassing
---
I don't understand how people joining groups to do content is a problem.
---
That is because pay2win is seen as a status symbol not a measure of skill in the East.
---
The point is more that in Vanilla, you haven't done any of that stuff yet, and that is what makes it fun. Hell, its somewhat feasible that the random peasant in Crossroads has no idea that you were one of the forty dudes who ventured underground to kill a fire god who would maybe threaten the world in like, fifteen years.
---
But it was when the character had indeed saved the world like six times by the end of burning crusade that it got a little ridiculous to be reporting to some first sergeant at an outpost and asking him how many boar asses he needs collected
---
Perhaps. But, arguably, the poll dynamic and Jagex's dedication to making new content that still feels time-appropriate for the older game has resulted in a pretty well done game. It always means there's going to be some contention and drama due to differing opinions, but it's clearly been a working formula for them.
---
1. Threat management. Warlocks above all other classes are abysmal with threat generation, especially when there are bosses that cannot be taunted, which makes threat control a good skill to have as a warlock. I.e. knowing when to safely push damage, when to stop etc.
---
2. Knowing when to Life Tap and when to use mana potions/demonic runes.
---
3. Knowing how to swap pets depending on the occasion and the need for CC, survivability etc.
---
Warlocks can do some mage dungeon farming ([lashers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIGyflRlxN8)) and can do some hunter dungeon farming ([Princess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8OXnnnv-rs)). If you're an herbalist, you can also add in ghost mushroom runs in Mara. You can also do some solo DM farming ([Mol'dar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5ZEYd8K9M0)).
---
In context to this one thing that bothered me about Trial of the Crusader during wrath.  
---
the armor you earn during trial is from some dusty attic in goldshire.   i'm like .. wtf .. come on i spent all that goddamn time killing stuff getting tier 0 then wiping in mc to get tier 1.. wiping killing giant dragons in bwl tier 2. . killing old gods in tier 3 and then finally reppelling the undead hordes with tier4.  5 again in outlands and and then tier 7 in north rend.. then tier 8 killing an old god..  
---
NOW YOU PULL THIS OUT OF A DUSTY ATTIC ?? YOU HAD THIS SHIT ALL ALONG AND NOW YOU GIVE IT TO ME .. NEVER MIND I COULD HAVE USED THIS STUFF TO KILL EVERYTHING UP UNTILL NOW...
---
I exercise the authority over my opinion and deny you the privilege of belittling it. I do however side with you on the fact that classic coming out is amazing. Hopefully this helps you understand better where I am coming from.
---
Thanks for that. Good to see that spillover is back. Should make the Darnassus rep grind a little easier. (:
---
It's obviously hyperbole man.  It happened 13 years ago let the man have his memories.
---
Exactly. Heroic dungeons are max level content but easier than leveling content in classic. I don't understand how it is hard to understand what I'm saying here. They don't need to be harder than mythic dungeons, they're already harder than heroics and for leveling content that says quite a lot.
---
YES. It's hard.
---
I really want to play Ret, but I also really want a horde druid.
---
didn't know you suffered from brain damage. I'm sorry about that. Hope you get some help!
---
If he thinks that's bad he should have seen Northshire Abbey.
---
only 2k players imo
---
Also, I got to level 5 on the stress test within 30 seconds of making my character so overpopulation definitely isn't a problem at all.
---
Oh I get it, I’m just sharing my launch experiences and why I believe layering/sharding the first initial launch is necessary.
---
Thank you for all your help!
---
Keto is not safe without adequate water intake and frequent restroom breaks. Both of which most people wont think about while min-maxing their time leveling.
---
maybe 30min id hate to wait nearly an hour to join a group . i could live with waiting 30min after my last group
---
Really puts into perspective just how large and powerful the Alliance is compared to the Horde, and why a faction war is...kinda a weak plot point. There's just too great a difference in size. The Horde is largely refugees that have made their homes in places nobody else wanted (excepting the Tauren really). The Alliance is composed of large, old, powerful, intact kingdoms.
---
Thrall didn't have it easy keeping the Horde races chilled out so as not to antagonize the Alliance too much. 
---
It's non-canonical for Classic, but when Varian Wrynn gave Vol'jin the threat at the end of MoP, it wasn't "we'll declare war", it was "we will END you". That was no idle boast. The Alliance could do it. It would eventually be a slog of fighting guerilla warfare in Horde areas, and it would have to come to genocide really, but at least physically the Alliance was quite capable of it.
---
It's also adds to the pile of reasons why Sylvanas attacking Teldrassil is colossally stupid. The Horde had become stronger than in vanilla, but it's also taken some incredible damage over the decade+ as well. The civil war against Garrosh alone was a big hit since whether your side wins or loses, overall your people are still being killed off. The Horde has added races, but those races did not join for world destruction. Oh sure, they're not cowards and they will fight to protect the Horde and its allies, but assaulting Teldrassil was completely unprovoked and savage on a level that would make the Lich King go, "JEE-sus! O_O". Saurfang's fear was genuine and bolsters my point, "They'll come for us. ALL of them!" It's not just Night Elves looking for some revenge. Now they have the attention of the entire Alliance. Even without the Night Elf capitol, that is not a good fight. Even if the factions were even, that's still terrible odds. You never want to pick a fight with a nation equal to you if you want to have anything left afterwards.
---
Of course, Sylvanas just WMD'd Undercity and lost that capitol and all in it as well. So now there is literally no reason for her to remain in power or for anyone to follow her. She should have been deposed before a lot of this even took place. She's acting like she's still Scourge and this was some long play to infiltrate the races of Azeroth.
---
I couldn't disagree more, and that's why I am glad we're going to have to entirely separate games to play on August 27th.
---
To each his own.
---
In my experience.. horde is almost always better at PvP. (regardless of which server, or which side I'm on)
---
Am I biased?
---
In the "Hero" department, yes. Wotlk acknowledged you as the hero who defeated Onyxia and Ragnaros at some points, yet your character may just be a new alt or maybe you never raided them in Classic.
---
This whole "You're a great hero, now pick up shit" approach is kinda silly. Legion atleast went all out. Wrath and TBC were still great expansions, but they could've just cut that out.
---
A solution to Ion's "unavoidable" problem: Make it unknown *who* killed these monsters and just let us stay adventurers. Sure, this might be a tad difficult once weapons like Sulfuras or Thunderfury come into play, but you can write around that. There is no need for us to be some grandiose all powerful hero. There never was.
---
private launches have 2-3times the players a classic server will have, and you want to kill the entire economy just for a few starter quests.
---
The ignorance of blizzdrones is astounding.
---
They do, and it's not black or white like you mentioned, but mobile games are product of silicon valley and it goes without saying that the whole world has been influenced by  developers in that region in one way or another.
---
No need. They will probably just make another Vanilla Classic server when the demand rises for it.
---
Considering the layers will retain the original population size, what? I dont want to run around in a world designed for 3000 people with 3-4 times that amount. Layering solves that at launch. Once the tourists leave, the layers can merge down to a healthy 2500 population realm. 
---
Oh look, layering is catering to the people who stick around. You're fucking entitled, I hope you're rolling alliance so I can gank you
---
If i had the power, i'd make servers for everyone and later combine them. But i dont...i guess we will have to deal with it. I mean i don't trust blizzard at all but then again, what can we do but trust them again.
---
I’ll save this comment and do this bucko. I’m trying to be rude here... You must have been a fucking child if you thought Vanilla raiding was hard. Classic wipes happened often because people (including me) played with 5 fucking fps on shitcan computers and didn’t understand most of the basic mechanics in the game. WoW has literally evolved in terms of min-maxing gear and dps rotations to the point where even super casual players know what they’re doing. Stop trying to make Vanilla seem difficult, it isn’t, it wasn’t, and it will never be.
---
It's free real estate.
---
What do you think about switching professions over time? I'm likely to level with 1 or more people that go for engineering from get go so I was planning to initially be herb/alch and later get engineering once I have made some money to be comfortable, considering also to swap temporarily to tailoring once Bloodvine set comes out.
---
the main reason for layering is for long term server health, theyre basically overpopulating servers with layering so that when the hype dies down and people start to quit they can remove the layering system and have a server with normal population, rather then people having to worry about their server being dead after people quit
---
i might do this on my female dwarf cause i never played a NE
---
That's fascinating. I'm definitely leveling with 1/2 now
---
Simply leaving out flying wouldnt work as there is a good amount of content you cant reach without flying. Some examples from Outland:   
---
Tempest Keep + Dungeons   
---
Skettis   
---
The mountain above Shatrath (important for Gruul attunement)   
---
Ogrila   
---
etc.   
---
Every expansion (excluding WOD) was designed with flying in mind. You cant just remove it without redesigning parts of the world. Also, the concept of flying is cool. Its the barebone implementation that makes it bland and too powerful. So instead of removing it, they should rather redesign it. An example how they could do that:   
---
1. Add exhaustion to flying. No infinite staying-in-the-air or  afk flying over the whole continent.   
---
2. Reduce epic flying speed and dont increase normal flying speed. Initially flying was at 60% increased speed, which means epic mounts were actually superior in terms of raw travelling speed. Epic flying should be somewhere between 80-180% increased speed, depending on how harsh the other nerfs are.   
---
3. Give players reliable tools to dismount flying players. Self explanatory.   
---
4. Add way more flying mobs / anti air guns (like those in destruction camps). Flying shouldnt be save, even on pve servers.
---
yeah im saying this is a lie 
---
the backup of a backup part im not surprised by
---
and im also not super surprised if they didnt have any backup of the first couple years when it was a smaller team
---
It's not like 2000 of the 3000 people weren't going to leave no matter what. It's the core issue why we are even discussing this.
---
So yes: make it 'unplayable' for the first week. If you're annoyed by overcrowded zones - just wait. It will pass. Classic is a marathon, not a sprint. One week, give or take, won't matter at all.
---
But introducing a weird cross-realm concept only so every tourist can comfortably live out their first-week-Ragnaros speedrunning fantasy with their make-believe guild is a bad thing.
---
Unfortunately, that advice was wrong back then IMO.  I took my sweet time getting to 60, mainly because I enjoyed dominating WSG as a druid flag carrier.  By the time I finally got to 60, Burning Crusade was on its way, and I didn't have time to experience end game content to the extent that I wanted.  Having each xpac make all earlier content obsolete is one of the things that I despise the most about the direction WoW took over the years.  My hope with classic is that any new content they add will be lateral and not vertical.
---
Assuming there's not a crowd so large that you can't find any mobs to kill. I hope there's a health population, but something tells me the bottleneck will be the lack of mobs
---
Seems like you know hat you talking about
---
I would like to see some tips about professions for PVE warlock if possible ahahaha
---
He says that in vanilla there was tech for starting zones (he was 1 of original developers) named "owerspawn" (kind of like retails dynamic) and he is atm almost sure it isnt working as itended. So it may be that new client actually dont know what owerspawn means and newer dynamic spawn is turned off also as it wasnt in vanilla.
---
If you don't want to be affected by other players, you can play retail
---
They literally had a patrol spawn behind them as they were fighting the boss and it aggroed.  They fear spammed and killed the add while fighting the boss.  The whole instance was respawning behind them as they fought the boss.  It was approximately 10 minutes long just to kill the boss.
---
Client or server dc causes a 10+ minute rollback of the char (location and equipment only). Items that were equipped during that interval are placed in the bags and if those are full they are deleted (checked mail)
---
But that's actual continuity. You can go and play through all of Vanilla to legion without ever stepping foot into a raid, yet you're often called Onyxia slayer, Ragnaros Killer, stuff like that in Wotlk onward.
---
In this case yeah. But most private servers have tons of mobs with entirely missing abilities (like the rocs in Tanaris) so it’s give and take.
---
Outland had a bunch of subzones that were only accessible with flying so they would need to add a way to get to them. Beyond that, Storm Peaks and Icecrown were also made to be navigated by air and would basically need to be completely remade.
---
Layering IS essentially server merging.
---
&gt; Classic is a journey, an adventure. Retail is a race. 
---
I hope this is the case. For me it will be. Unfortunately there will still be a very large amount of the population that will do all they can to race through the content and be on top of all others. I just hope this doesn't ruin the Classic experience as it has with Retail.
---
$5 says Method is the world first guild for downing Rag. Takes them 6 weeks.
---
You’d be walking for a while but it’s technically possible
---
I think part of what makes classic wow so rewarding especially while leveling is how the game rewards you. Think about this: you don't get your first green item from a quest until level 9-10. For most players that's several hours of play with just statless items. Then you have getting new spells every 2 levels that build up your character but you have to earn enough money to be able to learn them. Then you get your first blue most likely in the 20s. All while having played the game with 10+ hours into it. Then you end up getting more gear, more gold, more skills, then farming all that gold to get your very first mount! Then you eventually get to 60, and strive for the best gear you can get (usually) so that you can go raid. Then you get your first epic in raids (usually) and eventually a full set of epics (and maybe a legendary if you're lucky).  
---
Classic wow was what started it all. It is the foundation of every single expansion that's ever come to wow. For a good portion of the game's life cycle classic made up over 80% of the game. You go from expansion to expansion and the sense of getting that first green or blue or purple is gone because you've already got them but now you have to go farm/grind/level all over again just to be strong again.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I think expansions are a good way to reset the gear gap that accumulates as players get stronger and new players start at relatively the same spot. However, after a while doing the same cycle over and over also becomes stale. The sense of reward is gone with few exceptions. Features get watered down to make stuff less time consuming because technically you have "more" to do with every thing that they add. New features are added to simplify things that the players are already doing (LFG for example) but end up having unexpected consequences of less socialization or cooperation amongst others.   
---
That's my take on it :D
---
&gt; Im like 80% sure im going to be a human rogue.
---
No, I already called Human Rogue. I'm afraid you'll need to pick another combination. Unless you're prepared to be a male human rogue. In which case I'll allow it.
---
&gt; The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking survive
---
Not really no.
---
I was wondering this also. 
---
If me and my 2 friends, decide to stay in our starter zone, at what point do we meet up and get to quest together?
---
Heroic things \*and\* errands.
---
"Here farmer woman, have those apples for your pie."
---
Because raiding is a lot of people's favorite part of the game.
---
Thole shoulders are not great from what I hear... 1% dodge... apparently some rogues prefer truestriker shoulders for the hit?
---
It feels like the default is 20.
---
You might not be level 1 by the time you get there (exploration XP!) But yeah, it's definitely possible. And since Humans can be every class that Gnomes can, you should be able to do your class quests there as well.
---
private servers also have absurd dynamic respawns.          
---
whoops sorry, I forgot I can't use logic or else "blizzdrone"
---
I would highly suggest skipping this one on launch day.
---
There was a guy saying he would change layer everytimes he relogged in yesterday allowing him to freely farm all the mobs because he would relog every 5 mins and be put in a new layer everytime. It can work, but we can't have new layers being created every 15mins.
---
This is honestly the best solution, but we don't know exactly how the backend of layering works, so it might not be possible.
---
Why would you generalize the statement to the entirety of western culture? Further, youre just plain wrong. "Whatever doesnt kill you makes you stronger" was Confusious, right?
---
Ally! Ally everywhere!
---
Probably because taurens have a bigger hitbox and the ui uses a default npc hitbox value.
---
Yes. You will walk to Ironforge -&gt; Take the tram to Stonewind -&gt; Walk to human starter area (Northshire)
---
I rush my main so i can get on a raiding guild and not left behind, then i enjoy and take my time with alts. Classic has no catch up mechanisms like BFA.
---
It's okay, there's no way you could have known
---
Going to assume you haven't played beta, or classic back when it released.
---
Collection quests are brutal. Drop rates are low. As a group, it's both easier (as you're expecting) and also harder. You have better mob control with 2+ people tagging, but you're splitting the already low collection drop rate 2-5 ways.
---
This is always a funny argument..
---
No matter what Blizzard does, there are people on both sides, wanting it and hating it.
---
Yet somehow, when it's a success, the fans were on the "right" side, and when it's a flop.. the fans warned them.
---
People always forget that there were vocal fans on both sides of absolutely everything.
---
We've had many games ruined by "listening to the fans". In fact, you could argue that the Modern state of gaming is caused by "listening to the fans".   The fans want this, we want money lets give them what they want...
---
Bam we have a ton of games, that are exactly what we asked for, but really aren't fun after the intial time investment..
---
Don't forget the "Mongrels and Traitors trying to undue the kingdom from within!"
---
Try /r/buildapc - your post is more appropriate there, and they can provide you a lot more help. Please not we don't have any technical requirements for Classic.
---
They’re pretty god tier at all levels. I personally think 40+ elemental shamans with decent gear and good skill can fuck up any class. By that point you have every tool you need, and elemental mastery just straight up wipes out like 50% of hp. I’m a big ele sham fan and suggest anyone who’s thinking about shaman to seriously consider the respec at 40 to elemental and buying dreamweave gloves and chest if you like to pvp.
---
wuts the first song called
---
Im not home right now but I have some gif from when I was seeing difference between spells. Here you can see the grass is a great deal darker on my private server. I'll see if I can get the same perspective when I get home to properly compare.
---
I'm pretty sure I even purposely made the game (beta) darker by adjusting gamma and increasing contrast.

---
Fun fact: the new one will say &lt;made by (your name)&gt; in the item description.
---
The design around ToC was bad, not the raid itself as a small raid like onyixa, sarth, ect.. The reason ToC is bad is the same reason BfA is bad so it's really the same argument.  Can we still call the raids decent when the design of the game around it is sour?  
---
I think we can.  The game is fun and smooth, but it plays more like a hack and slash arpg than an MMORPG.  So comparing the two is a bit trivial, IMO.  It will never be as satisfying to kill stuff in an arpg than an MMO to me at least.
---
It's a relief. I was just writing that im off because conversations with you feel like on slow motion :)
---
On a side note critters can be skinned
---
Blizzard needs to create a vision and then stick to it. Retail abandoned the vision. Simple at that.
---
Just let the guy paint billions of people with the same brush. He wants a fleeting moment of feeling intelligent and superior to everyone else. Reddit in a nutshell.
---
Yeah, this sub skews enthusiast but I fully expect not to hit 60 within 10 weeks :P
---
I think the pets do only speak demonic, but possibly the warlock does as well.. so when you see someone else’s demon talking on your hunter it’s gobble gook but on your lock you can understand it!?
---
I have no evidence on which to base the above statement
---
10 or 15 after class quests i would say
---
Layering is just a version of sharding. It's the same tech.
---
This is so backwards for me haha
---
If you both start as the same Race, you'll play together immediately, Otherwise, you'll have to travel.
---
Wolfshead helm worked up until the WotLK patch where they changed Furor.
---
Add an increasing timer to Layer switching where by a user can't switch layers too frequently, somewhat like resurrect timers, all you need to do is make it more inconvenient to switch layers than just farm like a normal person.
---
So Diablo 3 basically.  You get set pieces in a couple days, then it becomes boring.
---
Wasn't in your guild but was on the server and definitely remember seeing RoD around.
---
Hope lots of you that made that server great are back in classic.
---
Pick orc warlock and you will not lose against a rogue at lvl 60
---
You're forgetting how while the distinction doesnt matter here, the application makes all the difference at launch. Blizzard has said that this will be made in order to make zone congestion easier at launch in the starting zones. It doesnt make a difference on server communities as a whole, as you, once you get out of elwynn or durotar, will be encountering those people who ended up in different layers during the early levels.

No shit? Legit didn't know that. That should be in the post title...might have less kids in here with "hurr durr stop changing things".
---
I expect them to have a higher percentage than Vanilla but still bottom half, if not still second to last. There's no way in hell they'd beat Warriors, Rogues, or Mages, and unlikely they'll exceed Shaman/Paladin on a per-faction basis. 
---
People know they're strong now, but not everyone likes the playstyle and the person who wants to play an Alliance warlock is still kind of a unicorn.
---
You really need to start to use you head more often lol. Number of online players is the one that layering deals with. Not the number of created characters.
---
Naming issues is complete unrelated to the amou nt of concurrent online players.
---
Why give the hungry a mama pot ever? In Vanilla hunters can drink in his fights.  Dismiss pet, feign death, and then drink all you want.  The hunter is it if combat so you can try and combat rez with jumper cables if need be.
---
doubt it, else they wouldn't say that
---
bro no1 in their right mind would ever spec soul link for anything but duels, what is this meme idea that its some godly spec. ur not gonna be soul link in bgs you want burst damage, you play conflag, you need ruin to do any damage to people. besides soul link is absolutely worthless in pve
---
.....was, yes. For the time period in which this reboot is attempting to emulate.
---
Pretty fucking relevant, mate.
---
18 in 12 hours would be BLAZING fast. If you’re not being super efficient about it just 1-10 can take ten hours.. plus the warrior is probably going to need to do some traveling to learn some weapon skills at some point, which can definitely take some time
---
"Attitude" being, "I don't care about anyone else, but hopefully they care more about me, otherwise I'd get kicked"?  
---
If anyone brings a shaman tank to any half serious raid, they must have been really desperate.
---
That would make some sense
---
Something small like this wouldn't have any affect on the game at all.
---
LOL that's some 200 IQ thinking
---
&gt; Still, to make a difference so huge that asmongold only takes 2/3 to 1/2 of the damage, he must have a lot more armor
---
Well, first off he's not taking 2/3 to 1/2 the damage, he's at most taking like 20% less damage. He's also not getting crushed/critted all the time, "only" 90% of the time (minus his mitigation).
---
You can guess at the damage he's taking by looking at his blocks: these cannot be crushing blows or crits, and you can see how much damage was mitigated by blocking. I looked through the video for some blocks, and only found two before Herod's enrage. They hit him for 166, 178 before the block damage reduction.
---
This actually means that Asmongold's getting hit for *more* than the Warrior in your clip even outside of crushing blows and crits, which means that he in fact probably has *less* armor than the level 60 warrior.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;specialy because the amount of health goes into the damage reduction through armor calculation too.
---
No, it does not. The armor DR formula is `DR% = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 * AttackLevel)`. The only variables in it are your armor and the level of the mob/player you're defending against.
---
Oh man your right I totally forget about it, and I can craft Wands as well, damn how I could  forgot about it
---
I didn't realise this was relatively unknown - I'm didn't discover this myself,  but I did learn about it through a friend when I was levelling up during the BC era.
---
I remember this fairly specifically because it was the thing which got me to start mouse turning instead of keyboard turning for the first time, so it was kinda a double-OMG moment.
---
Have you contacted them via the support chat? They handled everything really quickly for me
---
To be fair yelling at people in grade 2 for standing in the fire is unfair. Give them a few wipes to learn the mechanics first.
---
Sure, if I get into the next stress test.
---
As far as I know it does spawn in one a very few specific places. https://imgur.com/a/m1b7U
---
I haven't decided either. I played Horde from TBC to Legion and I really like the Horde aesthetics. Stormwind does nothing for me, though Ironforge is cool. Plus I hate gnomes.
---
But I'm really attracted to experiencing the pre-Cataclysm Alliance side of things which I only had a little experience with. So IDK.

not to mention i like healing but someone has or is prob making frames / healing addons

-=R.I.P. Vanilla=-
---
I don’t think you’re biased, I noticed in retail Horde usually wins at battlegrounds. I wasn’t sure how it was like in classic because Alliance gets paladins and that might give them an advantage. But Horde does have better PVP racials... I’ll probably end up making an undead warlock :)...
---
Essentially any long cave is a mini dungeon in Vanilla.
---
He's also one of the reason we have classic. He printed the petition for vanilla and went to Blizzard in person.
---
Given the knee-jerk toxicity of this subreddit, I'd probably re-post this and include the fact that Mark was a developer for vanilla. 
---
Hell, I played Vanilla and I had no idea who this guy was till now. 
---
Bunch of people are just going to complain about a random streamer wanting to make "changes" to their baby.
---
I have a general question i read up on the cost's of playing vanilla.
---
And if i understood that correctly it says i have to buy the "current" BFA expansion to be able play on vanilla servers.
---
I dont want to play this worthless BFA expansion and pay 40Euros for that? I stoped playing after i saw what they did to wow with WOD.
---
15 euros per month should be enough for vanilla.
---
If you're melee its a struggle bus. The wolf quest alone in Dun Morogh took me 15 to 20 minutes as melee.
---
8/8 Bloodfang is BiS until Phase 5
---
Yeah, I was an idiot and cut through Andorhal after following the path.
---
&gt; The amount of warlocks on Classic will be very high.
---
Warlocks will become a lot scarcer after level 30-35, especially on PvP servers. Unless you focus on Stam gear warlocks are paper thin, and if you do gear for stamina then levelling becomes painfully slow. As a warlock you will be asked to go to the dungeons first so you can summon the slackers, you'll need to farm dozens of shards before any sort of PvE, and compared to mages, rogues and warriors the damage is subpar, at least until full T2.
---
You'll see A LOT of people switching mains about 1-2 months in.
---
Yea you can forget about that in modern wow.
---
Biggest lie are the gold coin bags that have silver in it

I like your perspective (not sure I entirely agree with it), but as a systems-tinkerer I want to posit the puzzling out of builds, systems, interactions etc as a domain of "actual value" too :)

To think they won't change it again is naive.

I slightly disagree in that the last patch where we go to Argus should have been skipped and Legion end with us shutting down the Portal in the Tomb of Sargeras, but setting us up to go to Argus in the future. The expansion after would, well probably resemble BfA as it would have been us dealing with N’Zoth and Azshara, as they are the final main threats on Azeroth, while also working on making a way to get to Argus... and probably the resolution of faction conflict narratively. *Then* have it wrap up in an expansion where both factions travel to Argus (except not all fel-twisted and broken) to finish the legion in a climactic battle that also is full of callbacks and references to everything over WoW’s history while also setting the expansion to possibly run a bit longer than normal ones since it’s meant to be the final one.  
---
Tl;dr: Argus should have been the last place we visit in WoW.
---
My name is pahbert and I approve of this message.

You are forgetting about the 8/8 set bonus. There is no way you give up on 1% dodge and " Gives the Rogue a chance to inflict 283 to 317 damage on the target and heal the Rogue for 50 health every 1 sec. for 6 sec. on a melee hit. "

Thanks again for helping out :)

watched a streamer last night, respawn was ~10-15 seconds for that quest you mentioned in OP.

Engineering is the best at launch. Goblin Sappers and grenades are good DPS in PvE, and there's numerous PvP items. You will probably want to keep engineering forever. 
---
Your second profession will probably change over the course of classic. Skinning while leveling is a good choice. You can switch to mining or herbalism at 60 if you like. Tailoring is mandatory for PvE once you reach ZG, as you need 300 for the Bloodvine set bonus.

If you want to be a “Hero” you are better off playing BFA
---
There is a large degree of space between "being affected by other players" and "literally being unable to progress in the game". 
---
There will be enough players in the areas that there will be plenty of affecting going on. 
---
And I do play retail casually. I like raiding.
---
Enchanting is a real contender since the wands you can make will provide a large amount of damage during the levelling process (just wanding can actually be better dps than your rotation at points) and having access to enchants is always nice. Levelling it alognside tailoring is pretty efficient too since you can convert crafted gear into dust (you'll be tearing your hair out at the time/expense of getting mats to level enchanting at 60). However if your guild isn't willing to give you enchanting recipes it might not end up the most profitable profession.
---
Engineering as others have pointed out is a great profession due to how much it adds to the warlock kit in both PVP *and* PVE. Other than those mentioned there's no real professions that are ideal.
---
A common strat on pservers has been to take Tailoring &amp; Enchanting and skill them as you level, Tailoring providing gear/bags/dust and Enchanting providing enchants/wands, for maximum levelling efficiency. Then when you hit 60 you dump one or both in favour of Engineering for your raid/pvp group - You keep Tailoring because Bloodvine set is BIS when Zul'gurub launches to craft it for your guildies, keep Enchanting if you've been appointed the guild enchanter, and otherwise pick up Mining for gold farming and keeping Engineering costs low.
---
Loot council is easily the best system as long as the council is fair and not corrupt. 
---
Honestly I see this being the biggest issue facing people who want to play Classic. Anyone who has never done it before is going to be in for a bit of a rude awakening when they start to realize how scarce the raid loot is.
---
Many people, especially those coming from retail, are used to getting spoonfed gear on a constant basis. Having to go even 2 or 3 weeks (or even more in many cases) without getting some gear from the raids you are attending might wear on some people patience.
---
If there is any hint at all of loot council corruption those people are going to start throwing an absolute fit. I've seen many guilds on private servers that start full clearing MC and Ony in phase one, and then regress to being unable to clear the content because people started having attendance problems. 
---
When I talk to the people that stop coming they almost always claim loot council bias and the lack of gear they were getting as at least one of the reasons.
---
There is no system that is perfect. I think a version of a modified loot council will end up being the best, although I don't know how many guilds would pick up a system like the one I envision.
---
 - Petrified leaf / eye of divinity are pre-determined and everyone will know who is next in line before we even enter the raid. Decisions on who is next is made based on attendance, performance, and guild participation. Players may challenge the decision if they can provide legitimate reasoning. Challenges will go to a blind guild vote. 50% majority vote will result in a new decision on who gets next dibs. 
---
 - Thunderfury goes to the main tank. 
---
 - Other legendaries will be viewed as rewards. The guild will blind vote for who gets the rewards when they drop.
---
 - Council may at their discretion guarantee a specific item to a new recruit upon passing trail. Any time an item is garanteed to a new recruit the guild will be informed.
---
 - Any member of the loot council may be impeached except the guild master and the raid leader. Impeachment is started by petition that must be endorsed by at least 15 raiders and brought to the GM. A guild blind vote of 50% will result in impeachment. A new member will be determined by vote. 
---
 - 5 Loot council spots are on the guild. 2 are taken by the GM and the raid leader. The remaining 3 are on 3 month cycles. Every 3 months the guild will vote on new members. Current members can be re-instated and serve indefinitely as long as they are continuously voted on every 3 months. 
---
 - Each raider gets 1 challenge per raid tier. You may challenge loot council decisions. A challenge forces a guild vote for the item in question. 
---
While loot council is the best system overall, it's major flaw is either corruption or, more commonly, perceived corruption. The perceived corruption usually comes from the authoritarian nature that most loot councils propagate. By allowing the guild to vote on who gets to be in the loot council and also adding systems that defer some of the loot council power to the raiders it promotes a much more positive atmosphere that feels less like a monarchy / dictatorship and more like a democracy that everyone is involved in.
---
When the people feel like they are more involved in the decision making they are much more invested in the guild and you still get to funnel loot via loot council to members of the guild that need it most.
---
Does anyone remember WHEN the one hour timer on Vael started? Was it after talking to him or was it when the gate opened or could it be when you kill the goblins?
---
Seriously though... This games not even out, I'm not in beta or stress test, and it's already killing every other game for me.
---
This made me sad :(

lol nah does retail do this? gnome starting area to human starting area is about 20min walk
---
You don't need to buy bfa to play classic. Only have an active subscription
---
You only need a wow Sub. You don't need to buy BFA. Just google it.
---
Even I was considering buying BfA until I heard the news about Classic....that's the only reason I decided against getting into BfA.
---
Exactly. I've played since vanilla and I'm gonna play classic when it comes out, but about 90% of this subreddit is SO over romanticized about what that game was. I had a lot of fun but I also had a lot of annoyances with how restrictive the game really was compared to the current edition when it comes to this "play how you want, it's classic!" narrative. Just be honest about what the game is and enjoy it! It can be worse and still be fun!
---
Layering isn't the same as sharding. In the end it will still be much needed if you don't want to have a start with 5 fps and thousands of people. You would need hours just to get out of the starter area.
---
I'd much prefer a more normal start and they can deactivate it right afterwards when the population spreads a bit.
---
SASS SISTER???? IS THAT YOU??????
---
No, I could be wrong but I'm almost certain you only need an active subscription to play Classic.
---
Were addons disabled during the beginnings of vanilla? #nochanges
---
I'm not sure. There was a post with lots of upvotes here earlier about these pets problems, and its apparently being going over for 2 years or so on retail.
---
You can ask twitch.tv/staysafetv he mains a Lock and reads his chat.
---
I was referencing the wotlk implementation but he also fought against the BC implementation, though it wasn’t as impactful as he thought, I agree.
---
It’s still well within a reasonable level of Suspension of Disbelief. And if you disagree then please tell me how FF14 is very different because with the whole “Everyone is the Warrior of Light” thing it seems to be working pretty well for them.
---
Ive was in a group that had a Shaman tank BRD. It was so awesome that it was a main reason to roll a Shaman. Group really has to work together but it’s doable.
---
If you don't like them don't play with them.
---
There's literally nothing making you install addons. Why force your elitism on other players? Let them play how they want.
---
Also, a dumb poll since it's something that would never happen.
---
And People say classic is hard

didn't know private servers had normal respawn rates when they had 10k+ pop.

I’m pretty sure that’s how it used to work.

Maybe you can get 18 relatively OK in 12h, but doing Dead Mines just after these 12h will be pretty hard since first you'll have to find a healer that leveled as fast you to run it. And 18 is the entry point, Van Cleef will give you and your group hell.

It hurts watching how bad tips is
---
The warrior is moving backwards to get charge range. You can afford a throw.

There is a certain aspect of socialization that will be bypassed with dynamic respawns.

When you taunt your threat is increased to that of the person that has aggro at the moment. This is a permanent change.

---
Criticism of the features that are engrained in retail (Transmog, LFR, Flying) that gradually ruined the live game is heavily downvoted in the retail subreddit but is the majority opinion here. You are going to hear those kinds of criticisms here because Classic represents the return of a design philosophy that is the antithesis of retail. There is more than a choice between two games going on here, there is an ideological battle going on in the WoW community for the future of the franchise and MMORPGs as a genre.
---
Its kind of a raid meme i suppose. Back in a a days some guild masters were perfect example of toxicity.
---
don't train skills you don't need, if you aren't doing that already
---
Even if you're min-maxing your leveling path, you'll still have some occasional downtime on flight paths or waiting for boats/zeppelins you could use to tweak your addons as you go.
---
Everything you do in Classic brings you closer to a micro-victory, you get a return on your time invested, hence why I don't think there is wasted time. Time wasted insinuates that the effort you put in entirely useless and didn't do anything to progress your character. Which in Classic, just doesn't happen. Even world exploring you an pick up flightpaths. 
---
I'm not trying to sound like a dick, but in BFA there truly is time sinks and time wastes. You cram that +10 M+ in on Monday night?  Welp, come Tuesday you got another ring with the exact same stats as your previous six. Grind for months to level your neck? Your friend will get to your level in 2-4 days with a catch-up mechanic. These things are wastes of time. So, when people tell me that Classic is a 'timesink' , it doesn't make any sense to me.
---
This is not the belt from the video,
---
the belt in question in Forest Leather Belt
---
They're will be roughly 500x more players logging into classic on launch than a new pserver...
---
I don't know what addons are able to pull from the client, but more than just tracking a name it should track the class and item stolen, as well as a chatlog at the time of report. If someone reports the mage for "ninja looting" the staff from Deadmines with an attached chat log that shows the Hunter who reported it rolling Need as well, then you have a mod. Allow anyone viewing the database to view each report, as well as showing the number of reports. Perhaps also allow comments on each report if you're planning on linking it to a website.
---
It's not an exploit, it's not bannable and everyone will be doing it on classic. Sorry to burst your bubble, these are the inevitable sideffects of your "perfect" system.
---
but I like them. I just like the idea of not having them at the begining, calm down
---
Oh crap. So close man :/
---
...he's gonna fuck that fish, ain't he?
---
Spoiler alert: Yes they are worried
---
aren't a lot of vanilla bosses taunt immune?
---
Loot Council is by far the EASIEST system to corrupt. This system is mostly adopted by guilds who have already been together in the past and want to ensure they get the loot. Yes, items will trickle down that the council/core members do not need, which will keep outsiders coming back. In the end, garbage system, way to many flaws, is based on feelings rather than cold hard stats.
---
I mained shaman in vanilla, and tanked every leveling dungeon up to and including BRD. I tried LBRS/Scholo/Strat a few times, even with some AQ40 and BWL gear, but really struggled to hold threat and be effective keeping agro.
---
I think as long as your expectation isn't that you're going to be as good a tank as a warrior or druid, you'll be fine, but really you'll be totally fine in a pinch for lower level content.
---
This is similar to Paladin tanking (with less gear support), in that it'll take a ton of effort from everyone to make it work on the high end, and really should not be attempted unless you're very bored/geared/loved.
---
That’s a placeholder icon for skills that did not have artwork. There is a lot of that in classic.
---
I never said SL was good, and BG’s won’t be around for months...

video games on a computer or console bad

candy crush and facebook on phone good
---
beer and liquor bad
---
wine good
---
But you didn't answer either of my questions. Because you can't.  
---
Let me try to explain this so you can understand.
---
The game world was balanced around so many players existing at one time on a server for Vanilla. There are time locked respawns on Black Lotus, and things like Thorium are more difficult to obtain. World bosses will only respawn once per week. 
---
If the population ends up low, then some people actually like that and it probably wont be a problem, but they might have to do merges.
---
If the population ends up too high it will break the game world's balance, as there will be more competition for those limited resources to the point where some might never get to see them.
---
You could say the same about hunter or warlock if you want to go that route, yet more people pick those classes.
---
Free?? Haha^haha

If I'm not looking to wait until naxx or AQ gear to be relevant in PvP is it worth playing this class?
---
Yeah I'm not saying it's wrong, just saying it does keep toxicity going because there's always a brand new debate to be arguing over.
---
don't you think people like this will have already capitalized on the system by the time phase 1 is over?
---
This isn't a private server, you can't just relaunch it 6 months after if you make a mistake.
---
Yeah...then, basically, this guy's word should be just short of law.
---
If he says a specific code was, in fact, in the vanilla version - but at this time doesn't appear to be active....well, we listen damnit, and hopefully it is corrected.
---
I've pretty much never had any affinity for elves in any game. I started MMORPG's with Dark Age of Camelot, played Midgard, because I liked the Trolls from lore. Other races like Orcs, etc intrigue me more.
---
If I ever play an alliance that's handy thanks
---
good luck trying to ban people for using discord to talk to the other faction
---
From a classic perspective it’s kind of balanced. The horde races are physically stronger, and the undead are like that giant spider you find on the bathroom wall, just shut the door and say “Nope.”
---
Yes and no. While you can instantly add each other as friends and group up together, you will not be in the same starting zones depending on race. 
---
Orcs/shamans and gnome/dwarf  start in the same zone. Humans, Nelf, undead and Tauren have there own starter zones.
---
I don’t think anyone else wants to play on a dead server either, but all evidence points to that really not being too much of a concern. Additionally, layering isn’t the only way to prevent server pop imbalances. 
---
What *is* a concern is what this exploit of layering can do to the economy, as well as what it does to the Classic experience in general.
---
I’ve played beta and vanilla from the beginning.
---
Now I’m playing the classic-beta and made the experiences I’ve shared up above... they’ve (obviously) changed the quest-items dropped by mobs to shared loot. At least for the quest at the starter-areas.
---
Is there any hope of not being a shadowbolt bitch at endgame? 
---
I'm playing a lock on a pserver atm and it's just damn fun. So many options to play with and I can micro manage my pets pretty well. Having the fear is probably the biggest selling point. Only level 24. But first trait points got me instant corruptions then going destruction line to actuallt usr my soul stones now that I have a soul stone bag
---
Also, tailoring and enchanting seem to work well together while leveling. Should I continue that or do something else?
---
Priest Spirit Tap does not seem to activate 100% (despite max'd skill point allocation) when doing an escort quest.
---
I was running the Defias Traitor portion of the Defias Brotherhood quest by myself (so no group members), and Spirit Tap appeared to only proc 50% of the time on kills.
---
It looks like the escorted NPC is being treated like a group member. Not 100% sure if this is a bug or just Vanilla.
---
I want to make sure it works this way in classic again.  They removed this method to eat in boss fights in live.
---
48h isnt enough.
---
Game launch on Tuesday, you'll get a fuck ton of player logging on Friday for the week end and a week after that, player who got the itch will join too. 
---
I just think people don't really remember the awfulness of queue (2hr queue to play 10min before a server restart)
---
Correctly functioning dynamic spawns will absolutely work.
---
I was there when a private server launched with 11k users online and it was very playable.
---
Druid and priest are great and needed classes :) 
---
Have you been checking out Soda’s druid play on twitch at all?
---
Interesting that some had to defend themselves for playing casually back then and now we have to defend ourselves for playing quickly nowadays.
---
Shimmering Flats is a great grinding spot due to the high density of Mobs &amp; the high vendor values of the grey items that drop. This could be very useful for sustaining Mana &amp; HP.
---
For certain, and I’m against dynamic respawn as a whole but on launch day in the starting zones? Not gonna be a whole lot of socializing anyway.
---
As stated, there was dynamic respawn back in 2004 as Mark Kern stated. Only during the start though.
---
Then just don't use them for the first month?
---
Thanks for the answers guys, found some clearyfication on wowhead saying just the monthly \~ 15€.

---
the complete misuse of hamstring, no 5-8 mindgaming at all, no shout to stay in combat no anything tbh
---
I used to do that back in the day actually! I also did some gold with Alchemy with shadow resist pots, but then my guild eventually reached Naxx and we needed said pots...so that killed my profits.
---
&gt;I used to do that on all raids to get my mama back
---
That's sad :(
---
Leveling is objectively more difficult in vanilla and is a fully legitimate play style/part of the game on par with endgame. All mechanics in vanilla are equivalent or more punishing than those in retail. Keep trying though.
---
Engineering is also very welcome in raids for using goblin sapper charges. You might be able to go tailor/mining while leveling and save all the mats on an alt. Then at 60 you can swap mining for engineering and use all the materials to level your engineering skill. This probably works best if you figure out what mats you will need to level and build the things you want to use beforehand or if you can supplement what you collected with buying stuff off the auction house. 
---
Obviously, not having mining to continue supplying you with materials is a pain, so this plan has some limitations. Maybe having an alt or a guild mate to do mining could be good.
---
They're shifting focus to collectables and other gaming paraphernalia, my local one has a whole corner of the store dedicated to those stupid dolls with huge heads
---
dont underestimate the melee hunter though! can be good for melee
---
That’s all good then. Didn’t see that part. Nevertheless it’s interesting to hear direct feedback from the original creator.
---
WoW is a western mmorpg, and while I do agree bfa is instant gratification garbage, I disagree with that generalization. There is a reason why Vanilla WoW was the best mmorpg on the market globally 14 years ago, and why Classic will be the best mmorpg on the market in August 2019.
---
Streamers did an event at the start of the test of racing raids full of gnomes and forsaken to AQ gates. There were about 100k viewers for this event. That, like many other stress test factors, skews this data.
---
Thats why you keep rend up lol it's like we are talking in circles here dude.  Dueling as a warrior is not that hard to understand.
---
And this was certainly the best way to go about getting your concerns addressed. Classy!
---
30 min seems way better for some people, but the same issue may arise. 
---
The best thing would prob be to get rid of the layering within the first week.
---
I've never played FF14 so I can't speak to that, I just know that an MMO should not try to create a single player narrative that every player follows through boring solo instanced content. Especially when that content is constantly reminding you how important and awesome you are when in reality you know that every player is getting the same treatment. 
---
I disagree heavily that it's still a reasonable level of suspension of disbelief, I feel like wow crossed that line many expansions ago. I don't think it's reasonable to give every single player a renowned lore weapon just because they buy the expansion and use a level boost and then on top of that have them all run around the same class area where they are told they are the commander boss lord. That's just insulting.
---
That's not what he said. He's just saying that, by comparison, being a nobody doing cool stuff as an adventurer is perhaps more stimulating than being the big hero leading the armies. Surprisingly. I think they're both fun and cool, but we have the latter, and now we can have the former again.
---
lol cute.  MS warrior will never out dos a similar geared fire mage in AQ..... unless he ruins ignite procs.. Your arguments are shit.
---
Nothing solo WB at Vanilla. It's a BC thing (Hunter Azuregos for example). Only broken Reckoning Paladin can solo Kazzak at 60 and we know the bugged Reckoning won't be there.
---
Hunters will farm golds faster with same gear level, but in PvP you'll be better. 
---
If you want to DPS in raids, Hunter &gt; Warlock for most of the content.
---
You’re being overly dramatic lmao
---
Because all the RPG elements have been sanitized from the game and the world barely exists anymore. I think you’re lost friend, have you tried r/wow?
---
I noticed that. Worth a try to submit a ticket in such a manner. How long does the beta go anyways?

This true.  If get right bedhind the tank on omen threat meter to where the raid leader is yelling at me.  Then is FD and just drop off the meter.  Then climb back up till I get yelled at again.  Getting them to yell at me was a mini game for me.
---
Usually how it goes. Management trying to play politicks are afraid to go to their highers and say "We must push for it, our devs think we can do it" because they desperately need than 5k salary promotion.
---
which makes grinding to 60 much, much more pleasant....
---
shimmering flats is going to be like a mini STVietnam I feel like hah, but yeah it definitely could be
---
I assume that the coldridge valley one is much much further yea, this spot rezzed me at kharanos!
---
Kinda off topic, but unless your display is one of the 240hz ones, you should cap your framerate at 60/120/144Hz or whatever your display refresh rate is.
---
I tried to explore the whole world at level 20 on my first character. It was insanely difficult because higher level mobs would aggro from like a mile away. Sometimes I would meet random people who would help me along the way. It was a blast.
---
You need more warlocks and rogues in a raid than druids for sure because you need overall more damage dealers in the raid compared to healers.
---
It is 100% *not* shared post-starter area. Not.At.All.
---
Have fun with that.
---
Skarm has a video of doing this in AQ40. With commentary on the spec. Basically spammed abolish poison on the fights he healed in if I recall.
---
Could you test the opposite? You can ress in Coldridge if you die in southern Wetlands in water afaik.
---
How is it not a concern? I could not find a group on an empty server in vanilla. I forgot which server I played on, but there were literally like 10 people in Orgrimmar at lunch time.
---
against what TOS? the TOS for wow hasn't existed for years
---
If it's a true zerg melee is the only way to tag, if a caster has time to cast it's not that packed.
---
I know that threat is good and so is not missing your abilities as tank. I know that wiping all the caster dps is bad.
---
TIL people are going to full clear Naxx in Phase 1.
---
As for the rest of your post, so much hyperbole and so many assumptions about how things are going to work.  I can’t wait for the day Blizzard gives more details about what their plan was all along and this toxic sub can rejoice and say “We did that!!”
---
I'm also interested in this, most importantly I want to see if there is a way around the global cooldown. Like if you can powershift 2 times inside the global with a macro
---
Sounds like someone’s pissed. Calm down, man.
---
Wow vanilla was instant gratification compared to FFXI. It's all relative. 
---
You're allowed to disagree but this is a pretty well studied cultural fact.
---
I feel like you didn't really ready anything I wrote, but OK.
---
I think it would be pretty weird if the story never really advanced though. Your character does do a lot of that stuff so why wouldn’t they become famous and be recognized for it?
---
I absolutely agree with you. Before beta my only exposure with Asmongold were some clips that were linked around these forums of him going on insane rants while playing BFA. I chalked him up to being one of those toxic asshole types of Twitch streamers.
---
But I've been totally loving his streams during the beta. It takes actually watching a bit to "get it." Like others have said, he's playing a character. But it's a lot more nuanced and subtle than someone like DrDisrespect.
---
what "small community" are you expecting with servers with 5 layers?
---
You can heal very effectively as 30/0/21, I did it for a long time very successfully. 
---
You won't have as many tools as a fully resto specced shaman, but a full resto shaman was very rare back in vanilla.
---
I'm sure calling them fascists will make them and the other users of this subreddit  sympathetic to your plight.
---
Whats layering?
---
 in my experience tauren elemental is going to net you more kills than either troll/orc - the warstomp sets up so many kills, but whatever.
---
Hmmm, Sounds like a good option for me, but yeah who wanna be my friend with mining? xD
---
Just to your first point, a max mining alt in 2 days wouldn’t be that difficult if you really went for it.
---
Eat a snickers
---
&gt; "the armies of the grand alliance are called away to fight the Savage horde in far off lands. It's up to people like you to be the defenders of your land"
---
This is a surprisingly good reason for why we're having to do adventurer stuff, and the sort of thing that a D&amp;D campaign should have as part of its setup. So often the PCs are the guys fixing local town problems when there should be a standing military to just *end* bandits, goblins, etc. Why is the Defias Brotherhood even a problem when Stormwind could deploy a battalion and take turns teabagging VanCleef? Why, because they are off doing major army stuff, and so Stormwind is protected by a garrison and the surrounding areas have small guard posts.
---
It's so simple and kind of cliche, but maybe that's what makes it great.

Nah, he was just waiting for a black lotus to spawn

please do.

help blizzard give us the best game they can.
---
How is org not #1? That city is the best layout of any mmo.
---
Delete this post, mods. It will arouse me.
---
To be fair though, thats only ever apparant in forums. In game you wouldn't even know that new content xyz had a shitload of edgelords arguing over the internet about. You just have the new content that the developers (obviously) carefully crafted to work within this specific niche version of the game.
---
As someone who regularly frequents forums/subreddits for games I like, I still confidently believe we are the vocal minority and that for the most part the sky is in fact no falling when things do not go our way.
---
Do we know if the /who functionality is effected by layering? I could see reasoning for both but my first instinct was that it would show anyone on your server (that you could possibly group with) in the /who results, since if I am not mistaken things like zone channels aren't effected by layering.
---
How dare a game change over its lifespan, for good or bad.
---
Some people still enjoy it as it is, and some aspects of the game are still great.
---
Why don't we give out Epics for everyone? Wouldn't affect the game at all right? Oh wait.. thats BfA...
---
We have answered this repeatedly on this same thread: a single name bank for designated servers would bypass this problem entirely.
---
Never do what you're good at for free
---
There's indeed one that claims they don't stack, but others say they do.
---
It's not actually the blood elf starting area- https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs9wt5/i_expected_more_people_to_make_a_blood_elf_but/eolvkbv/
---
so hot, too
---
there's no reason that the old quest helper database wont still be accurate (at least reasonably so). If that still exists somewhere, we'll have full on quest addons I bet.
---
Copy pasting what I said in a post last week:
---
&gt; So many people have commented about a big issue with layering will be people asking in Zone chats to invite them if a rare they want isn't up. Another concern is that if people are getting ganked they will ask someone to invite them so they can just transfer to their layer, effectively bypassing world PvP.
---
&gt; So my suggest which I think will solve this, is that for someone to layer into a group leaders layer, they would have to actively click a button that does it, and it can only be done in safe places (inns, cities etc).
---
&gt; This way you won't have those issues, and it will be more of a hassle to change layers, but people that want to group together can easily do it since they will probably start from sort of hub anyways.
---
&gt; Other suggestions that I have for layering is a form of a ramping cooldown, so that you can just bounce between layers as much as you want. And that when you log in and the server chooses a layer for you, it should take into consideration what layer you have been in the last few hours of gameplay, and force you into that. This way you can't just log out somewhere and then log back in right away to change layers.
---
&gt; Anyone have thoughts on these suggestions? What would you guys do?
---
The answer is that yours is an irrelevant question  
---
You don't need to know what number layer you are in. If there are enough layers and you whisper a random person, chances are high that they are in a different layer. With layer hopping you don't really care about which exact layer you're going to, you just care that it's a different one and that way you roll the dice (indeed, it's not a guarantee) on hopefully respawning whatever it is you are looking for (copper ore, named mob quest, black lotus)
---
I doubt it.  Its not true to 1.12 AND it isn't a healthy change for the game.  Double whammy.  1 Hour limitation is brutal.
---
You can't simply listen to fans, you need to consider that feedback and eventually protect players from themselves. Something blizzard clearly failed to do. We will see if they eventually repeat that mistake. Simply listening to the fans can be dangerous.
---
There isn't, it's a difficult problem, but everyone here seems to have a solution while making claims that blizz is bad.
---
Not at all? Just saying that grouping is actually quite counter-productive in several ways, and that just because it's an mmo doesnt mean you need/should be grouping during your leveling. Don't project on me, bud.
---
Amazing work on the list, it must have taken ages to put it together, but I have a nitpick, as a true paladin:  
---
\&gt;"*I will not spend time adding classes/specs that aren't considered viable*"
---
\&gt; Lists elemental shamans, but not retribution paladins  
---
:&lt;
---
Thats a great Idea!
---
We should Brainstorm for a solution so EVERYONE playing our Game can beat the Content! So no one is left out.
---
Hands down best vid ever for classic and tbc
---
Im also interested in this. Would like to learn more about it
---
Depends on your race choices and where you decide to go afterwards. There's the initial "tutorial" area which takes you to around level 5, and finishing the entire zone will take you to around level 10. Orcs and Trolls have these in common with each other, as do Dwarved and Gnomes.
---
You can basically decide to meet up at any point, so if you're determined to finish your 1-10 in your natural starting area, you could meet up at level 10 in any of the secondary zones. It's a bit harder for Night Elves to meet up with other Alliance races, since one of you needs to run through Wetlands to get to the other's zone (past a lot of level 20-25 mobs).
---
If you're asking when you'll "naturally" meet up, just by following quest lines? Tauren will naturally meet up with the Orcs and Trolls at level 10. Otherwise, there is no answer. It's entirely possible for you to follow two completely different questing routes, and never meet up at all. The game really is that open. However, the chance of this is fairly unlikely. I'd be utterly shocked if by level 25 you hadn't spent at least some time levelling in the same zones.
---
No, it's the McCarthian attitude towards everything retail to the point of derangement. You don't need to make shit up to justify your preference of Vanilla. 
---
Have you set foot in a single raid on higher difficulty than LFR over the past decade? Or PvPed at all? 
---
I'm genuinely wondering what aspect of the game is akin to space invaders lol.
---
The problem I have with this: Both you and a friend level together on alliance side. You log out in lets say Tanaris. Next day both of you log in aaaaand you are in different layers. So, do you travel all the way back to a capital? Or do you not play together? You get fucked either way.   
---
Resting areas seems to be the far more sensible approach.
---
What timers? In the first month everyone will be leveling.
---
Similar: Allow it anywhere, but make the ability have a cast time like hearthing, and put the player at the nearest graveyard (or inn, whichever is closer).
---
People act like having a group finder (not an automated dungeon tool, just a place to put a listing for your group) in classic would be the same as lfd/lfr, but the difference is you'd be interacting with the same community of people so you're much more likely to socialize with them and get to know them. Not to mention, dungeons in classic take so much longer and there's much more downtime between pulls, so you don't get as much of the "GO GO GO, NO TALKING" attitude. 
---
Personally, I don't see how an official group finder would be any different than that addon that scans trade chat and finds all the group advertisements and puts them in a list for you
---
I like that. lol
---
The Undead also have the added bonus of, I think, generally wanting to avoid conflict. They do not heal like the living do, and while they may not feel (or care about) pain, a damaged body is still not particularly great and it will take its toll as it accumulates. Consider, too, that physical work damages muscles and strains joints, and our healing makes us stronger for it, but the Undead do not enjoy that advantage so far as I know. From that perspective it makes sense that they might be among the biggest isolationists out there, relying on the might of the Horde to keep Gilneans and the Alliance the hell away from the one place they can still call home, and perhaps providing logistical support and supplies in return, but really not wanting to deploy themselves in a military. Well, I suppose they can craft a bunch of constructs for that purpose, but certainly not themselves.
---
Is Ret in Naxx viable?
---
I dont think beta testing gives "world first" rights
---
Because this was a *stress test* and not the actual release.
---
A little sad my Hitler doesn’t get into the stress test video got deleted while complete and utter trash has made it through on other posts, but with the amount of junk that gets posted here they’re probably just cleaning a lot of it up. Can’t fault them.
---
Does the post have to do with the stress test? They are trying to keep everything onto the megathread.
---
Blizzard will do us right. Why? Because layering isn't a business decision. It's a systems decision. It doesn't make them money. They have no reason to exploit the system any more than they need to.
---
LFD/LFR were business decisions. They were used to market patches/expansions as a shiny new feature (not to mention they night not have seemed as necessary if original wow launched with layering to keep server health for longer). This is not that. It's a necessary evil.
---
I think they know how concerned the community is. And they understand why.
---
part 2, tbc. but still good. if u care. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNHQ220s1C0
---
You can sell that stuff now because same realm trade. Laugh your way to the bank.
---
Chuckles
---
Get thick skin, the internet and strangers comments on it, do not actually affect you unless you let it.
---
spirit tap is mana regen on killing blow right? are you sure the npc isn't dealing the killing blow?
---
Yeah I realized that lol, just make your post again, probably some retarded mod who didn't even read your post.
---
Thats why im focused on the social aspect. You cant rediscover, but you can relive the first deadmines run, first raids, etc. from a social standpoint.
---
Its still very rewarding and makes the game way more durable (fun for longer).
---
People have completed it in the beta.
---
This is beyond cringe worthy.
---
Fair point! You're correct. 
---
Basically, whenever I joined raids, I never was part of a raid or guild that downed the horsemen in the military quarter.  I specifically pointed them out because, at least when I review what people talk about, that was considered another one of the 'gatekeeper' fights.  I never killed Saph or KT.
---
I remember clearing the quarter with Patchwerk and then the other quarter with Anub.  Not sure I was ever part of a raid that cleared the Plague quarter... not necessarily because my raids couldn't do it but because I was just there for first attempts and 'non-farm' attempts so they would clear those quarters on their own before bringing in new bodies like me :)
---
[Last seconds of a burning candle.](https://i.imgur.com/7riOpNu.jpg)
---
Not much can be said what hasn't been said before. I'm glad I got in because completing UI beforehand, along with acclimating to vanilla once more is extremely valuable.
---
I believe it was possible as was a similar command to zoom the screen way out which appears to be nerfed in classic beta.
---
Bfa has lots of horde content for you.
---
Not in a true-blue raiding guild. Debuff limits only allow for 2, maybe 3 corruption, depending on try-hardiness. Even then eventually shit just drops so fast you won't have time to get the full duration from them on trash. CoA takes too long to get to the heavy damage ticks, so that's a non-starter.
---
Tailor/enchanting is fine, when ZG comes out you'll be able to get bloodvine which are basically lock bis through late aq40
---
How can it be forgotten wisdom when every other day someone makes a PSA about not rushing
---
The first couple of quests are against mobs that neutral but then the next set are hostile (e.g the bandits in Northshire Abbey and the trolls in Coldridge Valley)
---
These are the moments were I wish the stat weights and what the affect were a little more clear cut in game. AGI boosts ranged weapon damage and Wands are a "ranged" weapon.   
---
The best way to test this would be by removing all of you +AGI gear and using the wand, then again with all of your +AGI gear on. Average the damage from the two attempts and you should have somewhat of an answer.  
---
The brady game guides may have more info on the stat weights as well if you can find someone with one floating around.
---
They might save a full refresh for the two remaining originally-planned stress tests spaced more like a month apart. The test next week is more of a continuation.
---
$15/month if you pay monthly, cheaper in bulk. Can also buy game cards online or use gold from in the BFA version of the game to purchase game time.
---
Yes, and it was a colossal failure if i can't see Ragnaros in SW while others can. It's literally sharding. "but it's beta" that is literally what everyone was saying during the BFA beta. So odd how we choose to repeat history.
---
I believe the starting zone ones are neutral that way newer players can get used to fighting before they have to adapt to aggressive mobs.
---
10 minute restriction on hopping layers outside of major cities, no restriction (or like 10 seconds, something really low) inside of major cities. 10 minutes is going to be quicker than traveling to a dungeon, most likely the group will be waiting on people to get there anyway, even in a zone it can take minutes to get to the dungeon anyway. It heavily restricts resource/rare farming abuse. Is there anything missing with these restrictions?
---
&gt; I don't see how an official group finder would be any different than that addon that scans trade chat and finds all the group advertisements and puts them in a list for you
---
Because those people are on your server. The problem is cross realm anything. Server xfers means you can abandon your guild at the slightest problem, cross realm LFG means you don't need to ever care about the group memebers.
---

---
Where in your account can you find your earliest WoW sub history? I went to check this out of curiosity, the closest I could find was transaction history, which is missing 7 1/2 years of account activity.
---
Sure! I believe you can just take a tram from Ironforge for free and use it to get into SW.
---
Yup.  They're the same exact thing.  If it was layering as they described, you wouldn't be switching in and out constantly.   They made it sound like these layers would be more like temporary smaller servers that would make merging easier later on.  And with the beta population being so small, why would it even be needed, and to this degree, so early???
---
Just go log into retail.. it's free 1-20.  It's the exact same thing.  Who would have thought?? Same client.. same sharding.. 
---
inc downvotes..
---
Oh he will but he'll be stunned the entire time.
---
If I was on a RP server, that would have freaked me the hell out.
---
It would be pointless to message the person who's deleting my posts about his corruption.
---
So uh.... can we talk about this poopsock for a second?
---
ohh look another 10iq monkey, great thread. You are free to NOT use addons.
---
You burn in hell!
---
I read your entire post. Not one bit of it made me even consider it a valid system that should be used in 40 man raids. You start by claiming it is the best system, but then follow it up immediately by saying "as long as the council is fair, and not corrupt".  
---
Corruption is going to happen, people form cliques, kiss asses will bribe their way into loot, officers will try to buy followers etc.  
---
3 month cycles or rotating guild members does not solve any problem. Your whole guild can fall apart in that period from a corrupt council.  The GM and RL are permanent council members, so those are going to be 2 big targets for corruption, and where a lot of blame will fly.  
---
The only part I will agree with you on, is things like Thunderfury, Ingots, etc.. Those should be determined by the GM/Officers ahead of time and communicated with the guild. Those items are few and far between and should always go to key members that will best make use of them.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "console commands"
---
Consider yourself... *aroused*. ;)
---
This is awesome, thanks! Never knew about it
---
People who have played locks during Vanilla and TBC.. what was the biggest cons you found?
---
dang missed it again!
---
I think it’s fine and not even permanent. I think the vanilla elitists need to chill out.
---
Tailoring for bloodvine.
---
Just like he doesn't need shield block on his bars
---
Vael seems more like a modern boss, with unique and challenging mechanics instead of most of vanilla which was pretty dull. The 1 hour time limit on a mandatory boss is very terrible design though, if you want the majority of your player base to progress in a timely manner.  Luckily it won't be in 1.12 ehh?
---
Exactly like that
---
Kinda depressing that such an intricate class devolves into, use that same skill. Forever
---
Even if it was, that was clearly a shard which I thought they said wasn't going to be used like that.  At the start of the video, you can see the NPC right next to him and it doesn't aggro.
---
That *is* interesting.
---
I personally believe 80% of players won't be 60 by the time layering is removed...
---
If you think it was done in error, do as the removal message says, and send us a modmail. This has been removed because there is no pretending this doesn't fall under Rule 3.
---
it all balances out.
---
If your on the underdog side, your PvP skills get much better much faster. And the crowded side is slower to learn non-zerg tactics. So it quickly becomes a target rich environment for the underdog realm.
---
Don't get me wrong, your going to need some grit on the underdog side... But the satisfaction of 2 chars walking into a higher level faction grinding area,  settting up camp, and running group after group after group out of the area, over and over again is priceless.
---
Guess I'm gonna give an upboat and a reply since you are the only person who posted the back-up to your math. TBH, this is what I'm thinking too - seems more like both males are doing more damage than they should rather than receiving less damage than they should 
---
Possible causes I guess are any attack power buffs they may have received as well as sharpening stones. Think this is important because there has been a lot of speculation on reddit that devotion aura is having a similar issue to stoneskin.
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks, man!
---
Yes, if you got BFA you can play classic for free, so why wouldn't you try out "new" content even if you don't think you will like it?
---
Per the tooltip, it is supposed to activate  "after killing a target that yields experience", however I do not believe NPC counted like party members for this purpose. I could be mistaken and I'll have to test more after work to confirm.
---
It’s not that you’re turned around. You just have to step a bit back from the mob. Their cast-range is probably limited to melee-distance.
---
It's funny how 2 of the 3 things you mention are some of the reasons why I don't play retail (transmog and spec swapping on the fly). I believe both of these make the game worse. To me those might make sense in a single player RPG, but not in an MMORPG.
---
I honestly don't think I'll miss anything from retail, but I haven't played retail enough to really know about it all.
---
&gt;  Getting them to yell at me was a mini game for me.  
---
&gt;"Watch your agro Borri!". Oh I am &gt;:)
---
LOL not on hunter you weren't.
---
Back in icc I kept farming 10 man for a shot at whispering fanged skull. It took months and by the time I actually got it I wasn't even excited anymore, it was just a "about damn time" moment.
---
0 also removes blur effects from being drunk. Necessary for ZG spider boss trash.
---
Soul shards.  Gross gross gross.
---
&gt;The ultimate classic experience would really be to wait 30min + for a mob
---
Which is exactly how it's going to be as each layer is about the same as Vanilla server pop cap. I don't understand how people don't get this. They only way in which Layering is actually reducing starting zone populations is if you assume that each 'server' will have a pop cap much higher than Vanilla did. But it's still going to be just like Vanilla.
---
&gt; Hunter &gt; Warlock for most of the content.
---
This is false. Hunters are better in Mc and maybe bwl. They are bad after that.
---
Yeah this is definitely still going to happen, it's going to be crazy trying to get out of the starting zone. This just avoids either super long queues, or too many servers that will need to be manually merged when they start to die.
---
The Horde is literally meant to be bent-back
---
I have mixed feelings about this because I really do prefer nameplates being visible from a further distance especially if you're like a ranged dps. That being said I'm not going to argue if it gets removed because that wasn't how it was in vanilla...
---
I am searching through vanilla wow videos, specifically boss kill videos, such as C'Thun where the adds spawn at various places and trying to find anyone who clearly has nameplates showing at further than the default distance (which looks to be like 20 yards).
---
I did the numbers for the starting NE bow and the lvl 2(or3) variant that you could buy. They all get the correct amount of haste for the auto shot cd. Just the animation time was off
---
Without access to multi shot I could obviously not test the 0,5 sec animation time on that one either.  
---
(For people who are unaware of this. Stings and arcane shots have no animation time - they are true instant abilities. Multi shot has a 0,5 animation just like auto shots)  
---
Regarding latency. I did the old 'use skill without enforced autoshot toggling and obviously that did cause the expected delay - and on the same topic there was no delay on the autoshot casts when the forced cast was on
---
In other words
---
Serpent Sting in your hotbar without a macro leads to a latency equivalent delay on the auto shot cast to start
---
a
---
/cast Serpent String
---
/cast !Auto Shot
---
leads to Serpent Sting and the Auto Shot cast happening at the same moment with no delay
---

---
Oh my god, so THIS is why I always feel like I have to turn down my monitor's brightness when I play retail. Thank you!
---
I can't remember. Can you do the quest at a later level and still gain reputation ?
---
Current known ones.
---
It's not that everyone will abuse it, but the 0.1% will.
---
imo if layering lasts more than 2-3 weeks, someone will make a mod for it. Especially people can develop those mods in the beta.
---
There are already census addons to determine server population. If there is a static max layer size, determining the number of layers is pretty trivial, as is predicting when a new layer is about to open up.
---
It wouldn't surprise me if people made multiple accounts to abuse layering, especially if a guild is working together. Have alts sitting in Ironforge, checking layer status, and have those alts send invites. Then you do a mining run on layer 1, repeat on layer 2, repeat on layer 3.
---
SP is by all accounts the strongest vanilla pvp class.
---
Forgotten wisdom that gets reposted to r/classicwow literally every day. 
---
Thank you. We totally need this thread literally every day /s
---
&gt;~~Vael~~ every fight till halfway into Naxx is just standing still and doing a rotation without overaggroing. It's not even a tight DPS check
---
And even still, fights that are more than just tank and spank only require 1-5 people out of 40 to have any responsibility at all.  If there are NO CHANGES, and seems like there won't be, there are going to be a lot of very dissapointed people when they blow through MC and BWL.  Only thing that will hold guilds back will be time-gated stuff like Hydraxian Waterlord Rep to summon Ragnaros and having enough Ony cloaks to survive dark flame.     
---
I bet there will be guilds that will wipe less in the entirety of all Classic content than they did on any singular end boss going back to Yogg'Saron.
---
Rogues will destroy you in world combat if you aren't soul link for phase 1&amp;2
---
I was looking through here but they didn't all seem to work. Specifically, Details.

A remake of classic suggests they have no faith in retail, at least that's what it might look like to skittish investors. It's only natural. Blizzard probably always knew it was possible but we live in an age where even social media posts can affect stock prices.  I'm still not sure how they convinced execs to allow it. I'd love to see a documentary or something of the entire process and where the internal support for its development spawned from.
---
 "**retail** "

Flying was implemented as just a different means of traversal, instead of a whole new horizon in the game. If there would have been flying enemies, a whole different combat method of flying, with your flying mount having class-specific skills and armor, etc etc (like how Riders of Icarus did), it would have been better.  
---
But as an auto-run easy to get to locations alternative for travel, flying does more harm than good for WoW. I 100% agree with you.
---
Should have just called the skill "Guybrush Threepwood" and we would be fine.
---
Ah I see, I started playing not long after TBC launched, I don't think I ever even heard about Naxx until they rereleased it
---
RemindMe! 95 days "wow commands"
---
Melt anyone 1v1 but youre gonna be OOM faster than some other classes
---
spending money on computers and games bad
---
spending money on clothing and shoes good
---
Was my first thought 5head
---
Oh no, I meant to submit a ticket to Blizz. Not to whoever deleted your post.
---
Considering that he clearly doesn't understand what layering is and how it differs from sharding I wouldn't put too much stock in his opinion on how it will kill classic.
---
Remind me! 96 days "orange"
---
no, if its gray u will get alot of less rep
---
It's ok to rush to 60 if you want to.
---
This would also get abused, so you’d have to iron out a bunch more issues even with this
---
10 seconds on google and i found multiple working ones, fuck me lifes hard.
---
I didn’t portray change as a universal negative - there is a big difference between making a particular change and abandoning the original design philosophy of the game. The continued swing toward accessibility was obviously market-driven but ironically caused the game to slip into a long steady decline.
---
I was just saying the commenter was speaking about end game content. I'm sure it will be fleshed out before then so we know exactly what to expect. Currently they stated layering will not make it to second phase but second phase is also many months ahead of release. I don't expect any problem from it, just needs to be worked out with testers and reports.
---
Yeah they're really good due to significant +damage versus undead mobs. But don't forget that you have to go through hardcore content before where you won't be wanted. You can be this only Ret, but be prepared for long discussions with group/guild leaders about your viability and be sure about being very very good and fully dedicated. For 10 Ret, only 1 will be chosen, be this one, the Vanilla endgame is godlike for you, but most of us won't enter Naxx at all.
---
A more casual guild will take an Elly Shaman. It’s definitely doable. I wouldn’t go as healer because you won’t get any dps gear.
---
Well, no its not a colossal failure. They're testning systems and have said themselves that they found several critical issues during the stress test. They check things by breaking them.
---
Yes, they are going to leave. And after they leave, I still want People to play with. Layering ensures that.
---
And the starting Zones still will be overcrowded with 3 Groups compiting over a single normal mob. Just like on the stress test.
---
The kind of unplayability u will see without it, is like when Asmongold's crew joins up and everything simply stops moving. Is that what you want?
---
Best =/= perfect. There's still potential for issues, but it's better than the alternative. The fact people never have a garanteed spot on the loot council goes a long way in preventing corruption. 
---
Also if your GM and raid leader are corrupt the guild is fucked no matter what system you have.
---
this is very true.  Most rogues will wail on warriors in duels.  Sometimes the warrior may get a good string of crits/stuns/sword strikes if the rogue decides to duel without half of their cooldowns for a win, but even that win is pretty rare.
---
Used to*
---
I think it's going to start at a moderate level (higher than original vanilla) but it's going to drop off. They're pretty hard to play in pvp compared to many classes and they don't have great dps for the first two raids (most people will not raid AQ40 and Naxx, where warlocks really start to ramp up. They level pretty smooth and have an interesting rotation for leveling so I think it'll appeal until the mid-stages of the game.
---
If you look at the Clip, the first time, he is within melee range of the Mob. Also, the cast almost finishes. If he was out of range of the cast, it would have stopped a lot sooner. The second time in the clip, he is well out of melee range when the mob starts casting, and casts just as long as the first.It might be worth having additional testing done facing the mob outside of melee range, but facing it, to see if it finishes the cast or not.
---
*SL Warlock joined the server*
---
Shadowpriest was very strong in PVP. I wouldn't say it was one of the best, but absolutely top 5, maybe 3, in class/spec combinations. Also everyone needs a priest in raids so PVE gearing and then offtiming in PVP will be the easiest for priests.
---
yes, it was just my first time streaming anything at all.. i was testing my fps, but thank you anyways :)
---
Hehe everything is a slippery slope
---
I can agree with that. With so little rage to work with its hard to make the correct decisions.
---
I threw a token at it just so I could test a few things if I got in,but I really don’t want to dedicate a lot of time to beta atm.
---
Getting a break to plan and focus on other stuff during the summer will just let me enjoy the classic experience more since I won’t be burned out.
---
That's why I said most since most will also won't see raids past BWL/ZG.
---
What do you mean?  It happened just like that.  It wasn't till AQ40 where a windseeker rogue gave me some trouble on the meters.
---
Its actually like 10-12k absorb shield. Soda already got it
---
During raid bosses theres a combat pulse that goes off every 2-3 seconds. You get put in combat in a few seconds but you can feign and drink if you're fast.
---
Details specifically is just planned, not yet updated.      
---
Some people have used Recount/Skada iirc to some success on the beta.
---
Drink water people!
---
Attack of the Clones much?
---
The vanilla rotation is just curse &gt; shadowbolt for most locks. BC had viable affliction until SSC/TK when shadowbolt spec took back over. You will be casting a lot of shadowbolt. 
---
Soul shards kinda suck, but when your food buff requires you to kill mobs for the mats, I would farm my shards and food at the same time. 
---
You will get a lot of tells from people wanting a summon to wherever you are. They won't pay you or help find 2 people to assist with the summon. Ignore them.
---
when you target someone. and you type a command in chat. %T will show the targets name
---
so for example:  
---
so if you make a macro that tells the raid to attack a target. the macro will be something like :  
---
/raid ATTACK %T NOW!  
---
it will show up in raid chat as:  
---
ATTACK HOGGER NOW!
---
Warriors, rogues, and mages are all going to have high populations 100%. I'd be shocked if they weren't all the top 3 most played. They start strong and remain strong entire xpac, (warriors are iffy pvp in low gear but that's it). in both pvp and pve.
---
The definition of casual in mmorpg was different back then.
---
They're pretty nasty. S Tier for sure. I'm probably going to start the game as an Undead Priest and Duo with someone to the tippy top. It's so easy to get into raids with them too. I'm just not sure what I'm going to do about talents. Obviously Holy/Disc for Raids... Shadow/Disc or Shadow/Holy(if you intend to switch out of shadow form to heal on occasion, very strong if done right) for PvP. These two conflict though and I'd have to respect often. Maybe I just have to make two priests?
---
oh really, what gave that away? the big blue box that says PLANNED instead of the big orange box that says UPDATED?
---
It's a placeholder icon. The photograph is of the guy who designed the icons for WC3 and WoW.
---
You're the one confusing the two. Yes, layering will help if you consider anything over 3-4k to be the server pop cap. But it's still going to end up being the same numbers you would see when a new Vanilla server launched, and it would still take forever to progress through the starting zones. 
---
And those high server pop caps are irrelevant after Layering is removed as they will either have to Server Merge the smaller servers or transfer massive amounts of people off of any given server to get the pop down to \~3-4k so the game world can exist as it was balanced to in Vanilla. 
---
After the 'tourist wave' and early game congestion that Layering is supposedly supposed to help with, you are either going to have nearly dead servers with only a few hundred people or massive servers with way more people than intended for a Vanilla server (over 4k). I guess it's possible to have the servers end up with the perfect population after Layering and after the total amount of people playing levels out.
---
Technically its still a lie since they said it would come with the wrath expansion pack
---
Write \\\#nochanges to show the \# symbol and the text being bold.
---
A lot depends on what you plan to do with the sheets.
---
Maybe it's enough to track Role and Secondary Role, without looking at the exact talent point distribution. If you don't intend to keep the Talent build updated, there's no need for tracking it.
---
I think tracking the attunement progress can help, but will be a hassle to keep updated. I assume your guildmates can't update their information themselves in your system?
---
Resistance should focus on what's important for raids - NR soaking gear (AQ40 Huhuran) for melee could be a point in the progress/attunement list, for example.
---
A small timeline might be helpful - joined, promoted to Core Member, promoted to Class Leader, stuff like that, with the dates. 
---
I assume raid attendance/items recieved/DKP and similar are tracked elsewhere?
---
Wasn’t warrior typically most played class overall but not most played class at 60? I remember them being quite rare on high level and the meme has been “everyone wants to play warrior until they have to level them” meaning that there is typically a high warrior population at the start that drops off when people realize what it means to level them.
---
That being said, the beta suggests it’s not that bad, since they have pretty good health regen
---
yw :)
---
I don't think you understand what I'm saying. I've found lots of threads and even two websites via google, but none of their DPS meters worked...but maybe reading is just as hard as life :)
---
Somehow showing an email asking support for Classic beta is not related to Classic beta. 200 IQ mods.
---
I made a 19 twink Rogue (Alliance) out of boredom in TBC who had this weapon - I took him to Ratchet and picked fights with people a few levels higher than me, and was able to kill several. Fun times.
---
I'd be willing to argue that flying was one of, if not the worst thing to happen to WoW.
---
According to one beta tester it didn't seem to be the case in classic (I expected it to be that way due to that's how it is on private servers).
---
He was level 30 doing the starter quest of another faction and got the same rep for it.. but that may be here-say. I'd love to get that confirmed.
---
That part isn't even hard because Warriors can start Full Rage bar Execute Spam just a couple seconds into the fight.  They are guaranteed going to be top of the threat meter from the damage output they do, and they all just watch the meter to make sure they fall in the order agreed upon.  EZ PZ.
---
I know what I wanted.
---
SL is one of the strongest PvP builds in the game, as many said, mostly for dueling. However warlocks in general require some gear.
---
You can also play destro later, which is kinda glass cannon but the M A S S I V E crits (even bigger than PoM-pyro) are just epic Geared warlock Soul fire crits are just beautiful. These are very fun in battlegrounds but against CC heavy classes like rogues you will cry, warriors will also probably make you cry since you are immobile. 
---
Overall, rogues and warriors are your hardest matchups, esp fury. 
---
In the end, if you want to play warlock you will be very good in PvP and you have the means to play any type of PvP you want. 1v1, bg, dots, mega nukes etc etc.
---
adding a bit more specific information to the melee weapon 'quiver' feature
---
Weapons aligned to the same shoulder as your quiver would trigger the 'I'm using a quiver as 2 handed weapon effect'  
---
Staffs have a different shoulder slot. A NE female that swaps from Auto Shots to a Staff Melee swing will keep the bow in the left hand and the staff on her back until the first melee swing animation happens

---
Good. I haven't done any 60 PvP content with them, but leveling a SPriest has been easier than any other class for ganks. They are absurdly tanky in 1v1s, with solid damage output and CC; plus utility like silence, dispel magic, and mana burn; along with the absolute trolliest ability mind control.
---
It reminded me of the Twitch plays pokemon run of the elite 4
---
Many people dont react that fast, dont spam tab, etc. Your comment is a gross overgeneralization.
---
Welcome to classic dice rolls.
---
‘They’ve only started rolling out patches! Be patient’
---
Go alliance so we can have better population balance, please.
---
no.
---
Such an amazing quest chain there. Despite such a low level, you really felt the power progression and the climactic battle against the big baddie of the ghostlands. Every part of that quest chain felt impactful, almost like a movie where the main character is uncovering an ancient disturbing mystery.
---
Nope. It seems to be straight up 1.12 all the way through. Pretty sure they're going to throttle Power Levels for raids, and also timegate Raid Releases though. Pretty sure they improved the netcode but otherwise I don't know of much that is different.
---
Yeah, honestly, that's what makes me love vanilla so much. The game is *challenging* in a sense that there's a real risk of failure and setbacks, and it makes you feel like you really accomplished something when you skillfully play around the clunky mechanics and awkward class design and still be successful.
---
Awesome, just read that. Much better in wording.  Here’s hoping I can beat the character creation boss this time.
---
About half i'd guesstimate
---
I think you mean what entertains one person might not entertain another. This means that that there are truths, it’s just that the truths aren’t ever “This thing entertains everyone”
---
Warlocks are the only class I couldn't kill with ease in PVP as a mage. 
---
The fearing lasts way longer, is harder to break, and makes them incredibly OP (in a good way).
---
Never heard of this guy. I grew up watching Niar, Ming and happyminti though and was always so blown away by how they toyed with people
---
How do you reserve characters?
---
It was the BFA version with last minute fixes to make it work with classic, there is still some bugs that I didn't had time to fix because I wanted to get as much data as possible.

---
Thematically the time limit was cool, especially if you were close and all the sudden you were cockblocked by it, felt so meaningful to actually kill the boss.
---
This is clearly exploiting a bug, and would get them banned if it made it live.
---
As someone progging on mythic uunat...yea..this boss is insane
---
Everyone wants the Vanilla experience until they don't.
---
it'd only really make sense to do that if they plan on keeping layering forever.
---
just not worth the effort to code something complicated like that for something supposedly temporary
---
I learned this recently on a pserver myself, although i'd just go about 8 yards out of range. Didn't know you could just turn around!
---
uhh what?
---
pservers have always been tuned harder to account for the estimation work required for most mobs. Your average level 5 mob may vary on an easier / harder scale, but the game in general was much harder. Not entirely sure why people have such a hard-on about calling pservers easier, I guess it's a pride issue.
---
I could, but the servers are down now

The stress tests were open to anyone with a current wow subscription you justbhad to opt into it while it was going on. There is one planned in june and one more in July I think that will be the same.
---
I would be a little bit mad if someone had the guts to act all-mighty and cant even get basic facts right. Youre an idiot. Nothing more to say here.
---
How? An Undead would drown faster than somebody with this buff.
---
If this would be implemented, I guarantee you, no one will layer hop:
---
When someone abuses layerhopping a bunch of blizzard goons (with hogger tattoos, pierced nipples, boxer noses, broken teeth, tight muscle shirts and a stench of alcohol breath anouncing their arrival) come to the players house and they sharpen his legs with an oversized penicl sharpener and then they redecorate his bathroom into pikachu yellow.
---
\*taps temple\* right here, people, right here is where you have to have it.
---
God, I'd be the best law enforcer in the universe.
---
Yeah you have to just skip those quests. Might be some gaps where there's no quests to be done, but it beats  trying to do 1 quest for hours.
---
the 2 easiest bosses in the raid? What? Well way to expose yourself as a troll. Please stop spreading misinformation
---
I was so on board with the scaling zones because I hated constantly outleveling zones, but now there’s no real feeling of accomplishment. Mobs are always just as hard as they were ten levels earlier, you don’t unlock many skills or talents, and there’s no real challenge to finding quality gear - even without heirlooms in the mix.
---
If you’re super duper concerned about raid comp (as in the case where you’d refuse to take more than 2 Druids) you can just fill those slots with warriors, rogues, and mages, in the same way you can fill the most healer slots with priests and pala/shams.
---
when vanilla launched without layering. not only was [blizzard.com](https://blizzard.com) dddosed to death, people couldn't even register the CD key to create the account. Much less log on to play. The queue's were 5-8 hours long without layering. Sure you have a valid point. But your point is valid. Just the lesser of two evils. Being that I went through both Vanilla launch and after seeing beta launch. You are wrong. Layering is better. Blizzard learned from their mistakes. You obviously weren't around to experience the actual launch of OG WoW. It was fucking terrible.
---
have you tried guild wars 2? It's pretty much meant for exploring.. different style of MMO but really beautiful explorable areas and a lot of hidden places that have nothing to do with any main quests
---
Hrm, thats definitely true.  Maybe what if relogging doenst reset your layer, and you wont go back to the 'right' one until youre back in a city?
---
Of course then youre seeing a ton of people youve never seen before/arent on your layer that whole time, so thats a potential negative.
---
How many zones are we really worried about getting exploited?  Could they just disable layering in zones above lvl 40?  By then the population should be spread out quite a bit i'd think.
---
Granted, i have zero clue how the tech works, and maybe thats not possible.
---
*shrug*   Brainstorming here.
---
No, that shouldn’t happen.
---
Very shortsighted view. Sometimes like working together to try something different. We have all the time in world to try new things in this game. This is obviously something you do with friends and guildies
---
Sadly I dont have beta access, so i cant test that :( but if my memory is correct you got close to nothing rep for gray quests in vanilla.

It was amazing for Algalon, because he was an optional / secret / super final boss.  Having it on boss #2...  Just no.
---
Damn. I should follow your strat. I remember turning in so much rune cloth to get exalted at 60 for my lock
---
Yeah, he said he *thinks* this and *there's supposed to be* that. While that's fine and all, I'm inclined to believe the working 1.12 reference client that the Classic team has in their hands. If they look at it and it says yes, there's supposed to be dynamic respawns here, then yes bring it on.
---
Is this the air horn sound effect emoji?
---
Some of my earliest WoW memories are about exploring the world. I grew up playing Warcraft 2 &amp; 3 and I desperately wanted to see up close the famous places from those games. I remember exploring the whole of the plaguelands as a ghost and couldn’t wait to be able to quest there.
---
"Watch my stream, guys!" There, fixed your title.
---
I mean any dungeon is hard if you do it 10 levels under. Not really a great comparison normal dungeons are harder then this if you are 10 levels too low.
---
And what exactly is hypocritical in this meme?
---
Yeah, I saw a straw poll recently where the 2nd most popular "What are you going to play?" class was Warlocks. I was utterly baffled. Soul shard bag-space issues, constant fear of rogues devouring you (assuming you're on PVP), pets that can be destroyed pretty easily.
---
Granted, they had their pros like being wanted to summon and such, but my memories of warlocks in Vanilla was a lot of people happy to see TBC come. Warlocks are by no means useless, but I was surprised by their apparent popularity.
---
hm, I wonder if they fixed that for classic then
---
The guy isn't immune to false memories like the rest of us just because he's one of the original designers. There were people swearing up and down that *this* thing here in Classic was *this* way, and it turns out it wasn't.
---
Trust the verified 1.12 client, not memories.
---
Was only level 56 when TBC dropped, but always had hoped to dual wield Maladath on my rogue; by the time transmog became account wide I was running BWL every week on four different toons for almost a year before I could get it to drop. 
---
RNG is frigid bitch sometimes.
---
For something to be considered the "best" it has to be better than all other options, it does not need to be perfect. The loot council system has so many points of failure that it quite simply cannot be the best. Even DKP is not a perfect system, I don't even like DKP, but if followed the way it is intended has fewer points of failure. DKP is a statistical measure of what a guild wishes to track and reward in a raid team. When discussing general loot rewards, matters of opinion and feelings should be the last thing considered. Attendance, readiness, punctuality, all things that can be tracked and assigned a value.
---
&gt;Classes without an agro dump 
---
there was only 1 class without an agro dump. Yuo were not beating rogue/ fury warriors/mages on dps with a hunter. Not in vanilla you weren't. The only reason hunters are brought to raids is not for DPS. it's for tranq shot and kites.
---
The whole point of layering is to cover the entire continent, so randomly phasing in/out isnt a possibility.
---
Good early on but Disc kills it later.

MAX\_CHARACTER\_LEVEL is set to 10 so you're set for the next stress test, you'll need to change it to 30 if you want to use it on the other Beta realms.
---
Just let people play the game how they want, for some people its world pvp, raid progressing and min maxing every little thing. Your way to play the game isnt better than anyone else's, the whole point here is fun. Fun is what you make it
---
I mean, is it really that complicated? I'm sure the nodes already have some kind of unique ID. All it would be is a log on each character of nodes they've farmed and a check to see if they've farmed that node in the past X minutes whenever they try to gather.
---
Yikes! OmegaLuL PogChamp omg lol

because these streamer cults don't get enough fan boy mail with gold and free items, the GMs need to now send them free items.  you earn your shitty blues and cosmetics. you do not get it for free in the mail.
---
Normally I'd agree but archers are often fun in fantasy games and it seems to often be associated with elves. However, my final play thru of skyrim I created a Leonidas character (Nord) and went with what I thought would be a boring sword and board progression. Turned out to be hella fun once I got enough points into blocking, heavy armor, stamina, and 1h swords. I actually started to feel like a spartan, beating the weaker enemies to death with my shield and beheading the tougher ones. XD
---
I agree it's the first reality check but AQ40 is the steepest drop off of player base/raiding guilds, hands down. You can get through bwl with minimal consumes/buffs. AQ40 really requires everyone to consume. There are no successful casual aq40 raid guilds.
---
As an old school MMORPG player (mostly UO, some Everquest) - it’s clear to me that accessibility is a continuum where straying too far to one extreme hurts the game experience. Early MMOs trended very strongly toward hardcore gamers.
---
The original WoW trilogy, IMO, straddles the perfect “Goldilocks” zone where accessibility is high enough for the average gamer but the game still provides meaningful challenge and adversity that creates emotional challenge and engagement. 
---
It’s obvious to me that Blizzard continued pushing the boundaries of accessibility in an effort to keep growing their market share, to the point they began to undercut the quality of the game. Due to loss aversion psychology once many of these destructive decisions were made they couldn’t be unmade, and over the years Blizzard has self-selected a tiny portion of their overall audience who would be ok with virtually anything (like people who still eat at Subway).
---
An alt could be a mining/engineer and just send you stuff, right?  Or is it soulbound?
---
Eh they're a utility class. We buff everyone and still do dope damage even if it is with only 1 1/2 spells lol. Classic isn't about the rotation it's about playing your role to keep everyone else firing on all cylinders. The dps is a bonus.

---
&gt; I think the layer sizes on the stress tests were adequate. Adding more layers won't make it more enjoyable for everyone. 
---
Guys! Guys! I found the person who represents all of us!
---
&gt; It may make it more enjoyable for you, but I for one don't like compromising on the MMO aspect of a game like wow.
---
I think you are confused about what makes an MMORPG an MMORPG.  Are you saying you actually enjoy sitting there with 100 other people all waiting for one single mob to spawn, and hoping you are the lucky one who attacks it first, then having to repeat that another 6+ times because that one didn’t drop the item you need for the quest? Is that what you think an MMORPG is? Really? We have very different opinions on what an MMORPG is, as well as oir definition of what we consider fun in an MMORPG. 
---
Do I want to be in a world with thousands of other players running. Around doing stuff? Absolutely! Do I want to have all of those playing camping a single mob needed for a quest? Absolutely not! 
---
ALSO: 
---
Apparently, there is supposed to be logic in the game that automatically increases the spawn rates of mobs in starting zones. I don’t believe this feature was working. See this clip from one of the original WoW devs, who states he even filed a bug for this.

I'm probably going to level as mining/skinning or skinning/tailoring
---
crusader strike was TBC so they aren't getting that at all
---
Soul Shards.
---
Full stop.
---
SL warlocks were a goddamn monsters. Even a well geared rogue was thinking twice before attacking one. You can't go wrong with warlock, they're solid choices for both, PvP and PvE. SL build is definitely easiest to duel and PvP with and it's also so strong. But it depends if you enjoy it or not. Personally I think it's one of the more boring builds, even on vanilla standards. 
---
Let's not forget Conflagrate builds too. Definitely more fun than SL for me. They're also good in PvP and it's complete different playstyle.
---
Personally I'm still deciding between hunter and lock for PvP.
---
Yes. So you would run Tailoring/Enchanting from 1-60, then abandon them for Mining/Engineering at 60.
---
So many MMOs have come and gone in between the ages of Warcraft... I've played a lot of them. I tried to get to max level, or find some sort of happiness in them, but they couldn't ever come close to the feelings that we're stuck with Classic.
---
Honestly, something like this might be a good solution to fix the layering abuse. It still won't fix issues like people swapping layers to avoid other people farming the same areas, or mobs like devilsaurs; but for things like black lotus it'd be huge. And way easier than trying to lock people into particular layers.
---
Yeah, but you need people to loot the gear at a reasonable pace. Most of the items that druid wears outside of tier pieces are good with Paladins and shamans, while, warriors and rogues have their difference in weapon preference.
---
I agree that totem stomping should not be a thing through the use of macros.
---
This brings up another thing that is generally forgotten. Different items had different cooldowns in Vanilla. Health potion, health stones, tubers, etc. all were separate so you could just pop one after another.
---
I wished they had chosen a better time for us in EU, having stress test at 01:00 is pretty mad.
---
that's what I was thinking too, but also figure it's only shamans looking for mail gear with spell power on it anyways so wouldnt be too hard to get(since im looking at a pvp focus i wouldnt want that random assortment of cloth and leather on me)
---
Hes not proposing dynamic respawns. He says it should be a quicker respawn
---
What? Did you mean for that to be for someone else? Like the original poster? If so, then that's the joke, buddy..
---
Do you have a source for this?
---
Can’t use engineering stuff without being an engineer. I’d probably make a farming alt with mining/herb to get money and materials
---
Undercity because its delightfully creepy and easy to find what you need.
---
I’m only here for announcements between now and release. On august 27th I’m unsubbing.
---
Theres a lot of idiots in this sub demanding changes to Classic. I would rather Blizz came out and said "1.12, take it or leave it."
---
Wait so locks do have a utility role? You made it sound like all we do is shadowbolt
---
This is super old
---
Not a member of the down vote brigade but just curious, how does your theory fit into the males who roll a MALE belf? Does that strike you as just a tad gay?
---
Okay, so lots of people will leave within the first month, no matter what. Heavy layering (as a sharding replacement) might make it so people stay two weeks instead of two days, but in the end, I doubt many of the 'hard core' would permanently quit because of a crowded launch week.
---
Layering attempts to solve this by overloading the servers massively at the start, so enough remain long-term. I understand this. 
---
The exact same thing could be achieved with merging servers, especially if those have been linked preemptively to avoid naming conflicts. Bonus points are you could just decide to not merge them if the population develops not according to plan.
---
With layers, you're forced to 'merge' them by phase 2, regardless of active population. This is a clear downside to me, I would much prefer small servers and heavy merges.
---
But you’d have to spend a lot of gold on respeccing right?
---
No, its just his clip. 3 out of 5 people were streamers there.
---
I think that's sort of the point.
---
We don't know exactly how it'll work, but we all know it won't be perfect.
---
If that is off the CD it could work, I would add meeting stone areas to that list too.
---
Hell, i started in Wrath and it was still pretty annoying....and we had soulwell by then (and iirc could just spam a target dummy to get shards).
---
Soul shards are probably the biggest reason im not rolling a lock on classic.
---
I kind of agree, but also don't.
---
I think Blizzard was at its peak when it made the game it wanted to make. When the developers actually played the game and released their artistic vision of what it should've been. I think there are certain times when they should listen to the players, but other times I think the players should realize that they are just one of two things: the player, or not. They're not the developer. We aren't owed anything by the devs, which is something I think many people forget. Everyone would be so much happier if they would look at this for what it is, an opportunity to enjoy someone else's creative world, instead of trying to make them change their vision into ours.
---
I watching guide about tailoring and there is a guy who have skinning/tailoring as well, because some of robe require leather for crafting stuff
---
No, it's not.
---
Thanks for doing some digging. 
---
I personally wouldn't mind if it was a bit adjustible but 100 yards etc. seems excessive.
---
100 yards is 91.44 meters
---
Apparently you can't see full history now, they changed it when [battle.net](https://battle.net) merged with accounts (recently spoke to GM to find when my account was created). It stops around 2010 for me.
---
Hey, thanks for the tip:) spamming tab to see it when it spawns is a good idea. Any other suggestions to help out the melee?
---
I think that's the most impressive part of this.
---
The to hit penalty and aggro juggling must have been brutal.
---
Look at all the game adverts, the previous expansions... Pretty much everything has got an alliance bias so that became a meme before memes were a thing - relax
---
Yes, it would be. And meeting stones is a good suggestion.
---
Classic cata would actually be pretty decent, especially if they had the freedom to fix what was wrong with it.
---
Oh that's cool to know x) I'd expect that to be dropped from the code after a while... so maybe this got introduced again by using old code functionality. Authentic &lt;3
---
Good bot.
---
That's three halves, which is one and a half, which means you're one and a half times better than everyone!
---
yeah, but mark is the type of guy that sleeps with an anime body pillow, so i wasn't surprised him specifically chose a female night elf
---
T is a custom used keybind for a lot of people.
---
&gt; Vast majority of us that played from day one didn't event know what an addon was until some time passed.
---
Citation Needed.
---
Some of us had addon installed before we even launched the game for the first time.
---
&gt;I think changing layers from grouping should only happen when you’re in the same zone.
---
I believe that’s how realm hopping currently works in retail. If you want to realm hop the party leader has to be in the same zone as you for you to actually change realms. So I’d imagine they’d have to ability to implement this with layering in Classic as well.
---
That isn't true. What YOU wanted to do and when YOU wanted to do it wasn't casual friendly.
---

Then this one should make you want to play an eh shaman

---
Curse of recklessness elements and shadows should be up on any target alive longer than 20-30sec probably. Sometimes maybe weakness. If you're good you can reckless melee that get mc'd on certain bosses :)
---
Well what can I say.  I was just that good.
---
&gt; Layering should stop around lvl35 zones. 
---
This isn't how layering works.
---
this
---
I used an old link from years ago I found on a forum post and it worked, brought me to the old account UI and everything.
---
You don’t breeze through BWL while not trying, this is not true at all.  90% of the guilds haven’t played private servers and didn’t make it past BWL back in the day.
---
Hunter is fair easy to learn and do decently with, but have a high skillcap with their macroplay and pet control especially in PvP. But it can be fun if you like games like Pokémon - catching wildlife to learn new ranks of pet abilities and all that.
---
Warlocks are fairly easy too and very forgiving. 
---
You shouldn't be scared of lower rank spells. You'll get to spend A LOT of time with your spells each level (; so I wouldn't be afraid of not getting it. You'll know the exact manacost of X rank and it's dmg or healing value. 
---
Fx When you find yourself going OOM by using your highest rank heals, you'll try out a lower rank and find it suits your needs as it heals the party without issues, but saves your mana a bit ^^
---
With lower rank spells for dmg it's mostly just a rank 1 of something to apply a debuff with a faster cast - like 1 second frost bolt for a slow, 1-1.5 cast fireball for a DOT so the enemy can't stealth.. small nuances like that
---
It’s not a bug is a purposely built-in feature of layering
---
Banned? Lol
---
if they aren't into the social aspect of mmos why are they playing vanilla...? yes, okay, if someone is vehemently against putting people on their friends list or is so anti social they get kicked out of all their guilds, they may have a tough time finding quick pugs for their dungeons or a decently paced raid. they also have bigger personal issues at play. and there are dozens of other activities they could enjoy in the game that requires no group at all. you are being ridiculous and keep moving your goal posts so we're done i think.
---
it's just a fact that vanilla wow was considered a casual mmorpg enjoyable by all types of players, and this remains true today.
---
They're still pretty good, especially 1v1. In a group fight, some hybrid that goes down shadow to get silence is probably better. As long as you're dispelling, willing to drop shadowform to throw out some heals, and silencing when needed you can be very useful in a group fight as well as small fights.
---
This is true. I will probably do this at launch, but in the context of the Stress Test, I assumed they want people focused in those areas so they could adjust and tune layering, so I focused on trying to complete those quests.
---
The only thing that addon would need is /who and the chat api, so it would be difficult to shut down unless Blizz took a lot of other addons with it. Most of the popular addons use the chat api.
---
Blizz probably won't say what the max layer size is, but people will figure it out quickly unless there is some dynamic/random factor to it.
---
weeeeeell its less complicated than it was the first 3 times i read it before posting
---
i hate when this happens
---
&gt; Every Nerubian will probably get a bug report too.
---
Was about to ask why. Then I thought "hey, technically nerubians are insects". Then I giggled.
---
What did fury warriors and mages do? Warriors have no aggro reset and mages?
---
Early on hunters are very good damage dealers.
---
Maybe technically but layering doesn't create issues like character renames or loss of server identity.
---
RemindMe! 95 days "This is cool"
---
Oh no some people will farm a bit more ore in the first 2 weeks of launch, disaster
---
I ran to the gong in silithus

Holy shit if more people approached Classic more casually like you. Especially on r/wow I've seen so many posts/comments from people who didn't want to play Classic because they don't have that much free time like back in the original vanilla. I always tell them they don't have to play hardcore like back in the day. I think there are more than enough things to do for casuals in vanilla.
---
Like, I play max 1-2 hours daily these days, maybe not even that because I don't enjoy BfA and I also have less free time. I still managed to clear HC raids, get 2.3k in PvP and 415 ilvl. I've never become another casual LFR hero. And I'll approach Classic in the same way.
---
&gt; i doubt a quest helper will exist above level 30
---
Questie is working on beta right now and has already recieved several updates for quests pservers had wrong.
---
If you think that, you truly don’t know how layering works
---
Anyone who gets this should be worried.
---
I’m pretty sure the Elly gearing is a mixed bag of mail/leather/cloth because of the severe lack of mail spell power gear. And also spell power rings/neck/trinkets/weapons are quite crucial.
---
A source for what exactly? Vanilla server pops? Layer pop?
---
Vanilla server pop limits were about 2.5-3k.
---
 [http://progression-annexe.blogspot.com/2016/04/how-many-players-was-there-on-vanilla.html](http://progression-annexe.blogspot.com/2016/04/how-many-players-was-there-on-vanilla.html) 
---
Layers are 3k.
---
I can't wait to get addicted into WoW again. BfA has almost cured my addiction.
---
Lol @ world first
---
It was just an example. "If the 1.12 client said Ragnaros was supposed to spawn in SW every night, so be it." That sort of thing.
---
RemindMe! 95 days "treat yoself"
---
NEVER TAKE THE SHOULDERS GUYS
---
ITS A BAIT
---
From October 2018 - based on private server knowledge or perhaps an earlier patch of vanilla. I know for a fact they changed the rep so you'd get the full amount even if it was grey - but I cannot remember when.
---
So it's still in the air until confirmed by a closed beta guy ^^
---
I prefer not having 2k other players trying to kill my boars and pick my apples in durotar.
---
It's going to be an uphill battle for sure. If you want to dps and get dps gear without pulling your teeth out and begging and arguing roll a dps class.
---
Speaking only for myself, I am perfectly happy sitting the first week out and waiting for things to calm down a bit. I have done so before. I don't think I was missing anything important.
---
as the common phrase goes in retail, ("exploit early and exploit often.")[https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/search?q="exploit+early"&amp;restrict_sr=on]
---
I doubt it would be complicated, adding a few columns to a database but if they are only going to have layering for tops a month I dont think its worth the money (dev cost) to actually implement it and test it.
---
You also won't be able to get your mount until Dire Maul releases
---
You can keep in touch with certain streamers and see if they announce what server they will be on, otherwise if it's a disturbance after that you can reroll somewhere else
---
5x the amount of Lotuses available, horded by the best guilds who will farm 4-5 layers means nearly everyone can pop flasks
---
I used to do this in TBC so it should work in classic.
---
I want _some_ of the Vanilla experience. I want all the good things from Vanilla, and none of the bad things.
---
Lmao the consensus is that its much easier to level on beta than privatw server so far. Mob aggro range and density is reduced and many mobs do less dmg. Again, using false premises for your arguments.
---
Glad you asked. Those who roll male belfs are the Chads of the WoW community. It's the equivalent of wearing a pink shirt because you are super comfortable with your sexuality and wanna rake in the p\*\*\*\*.
---
[They are have not](https://i.imgur.com/qKIXkcm.jpg).
---
well he did cross 16,000 subs
---
Why do we have to have faith?
---
Blizzard released the next Diablo on mobile. Do you really trust them to make smart moves?
---
Implementing layering at all....... with this decision they’ve shown us they prioritize a bit of profit over player experience.
---
Despite getting crit and crushed on the majority of herod’s attacks
---
Not true. Still plenty of time to make things true to actual Classic
---
Want others to have the same handicap or it's not fun.
---
Understandable. Funny thing is if you watch the video linked in that linked comment you actually can "fly [in] there" (the ruins area by the coast) just not from the outside--contradicting the person you were joking with, in a sense. :)
---
Unfortunately this is what people think I'm saying even though I never said instant gratification was bad nor good. People just want to turn this into a racial competition in any way.
---
It's OK Blizzard only gave Beta access to streamers who entertain 10 year olds or to people who hate Classic and still play BFA.
---
You won't recreated that feel ever again. Classic 2.0 won't help.
---
Literaly unplayable.
---
Ouch, guess they really will be buffing non stop. Almost a shame as some of the classes will be returning to their broken state... but if they were fixed then it wouldn’t be vanilla I guess
---
i dont think anyone has even done it in 3 days mate
---
Kreygasm
---
literally unplayable
---
BFA: You are a hero doing errands
---
Classic: You are a soldier doing heroic things
---
oof, I hope they fix it, cause that was so nice to have
---
When geared the best 1v1 class. Some issues in bg and world pvp with mana, but if you manage it well and use pots you should be fine.
---
Are you going to play a warlock again for classic? Thanks for the write up on everything. Anything else you can think of worth noting?
---
What's 5-8 mindgaming, friend?
---
Those things aren’t exploits, they are features of layering.
---
There is no way around it other than capping the number of layer jumps you can make within a given time range, and even that still leaves layering open to guild abuse where they can spread gathering among multiple members
---
Black lotuses are supposed to be rare, with layering they will be ridiculously common
---
I'm thinking of going full memes by building a firestone warlock (or at the very least enabling the option using macro scripts and whatnot).
---
So far I'm planning this [build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/ATAEzMH4HATDDcjE) and I found this [item](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12531) to find and use.
---
What other options do I have in terms of gear and just how stupid is the idea?
---
Now if only other people were as reasonable as you. Even with layering in the Stress test AND grouping up for quest mobs it took around 10-20 minutes to kill 12 Vile Familiars in the Valley of Trials.
---
yeah they needed to come up with some excuse 
---
we cant do it is much easier than we dont want to do it for people to swallow 
---
they also may have had to do a bit of digging to find whatever they needed
---
notice how they have never mentioned anything about BC or Wrath having any issue , just like o if classic is popular we could do that 
---
By the end of vanilla wow was a massive game i just find it unlikely not a single person though hey maybe we should keep a few backups of old code, you know just for a reference if we ever have issues 
---
for example if say some huge bug was introduced with BC its nice to be able to compare pre bc code to bc code , say every 5 days the servers just stopped spawning mobs or something strange. Its much easier to find a bug if you have code to compare from a working version.
---
edit: cool
---
Well on the plus side, at least layering is gone after phase 1.
---
Keep the hype train rolling !
---
Yea, on retail you can just fly to that area. On classic/vanilla you have to swim along the shore to get there. 
---
On the client I have, I can also just fly there, but in the old world. :)
---
Hit F6 and let them know.
---
Thanks.
---
not being able to DPS with curse of doom or agony because I had to be a support curse for mages.  Pets would die to aoe like a bitch unless you sacc'd them or had the imp phase shift.
---
very much possible
---
In this sub we’re trying to make Classic better by having discussion about layering.
---
If you want to be toxic go back to retail.
---
&gt;If you're annoyed by overcrowded zones - just wait. It will pass. Classic  is a marathon, not a sprint. One week, give or take, won't matter at  all.
---
Never play on patch day used to be a thing. If you want to power through crowded zones and be among the first to 60? Go for it, power through, get ahead of the pack. Prefer a more relaxed experience? Start one week after launch. You certainly won't be alone still, and you won't miss anything.
---
Layering wont solve the fucked up starting zones. 3K players per layer will result in fucked up staarting zone no matter what. So if they want to solve the starting zones issue its not gonna happen with layering.
---
ah thanks :)
---
ah, yeah the non armor pieces would be very contested otherwise that's a good point. I just wouldnt think I'd want to go into pvp with anything but shield+mail since I have no way to really peel for myself with a warrior/rogue on me - so i need all the armor I can get.
---
While this demonstrates an issue with layering which can be fixed, it appears the vast majority of you don't understand what layering is.
---
Yeah you’re definitely right
---
You get almost all the dps gear you want, all the tier sets are dps gear only gear that will be hard is rings, neck and trinkets and there are ok ones outside of raids or in zg ones it releases. And going as a healer is almost the only way doubt many guilds will bring elemental shamans and if they do they won't have gear prio. But never fear as the guild wants 8 if you it is easy to find a home
---
I actually went to test and the damage does not increase on pservers, shadow bolt rank 1 damage was still 12-16 on mobs like it says on the tooltip.
---
Thats something that I never quite understand about the retail hate. Mythic is one of the best mechanics ever added to the game. Sure, there are some issues, but it keeps 5 man content relevant. To easy? Turn it up a notch, 'till the difficult is straight up bonkers.
---
&gt; There were people...
---
How many of them were actual WoW Developers?
---
I'm sorry, but your vague anecdotal comment about a vocal minority of literal nobodies isn't an appropriate comparison against someone who had a very large part in this game even existing.
---
And he's speaking about a very specific code function. Not vaguely mentioning "this feels a bit off".
---
Yes I know people will certainly abuse the system if it’s easily a useable. That is why Blizzard will hopefully find ways to combat it. As others have stated, all they would have to do is keep an account locked into a certain layer for a set period of time after logout. Now, I feel it will be a little harder to combat people who use a 2nd account or friends to switch layers.
---
lost me at "no loot council" sadly. imo the only way to gear a guild properly
---
Does he actually? lmao
---
Why would Vael despawn after an hour? Was that intended or a bug that just never got fixed? It seems a little strange that a boss in an instance would completely screw you if you didn't down it in an hours worth of attempts.
---
Thats completely possible. Just go to IF and use the Tram to SW then walk to the starting zone. May take 30 - 45 mins tops. Ill test it on pserver when I get off work.
---
guys. think about this. what if it's real, but it has such an insanely small drop rate that no one has ever found it in almost 15 years? DUN DUN DUN
---
This seems to be 1 stamina too weak. Vendor trash
---
Exactly. The other guy was supporting server mergers but doesn't like layering. They're extremely similar.
---
I liked playing gnomes but always preferred questing through the human areas, so you definitely can. Here's the basic path:
---
1. Follow the [road to Ironforge](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v7zFQIk8p04/Td9Th3x35FI/AAAAAAAAAKw/1of96AExX9U/s1600/WoWScrnShot_052611_225825.jpg) from Coldridge Valley
---
2. [Just inside the Gates of Ironforge](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/4/4d/WorldMap-Ironforge.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140213192958) you'll find The Commons; run to the right from there to the Military Ward, then continue this counter-clockwise path up to Tinkertown where you'll find a tunnel to the Deeprun Tram
---
3. Wait for a Tram to arrive at either station, hop on, and DON'T move around. If you fall off, you have to walk the whole way, and it is LONG. Trams come like every minute or something.
---
4. Exiting the Tram from the end of the line, you'll find yourself in the [Dwarven District of Stormwind](http://wow.gamepressure.com/gfx/maps/42.jpg). You will want to make your way to the canal and cross the bridge to either Old Town or Cathedral Square, stay by the canal and find the next bridge to the Trade District, and follow paths to the Valley of Heroes at the bottom to leave the city. 
---
5. Finally, from [outside of Stormwind] you will follow the road down to Goldshire, then take the other road going north up to Northshire. You'll see on the map you could ignore the road to Goldshire and cut through the forest outside Stormwind, but you'll be level 1 and you might aggro some lvl 3-5 baddies - so it's up to you.
---
Once you arrive at Northshire, that's it! That's where Humans start.
---
Not a single comment about how much easier it would have been with a proper group? Change retripaladin for a hunter and it would have been smooth sailing.
---
Asmongold keeps talking about not artificially make things harder, so why then bring a paladin with no damage?
---
Layering basically is a shard for the whole world. Ideally they want 3k people per layer to mimic a normal server. Thing is, these layers are all contained on one server, so when time comes to merge servers, it will be a little easier for Blizzard technically.
---
That is the entire appeal - it’s a little easier for Blizzard to merge servers using layering.
---
They either chose that approach *knowing* it would open up the door to exploits and player abuse and ruin the economy, or even worse, they chose that approach not knowing it would do those things.
---
In either case it’s a terrible decision
---
locks are super in demand for all the uses their soul shards give.  you will have 5-8 people helping you before raids to gather enough soul shards so you don't have any space for water and be told to just life tap if you need mana and this priest/pal/shaman will pocket heal you.
---
Regular sharding in starting areas fixes that
---
Layering was introduced to make server mergers easier
---
You know, it sounds brilliant, but a really good example comes to mind that just seems to disagree (and maybe it's not a hard set rule).  in Cities: Skylines, the obstacles are fairly thin, you're really just given a few hurdles before you build the city of your dreams.  There's progression, but it's almost certainly assured.  I don't even think it is possible to lose at the game.  And, this being said, it's a very fun game.
---
On the flip side, when I play something like Civ 6, when I get to the point where I have a very clear path ahead of me to win (I've conquered 51% of the map, etc.) I tend to stop playing that save file, even if I know there is the occasional surprise war or set of natural disasters that might need my attention.
---
So back in the day the damage increased even if you did not gain any spell power from anywhere? Got any proof of this?
---
Layering wont solve the fucked up starting zones. 3K players per layer will result in fucked up staarting zone no matter what. So if they want to solve the starting zones issue its not gonna happen with layering. Layering can and will fuck up the economy and the community of classic.
---
You're right. I won't be able to recreate playing with my mom dad and sister in the same room while raiding MC. I'm married and have a kid now. There's no way I'd be able to go back to middle school and live through those golden years again without a timestone.

---
How are they for PvP in classic? Also what professions should I have?
---
oh thanks i did not know , is it as bad as the old vanilla version or does it have better markers and stuff
---
really hope it has the tomtom green arrow added just to help navigate to quest starts
---
I know people may take some issue with wanting a quest helper but i personally never really liked questing
---
Regular sharding would fix that
---
Layering is far too extreme a system that applies to the whole world and allows endgame resources to be farmed
---
i read that post too. It's a good sentiment i think.
---
I know and it should be changed.
---
thanks. that's true i forgot about what a high demand shaman are just for putting totems near every group.
---
August 12/13 depending on your region. You’ll be able to create up to three characters per account.
---
Not sure if they will because I think it is/was considered an exploit :\ reported it anyways
---
This video is not very famous but ive had it on my HDD for over a 10 years and its kinda gotten pixelated. :D I downloaded it from warcraftmovies or googlevids very long time ago.

I want to take it more slowly as well and I guess I will have a kind of big ignore list. I can't stand people who tell me I MUST do certain things to be most effective or fastest or w/e. As soon as people start to tell me how they think I should play it's /ignore.
---
Worked in LoL and Hots, and I'm optimistic that it will work in classic
---
you are retarded if you think a little extra ore for the 1st 2 weeks will break wow.
---
Thank you, I did bug report at the time as it did seem out of place.
---
Layering may last 2-3 months. People reach 60 within 5-6 days. That would leave potentially 10 weeks of uninhibited black lotus and devilsaur farming for top end guilds
---
That would decimate economies and give those guilds insane monopoly power
---
Comment to see later.
---
Layering literally is sharding for the whole continent.
---
No they haven't.  They have banned people participating in illegal activities.  If an ENTIRE guild gets banned,  it means they were all doing it.  You don't get banned because a guildmember broke the rules.....unless you were doing it with them.
---
&gt; Guys! Guys! I found the person who represents and speaks for all of us! Tell me, what else should I find enjoyable, please. 
---
I don't know if you're incapable of reading but saying "it won't make it more enjoyable for everyone" is not the same as "it will make it less enjoyable for everyone". I said that not EVERYONE finds it enjoyable, which means people have different opinions. How on earth did you interpret that as me saying what you should enjoy? 
---
&gt; We have very different opinions on what an MMORPG is, as well as our  definition of what we consider fun in an MMORPG. What I find enjoyable  is advancing the quest story line, and being able to buy new skills. 
---
So it sounds like the part about this MMORPG you enjoy is the things you do solo? Then yes, we absolutely have different definitions of what we consider fun in a MMORPG. 
---
I enjoy playing with other players. I don't know if you even played the stress test, but there were never 100 players competing for one single mob, the \~3k layer sizes prevented that. Sure, there were multiple people competing for mobs but that is to be expected in a game with other players. You're supposed to interact with other people in an online game. I put forth my opinion that the layer sizes were adequate in the stress test, and I stand by that. 
---
It's just sad that you can't talk about this without building up a straw man with stuff like this: 
---
&gt; 100 other people all waiting for one single mob to spawn 
---
Did you really find the stress test experience to be so unbearable? I enjoyed it fully. It was populated enough for it to feel like a full pop server while still being layered to a point where you could quest without too much issues.
---
Sure, but it can be mitigated. Put a timer on it or something.
---
I agree. I hate the idea of people vanishing in front of me because they found a new layer. It bothers me Blizzard thought it was necessary to do with the whole world instead of just starting areas
---
Way worse than the original idea of sharding ONLY in the starting zones. It will fuck up the economy and the community, cant wait for ppl to disappear in front of me cuz they got an invite from another layer.
---
Terrible system it needs to go.
---
There's also a video of 40 priests mugging Onxia. So yes, gear solves everything.
---
The fact your downvoted for a legit comment makes me worry about the state of this sub
---
\+rep on this cause I wanna know as well.
---
Actual WoW developers for the launch of a game 15 years ago, who left, made a failed company, and then got voted out of said company. Yeah, real Grade A material there.
---
And he specifically mentions this *vague* code function was in place because they were worried about launch.
---
1.12 is not a launch database. Clearly. So *if* said mechanism was in place, it wouldn't be in place in 1.12 and therefore isn't a bug.
---
He's exactly like that vocal "minority" you mention, remembering things that were either not in place, or were from an earlier patch and don't have a bearing on 1.12.
---
Dang, I may be in the minority here, but two of the three things you're going to miss are the things I hate about retail lol. 
---
I hate transmogs with a passion. In the old days you had to earn what you wore. Your prestige and skill were displayed through how your character looked. There was much less emphasis on how good a set or group of gear went together and more emphasis on, 'holy shit, that guy fucks!'
---
Don't care one way or the other when it comes to raid size, I probably won't put enough time in to experience that again.
---
There isn't a major penalty to respeccing. It caps at 50 gold, if you really **needed** to respec that often, you could afford it. But most importantly, the respec penalty means you have to think about your talents. It adds weight to your decisions and gives you the feeling of making your character how you want it to be. Same with Diablo 2 -&gt; 3. The challenge and allure of D2 is saying, I want to make a character that does this, what gear do I need? Diablo 3 is the opposite. Here's my gear, what skills do I need? The choices are made for you.
---
Shaman tank is all cool and fun in dungeons. I've enjoyed watching cdew tanking but please don't expect to bring them in raids so casually. Not everyone has all the time in the world anymore and it's miracle to bring 40 people together when so many of us work long hours. Gathering consumables and money takes some time and ''wasting'' it all for some testing will make people angry.
---
The next thing is warrior trying raid healing with first aid or hunter pet tanking. You need something else than just couple of friends to make that work
---
A few weeks is enough for some people to get 1-60 though (Super sweaty nerds) but still, thats enough time to do alot of damage.
---
All raid content in Vanilla was relevant, even when Naxx released. Keeping up isnt a requirement.
---
I wasn't really expecting a well thought out response, thank you.
---
I agree that some things were better in certain ways with the old design philosophy, which is one reason i'm super excited to play Classic. 
---
I also have enjoyed countless of hours in retail farming mounts, transmog, achievements, and other things that are effectively the antithesis of classic, so its definitely dissapointing to repeatedly hear that the things I love have "gradually ruined wow" over and over. I think many of the people claiming this subreddit to be toxic have similar thoughts.
---
Correct, however it's still a bug I would assume as the UI should be using the hitbox's to measure the interaction range, correct?
---
bleh, we can hope. Thanks for checking and such though.
---
Are you going to get to your point or just leave it there?
---
Nah there's nothing lost about millenials or gen x
---
I find  [https://itemization.info/](https://itemization.info/)   invaluable for creating my lists (I'm not affiliated in any way).
---
Use [classicdb.ch](https://classicdb.ch) to find where it drops, Excel or equivalent and there you go.
---
I'd say it is reasonable to play as 30/0/21 if you play as a healer in healing gear. You might have to respec ones aq is released but you should be fine up to that. Be prepared to play alot of zg when it arrives you need some of pieces like neck and rings that normally goes to dps but if you hang in there you'll get them ones the locks and mages get them.
---
Not a problem at all, go fast and min max if that's what's fun to you bro, this game is for ALL of us.
---
RemindMe! 95 days "git gud bro"
---
You can still abuse it by getting someone from another layer to invite you right? If you have 1 friend in layer 1 and another friend in layer 2, can't you just hop between layers?
---
Never played horde and I'm excited to read all the quests.
---
I ended up not running RFC on my first toon because I got so frustrated trying to find the entrance.
---
you can't just weigh stats, a lot of Classic items have procs that aren't straight stat based and aren't straight foward. 
---
Unstoppable Force (epic 2handed mace from AV rep) is a great example, it was a proc based knockback that was eventually changed to be a proc based stun. The proc has very limited use in PvE but the mace itself (from what I remember) isn't bad.
---
About the first link your reply "MC Ninja Loot", there is this parody of it:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ox4rMzY0zI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ox4rMzY0zI) 
---
Freaking hilarious.
---
Layering will be in place for a while, maybe a week, maybe 2, but it won't be there once Phase 1 ends, so this might help you in the starting rush to 60 if you plan on doing that.
---
I think this sub is at that point where there's more people complaining about the complainers than actual posts of people complaining.
---
I'm not talking about cross realm. Like I said in my post, when I say group finder I'm talking about an *in-realm* place to put up group listings, like at innkeepers or something.
---
Relogging in
---
Joining dungeon groups and quitting, repeating
---
Contacting guild mates
---
It will only take guilds about a half hour to find the number of layers on a server and plant a man in each, then hop members between to farm resources.
---
Comparing to the golden era, they have no subs today. In wotlk they (Blizzard not Activision), reached 11.000.000 of active accounts, then at the end of wotlk they started messing with the game so that anyone was able to access everything. The number of subs gone down to few millions and then they gave no more numbers at all. Legion was a good expansion but the rest was shit. They were in need of classic to take back all those lost subscriptions.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "dewit"
---
Yeah, it means your initial comment is nothing but bs 😂 let me know if you want me to clarify further
---
Both are pretty popular, but I'd say mage if you want more raw dps.
---
Yeah it's rough but if you have interest in PvP and PvE like me, that's a solid plan. It will suck a bit not having engineering til 60 but it's usually too hard to justify buying every material off the AH for engineering without any mats at all. You'll need that gold
---
Not having enough bag slots for items because of soul shards
---
Every server will be a streamer server.  Some one will be in your guild streaming guild chat.
---
Yes, and I'm pretty sure you can't see a node from another continent, so this wouldn't happen
---
Nice, I remember this one from a long time ago. Hunter is cool it's like you always have another player with you.
---
You'll have new memories of playing with your new family. That will be nostalgic as your kid grows up and moved away. You're living in a time you'll long for *now*.
---
I guarantee you that if simply steps back while facing the mob when the cast begins, the cast will stop. Was like this in vanilla as well.
---
I have not actually, I did really enjoy the 1st one though and I've been meaning to try it at some point
---
Layering wont solve the crowded starting zones. 3k per layer will result in fucked up starting zones no matter what.
---
yea mostly vael tho
---
Those are great.
---
sucks until about level 24. dont waste your time training it.
---
I highly recommend checking out the guide. There is nothing casual about shaman tanking raids in vanilla. Its extremely difficult and requires excellent gear and support from guildies. My apologies if it came off that any Shaman can tank a rank boss
---
That's gonna be a no from me dawg.
---
You do breeze through it especially with the 1.12 fixes to talents. They arent hard bosses.
---
This question is only for official wow classic beta or alpha players.  If you can, reply with the macro for casting rank 1 drain soul and make sure that my soul shards do not spill over into another bag.  I want one inventory bag, even if it is the default 16 slot, filled with shards, and the rest of the bags to not have shards in them when I press this drain life macro.  It is a organization thing that I do not like to fill up all my spaces with shards, and have some room to loot greys/crafting mats/quest rewards.  Going into the bags each time to delete a shard that is worth 0c is such a hassle and I am looking to prevent this with a drain soul macro.   
---
Back in blizzcon I played and spent hours attempting to make this. None of the macro and/or console commands that worked on pservers or retail wow worked in the wow classic lvls15-20 test.  So, please don't comment "this should work," as I am only wanting people in the beta or alpha of wow classic responses.  Please and thanks.
---
Most of the classes are like that in raiding. A lot of times it’s the mechanics of the bosses that make raiding interesting.  Also micro managing your aggro is its own mini game. 
---
I mained a warlock from launch till a few months into bc. I had a lot of fun and challenging things to do in game, dpsing wasn’t one of those things. 
---
There’s lots of reasons to play a warlock outside of raids though. They are really useful and good to have in dungeons. Three forms of cc with seduce, banish, and control demon. You can soul stone the healer or tank and save a wipe.  Health stones are basically free health potions. 
---
Their mob tagging abilities are also one of the best. Great for farming and for gaining honor in AV. 
---
They have a lot of class quests that take you all over the world. The final one for the dreadsteed is really long and fun (and expensive) .
---
Yeee fully agree, at least not without going withered :D
---
I don't know of any "big" streamers, there is one EU server you probably would want to avoid unless you're mega hardcore and specifically want to be on though
---
just hand holding carebears,
---
I love me some drama
---
I could have sworn I saw a video or an interview or something where the devs specifically said that layering would not be like sharding in that you would stay in the same layer if you logged off and logged in again - the only thing that would change your later is grouping. Why can’t they just do that?
---
Anyway, it’s a complicated issue, and I should have known layering sounded too good to be true. As of now layering is just sharding 2.0
---
Actually, I take that back, layering is more like sharding 1.1
---
Someone on Asmongold's chat told him about it and he entered the command. It does work, his nameplates went from showing up to 20 yards to probably 80. He was on a flight path in STV and could see nameplates a good distance away, much more than what the default it set to.
---
You obviously didnt watch the video, all of this happened, the shout missed, he did play the 5-8 game thats how he got his interception in the first place. Misuse of hamstring? huh?
---
The humans under Garithos were still part of the Alliance.
---
This is a gigantic problem. Please share this on Classic Forums if you haven’t already.
---
This reminds me of the infamous DotA 1 ogre magi ambush.
---
If you want to rank up, desperate measures are warranted!
---
Somethings aren't really up for debate sir. Shamans are not going to be magically 1000% times better because it's retail.
---
At one point I had to leave the Razor Hill inn 3 or 4 times because of getting dc'ed by a layer change and getting rolled back into the inn.
---
Layering potentially lasts 2 months
---
People hit 60 in a week
---
That gives 7 weeks to farm endless black lotuses and devilsaur etc
---
7 weeks is ample time for top guilds to decimate economies 
---
Black lotuses are supposed to be rare and mega expensive. Since Classic has been out for 15 years we already know how to farm them best, so they’re a little less rare to us now. With layering? Guilds will be laughing at how many they have. They could potentially flask most of their DPS every raid by farming this. Trivializes raid content in a major way
---
Yeah i did lol thats what the post was about
---
Explain how is he bad, thats why i call you noob, you dont know what you are looking at. Probably a retail baby running his mouth
---
Yeah, [the item](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6382/forest-leather-belt) is wrong.
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24926-NameplateDistanceClassic.html
---
Ha! I’m in there. I hope this sense of community stays in August.
---
They are pretty fun, battleground pvp is basically just dotting everything in sight, fearing, and shadowbolt spam. When a rogue gets close just death coil and dot them up. All in all they were pretty decent but mages are just so much more versatile in pvp imho.
---
Go enjoy your summer and cocoon afterwards with classic lol.
---
&gt;rawMouseEnabl
---
A month was average. Though on my server, some orc too called Chris leveled up to 60 within the first three days and started ganking us. He was infamous and we were in constant fear.
---
I sort of miss that about wow - classic wow might not be the most balanced game and the end game is enjoyed only by the top guilds on the server, but we knew each other
---
I remember one time deleting my toon and rolling horde. People recognized me immediately and I joined a guild shortly after.
---
Hah wish they would listen, sad af snowflakes will get offended at anything.
---
What are you talking about.  You literally get sent to a different layer on the same continent allowing you to get more nodes.  That's what layering is.
---
I don't have any remaining screenshots unfortunately; but there's a few online where you can see it - often in old tarren mill vs hillsbrad style zone wars.
---
GM creates and sends them each  the Scarlet Tabard that can drop from herod as a trophy
---
It's not classic without people making song parodies!
---
Keep em coming, I love how many different, weird things came out of games like WoW and TF2. Really made me feel more attached to them.
---
There are other options to server merging.
---
My point is, Layering is an inferior option that impacts player experience and immersion in a negative way.
---
If Blizzard can’t find a solution that doesn’t fuck the player experience then you *should* be questing them
---
&gt; In contrast with eastern culture, western culture looks for instant gratification and always seeks to go straight to the point or the solution
---
I love JRPGs, they were created by the "East" as you put it. It's impossible to not beat a JRPG. They are some of the easiest games out there.
---
Shamans can tank, paladins, shamans, druids, priests can dps.. but should they?
---
Sure anything can be done, it's not the most optimal solution but classic doesn't require the most optimal setups either.
---
If you are dedicated enough you can find groups who will carry you in raids and both you and your raid might have a blast - that's what classic is all about!
---
An issue here however, is that players tend to listen to people who is saying that things like shaman tanking is okay, then you suddenly have a shaman tank in bfd and you wipe, over and over and over again. I still have nightmares from that run!
---
Shit tier reading comprehension.
---
nope
---
I don't know if resting zones is the right way to do it, but it could work. Something to prevent layer swap abuse needs to be in the game, but you also can't make it restrict your gameplay too much.
---
🙀 Blasphemy.
---
They did earn it. Shitty RNG and repeating it is unnecessary
---
They don't need to have everything locked in pre-release. They don't have to trigger merges that wouldn't make sense just because they linked their name banks in the beginning. I don't think it's a huge sacrifice to risk not having a mage named Frosty on your server.
---
"its just a beta!!!"
---
We clearly played in two different stress test realms. :-)
---
&gt; I don't know if you even played the stress test
---
I was online in the Stress Test playing for the majority of time it was up, minus about 6 hours for sleep, and eating. I even took time off work Thursday hoping I could experience the realm when there were fewer people on. 
---
&gt; I enjoy playing with other players.
---
I do as well. What I don’t enjoy all of those players competing for the same mobs. We were clearly online playing at very different times. In the first three to four hours the realm was up, the NE starting area was a very bad experience. If I was a new player at launch, and it took me several hours to make the slightest progress n the _first_ quest the game hands me, let alone finish it, I would quit my trial and never play again. 
---
In any case, it’s very clear we enjoy different things from this game.
---
Good
---
Engineering
---
Posting to check back and see if you posted this.
---
You want to level enhancement till level 40. Use a 2 hander and kite the mob trading one hit for one hit. I think Stonebiter is technically the best weapon buff to level with but, I would go wind fury for style it's way more fun. Then after 40 you should go ele. Not sure what the spec for that is but, that is what "pro levelers" say it's most efficient. I normally just stay enhance though. Way more fun.
---
Oh look, tips twitch fanboy. Maybe if you whiteknight him enough he will mention you're name on stream ;) 
---
He lost the duel while claiming to be best NA warrior (among many other things) but who am I to argue with a 12 year old...I haven't played retail since WotLK, and your precious tips started playing in Cata at earliest. Look around you and check the facts, they're easy to find. Unless you're 12 and a fanboy I suppose...
---
Real bad
---
Yep, most game designers now don't seem to get this.  You can't win all the time and enjoy winning.  You can't enjoy a big open world and conveniently teleport everywhere.  You can't have engaging difficulty and never die.

Hi friends, Buttercuts here!
---
Right now it appears that there is no permanence to your layer, it most likely just assigns you to the first layer with room.
---
They could fix this by assigning players to a layer, and keeping them linked to that layer for a certain time frame.
---
The issue with this is Blizzard wants you to be able to seamlessly play with your guild and friends, and forcing you to remain linked to a layer will break this. 
---
Not sure what can be done to satisfy both conditions here.
---
Pretty sure he is just out of range. The range on their stun is melee range. The mob doesn't interrupt its own cast as soon as you leave melee range, rather, it tries to finish the cast and once it hits the end of the cast time the mob receives a "target is too far away" and the spell doesn't go off.
---
It's the same if two mages are standing at max range of each other. If one mage starts casting Pyroblast and the other mage then instantly blinks away from the mage casting Pyroblast, the casting time won't stop, but once the cast is finished you would get a "target is too far away" error and the Pyroblast will not be fired.
---

---
Gearscore gained popularity in Wrath because of how huge the swing of being geared vs. not being geared was. In fact, Ghostcrawler made a post about Wrath itemlevels being way higher than was planned because of the implementation of hardmodes/heroic.
---
In Classic, not only does itemlevel not at all determine what your character is capable of (gearing correctly will trump itemlevel straight up) but if you are using itemlevel to compare/contrast player capability, you are likely going to be dealing with differences that are in the single digit ranges due to linearly scaling gear. Even with that consideration, some classes don't even benefit much from gear until super late in the gearing process- not every ability has scaling coefficients in Classic. 
---
This problem wouldn't become obvious until late BC where you had the infamous issue of Mages not being brought to Sunwell due to their abilities not scaling like other classes.
---
I appreciate you guys being worried about this hampering the Classic community but it really is by all counts a totally different game than what Retail is.
---
PvP gear is really strong and you get it through pvping.  With seduce, fear and death coil, and your dots you can actually win a lot of 1v2 situations if you play smart.
---
this subreddit will be comedy gold 3 weeks after launch when everyone realizes what has actually happened.
---
Why orc for mage? Troll is best choice for pve
---
We have the presedence in front of us, we've passed the following states
---
No sharding
---
Possible sharding
---
Sharding only during launch in starter zones
---
Sharding only first few weeks starter zones
---
Sharding until end of phase 1
---
Global sharding (Layering^^tm) until end of Phase 1
---
It's not hyperbole, it's history. It's also within reason to speculate that this trend of sharding may continue to be implemented without sufficient pushback, which is why we're making our opinions heard on the matter.
---
u/isaelia how do these guys actually stand behind these arguments
---
He’s saying option 2 doesn’t work because all the “sensical” names will be taken, without realizing that same issue happens on a single server hosting 15k people thru different layers
---
I haven’t seen anyone logically support the argument that a immersion and economy-killing software such as layering is the best solution.
---
Surely, blizzard could find another, better solution that doesn’t negatively impact player experience so heavily
---
Are you saying they can bring in reinforcements? How is that significantly different than normal? People call for reinforcements all the time. They still have to walk there and everything. I suppose you could use it to escape a battle by going to another layer. But these things can be mitigated too. Maybe you can't switch layers if you've been in pvp on- the last 5 minutes or something?
---
It's also below your mom to spend her time doting over made up bronze-age stories that purport to be moral, but actually advocate stoning people to death for minor social faux pas. On behalf of all immoral heathens everywhere, I suggest telling your mother to mind her own business.
---
It appears that the consensus is that it is triggered from the killing blow, despite the vague tooltip.
---
Assuming this is the case, my only question would be whether or not NPCs can steal killing blows or would the "killing blow" revert to the last damage dealt by the player?
---
As I type it out, it seems like the answer is, no, that wouldn't make sense. So I suppose then this can be considered working as intended and the Defias Traitor just did me dirty by getting the last hit and preventing my Spirit Tap from proccing.
---
Only class I'm actually good at lol
---
I'm generally bad at video games
---
Thanks man, I have great memories from zg. I actually won the raptor roll in there, the GMC was kinda mad, but it was good times. I was the fishing guy so we could summon the extra boss. That place was fun.
---
Sharding does that.
---
Layering is meant for server merging
---
Sims are not RPGs, so you're talking about a completely different genre of games with different design goals. 
---
Strategy games also have a different design goal (especially competitive games). I'd argue that they are more similar to RPGs as there is progression, but I think that's where the similarity ends on design goals.
---
In the quoted reference above, he's discussing Dark Souls (and by proxy, how RPGs are structured).
---
Fair enough observation. I guess it may require additional testing.
---
Rise again, hero.
---
Unending-ish Breath
---
Riding on this comment, Ion said in a recent interview that a lot of private server bosses didn't have correct resist values. He talked about some bosses just having a ton of shadow resist for pretty much no reason. I'm interested to see how much this hurts locks.
---
You did that by turning it into an east/west thing in the first place, which is grossly inaccurate at best.   
---
Also I have no idea in which world "seeking instant gratification vs. patience" is a judgement neutral topic. Sounds like you are playing the "i Meant it, but I didnt say it" card. And nobody likes that crap
---
I must admit, other than obvious bugs, I've never had any issues with Questie, you can argue for features (such as the arrow), but it does what it does and it does it well.
---
Probably similar to how it is now, but less interesting fights and more poorly balanced / designed.  They likely took the lessons of vanilla and applied it to their original plan.
---
Forbiddencomment, delete now!! only happens in vanilla111!111one
---
launch and 12 hour session are oxymorons.  it is highly, highly unlikely anyone will be able to play for 12 hours straight at launch with out authentication, latency, and server crashes even after all the beta testing, stress testing, layering, and name/realm reservations.  
---
Prime time BFA and WOD launches were really laggy and notorious for people being kicked and not being able to reach back in through the auth servers.
---
I'm very aware :) Every second is a blessing, and getting to play video games with my daughter in my lap is all that I want. That and for the wife to play with me but she's not interested, and that's okay. :)
---
I don't get why that would be a cherry on top for anyone tbh. You want the gms to literally send your fav streamers loot? Why would that make you excited or happy?
---
Were you using any high threat abilities? Threat isn't always directly related to damage done.
---
If your raid leaders are yelling at you, you should be dropping threat sooner - it means you're now distracting them from doing their other jobs. Your job is to never make them need to call you out
---
This may seem rude, but when would there be a benefit of having a shaman tank over a warr / druid.
---
Can Shamans ideally pull enough threat for other classes NOT to hold back effectively gimping your raid ?
---
Sincerely curious
---
In PvE:
---
- Takes some time to become really good, basically around ZG
---
- Lacks threat reduction tools and can run into aggro problems
---
- Lacks mobility and ways to avoid raid mechanics
---
- DoTs aren't very practical in dungeons and raids
---
PvP:
---
- Poor tools for countering CC
---
- Lacks mobility and ways to shake off melees
---
- Highly reliant on the most easily countered form of CC
---
- Worst PvP trinket (charm, polymorph, fear)
---
I have BFA, my main account is an active BFA sub.  This new account only appeared the day before the stress test.  I have been checking every day hoping for beta.

cool, i never thought anyone else had seen that since its such a frekking old video and the guy didnt really make any other ones.  
---
I think it was one of the first pvp videos i ever saw.
---
There is no orc mage
---
&gt; Oh my god what a brilliant person! /s
---
You joke, but the number of game designers that seem to have forgotten this or ignore it seem to be increasing every game or expansion that gets released.
---
You can see it in the first map, it was a \[M\] dungeon
---
Beautifully said.
---
Thanks. At least it got some attention now. I am not sure if this was in vanilla but maybe now someone from Blizz sees it and can investigate.
---
Herb/alch is pretty nice for leveling since you get some cool potions, especially swiftness potions, your friends will love you for it. Alchemy is actually my all-time favourite profession, it just sucks that it's so hard to make money from it. You pretty much have to get a flask recipe and that's easier said than done. Some of them go for way over 1000g early on. On private servers I usually drop my gathering profession for tailoring once ZG is out for the set bonus. By that time you could level up a herbing alt. That's probably not a guarantee for all players though since 1-60 is a several hundred hours process. 
---
Engineering is just so overpowered in vanilla I wouldn't skip it for anything.
---
As an EU player myself I havn't experienced it before, but on stress test I noticed that ingame chat more or less was a teitch chat, asmongold thos and mccuck that...
---
I mean sure I can enjoy watching their streams but it was quite a downer to see such a chat.
---
Realistic is more like it, just wait til release and see how many hundreds of threads are going to be here talking about a problems like unable to log or stuck in the first zone for hours and hours waiting on spawns people have no idea what they're in for lol
---
Yo homie, I’d actually appreciate an invite too. As long as y’all say you’re as chill as you say you are then I’m in.
---
I’ve actually never played much WoW and am thinking of starting with Classic.

Slippery Slope is real

Had a fun time. Joined a guild, met some people. Everyone trying to collect gold to create a tabard. We did Elwynn Defias rare for the green dagger and Hogger 5-man for the quest. Did mining+herb while running around Elwynn, then picked up BS for sharpening stones and Alch for pots and elixirs. My friend logged on later and we geared him up as well. Rogue friend and I went to Westfall to kill defias for the mask but no luck after 50 or so kills. 
---
We spent the rest of the night in Durotar. We tried joining raids but with layering it was really hard to coordinate with the horde players, we rarely saw a big number of Horde that dared attack the raid, even though general chat was popping with "Horde over there!", "Big Horde raid rn at [location]". We ended up sneaking around just the two of us, baiting people to pvp flag themselves while the other was hiding in stealth. Video in Swedish:

If you're basing "I was doing top DPS" on that you were pushing the tank for aggro, then you really don't understand threat at all, and I highly doubt you were top DPS
---
I meant playing orc, instead of troll. In terms of just class, myb
---
Care to share some more thoughts as to why? I have zero experience with vanilla warlocks.
---
They are a mix.  In Northshire the Defias are red/aggressive.  The wolves, for example, are yellow.
---
You can easily have 10+ mages and warlocks in your raid, as decurse and banish are often important. You should have no issue getting a spot either way you go.
---
A lot of people want it. There are even people who don't want to play Classic if TBC won't come after.
---
Thankfully for alliance rogues everywhere, orcs can't be mages.
---
Wombat of slaying?
---
If your heart tells you to go Troll, go Troll. WOTF is nice but it's not game breaking. Don't let racials deter you from playing a race that will make you happy, because you don't want to be upset months later that you picked the wrong one.
---
Its already begun.  People have been asking for changes since Blizz announced they were doing this
---
Same
---
Yeah I make up thad data, just my memories. I'm talking about USA beta/launch. Also thottbot was not very known. 15 years ago internet was not as overwhelming as it is today. First addon i installed I think was called Cosmos because a guild mate told me it exists. Lol didn't expect so many people will be pissed with this post (not talking about yours)
---
Shoutout to /u/beckscomics for the [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/bsdsxv/coparenting_oc/).
---
Yeah, just to clarify: I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying that the video is not evidence of the claim since the distance it too far regardless of which direction the character was facing.
---
Manapool could be an issue
---
Omg I love these old warrior vids man. Warrior pvp was awesome, I was a noob and ran around with the pvp hammer for stuns in bg's. Good times thanks for links.
---
Fighting off a Horde Raid of lvl 5 spergs running into the defias field from over the hills in the back of Northshire as we attempt to hold them off at the bridge. This is just everything I expected with Classic and then some, I can't wait to play again.
---
I watched this today live.He had like 10+ trys also he almost one shot him.Also interesting thing about FD.It got resisted 4 times in kill try if im correct. While i played on private servers FD was NEVER resisted even in raids.
---
It's ok.
---
In any case, I was just pointing it because I wasn't sure. Maybe someone from Blizz sees it and can investigate to what extent it existed in vanilla.
---
I have no idea
---
Gathering professions for leveling is where it's at on pservers (especially during AQ war efforts). Not sure how it's going to be for a brand new server though, not many people with gold.
---
That doesn't mean the opposite must be true though. Sure there is no "truth" but we know what doesn't work like BfA.
---
your 3rd link is broken btw, missing the ? before the v=
---
Retail is probably getting close to 2M players now. WoW retail is a ghost town compared to what it was at it's height in WotLK.
---
Blizz can see the trend and they have nothing ready to combat it. They have gone too far down that rabbit hole of fast play, and dumbed down mechanics that it cannot be salvaged before their playerbase is completely in the dumpster.
---
So now they decide to remake classic and start the whole ball of wax  again hopefully with the spirit of the original game at heart.
---
I think I got wooshed on this one. Can you elaborate?
---
I dont watch him, solid argument. Im 31, you are the one who sounds like a kid here, ive played since vanilla, i dont care how long this streamer has played its irrelevant to the conversation at hand wich is this duel.
---
na
---
Haha idk why I didn’t think of this :)
---
Yea I remember it cause of that liger intro. I was into mech stuff around then and it just stuck in my mind. Always loved my troll hunter and prowler pet from vanilla.
---
Pets were kinda poor DPS though, even an Imp would sit with you and the party or be strategically placed for the tank, otherwise you would Sacc them for the DPS boost through MD. Of course, im assuming under a raid scenario of course.
---
Warlock if u want to gear up fast in raids
---
What’s the best ally race for warlock? I’ll be PvP focused
---
Oh good to know. Looks like possibly a planned crash.
---
I'll add your quote to the already 100 quotes of things that will kill classic.
---
I think classic has been killed 1,000 times by now.
---
Btw, on private servers you don't need to take IF flight if dwarf or gnome, they are known by default. I wonder if it is the same on beta.
---
You have to remember that 99% of people won’t be wearing AQ/Naxx gear ever. Most people will have a mix of blues and epics at their height.
---
Warlocks are always a great PvP class and their PvP set is also quite good as the stat allocation is great and the bonus effects are good.
---
Yeah, there are problems with it, but they couldnt exactly keep it the same either, with how many levels there are in the game, and how the vast majority of the playerbase is at max level.
---
Not a big deal...FOR YOU maybe
---
I don't agree fully. I think Raids, high m+, are challenging content, moreso than anything that classic will ever offer. I'm def. more engaged when I have to juggle a ton of stuff instead of spamming frostbolt waiting for the fight to end. But, the reward structure is different.  
---
I think you get too much stuff, you change too much stuff itemwise, you're constantly around the corner of an upgrade, basicly sprinting down the loot spiral. And Classic is different. With just a few items per boss, for 40 people, bad itemisation and so on, you rarely get an upgrade, but it feels good when it happens, you look forward to something.  
---
Maybe that's the big deal afterall, you are really engaged during mythic raiding, but the rewards feel lackluster. Basicly a disconnect.   
---
I don't want to hate on classic btw, I look forward to it, but mechanical engaging difficulty is not one of the strong points of the game IMO. Also on a sidenote, I'm not saying classic is easy, just easier mechanicly. The whole organization aspect, coordinating 40 people seems like a horrendous task. But that affects only few people comparatively.
---
That’s a horrible personality trait.
---
Hi, /u/NowhereMan87
---
There are different types of games. In Cities: Skylines the fun about the game is pretty much the creative process, not the challenge. But a similar thing is true there. If they gave you endless options and no limitations, it would not be a fun game. It's fun because they limit you in many ways with what you can do, and you have to really figure stuff out/be creative to work around the limitations. 
---
If you look at a game as working towards reaching a certain goal, then the challenge thing still applies to all games. Even in Cities: Skyline you have a goal *you* want to achieve (it's just not staked out by the game itself), and there are various challenges you have to overcome to get there. But the challenge might be more like a mental puzzle than mechanical or time spent challenge.
---
4 strength 3 Stam leather belt...ughhhh fuck
---
Quite the opposite, I couldn't be happier they didn't go with that clumsy 2004 interface
---
Well if you had 3k people in server in Vanilla, you will now have 9k and  3 layers. 3 layers - 3 times the nodes and 3 times the players. 3/3 = 1, so nodes per person is still the same. Besides you are not guaranteed to switch layers after logoff/logon. A node is not guaranteed to be available in another layer you switch to (if you do). I don't see the exploit here. Also layering will be removed soon after release so just wait a month after release and start playing then. Or are you in a hurry somewhere?
---
THANK YOU so much for this. 
---
I did a 30+ Min test run from the Gnome/Dwarf starting area on private servers to see how much time I would be spending/wasting running back to Kalimdor.
---
What you're asking for is sharding, which Blizzard already planned to do, but the community freaked out over not having 100s of people in the same starting zone, so they switched to layering.
---
I can not answer this then... but it is ran in 8.x patch
---
Getting the gear, farming consumables, building your char takes a ton more investment then retail. All things considered. Wow raiding content is easy, designed that way. The most loved raids have all been on the easier side. 
---
But the rest of the game is much more fuller than retail.
---
From what I could tell, the General chat was layer based, but World chat was the entire server. So in World chat I saw messages from people everywhere, but if I wanted to talk only locally General zone chat seemed to do the trick.
---
In that case they need to shrink draenei a bit, there's a bunch of doors in those new BfA boats that my guy has trouble fitting through haha
---
When you say it like that you see just how absolutely disgusting retail is...
---
Also the raid frames and “(name) requested an invite to your group”is from retail.
---
Yes. We already know they're opening 2 weeks early for character creation. At the very worst, we'll have that info by then.
---
Same dilemma. Think I’m rolling f troll because the armor looks way cool on them
---
There wouldn’t. Shamans are viable up until about ST. This is from Kevin Jordan, who spent a lot of time designing the class for blizzard in the early saus.
---
Also a perfect example at which state the retail game is in comparatively to Classic. News Flash Blizzard, If EVERYONE is a Winner... then NO ONE is a LOSER. Chew on it for a bit
---
&gt; Unfortunately there will still be a very large amount of the population that will do all they can to race through the content and be on top of all others
---
Why is that unfortunate? I will be one of those to level as fast as I can to try to stay ahead of the others, that's what is most fun for me in a MMO. People enjoy the game in different ways.
---
We did the same thing for BfA and went smooth as butter, the only gap we had was a 5 min delay for the last person to get the first quest
---
Its a ton of extra work to do 6 dungeons that only 1/6 of the playerbase might even run.
---
They’re releasing them in a while. No date confirmed.
---
Your sister single?
---
You're the one who called me a retail baby and basically white knighted him. It's all there in the video. His enemy was undergeared, he resisted 2/4 and still lost. I suppose you're watching the same video I am? 
---
Therefore, ouch still stands for best self-proclaimed warrior duelist in North America...
---
Maybe I’m just retarded, but I didn’t notice any difference.
---
Do you have to be a certain level of engineer to use higher end stuff or is just being an engineer sufficient?
---
Blizzard made arguably the most popular game in the world. Prior to that, they made niche games in niche genres. RTS and ARPG. 
---
They made the best RTS and the best arpg ever made. But neither of those were developed to me mass appeal smash successes. They attempted to be very good at what they did. 
---
That’s the big difference, WoW today (and blizzard games in general) are built to be popular successful appealing games. They are not made to be great games people literally can’t put down. 
---
Blizzard has been so concerned with capturing a bigger audience, they’ve forgotten about their existing one.
---
that said we have no idea how the values will change vs private servers since it's clear their data is absolutely scuffed
---
endgame content and soloing are oxymorons.  soloing and farming seem closer to what you are asking, but I'll weigh in on end game raid nights.  warlocks can life tap and get healed to keep casting, making healthstones, and cursing.  hunters in my raids would run out of mana shortly into the fight and get to see the sights and auto shot.  They would try and run 50 yds out feign death and drink.  As a hunter it was a talent decision between, do you use up all your mana, or do you micro your pet.  Warlocks would even get in the mana tide group sometimes even to help their dps.  Hunters generally were not nearly as special as warlocks except on magmadar and the rare occasion if they went into trueshot aura for the melee group.
---
removing your comment cause of a simple rewording of mine, then coming back? PATHETIC!
---
I enjoy armor on troll females quite a bit too, and I love that they are upright. I do find the hadouken troll casting animation to be quite attractive though. It's a hard choice
---
Too bad the voice actor in the original videos when you start a character died
---
Think a optimal raid sett up is 8 shamans 1 resto druid and 3-5 holy/disc priests. Shamans have it easy
---
Oh man that ninja loot one was hilarious. I mean it sucks for that guild but the leeroy Jenkins before he steals was amazing. 
---
There are some great vids here man, thank you so much for your effort! Classics.
---
Wotf is great but the bones... are so UGLY
---
Hahaha this is great!! Thanks for the credit friend!
---
ret is pretty solid dps in vanilla :)
---
The classic interface was a mess, so I’m not that bothered by the change.
---
True but you can't remove a racial buff
---
You my boy Cairne!
---
Blizzard won't have to cave if people end up not liking wow classic they can just direct them to current wow
---
 RemindMe! 95 days "wow commands bruh"
---
Can't say I noticed that one, as I only played for an hour during the stress test but yeah, that's a bit annoying too. 
---
I know it wont bother most people but it definitely changes the feels. I want to feel like its 2006 again and these damn menus arent helping! lol
---
I saw a post about this. The person who did the inviting got merged with the layer of the person they were inviting. That won't save the PVP'r.
---
I just want to play on a server without a popular streamer.
---
Didn't they rename this to The Fast and the Furious?
---
Fair enough :) Guess it's just me then lol
---
People have only seen a few 40 man raids. Imagine icc 40 man, or kj or even Jaina. That would have been so much cooler than the small groups today
---
Hi, /u/chum1ly
---
I've been playing since vanilla and never seen a shaman tank.
---
This thread is kinda blowing my mind.
---
Beserking is a pretty underrated racial for PVP. Popping it a half health or lower will lead significant casting time reductions and could be the difference between living and dying. However, fighting warlocks is so much more difficult as a troll.
---
In PVE, Beserking is the BiS mage racial as there are many, many raid damage fights. It also stacks with Mind Quickening Gem as well, if you're lucky enough to get it. 
---
I'm extremely bias here, since I only play troll mage, but I wouldn't play any other class/race combo.
---
Here's my guild in the vanilla raids,  quality not amazing but what can you do?
---
Some TBC and Cata stuff but ignore that. Enjoy
---
https://m.youtube.com/user/Coalescencemovies
---
Another important difference is that sharding is per-zone rather than server-wide like layering is. Also layering is used only for overpopulation whereas sharding is also used for underpopulation(hence the cross-server shit).
---
Oh really? Well, I get that it isn't a big deal but I just hoped for full authenticity.
---
Isn't that what MMOs are about? Gearing up for end-game?
---
Those people are gonna get told to fuck off en masse very quickly, and learn to either shut up or play retail.
---
Yes but I doubt blizzard will do something like this. They want to have this layering system in the background, you are not supposed to notice it if you are just casually playing. And where are all the #nochanges people? This feels like something that goes even further away from vanilla. Every time you group up with someone from a different layer you first have to run to the nearest town to play with them.
---
The 2004/2005 interface was very messy...
---
A welcomed QoL change.
---
I feel switching for certain scenarios would help. Like flag carrying for instance. Not so sure you can min/max the timers that way. I’m not sure how the swing timers overlap, but it might be counterproductive for that 2-3+ seconds in combat. 
---
I’m curious as to how this would play out, though. If you do any research please update us!
---
That was just an example that came to his mind first. It does not mean that shadow will be the only resistance bosses might have extra of.
---
Old school RuneScape did the same thing. There had always been a closed curtain separating players from the admins, OSRS saw the admins start playing a role in the community. It's died down a lot though.
---
RemindMe! 95 days "do this"
---
How does that make me a troll.. It was a serious question? Thank you for your input though.
---
I should have been recording my combat log but there was hours of combat vs a lvl 7+ with no dodges being registered with 20% dodge.  We also had a priest keeping track of shadow word pain with about 90-85% success rate on casting on mobs level 9-10 which should have been averaged at 65%.  I really haven't logged (or theorycrafted at the high end) since tbc so I wish I could have done it on the server but at level it might be fine, but it scaling upwards it definitely is not.  Watching Asmongolds party yesterday confirms for me that the spell hit in some cases does not scale down correctly.  Also, after sleeping on it you might be right about dynamic respawns, I could have been phased into another zone with Sarkoth in it multiple times during that window.  They did say that was when they would be crunching layers.
---
 “cherry on top” means metaphorically that something small and special is added to something else that is also very nice to make it just that much more enriched. It comes from the idea that a bowl of ice cream is wonderful, but even more wonderful if a cherry is put on top"
---
The issue with this is, most dungeons can be feasibly cleared by 3 people, even in the later part of the levelling process.
---
Anecdotally, I had a big LAN party back in late classic where it was me (mage), and two friends (paladin and hunter) and we were able to farm full clear ZF runs from the moment we were able to step into the dungeon until all mobs inside were green/grey. 
---
This kind of addon just limits the pool of people that get invited into content that is trivial from the outset with a full group, you are going to set yourself back more than any one poorly geared player will by limiting yourself in this way. 
---
Also, not all classes scale the same with gear, ESPECIALLY at levels before the level cap. A mage with 30 ilvl isn't going to be much worse off than a mage at 40 ilvl outside of maybe less mana and less crit chance due to the scarcity of spell damage gear.
---
this, so much this
---
It is when you think of the quests, every single one of them that doesn’t require you to group up, as something that you, and only you, do. That is where the whole suspension of disbelief comes in: You’re the only Highlord with Ashbringer and everyone else around you are lower ranking members of the order.  
---
I mean, it’s not much more taxing on suspension of disbelief than seeing multiple people with Rhok’delar or Thunderfury. Or the fact that multiple people outside your geoup can get and complete the quests to kill Thermaplugg or rescue Moira. Or the fact that Onyxia’s head gets turned in on a regular basis.
---
This is not your home, you foul orc!
---
i remember seeing reports of people ninja looting the domo crate or something, but usually after a few weeks it wasnt an issue anymore. MOST people forget.
---
Rock biter generates threat. There are a few shaman abilities that do. It’s a cool class. I’m rolling one for the first time in classic
---
What are you talking about, no1 showed there gear, how is him beeing undergeard "all there in the video" 
---
Im sorry did he resist half the stuns with 40% stun resist, HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?!
---
"You're the one who called me a retail baby" compared to me you literally are tho? 
---
You are just joining the bandwagon of hating this guy without having a damn clue what you looking at. I dont give a flying fuck about him, i dont know him or watch him. But i like to call out people like you.
---
"Unfortunately" wasn't necessarily the right word to use I will admit. I think that for me I like the idea of PVP and plan to play on a PVP server. What I don't like is that many people rush to end game with the intention of ruining the experience for others. Having a level 60 site in Freewind Post down in Thousand Needles killing lowbies turning in quests can ruin that experience. I personally find other places to level until those idiots decide to leave but for others it can be a demoralizing experience and result in many fleeing the game or heading to a PVE server and being forced to start over.
---
Trade is, yeah. But General could be per shard, since that is how it works in BfA.
---
Yeah idk either, I genuinely want to try it and made this post out of pure curiosity if I was missing something lol.
---
Do we really always want to love in an optimal world? This may seem like a stupid question and perhaps it is. However, Classic itself as a whole it polished, optimal, or without idiosyncrasy. Just because things aren't optimal, as we state in the guide itself, doesn't mean they are worthwhile or fun..I do it because it's fun and I enjoy it. If other people find it fun as well, then where is the harm?
---
?
---
It was intended.  Here's a quote from Tigole from back in the day:
---
&gt;You have 1 hour to attempt Vaelanstrasz the Corrupted, at which point he will leave the Lair. If you cannot beat him, you cannot progress.
---
[Source](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-dungeons/83818.htm)
---
This is just one of a handful things in Vanilla that was pretty... hardcore lol :)
---
Okay and I get that, but if that's the case what will I do after I level. Be satisfied that I got to 60 then what?
---
I picked IF because of all the good memories i have of it. It was the "main" city where everyone would hang out because it was closest to all the endgame content.   
---
It was a more convenient city than Stormwind in terms of getting around the world.   
---
It had flight points close to both Thorium Point and the Menethil Harbor boat. From Thorium Point you could easily get to MC, BWL, UBRS, LBRS etc. and the Menethil boat would get you really close to Onyxia and AQ20/40. And if you wanted to go up north to Stratholme, Scholomance, SM, Naxxramas then IF was also closer than SW.
---
Bug true, great comic
---
Can you please check reputation values from other faction starter zones?
---
(now when you are 30 what reputation will those quests give you when they are gray)
---
Thank you in advance
---
I love UC. It feels like a secret hiding place.
---
Man, this hit home so much. Even as a kid I was wondering why my mother told me to stop video games but she was OK with me at TV. I would have played so much of my games if she only let me play when I wanted to. And yet she said I was addicted. I had good grades all along, but as a kid you can't argue at why the TV is a debilitating media and why video games are not.
---
No I never said he played a lot in TBC, I said he played seriously since TBC. You have some serious learning and reading disabilities.
---
We will be the light that stands between the darkness. Classic mechanics forever.
---
If we wanted that new age bullshit we wouldn't be so fired up about Classic.
---
Better graphics great. New content great. New skills great. Minor balancing great.
---
When they start catering to the fast reward, zero patience, QQ crowd then I'm out.
---
I want a long term classic reboot with frequent expansions.
---
I mean theres no actual setback outside of time and monetary value if you die in wow and thats fine its always been like that and personally i don’t know many people who want to go back to the EQ style of difficulty where death set you back so much you wanted to just quit playing sometimes. As for the mechanical skill issues of the game people will get it in time and for WoW classic that going to be great because your not going to be punished for being mechanically inclined as someone from like method or something outside of PvP that is.
---
Yeah like I said I don't really wanna invest my time if I think it'll be a waste. That's why i'm trying to get honest feedback and not just "Classic &gt; BFA fuck BFA Classic is better fuck you" elitist answers lol.
---
... yes it is down.
---
You're not much of a reader are you?
---
Switching g weapons resets the swing timer.
---
Doesn't matter if the designer wasn't able to
---
And since the game data classic is using is from 1.12 that means missing the keyring is a bug.
---
Is it a big deal for you?
---
Well the difference here is that it happened in CLASSIC's Stress Test Beta, never mind Cata, Wod, MoP, Legion or BFA's beta.
---
I felt more at home seeing C'thun or Rag being spawned in the Human starting zone by the devs than if I'd have seen any raid boss from WoD, MoP, Legion or BFA being spawned. Deathwing's kinda cool though.
---
I love this. Like, yeah, I'd like to get good enough to raid eventually, but my favorite thing *ever* is finding some starry opening from a cave or stumbling upon the Aurora Borealis and just... watching. Some music playing in the background, nothing to fight. It's escapism in such a pure form and calms me down so, so much. That's really why WoW has become so special to me.
---
everything from 15s in to the end is underwhelming play, charge always beats stealth in spell batching so the rogue should be the aggressor not the other way around. you could argue that the rogue wouldve still 5-8d him anyway but its still just poor play to run after your opponent with sprint on when u are crippled. he did have recently bandaged from the start on closer inspection so thats fair that he couldnt bandage earlier, when it does come out it doesnt do anything. the shout is used but would not have done anything at that time anyway, no grenades, idk its not terrible play but just not something youd expect to see from someone claiming to be one of the best warriors in duels
---
Relevant context:
---
&gt;   I've been farming ore and herbs during Legion with realm hop addon and nobody stopped me.  
---
&gt; Since based on what I've read it's sharding for a whole map, instead of per zone.  
---
&gt; ...so it wants to split some players to a new layer. But now a whole new instance of the EK continent has been made.
---
so if all this is correct, and a large amount of the population of a layer is congregated in a specific zone which for some reason causes a new layer, then I can ask a guildie (if they are in that layer, ofc) to invite me to that new EK layer. Which is problematic because now I am jumping to layers where a large part of the people are in one spot.  
---
I wasn't talking about pvp, and if I understand OP (agent) was also talking about server hopping to layers with little competition to farm whatever it is you want to farm
---
I remember there was a black lion in the barrens that took me forever to tame. He was on a rare spawn and I wasn't the only one who sought him. When I finally got him... Man. I can't wait for Aug 27.
---
Exactly, why should people get punished and banned for saying some dumb shit in the heat of the moment on a video game. You just explained what every league player feels, frustration.
---
As long as you're not being racist etc kinda thing, I think most things said are fine. Calling someone bad and trash shouldn't be bannable.
---
Shaman can definitely pull enough threat. The issue is survivability and mitigation. Warriors will always be more optimal. But for many people, including myself, I play to learn and experience new things not just play it safe
---
so I guess it works like gouge where your target needs to be facing you.
---
Innnnttterrressstinggggg
---
If they do I hope they just expand upon Azeroth a la Isle of Quel’danas. Part of what ruins the game for me personally is having all these deserted areas after their time has passed. Keeping everything limited to Azeroth (and with that leaving hubs as IF/UC/ORG/SW) would keep the world feeling alive.
---
Well you're not wrong about the couple days to max level and easily get 400 ilvl within a week or two. There's alot of things im missing I guess didn't think there was that much to do other than get resist gear and raid. Thanks for the reply homie.
---
In your experience, do you find that berserking has a wider range of uses and is used more often than you'd expect WotF would be used?
---
No, because precisely the overpopulation will be present on the first days, when the community sense will make it acceptable. Later on, the starting zones will be more chill, it'll be easier to tag mobs, so it'll balance itself out! People will spread out, between hardcore players on the frontlines and casual people leveling slowly, and people just starting out. I wouldn't worry :)
---
I’ll never understand the “omg they took my talent trees!!!1!” Argument, by the time the new talent system was implemented, the existing trees were bloated, non functional, unfun, and anachronistic with the appearent design goals of the game. 
---
Wow stopped being an rpg with the release of Wrath. It then became a 3rd person encounter driven, performance oriented, virtual world of collectibles. Which is fine,  if it’s not an rpg. 
---
By Cata the talent trees were a shut system. They were great in Bc and vanilla, and were even sorta cool in Wrath.
---
At max level, the new talent trees offer the potential for SO much more customization. That said, blizzard consistently drops the ball on talents. On live currently, I swap 1 talent around during all of BoD raiding. In tot and soo I was changing multiple talents multiple times per raid. 
---
I dunno, I like the trees on the classic beta, I liked trees in Bc and retail vanilla. I think the new talent trees were the right call in MoP and are one of the few improvements to the game outside raiding and combat spell rotation mechanics over the years.
---
which is?
---
No need to be insulting. Could have just answered the question.
---
This cannot be tested yet as there are no raid instances available at level 30.
---
Mage if you want a raid spot. Engineering and get repair o matic or whatever its called to make yourself even more appealing.
---
Flying mounts in Vanilla...
---
Whatever you say dude, lost you at "compared to me you literally are"
---
I did answer the question.
---
Twice.
---
apparently not where did they say they are down?
---
I beg to differ. Cata destroyed all 3 of my mains.
---
Arguably the best 1v1 class in the game next to hunters
---
This is a flight path gryphon, and the video is 11 years old, dude.
---
What level did you try?. [Smite on ND seems to do more damage](https://i.imgur.com/nDlvFqr.png) at least.
---
There is no this versus that.  Why does everything have to be a competition of who's superior?
---
If you're saying instant gratification is good/bad then go on and share your argument on that. That's how healthy discussions are made and spare me the snide remarks please.
---
She probably plays Alliance too
---
Why do you assume population is going to decline? Are you a post-wrath player?
---
For the entirety of the first 3 expansions, populations mostly increased. There is absolutely no reason to believe that population will decline as they release new content.
---
Very true. I have lost count of the amount of times I cringed when called "Hero" or "Champion" by important NPCs.
---
I'd have to consider private servers, in a sense, like an echo chamber. The influx of new players isn't that high and its often the case of the same players running the same content. Its almost like, if you had one server on live where 80% of the players are the best players in the game.
---
It will be whichever was present in 1.12.1
---
Gnome is best for any pvp
---
&gt; Difficulty isn't only in how many buttons per second you push. 
---
Okay I get that, but I never said that. The GAMEPLAY doesn't seem fun pushing 1-2 buttons in 10 seconds.
---
Tested, you can indeed, on the map of Dun Morogh it's the second "fjord", where the water comes into the land. This zone will say "Dun Morogh", die there and you're all set!

Yeah that's what I'm wondering, with like a 3.8 speed weapon, if you switch to a faster weapon does it holds the same attack speed like in Oldschool RuneScape, then you just switch back for the 2 hander swing.
---
Or does it add some sort of delay or something.
---
Regardless of my stance on layering, the thing that scares me the most is when people say "oh, well, it's just beta!"
---
How long have y'all been playing videos games &amp; seen betas come &amp; go? Shit ALWAYS makes it to launch. Trying to pretend that the beta will work out every single problem is just fucking delusional.

That's really cool, thanks for sharing :)

You can rep grind Waterlords in Silithus so that won’t be a problem. You can dodge black flame in the cave and behind throne, only need 3-4 cloaks.
---
Low lvl exploration of high lvl zones is a great challenge
---
Welcome home.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "classic command"

Not a bug
---
"All weapon skills could be learned at level 1 and cost 10s, except for Polearms which required level 20 and cost 1g."
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Weapon_master
---
There will be a LFG/LFR addon.
---
How do you mean? If you switch to a faster weapon, immediately after an attack, does a 1.8s speed weapon then take 1.8s to attack again?
---
I would say so. WotF doesn't really do much in a PVE setting. Sure Ony, Nef and Bug Trio have group fears, some fights in Naxx as well, but that its. Beserking can be and should be used in every Pve encounter. On a pvp server, if you get ganked and are able to get a sheep off at half health. You'll be able to pew pew much faster, especially if shatter combos are envolved.
---
Don't you ruin my moment!
---
Rather than the rolling new server people keep talking about I hope we'll see stuff like that.
---
Yes hunters don’t do it to drink mana anymore though. They do it to drop trap for aoe, trinket swap, drop threat, or save the repair costs. If you’re fd+drink for mana, you should be down ranking your multi
---
I was the one talking with Kevin on that interview. He's right and wrong on that. Even though the design philosophy may have been one thing, the meta and the player base have done it. The person who wrote this guide, Caperfin is testament to that
---
&gt;It's not just about the community
---
That's all I hear people talk about when they say smth about Classic though? That's the main argument lmao.
---
I bet none of those herbs/ore have equivalent value in retail as say idk maybe using this exploit on Black Lotus in Classic. It would destroy everything...
---
Nah still in the beta, working a treat 👌
---
Yeah, a guide on how to be a scrub
---
Yes, it's the northern lordaeron area that you can only get to by doing some tricky things through the stratholme instance.
---
&gt;  at higher gear levels resto druids can compete with holy priests just fine in raw healing as well
---
not even in full naxx bis is this close to correct
---
Its been a while so this may not be 100% accurate, but basically when you DI'd Razergore and wiped all the eggs and adds despawned.  Then you used soulstone to rez and it was basically a tank and spank when the DI faded.
---
THis.
---
so if you do this, you can do the whole NE start zone no problem? you dont have to be night elf to get any of the quests etc there? id love to do that as a human aswell, always preferred that starting zone + best mount
---
You'll be LVL 1 still when you get there. When you go through IF and take the tram.
---
How else can it have LVL 1 gnome Hogger raids?
---
But how much is enough to you ? That's what interesting, and do shamans have certain mechanic that actually makes them able approach certain fights in different ways IE having a totem soak certain abilities or something ?
---
You will melt faces
---
Lvl 14 warlock on ND and level 60 warlock on retroWoW both giving same result.
---
You have to understand that those of us who wanted harder leveling, wanted flying removed, want 30+ skills keybound on our bars...no longer play.
---
We lost the argument with the current live players. 
---
The only ones left on live are those who like it or are too stupid to realize how bad the game is now vis a vis what it was. 
---
Blizzard will get an indication of their “silent majority” (who knows how many of us really want the old ways vs those who are content with bfa) on 8/27. If more people are playing classic, it’s pretty clear blizzard spent 10 years listening to the wrong shouting voices, after all those who are having a gas rarely go to the forums to rant about how good it is, only people who aren’t having fun do that.
---
This ^
---
Uhhh I did check it and it actually had almost 3x as much damage in reality. Venomstrike 14 top end Bow Of plunder 39 top end...so okay?

Gnome is the best for everything iirc
---
the problem with druids (at least resto) isnt really that they do a ton less healing because their fine for raid healing and have purposes. its more the fact that every single druid you bring past the first one makes them all signifigantly worse
---
Yes! We have a lot in our toolkit. I don't mean to be rude but perhaps read or watch the guide? I feel like this could go on forever :)
---
Weapon timers don’t keep time when they’re not equipped. Your 3.0s 2H timer *starts* when you equip it and *not* whenever you last swung.
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=567 he looked up the post cata version in reality this is what I'm talking about it's 39 top end vs 14 so....
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Word is that they are still trying to clear Vael to this day.... they need their hero back.....!  :)
---
If it’s the same as in actual Vanilla only xp is affected by quest level not the rep. Way back when I did most of of the human starting zones (Northshire, Goldshire, Eastvale, etc.) on my NE to get the horse mount
---
I think they're right in that streamers all got in to the beta, but why wouldn't blizz want all the streamers to get in?  They know it means a lot of people get to see the beta and it cranks up the hype for release.  They're also going to be playing quite a lot, they attract other players in game, and they attempt a lot of stuff/do dumb shit to entertain their viewers.  Those are all good things in a beta.
---
a dozen in 6 months! Your guild was rock solid haha. In 6 months in retail raiding we probably go through 30-40 people
---
When originally playing I didn't discover instant quest text or Ctrl looting for like 6 months lol
---
Seeing all of the posts in this thread got me feeling like I don't want to roll a warlock after all.... Can you guys provide real highlights for vanilla warlocks? I have terrible memories of my hunter getting absolutely dicked on by SL locks back when I was like 12/13 lol
---
Oh okay, thank you for the clarification. I haven't played WoW in a while so was confusing OSRS traits.  
---
This is probably why you haven't ever seen people weapon switching all the time haha
---
Can someone ELI5 layer changing?
---
Looks cool and has a great layout. What is there not to like about it? Especially the big square where everyone is gathering with the bank and Auction house on either side is nice. Orgrimmar is similar, but Ironforge looks more like a real city. 
---
Only thing I don't like about IF is the passages from the bank to the big forge where the flight master is. Considering how many people travel that way it should be bigger than the tiny tunnels we have.
---
I play a char on Kel'Thuzad. Have never seen asmongold or sodapoppin and the it is just regular shitty wow chat. The only reason i know there are numerous streamers on this server is from a random YouTube video. I'm sure sharing plays a huge role in this but I also think it is just Reddit hyperbole.
---
A source for the fact of the layer size. I can’t find this number.
---
go play on a private server then. these are all very welcome QoL changes and they need to implement more.
---
Yeah if you're complaining that it's too hard to gear in BFA you never raided in classic.  It's much harder to gear in classic and you need resistance sets and attunements just to raid.  This guy is a fucking nutjob.
---
Amen
---
Was my confirmation in the other thread not good enough for you?
---
I. JUST. MISSED. AGAIN
---
&gt;She's 62 and thinks BfA sucks
---
damn, even the people they clearly have designed the game around thinks their game sucks!
---
APES, arguably top private server guild
---
The difference is that you need to earn Rhok'delar or Thunderfury, so when you stand in Orgrimmar with your iconic weapon you feel special and when you see someone else with the same item you know they had to earn it.
---
The point is that the only pre requisite to becoming literally commander of the faction you play or the highlord of the argent dawn is giving blizzard money and playing for half an hour. This makes your prestigious title utterly meaningless and the world you interact with feel artificial and designed around praising you rather than being a convincing organic world that entices you to explore it.
---
Sorry to be the devil's advocate, but Classic isn't patch 1.12. It's based and balanced around it, but there are features that were part of Vanilla, intrinsec to the history of the game, that were gone by 1.12. Classic is an amalgam of the different phases of Vanilla. 
---
That being said, I dont think its needed. The amount of people in one layer is enough to make the respawn rate fair. Hard, but fair. Not to mention you dont need to finish the quests to gain exp. Group up, kill everything, share the loot and move one if you outlevel the quest and the rewards are not worth it anymore. 
---
Early level rewards are just whites. If you find a place that isn't very crowded, set camp there and grind your way to the next level. By the time I got to level 5 on my NE, I had enough silver to buy vendor gear in my way to Darnassus that was better than quest rewards, train my skills and buy 4 6-slot bags.

For those that don't want to click, it seems to be a player's macro collection and has a listing for:

---
Holy shit this entire subreddit is cringe. The game had addons since day one.
---
Firstly, can’t have 3 mains, that’s not how having a “main” works. 
---
Secondly, it’s beginning to sound more like you had an unhealthy obsession with your talent trees themselves, and less that you actually experienced gameplay differences. Cause how often do you interact with either system? Talents? Talent reset 2 times a week? To a build you know by heart? New talents, interact in cities before switching content from raids to 5 man’s to questing/farming.
---
I think at the end of the day we’ll have to accept some concessions, because it’s not 2004 anymore and a lot has changed for the better since then. I think the vanilla content and structure will outweigh any of that smaller stuff in the end personally.
---
True, but it’s not that, it’s the cliched “chosen one” story that removes player agency.
---
Because Ironforge has a very similar layout, but it's more structured.
---
Good find, thanks. The question is if 40 was the max back then or 100 like it is now.
---
That stress test had layering, i was in it and exploited it to find mobs to kill in the starting zones.
---
 You can swap groups to move through layers, you can farm other things early level that make a ton of gold at cap when layering is in. 
---
Also when i went outside Org  i was phased away from my raid and couldn't see them for about 10 seconds, those are problems.
---
What if you are chasing someone down to pvp in the world and phase out before you get to them. Easy to do, just ask people for invite and roll through \[people until phasing occurs.
---
I could swap groups to farm ore that is contested for a boost in matts/leveling mats. 
---
You also can just log out and back in to change layers.
---
Bruh you fucked it up
---
&gt;it's clear the pserver data is absolutely scuffed
---
1. stop using "scuffed", it's insanely overused
---
2. No, pserver numbers and values are not that off.
---
Cause your question is generic and has been asked a million times-if it’s legit. 
---
But it’s also a great way to bait out responses for you to debate...cause your OP drips with bias and an agenda.
---
Keep the faith. 
---
“If you want changes go play retail and ask for them there. “ If they want “Classic Reforged” they can ask for it in 3 years after we have got our pure release. 
---
Now is not the time to talk about changes/tweaks to classic. 
---
If you want classic style with changes. Ask for Live to be changed to be more like classic. Which everyone in the Classic community will back you on.
---
Is that a Foghorn Leghorn quote?
---
Ah yes, Wombat of Slaying...
---
Ok, those are nice opinions you have there in your unsolicited paragraphs of text. I think I speak for everyone when I say - why do you post here? Are you farming downvotes?
---
This isn't true either, I've had plenty of amazing experiences with wholesome people on pservers as well as negative. Don't let your experience define you
---
Genuinely sad when the server went down last night.
---
I did, but your only mention of amount of threat lies in '' their threat is nearly equal to that of a pure protection warrior ''. How much is that ? This is a boat load of information without a general threat output in numbers.
---
"there's no actual setbacks other than the setbacks"
---
Nice.
---
Got no problem with that. 
---
What I ***do*** have a problem with is fully automated cross-realm group matchmaking that teleports you inside the instance, and forces you into a baby-mode raid. All of those things shatter our sense of community. 
---
Thankfully we aren't getting that.
---
Layering will only stay for as long as needed. You're talking like it's staying forever when the game is released.
---
I think sunwell is a bit too brutal. I like a challenge but I also like having fun. Otherwise, with the addition of more 10 man raids, tbc may have been the perfect expansion IMHO.
---
I’m fucking stoked for this game but it’s a game dude, don’t lose your job over it.
---
Thrall....
---
&gt; I'm surprised anyone was allowed to reserve the name SERVER
---
Probably streamer scum.
---
Well they didn’t fire Jay Wilson after D3 is released, so blizzard moves in mysterious ways is all I’m saying.
---
Thank you, came here to say this.  I knew that was a thing at one point, but I was pretty certain it got removed.
---
!RemindMe 96 days "do"
---
6 weeks? You're joking right?
---
Did you see the math on the rockbiter slide? Shaman effectively sunder every auto attack. Remember though, threat generation is highly dependent on gear. So on an equally geared warrior, shaman can be very close.
---
They are using layering for the release yes. They are gonna use layering for as long as the servers look like they need it and that is the info we have.
---
I wasn't sure you were a closed beta tester, and there seem to be some conflicting statements to it in another thread. Wanted to make completely sure :) 
---
And I'm sure other people also want to know for sure to spread awareness - changes your gameplay a lot and makes grinding levels instead of questing more attractive as you don't miss out on the rep, but can return to it later. 
---
- was it the same rep values you get as opposed to doing it in low levels? Was it reduced by an percentage or an amount? Increased? 
---
If you'd be willing to test it or answer it that would be brilliant! ^^ nothing could be better.
---
who cares about mmo champion in 2019
---
I pre joined a guild already and I'll go on whatever server the leaders announce. I hope it doesn't turn out to be a popular streamer server but a small part of me is excited about the possibility that we may not know until it's too late. Sort of like opting in to play one round of Russian Roulette.
---
I mean if you are in /r/wowclassic, post a thread and you dont know about stress schedule... somethings wrong lmao.
---
Yeh it's great it's gone. It's one of the biggest reasons wow communities died out.
---
It simply took no effort and since it was cross realm, you had much more reason to not care about other people you joined with, because you would most likely never see them again and even if you did, nobody remembers one person put of a million.
---
This post is such pandering lol
---
My guess is the rookie who belong in retail will play classic, level to 10-20ish and say “what is this shit” and go back to retail. It takes significantly longer to do such simple things and now you can get level 30 in retail the same day you create the character.
---
On the flipside, once your guild managed to conquer Razor, Vael and the Suppression Room consistently, the rest of BWL typically fell to you pretty easily.  The colors you drew on Chrom and Nef could shift the difficulty a bit when you were still learning, but overall those weren't tough fights either.
---
Right up there with "Final Fantasy"
---
I know you are talking raids that we haven't seen yet, but from what I have seen on the beta streams, threat generation is still an issue for tanks.  I have seen plenty of times that a tank has mobs pulled off him by DPS/healers.  I'll reserve judgement until lvl 60 since all the lower level dungeons can be pretty easy when you know what you are doing but threat issues still seem to be a problem.  
---
And now that I actually think about it, tanks don't have good AoE threat generation at this point may also factor into it as well.  If my memory serves me right, they really isnt a good way for a tank to generate good AoE threat in Vanilla but I could be wrong.
---
I'll speak how I like thanks. And you have literally no idea how "far off" the numbers are on pservers since you have no idea what values they are using for classic. From everything we've seen so far, it looks pretty damn far off. It definitely could be off in the way that makes classic easier than a pserver though, agreed.
---
As a member of the old guard, I started Vanilla in late 04/early 05 (can’t exactly remember), all I can say is I couldn’t be more excited to get back in. 
---
I was up at 1am, and my alarm goes off at 4am for work,  raiding Hogger with a bunch of level ones during the stress test and it was the most fun I’ve had in the game since my TBC days. 
---
It’s not going to be a perfect re-creation or the game, but just being able to go back is enough for me to have zero complaints about if this or that isn’t exactly the way it was all those years ago.
---
Normally I'd say if you plan on doing any kind of pvp always go pvp racial. But if you have a personal reason to want to go troll, then go with it.
---
Nope, its about the world, the community, leveling, professions, making money, progressing in more then a single path.

True, Thrall is a good leader. But that doesn't really have anything to do with the layout of the city. And who ever goes to Thralls throne room anyway?

Could you please define what you view as "a crwoded lanuch week" and how surviving it, is any way, shape or form beneficial to the game/an Archievment?
---
Your 2nd Proposal is basicly a new "manual layering" with an entire new set of its own Problems. Like population Growth / fall, which will be constantly changing in the first couple months. With all the drawbacks directly noticeable to the Players.
---
I was tempted, started 12am UK time I think but decided against it.
---
Have you tanked on private servers? The meta has shifted significantly since then
---
Throttle power levels? Elaborate on what you mean
---
Definitely not that. The buffs are nice but resto shams are not as mana efficient as priests, even though resto were still the only spec to take to raids. No dispel either. I raid led in vanilla and would have traded half my shams for priests in a heartbeat.
---
On live it’s +12 Stam and a 1200 shield on use. I’m sure that’s why the Stam was brought up
---
Im surprised this isn't more common knowledge.  I'd be expecting people to think basalisk/medusa/stone gaze = don't look.
---
It may have been more, but it really was a well put together guild, with relatively low drama. I really enjoyed raiding with the Insurrection crew.
---
Sharding is very chaotic, Layering can be still implemented the way they want it but deactivate it on high lvl zones. It's a stable layer that your character bear and staying in it whenever you enter these layered zones, but if you are entering 30+ zone you are phased to 1 single stable unlayered server space. If you go back to low lvl zone you will get layered back.
---
I don't think that's how it's supposed to work?
---
Altho people have suggested that you can exploit layer hoping via invites from another layer, OPs example can be easily remedy but forcing players to always log back in to the same layer. Altho I don't know the technical wide of this, I hope it'll  be easy enough for blizzard to fix.
---
Perhaps OP suggestion is a bit immersion breaking and not the best solution, something has to be done about exploiting nodes in different layers, especially if it's by the invite method. Perhaps a cool down that's equal to node respawn times would suffice? How often would you really need to change groups, aka layers legitimately anyhow? Plus the experience of grouping while questing so players don't compete for kills is unaffected by layering, so that's a good start. But trying to LFG for a dungeon is where any sort of layer changing restrictions could be an issue.
---
And perhaps there are flaws to the cooldown suggestion too, either way, I feel like Blizzard will have to address this issue before classic release, or the exploiting will ruin the economy just for starters.
---
I think phase 1 will last longer than a month.
---
Oh, hey Melderon. Love your stuff and input on the class. 
---
I see where you’re coming from. Any chance of you making this happen in Classic? I can’t imagine too many guilds are prepping for this, but I’d love to see it.
---
Awesome post.  As someone who raided MC, Ony and BWL regularly, (never got Nefarion down before pre BC patch) this is very true.  We were a horde guild, so we didn't have much trouble with Vael (Shaman buffs helped a TON) and had him on farm after a couple weeks of tries, but Razorgore took our guild, lifted us up and cracked our back over his knee.  That fight was so insanely difficult, for the reasons you suggested above.  Our guild fractured multiple times and merged with others (I lost my officer status in a merge) and it was hell, but the merge helped us beat Razorgore.  We also had a ringer in from the top progression guild on our server join us for a fight and help direct a strategy.  It took time but we got it.  Ony was probably the hardest, along with Lucifron (our first ever raid kill).  It was a lot of fun, but I would say Ony and Razorgore tested our friendships more than Vael.
---
Amen. I’m lvl 22 in beta and plan on spending today just picking herbs in Redridge and offering to help Guildies with quests.
---
My mom was one of the top rated players in 2v2 arenas in wrath but not even classic could bring her back to wow now :'(
---
Yup. I love layering. I was there when server bog down caused literal lines of people trying to kill the same respawn. 
---
I was there when the answer to 10 hours of stagnate  questing to finally finish the BE starting zone, caused Blizz to open up a dozen servers the next week.
---
I Was there when all of the "What! Pandas are the death of wow" people left by the millions, and the added servers where so empty you couldn't find any one to make flasks. 
---
A slight ding, or flood of extra mats will only help keep prices for skilling up professions in check. It wont likely cause a lasting economy issue, if it is only for phase one like they say it will be.
---
Thanks you for your analysis. I hope a lot of people take the time to read it, because it is 100% right.
---
As a WoW player since Vanilla days, I know, 100% sure, that 60-70% of the guilds in Classic will NOT clear BWL, no matter how long they try it.
---
People are all "players today have skill, and access to guides, youtube, twitch, etc". That doesn't count for shit when facing BWL.
---
Yes, many guilds will clear BWL, but the majority will not, no matter the skill, gear, information, guides, etc. It is simply out of the realm of possibility for most guilds...because most guilds will be CASUAL guilds, and casual guilds need a FULL 40 PREPARED players for raiding.
---
Which they will NOT have. They won't do it in 35, or 32, or 37 people. They won't do it by overgearing. They won't do it with flasks...because casuals cannot afford the gold. The guild logistics, for BWL, is WAY above the guild logistic for MC. For MC, you need 15 good players, and 25 non-afk players. And that is it.
---
Now, I have been flamed here, and on WoW forums, for saying what you are saying (except I didn't bothered to present a 1,000 word analysis) : most guilds won't clear it, because most guilds are casual guilds.
---
I am sure plenty of people disagree...but those people never played Vanilla, or played it in a good guild, that cleared BWL. They just fail to realize that MOST players will be casuals, and BWL is going to be DAMN HARD for them...and their guilds will fail...because casuals do not have the time and the will to prepare for BWL.
---
Simple as that.
---
your whole guild will always be in the same layer, so if you have someone on 24 hours, you will never move layers unless you go to a group that is on a different layer.
---
This stream is offline
---
The problem is that Classic content is not really challenging to the average player anymore, at least not as much as it was back in Vanilla when it hit the sweet spot in terms of giving that feeling of accomplishment. Private servers buffed dungeon content which was really well received. It’s not fun facerolling dungeons, it’s like retail. But when you’re challenged and maybe even wipe a couple times it makes the loot drop that much more satisfying.
---
Ehh.. okay.
---
Have a good day sir : )
---
I wont do it endgame as I want to progress resto. You never know though, I may have time to do so after we have things on farm. But I will be tanking while leveling
---
What about one layer per character creation, you choose a layer and that's it. It's basically the same as having multiple servers except character and guild names for future merges. Would be complicated tho to choose a server and then a layer
---
&gt; There are plenty of other raid bosses that killed guilds in Vanilla. However, they usually came after Razorgore and Vael. Since you typically had to beat BWL before even seriously attempting AQ40 or Naxx, the number of guilds even attempting AQ40 and Naxx is much smaller than the number of guilds who attempted BWL. Bear in mind that the vast, vast majority of the playerbase didn't even step foot in Naxx. Moreover, a large chunk of the playerbase barely went into AQ40.
---
This is pretty dead-on.  The Naxx fights were a quantum leap in terms of difficulty and mechanics.  I feel like Blizzard tinkered with their formula in AQ, and then turned out the master product once Naxx was released.  It was the largest raid to date, and every single boss required Razor/Vael levels of coordination and perfection - except harder.
---
God I loved Naxx.  Re-releasing that raid in WotLK was one of the best moves Blizzard every made - that was such a great raid that it was really criminal that so few people saw it in vanilla.
---
OP, I was in the same boat as you - we cleared everything in Naxx up to 4H.  That fight was just absolutely brutal.  What Razor &amp; Vael were to BWL, 4H was to Naxx.
---
Just swim from tirisfall along the north border. Or arathi coast if you like punishment
---
this isn't hard to look into - anything bc recording pre-2.3 should give a good baseline look at this as well as I don't think instances were touched in bc from 1.12 until the 2.3 mass nerfs/changes.
---
Everything else from around that time I found referencing nameplate range, but not the command specifically, seems to indicate it was quite a low range, and everyone believed it was hard coded, and unchangeable (no proof given though.)
---
I honestly never used nameplates in vanilla, so sadly my memory isn't helping.
---
Try it on a dungeon boss.
---
Do you know who the guy is lol?
---
because people rush everything, he just told you
---
You can still just sit on a flying mount to not get ganked. Or hover in the air and look for people to gank that wont see you comming.
---
Flying mounts in general are terrible imo.
---
Sad truth is that vanilla raiding content is probably as hard as LFR these days and I'm an advocate for Vanilla. Retail mythic raiding is no joke, and I consider myself apart of the 1%. Took me and my guild 600 pulls to down Mythic Argus in Legion and similar pulls done by guilds like Method. People tend to forget that. I still think Vanilla is a better game though. The journey, the community, the game as a whole is the full package. The only thing retail offers is difficult raiding, even M+ is pretty boring when you are already doing top end game content.
---
RemindMe! 95 days “wow commands”
---
Why bother? Changes nothing.
---
&gt; “cherry on top” means metaphorically that something small and special is added to something else that is also very nice to make it just that much more enriched. It comes from the idea that a bowl of ice cream is wonderful, but even more wonderful if a cherry is put on top"
---
&gt; How wouldnt a cosmetic item that drops from that boss they just killed, and theybsaidnwould be really cool if it dropped, not be a nice little bonus for them after a near 3 hour run doing a dungeon that required near perfect execution?
---
&gt; Not to mention it was the number one channel on twitch streaming for 100k people.
---
&gt; How absurd is it to think a gm or Omar would give them a reward to say "hey good job". A cosmetic item, on a beta test server.
---
&gt; You're just salty that these streamers are playing and you're not, and ontop of that they're making you look bad at the game, so you say it's not true damage as OG classic. Of course you don't want blizzard to reward them, you want them banned. That has to be true because why else do you care if they get it? How does it affect you or anyone negatively? Who does it hurt? It hurts your feelings and that's it
---
A shadow priest will melt faces in pvp.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "Swag Weather"
---
I've had this fight about a million times, so I've decided to ignore it. Religious people are literally incapable of minding their own business.
---
You have no idea what are you talking about. Basically, you are dead wrong.
---
I think it's more that in general questing you just spam your rotation. Leveling up in Vanilla used a ton of utility and situational spells that could keep you alive. It's funny because raiding is actually the most boring part of the Vanilla in terms of ability use.
---
Your right i should go back and edit that to say the biggest setbacks are time and gold.
---
Yeah was gonna say lots of classes have no aggro dump.
---
It would be like trying to build a mage that doesn't cast spells but only uses improved wand talent.  The spell isn't balanced correctly and most warlocks don't even pay the gold to train it after they try rank 1 for shits and giggles.
---
Thats what I was thinking. Instant gratification, low attention span, frontloaded content... its all ready, thats the crowd that degraded wow to what it is on live
---
I want no part of that
---
How am I Biased, I legit said I can't say it's a bad game because I havn't played it. I was looking for big boy adult answers, not kiddies wanting to argue over which version of the game is better. All posts about this subject are children arguing about their opinions.. I didn't argue about anything I just asked if I was missing something since I never played it. 
---
Side note, you took time out of your day to reply to a "troll" so who lost here?
---
I'm basing my damage it on the damage meter.  You don't understand the point I'm making, that's fine with me.
---
Remember when AQ was released? It was full of bugs.
---
Wow I do not remember vael despawning after  an hour. Guess that means my vanilla guild was good. Razorgore was such an annoying fight to reproduce.
---
For any future raiding rogues out there, if you want a fun spec during Vaelestraz attempts, go deal fate prep with daggers and backstab the shit out of him. That was our secret for top damage because with infinite energy we just sat at his hindquarters spamming backstab and had 2 vanishes to reset aggro.
---
bro. have you seen the front page?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsaewr/layering_is_fine_guys_dont_worry/
---
Remember that the bloodvine set doesn't actually require tailoring to wear, it's only a requirement for the 2% crit bonus. With tailoring the bloodvine set is your BiS until T3. Without it you can replace parts of it and there are intense discussions on discords about which items are BiS once AQ is out. I will personally go for the full T2,5 set because I like it and I'm the lock CL. BOW YA SHITS!
---
If you played until 30 minutes before you have to wake up why even bother going to bed
---
The world record for a 1-60 is a shade under 5 days of played time (116 hours). Nobody's going to hit that to start with due to competition on everything in zones. Even with no lifeing I doubt a single person is going to hit 60 in the first week.
---
Exactly! A lot of my retail friends do not want to play classic for the exact reasons I want to. Taking more time to level, having to farm for things, no daily quests, no LFR. I’m stoked!
---
It's the same shit, only the size is different
---
You can still hop to other ~~shards~~ layers
---
Why would you "twiddle your thumbs" just because you're the only lvl 60?   
---
There is still plenty you can do before everyone catches up that will make it easier for you to raid and get into raids, you're not 100% ready to raid just because you ding 60.   
---
Just because you're too narrow minded to see the point of it doesn't mean its wrong. Let him play the way he wants.
---
What you like &gt; being a meta slave
---
Yeah WotF is nice. But it doesn't matter if you hate looking at your Mage because he's a bag of bones instead of a sexy blue ninja turtle.
---
Lol c'mon playing 40 hours a week on optimized routes isn't average by a long shot.
---
Agree, but mages obviously have an upper hand as they can do ok while changing their damage type.
---
The community aspect won't go away, it's just a core component of Classic. But you should expect that "community" isn't always going to be in the form of everyone being friendly. Community also means that guilds and players will have rivalries, and toxic players will grief and troll to make a name for themselves. That's all part of it too, and it adds to the experience.
---
That method link with the rogue only having 19 gold. Ah yes, Classic. Where everyone's poor.
---
Axes usually arent too fast, at least not that I came across on the pserver I've been on. You want a fast weapon (I used daggers a lot) to make sure you're procing flurry and WF as soon as you can. Unless I'm totally wrong and have been noobing it up this whole time.
---
I was in a guild that really blew up over the loot issue.  We weren't that hardcore but we were still trying to progress.  When an epic necklace dropped and we were comparing gear to see who should get it.  We noticed a hunter that always raided with us had a green necklace.  This was in wrath so there was no excuse for someone who had been raiding for months already didn't bother trying to upgrade a green he was still wearing.  His clique was arguing he should get the piece since it was the biggest upgrade, a lot of other people were saying he should be kicked out of the raid for doing shit dps and not putting any time into his character when other players were bringing pots/food/etc.  That was the last day the guild ran a serious raid, the guys carrying the raid didn't want to play with people who weren't taking it at least a little seriously and we really felt he was wasting our time.
---
Preaching to the choir on this subreddit lol but yeah I’ll be there
---
Probably the video where tipsout interviews the devs.
---
Yes, sharding / layering wasnt in Vanilla but they did not know how many people were interested. If todays technology and knowlegde was there they might have used it in Vanilla already.
---
The use case is clear. People want to see only people from their realm, dont want any hopping to gain adventage.
---
I hope layering goes in this direction. Time will tell.
---
Post #3: opts in, doesnt play, doesnt plan on playing. Its time to change betas.
---
What a shithead
---
&gt;New skills great. Minor balancing great.
---
That's the stuff I was talking about..
---
Strafing animation bugs out when targetting someone. Your character plays the 'running forward' animation instead of the strafing animation (this is probably a leftover from the selection-dependent head-turning Legion feature).
---
everyone dc'd, also 24hrs of no sleep was bad :D
---
My causal raiding guild was stuck on razorgore for 3 months due to the guild being full of casual players and raid leader mistakes.  By the time we got him down the rest of BWL was easy mode.  Vael was especially easy because we brought like 10-15 warriors to every raid.
---
One thing to note, the author talks about the Silithid hives near the end and theorizes about possible old God influences being planned.
---
The truth is probably a lot less interesting. If you compare the minimap of southeast Tanaris to the bottoms of the Outland test minimap, they line up almost perfectly. They likely used Tanaris as a base template and just edited the terrain. The silithid hives are the original Tanaris ones they just didnt bother removing.
---
&gt; Dungeon/Raids are done with more careful planning and pulling. CC really changes the outcomes of every fight.
---
Have you seen the beta? You don't need CC, dungeon mobs barely do damage. It's all faceroll.
---
When I first leveled, I didn't have anyone to play with or show me the ropes. I never knew theramore existed. One day I saw the boat for the first time in menethil and curious me jumps on. Seeing another castle, on the swampy land with dragonkin was fucking mind blowing and is one of my favorite moments in wow.
---
So even easier? Lol.  Did the throne/cave thing always work?  Coulda swore they patched that out well before 1.12.   Did those waterlords exist before the cenarion circle was added to silithus?  I remember it being a zone with nothing in it while we were doing MC.
---
There will be a LFG/LFR addon, don’t worry.
---
Afaik dungeon bosses do not have the "Everyone inside this zone is in combat" mechanic that raid bosses do.
---
um what? the record was over 4 days played time what are you talking about?
---
I wish there was a system that worked zone by zone instead of the whole continent, so multiple layers created by high population on starter zones wouldn't open the opportunity to get multiple empty high level zones as well. 
---
Oh wait... 
---
But I'd see people I'll never interact with disappear on my screen. That would ruin my immersion for a few weeks, which is way worst than having all the crafted high level gear prices controlled by a few guilds for a few months, right guys?
---
Unfortunately undead got a better spell in pvp
---
And in pve nothing beats fearward so dwarfs is best.  
---
Tho trolls look awesome.
---
What an absolute beast.
---
I played on a pserver launch with 13k people. It was madness. But I'll take madness over layering anyday. People will exploit it day 1 and for many people that will be the line that they will not cross.
---
yeah so you won't be able to log in at all
---
see you on May 29th ?
---
I'm not trying to be big headed but I loved seeing a shadow priest out on their own in PvP. I was a BM hunter. I just ran straight in hit them with mana sting, popped bestial wrath and minced the shite out of them. God I miss mana sting.....
---
Especially considering Hitler did nothing wrong, Blizzard is far worse
---
Warlocks need GREEN FIRE!!
---
Nat pots were used on Huhuran  
---
Nat pots and all kinds of wierd stuff was used on Viscidus  
---
Frost pots were used on Sapp  
---
DPS elixers, dark/demon runes, blasted lands buffs where all used in mc+
---
LMAO oh kiddo, you're funny.
---
I wish I was. **I believe** you will have a bunch of 60s in the first week and a half. 3 weeks to gear up and a couple weeks to clear Molten Core.

It’s clearly a hunter head piece......
---
What makes you think horde have an edge in pve? Paladin buffs alone give alliance a tremendous advantage in pve. All the world firsts were alliance and often times the absolute best horde guilds were behind dozens of alliance guilds in progression.
---
I'm not crying you're crying!
---
haha, only one who seems to be whining is you.
---
Great counter argument well said, really got people on your side
---
It's not my fault he calls me out when I'm 1% on threat behind the tank.  I generated the threat just doing the standard damage rotation, nothing special.  Did you guys even raid in Vanilla or use omen?  I'd FD when I catch up with tank and just repeat.
---
My guild's leadership decided on a DPS everything down strat for razorgore.  It didn't go well, but the raid leader never gave up on it.
---
A crowded launch week would be, say, a limit on 3k concurrent players on a single server, and no further regulation. Number of servers so that there are moderate queues for each one, initially.
---
The benefits are
---
* no tampering with what a server is - no phasing, no cross-realm, no nothing - which could last for weeks or longer
---
* forced player influx over time, rather than all at once (controllable, steerable, reactive)
---
The servers would be packed for weeks no matter what, especially with people waiting for the traffic jam to dissipate a bit. Merging when population levels drop notably, but not for the first few weeks.
---
Grats dude, clearing any mythic progression is one hell of a feat. I'll miss the crazy mechanics for sure but I'd still pick Classic any day. Nothing beats that crazy hype when someone finally gets ***[That Item]*** and everyone spazzes out.
---
I want to start out by saying that I couldn't be any more thrilled that classic is coming back. I love classic, but man I thought the peak of the game was wotlk.
---
I don’t like reading quest texts but tried the addon and it really is cool for immersion
---
“Since TBC” is inclusive to TBC. His achievements are incongruent with that statement.
---
Example: “I’ve been playing tennis since high school.”
---
This sentence means that I began to play in high school. It is inclusive to the mentioned timeframe.
---
If you’re meaning “after TBC”, you either say “since Wrath” or literally just “after TBC”. 
---
Don’t insult others’ comprehension when you have no clue how you’re using a language incorrectly.
---
Yeah! playing with other people sucks!... moron.
---
&gt; On the flip side, when I play something like Civ 6, when I get to the point where I have a very clear path ahead of me to win (I've conquered 51% of the map, etc.) I tend to stop playing that save file, even if I know there is the occasional surprise war or set of natural disasters that might need my attention.
---
Huh, that's exactly what happens when I boot up Civ nowadays! You just get to a point where it stops being engaging and there's a very specific moment in each and every game that this happens. It's so weird though, because the game is really good otherwise. I guess I only enjoy the beginning of building my original civilization, and don't enjoy expanding.
---
I'm getting a real Howard Stern vibe here. A lot of people who disliked him still tuned in religiously for some weird reason.
---
Same :)
---
It's a good cringe thread if you're into those things. No loss there though ^^
---
Heros is fought at 05:05:10 nearly two hours after they first start the dungeon but the run up to that point is just as exciting.
---
Probably been written up before and is on his last strike lol
---
Imagine putting a video game before work.
---
Oh yeah, for sure.  But I also feel like there are many games out there that don't have any sort of "game over" screen, or avenue for mistakes other than slowing down a bit.  
---
I strongly agree with what Kevin is saying here but I think it's more about the limitations of human psyche when it comes to games more than "objective" good game design.  To give another analogy, someones enjoyment of Game of Thrones "wasted" if they didn't like the finale, or where it ended up?
---
Does the journey excuse the destination?  Etc.
---

---
Yep, sounds like everyone is going horde.
---
I can visualize that so vividly. Like... cool, I mean I love to talk about the game with people, really, I do... but right now I would drive through 20 brick walls between me and my CD drive just to play this.
---
15 years ago iwas 12 and married with childrens. Havent played since Draenor really and now no wife no kids, ready to rumble
---
My parents just don't understand gaming as a hobby. Binge watching Game of Thrones or something? Great. Gaming? Waste of time.
---
No game is worth this. Get your shit together man or you can't pay for that dank internet and wow classic subscription!!
---
Playing Classic with today's tech/layouts is perfect, and is quite frankly the goal for many players. I don't need the old layout and my old 2004 computer for 'authenticity'
---
Saronite bombs, Martin Fury, lots of shit, dude.
---
It's low level content, it was never hard.
---
That is fucking extreme. It‘s a donation at the end. That money has been donated by somebody who already payed taxes. Feels really unfair.
---
He's happily married with 3 kids actually lol, but he's definitely a bit... yeah.
---
\-if you play hunter or warlock, don't listen to people in gnomeregan telling you to dismiss your pet, they're most likely trolling you.
---
In Vanilla you had to cast it/turn it on from the spellbook but it didnt appear as a buff it appeared in a UI marker alongside the minimap. Same for other tracking abilities like track Humanoids and Track beasts.
---
Why would you play Alliance anyway
---
There's no real point unless you wanted to just have some fun. You don't sound like you're in a position to grind gold for tokens, which is the only reason I've been playing retail. The mechanics in retail are so different that you might do yourself a disservice to get used to it, only to revert to vanilla's simpler, sometimes blockier, systems.
---
Oooh, you can't gouge from behind?
---
Soul shard management with vanilla bag sizes, and lack of mobility were my two biggest cons.
---
Undead
---
Yeah!  I think a mental puzzle is a really great way of putting it.  I think the two big buckets are figuring it out and executing, and Cities: Skylines basically foregoes execution to focus on figuring it out.  It usually comes down to reaction time as the key factor - if you couldn't ever pause Cities, would it be more of a traditional game?
---
My bad, I forgot about the enchants. I can never forget the wonderful boss where mages get the turtle morph spell. ZG was my guild's drunken runs and we always did that fight just for the laughs
---
I remember the nerfed version of MC we got for the 10 year anniversary. Cleared it with a pug. We wiped so many times and it took so long to clear the whole instance. LFR is a snoozefest. Sure you can't compare it to mythic today but it sure does beat LFR
---
If it's anything like private servers, then yes. The limited spawns of certain quest mobs makes that area interesting to say the least.
---
&gt; but if you are entering 30+ zone you are phased to 1 single stable unlayered server space.
---
So what if that server is full? Does zoning into a 30+ zone log you out and put you in queue?
---
Vanilla though Wrath. Although I'm not sure why that would matter. The population is going to drop after 3-6 months because alot of casuals and tourists will quit the game. A lot of us that played back in the day were kids. We'll play, certainly, but it's unlikely I'll have the time to put 10 hour days in anymore. I've got a fiance and a social life. I am not alone in this regard.
---
!remindme 97 days
---
Retail has a strong e-Sports presence. That alone will prevent classic from surpassing retail, but only in my baseless opinion.
---
imo the true purpose of layering is to avoid dead low-pop servers months after launch. Blizz is concerned that servers will fill up with retail players who play for a few weeks and then quit. Layering is a way to have 15k players on one server at launch, with the understanding that it will drop to 5k after a few weeks.
---
I'm not sure what they'd do if the population didn't drop off.
---
Lol horde are about to get rekt in pvp going to be so funny
---
I could see a system where the people who play classic. say anyone with a level 45+ can vote on if a change should be allowed or not and they need to get say um...... 85 percent approval with a minimum number of votes to work. 
---
That said not until everything is out but i could see it for av where you can sign up for the newer version of the week long battle version for the bg.
---
I heard people like classic runescape and I think they do something like that or maybe i'm way off. I'd probably vote no on any changes atm though, but thats just me and im making up number randomly for my example.
---
Thought the smiley area was only accessible as a gnome with noggenfogger!
---
Just want to point out that you will very likely have to move around during many fights. Know what you can't do while moving? Cast shadowbolt. You can however cast some dots, lifetap for mana, etc.  
---
I mained a warlock through all of vanilla and with having quit the game at the end of Wrath I'm super excited to play a Warlock again.
---
Expect a big reddit post listing who is going where early on, mainly due to name reservations. Shouldn't be hard to avoid.
---
30 minutes of sleep is worse than 0
---
id prefer the game to be as it was when originally released.
---
no dynamic spawn timers please. i prefer waiting.
---
I can't speak for other older folks and I don't watch twitch much, but I'm about the same age and appreciate how mature and drama-free he is compared to most of the others.

These “everything will go to shit” threads are the worst. Now we’re complaining about things that haven’t even happened yet?

I really didn't like it! I'd rather have laggy orgrimmar than empty org, but maybe thats me.   
---
A new mechanic emerged where you'd ask in trade to be invite to the 'busy layer' - and then suddenly you'd pop into a crowd of people once you got the invite.
---
PvE? Not really anything different between UD and Orc. Orc has 5% more pet damage but that's not going to be relevant in endgame.
---
PvP? Orc has stun resist, UD has Cannibalize and WotF. I would say Orcs are stronger, since their racial is relevant in literally every single matchup (stun resistance works vs grenades).
---
&gt; Unfortunately undead got a better spell in pvp
---
Very debatable. Devouring Plague is a massive resource investment (Shadow Priest already suffers on mana) on a 3 minute CD and can easily be removed by 4/8 classes(?) or anyone carrying a Jungle Remedy. Against good players, in a lot of matchups, it'll be a dead spell. 
---
Shadowguard has no cooldown, works with all your shadow priest talents (e.g. Blackout), scales well with shadow damage gear and is a minimal mana investment. 
---
Not to mention the obvious superiority Hex of Weakness has over Touch of Weakness. 
---
Really the only reason Undead is often a favored choice is because WOTLK has much more swing value than Berserking (and few Shadow Priest spells work with cast speed, though Berserking into Mana Burn in grouped PvP is fantastic).
---
im curious if they will do some mini "events" like in classic. like being able to kite a world boss to sw or the corrupted blood.
---
I'm not 100% but I think I remember seeing that my dwarf had the IF flight path by default on stress test.
---
Indeed it is :D
---
I want to instill those values in our guild because I've been in guilds where leadership and members were insufferable, and I don't want that with our guild.

Yeah but the hate towards lfg and lfr is based in the removal of community. Look at how many streamers and you tubers are talking about making friends by playing and communicating with people. When was the last time you made a friend from, if ever, in lfg or lfr?
---
If the raids are easy, that’s fine for an older gamer like me. I’ll raid two times a week and enjoy shooting the shit with my mates. Much respect to the mythic raiders but I don’t have the time for that anymore, but I’m glad for the options that classic brings.

Part of Blizzard's core game design is making everybody feel overpowered, but its a fine line between the big picture of overpowered - feeling like you've grown and accomplished everything - and walking away from a small scenario feeling overpowered.  It feels really good to pull an entire dungeon room that you once had to go through carefully, but if that's the standard you meet fairly quickly, it doesn't feel nearly as special.
---
Depends on what you want to do. For pvp you generally want the slower weapon with windfury because of the burst. That being said if you are against an opponent who can't heal. A faster weapon with flame tongue or rockbiter can be better. That being said if you are repping WF by this patch it has an internal 3 second timer. So a fast weapon and WF is no good.
---
BWL is a good guild test imo because it separate the goods with the bads etc, in preparation for even harder raids, it's a good thing.
---
Look layering isn't perfect, I know. I truly hope it's not exploitable, but IMO it's preferable to sharding + mergers.
---
omg, its so dang refreshing to have to look for groups again!
---
I believe it's essentially the same thing as channels from other MMO's. In order to prevent major congestion at Classic launch, as one layer (channel) becomes full, players are then put into a new layer (channel) until that becomes full, etc. I believe these are supposed to be zone-wide, with each zone having it's own layers. They said this is only going to be implemented during the first phase of launch (before world bosses releases).
---
The one you like.
---
Horde so you don't have to deal with WoTF
---
That’s really helpful, thanks.
---
 HOW THE FUCK DO YOU RUN THAT FAST. WHAT ARE YOU ON THAT I'M NOT?
---
50g a pop and partially different gear sets
---
Warlocks get oversampled in class polls. They will be on the bottom end of chars at 60.
---
I'm excluding ALL of the time running around for various steps, but it's safe to say that adds significant time.
---
1. Kill Broodlord (1 day, assuming you have him on farm)
---
2. Collect fragments (at 10 secs per mob, this is 1000-1200 carapaces per hour, or ~30 hours of straight farming, assuming 9 hours for sleep and food, that's 2 days)
---
3. Farm dragonkin at the 4 portals, the first 3 fragments had less than 1% drop rate. Ashenvale and Feralas took about 1 hour each, Hinterlands took upwards of 10 hours, and the final fragment took a full raid team. So let's call it another day, but that's generous.
---
4. Another 40 man encounter, but let's lump this in with the previous day.
---
5. Complete BWL in 5 hours (1 day, assuming you have him on farm).
---
6. Complete Molten Core (and hope the goggles drop, 1 day)
---
7. 10-man encounter + a bit of farming.
---
8. 5-man encounter.
---
9. 15-man encounter
---
10. 5-man farming at a 4% drop rate.
---
11. More farming at 6% drop rate. (let's add all the above into 1 day, but again, that's generous).
---
12. Kill Onyxia.
---
13. Kill Broodlord again (let's assume 1 day for an Ony+BWL clear)
---
14. Clear MC again.
---
15. Another 20+ man raid encounter (let's assume 1 day for MC+Maws kill). Important to note that if another player accidentally loots the pages, you have to wait a week.
---
That's 8 days, most of which need to be raid nights. The fastest guild did it in 7 (Macabre on Mannoroth). The first server had the gates open in 19 days. So you'll have ~20 days to fit in ~8 days of raiding and round-the-clock farming.
---
if you just want a raid spot and nothing else....... idk tank or healer maybe?
---
Just play on PvP server. Most the streamers are fairly crappy players..
---
If you can't avoid them... Gank em.
---
I could say the same thing about what you said, without providing any arguments.
---
Would completely break the game balance for Vanilla. The hardware limits on the server pop caps from Vanilla affected how they balanced the world. If they put more people per server than Vanilla had, some guilds will never even see things like Black Lotus, Thorium, or World Bosses.
---
races start with their capital cities learned.
---
As a human, I ran to Redridge, and could (if i had gold) fly to Stormwind.
---
I'd imagine it's more likely that a trusted Holy Palidan gets permission to roll Ret.
---
Personally I'm buying my classic WoW a vibrator to spice things up.
---
A buddy and I once stayed up until 8am swimming around the northern part of Lordaeron trying to get into unfinished zones. Man I wish they didn‘t patch out climbing.
---
That's a good idea, it's also very roleplayish.
---
You would have to go to cities to gather with your friends
---
Each layer is essentially the population of a server. Layering is there to prevent the first few days from turning into a total shitshow of people trying to complete the same quests, killing the same mobs, etc.
---
I love transmog. but IMO, that has nothing to do with game play.  but big agrees on everything else.
---
Each layer is a full continent, so it affects all zones.
---
Competition for mobs depends on the size of each layer. There was one dev interview that said a layer would be similar in size to a full vanilla server (3k players). In that case, AoE farming wouldn't be substantially easier because you'd still have roughly the competition.
---
If layers are 500 people, then AoE mages have it made.
---
I think this is the biggest straw man ever. My nephews are 7 and 4 years old and I can’t get them off vanilla. They die all the time and they’re ok with it
---
Tell that to people looking for 2k rio for 10s mplus mate :D
---
Artificially made it harder by bringing useless dps, just bring hunters or atleast a ron-ret. Might aswell have done the run with a shaman tank.
---
This heinous oversight has ruined Classic.  Might as well shut it down now.
---
&gt; you have no idea what values they are using for classic
---
Thanks for confirming you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
The beta builds have been datamined, since you don't seem to know.
---
True I played NE priest so my only experience was getting ganked by undead priest. The few troll priest I faced I was able to deal with.
---
No real restrictions. BUT, if you're playing a class that NElf doesn't have, there's no trainers in Darnassus, and you'll need to travel for training.
---
I do 5-8 there as a human, but don't need trainers during that time.
---
I was in the hur dur "we're the elite raiders in this casual raiding guild" clique in my guild. We had our own private chat channel and everything where we'd talk shit about the filthy casuals.  However, the clique was never really an issue with guild stability.  Everyone respected the guild leader and the guild didn't pretend to be anything other than a family friendly casual raiding guild.  It helped that the GM wasn't in the hard core raid clique.
---
as of right now we dont exactly know how itll work and how they define a play session. even if its pretty restricted you guys shouldnt be limited in any way when playing together :)
---
That's a shitty response. How many of us have written walls of text about retail in the hopes that blizzard would do something to fix it? 
---
Disagreement is fine, but hes absolutely right about the majority of quests in wow. They aren't some god tier story being told, they're thematic things to do in the zone to get your character to a higher level and tell the story of that zone. Some expansions and zones are better at it than others. He doesn't like vanilla quests because they dont tell as good of a story as taela or runas (although I'd tell him to check the Marshall Windsor quest line).
---
I’m not sure, I haven’t seen any streamers explain or go over fishing. But I think they will bring it up to speed so it’s a smooth experience like how they are adding quality of life changes at launch
---
This is why I have trust issues
---
Most of that wont apply if Perplexity plays the deadzone well with crippling poison - which he did and will.
---
Piercing howl would have been a godsend in this scenario (or a decent talent build to start with lul)
---
It won't take long. People complained in vanilla, they'll complain in classic.
---
Hell even some of us who are excited for Classic and its mechanics and balance and wrote off the modern game a long time ago have asked for things like guild banks or updated graphics.
---
I mean it's going to happen.
---
Sorry bud can’t tell ya but it is in Tanaris :)
---
I definitely think Troll Shadow Priest is a bit of a sleeper hit (and there's a pretty obvious bias for the Undead visuals for most people, there's a reason they're often like 40% on Horde) and generally more consistent for higher end PvP in todays metas. 
---
It's that I find Warlocks a more compelling class overall, or else I'd definitely main one for Classic.
---
Here's a comment from 2007 (around TBC launch) referring to this.
---
http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2007/01/dynamic-spawn-system.html?showComment=1169136840000#c8170295829632808938
---
&gt;I don't think this is any different from what Blizzard was already doing in the level 1-6 areas. Bliz sets a minimum population of boars, or skels, or whatever -- if the number alive drops below that minimum another spawns with no respawn timer.
---
&gt;Try exhausting all the wolves in the human newb area...it can't be done.
---
fucking cringe
---
Cept we are not.
---
He got to level 5 tho 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
&gt; Coulda swore they patched that out well before 1.12.
---
Well I did it on live (but before 1.12) and it works on private servers, but what do I know. It's a retarded gatekeeper anyway, just let players dodge the shit in the cave.
---
Of course they are. They have incredible buffs and rarely go home.
---
I got the ZG tiger in my first raid ever after hitting 60. I won with a 94. Everyone was pm'ing telling me congrats and I was like....uh is this good?
---
I was one of two people on my server to have that mount well into TBC.
---
Pretty much what my casual raiding guild did too.  We had feral druids healing for most of the MC and they respected to restro for a while during the early struggles in BWL.
---
No problem man. Common mistake every makes from going to Retail to classic is they think about endgame too much.. Me included. its going to take like i said MONTHS to get there. once you do you. have a bunch more content in the game to use. lol its pretty sad that Vanillia Wow has more content then WOD, Legion, BFA Combined. maybe not raids and instances wise but general things to do and ways to progress your character are limitless.
---
I had a rough childhood that led to me using computer games as a form of escapism. I wasted pretty much all of my teenage years shying away from the world because of severe social anxiety, and PC games were my crutch and vice.
---
WoW on the other hand gave me back my life. In my late teens I got back into WoW during Wrath, and the game waa at the tail end of requiring community presence to progress. Joining a guild, actually talking to people, raiding and being a part of something greater than myself, main tanking, having a leadership role, resolving disputes, working hard with others to succeed, and although it was arguably silly, even falling in love.
---
WoW ended up forcing the social skills I'd avoided down my throat. It honestly taught me so much about leadership and working as a group. Most importantly, it broke the boundary of my willingness to work hard in videogames versus in real life. By the end of it I was able to focus my efforts into my actual life in my career, the gym, the people around me, etc, and drastically improve my life.
---
Videogames were horrible for me growing up, but WoW in specific repaired so much of the damage that I inflicted on myself from nearly a decade of social anxiety, and set me on the path to being a very happy person today.
---
Conflag sucks without good gear.
---
I thought layering is implemented because of people that will drop the game before 30-40 lvl zones.
---
Were going home
---
I watched Asmongold yesterday for about 1 hour and the day before for the same amount of time.  I switched over to Esfrand shortly there after.  I found him to be much more enjoyable and grateful for everyone there.
---
God bless
---
Both your sentences directly contradict themselves. If a layer had the population of a server, it would be just like releasing regular servers with regular population caps. 3k players, 6 starting zones, deal with it.
---
Where do most people get their addons for classic? Minion?
---
Both are necessary for raids.  Mages do better DPS, but they are raising the DoT slots, so locks DoT's will be more useful in raids from the get go.  Locks are necessary due to the utility they have than mages.  Locks will be portalling, healthstone, soulstone, banish, decursing.
---
Not as straight DPS as mages, but still very needed in the raids.  Either would be a fine choice.  They are both pretty popular.  Locks do get a cheap mount at 40.
---
Every single person on a private server is a hardcore player by comparison with the average player who will be making a character on launch day. The overwhelming majority of people who play BFA now only do LFR. The average WoW player is an LFR tier player.
---
I never played wow before, and I decided to play Classic on release, for the reason that I really want quality MMORPG where grouping matters and where I don't 1-shot everything I see. Yesterday I started to play on a private vanilla server to get some experience about the game before Classic is released.
---
That being said, I got a few questions:
---
1.  I read that engineering is the best profession in Vanilla WoW, I can see why by gathering information about it. I do see that it is a crafting profession and that I need materials for it. How hard is it to get those materials while leveling? It seems mining is needed, but I am 100% sure that nodes will be contested and it will all be just pointless while leveling. I think a better idea would be to do engineering later, once materials can be bought. Mining is maybe not even needed then. Correct me on this one. I need insight on how to go about it :) Wait until level 60 to do it? Start a bit later, like lev 40 or so? Or just pick mining and engi and do it since level 5 or so?
---
2. If engi and mining later into the game, maybe better skinning early levels? To get some items to sell to NPC vendors. I plan to play Night Elf Hunter (or Warrior, not sure yet) and buy the best available weapons from vendors if needed. If yes, what else than skinning? 
---
3. If I am 100% honest, I am not a person that likes gathering and crafting, it ain't enjoyable to me, and I would rather spend as little possible time on it unless it is important to have. What is your stance about it? Is that completely fine? For example to ignore all professions, except maybe skinning early levels, and then around level 40+ start preparing for Engineering.
---
I'd put cannibalize under PvE too (for lvling) it makes downtime between pulls quite low.
---
Nochanges
---
There’s a wow arena league outside of blizzcon?
---
nobody thinks orc looks good, if they nerfed the stun resist most people would be undead
---
You can still log in and see the realm (offline) with the marker showing how many characters you had, so maybe keep them? Unless they wipe it just before the test.
---
All raids in classic will be cleared within the first 6 hours of their release.
---
Orc are probably the best race hands down. The stun resist is just way too good to pass up. In pve I guess WOTF may have more uses? Im not sure tbh. However, play what you want.  You have to understand these class passive/abilities really make a tiny difference. There are many other variables that come before passive/abilities that will dictate a fight.  If you think Undead look better play undead because you will enjoy you're class WAY more if you like your race.
---
"Unending Breath For Real This Time"
---
Not in any semi serious capacity.
---
LFR made raids entirely trivial. Add 4 difficulties overall, and suddenly these special, cool places became just another instance to queue and clear.
---
Inb4 "bUt mYtHIc iS sO HaRd" - Yes, it is. And mythic raiding is tons of fun, but there shouldn't be more difficulties than a Warrior has specializations, that's just awkward.
---
2 already is more than enough. Normal, being a fair challenge, and Heroic, which is truly challenging. To be honest, I'd prefer NO difficulties whatsoever and just have an easy introduction raid. TBC did this so well, Karazhan wasn't really difficult for the most part, but was a fun and well made place.
---
But why do that when you can just cut mechanics andcall it content? Way easier and investors love it.
---
It’s mostly bad due to mana management; the dps is okay and utility is still good. If you want to do 5-mana and world content it’s fine, just bring water and expect to drink often. If you want to raid then it’s pretty bad; you’ll go oom and be unable to do anything productive for half the fight.
---
All I said is there is going to be crying, and that crying could be completely avoided because this is the only time in history we know exactly what the only changes are coming to the game for the foreseeable future.
---
It's for both. Hundreds of characters is better than mutliple thousands.
---
If you're this irresponsible over a stress test then launch is going to destroy your life. You might want to spend the next couple months working on self-control and a time management plan.
---
there are basilisks in desolace, too. if it weren't for maraudon, most people wouldn't know of that place :D
---
turning around is a neat trick btw, i used to run away from the stare because the range is pretty short but turning around seems way smoother.
---
Still used in retail to this day. Standard procedure I think, in the WoW client.
---
Depending on my friends choices I’m either going to first roll a troll hunter just because I never played that class.  Or a human rogue (same reason). 
---
I can’t stand the UD models so your statement about trolls makes me very happy. As I’m probl. Going to roll a healer as second class where troll priest or orc shaman was my options.
---
&gt;     ungeon/Raids are done with more careful planning and pulling. CC really changes the outcomes of every fight.
---
Well yeah, people are using level 40 weapons at level 30, bis gear at level 30, that shit doesnt happen while leveling in normal progression.
---
I think this could be resolved with a prompt: "A new layer has opened, do you wish to join it".
---
Like, I would be willing to switch layers most of the time. Just let me choose when the switch occurs. I don't want to be auto switched when gathering a resource, or fighting a mob... etc.
---
IIRC GW2 does this with their mega server system.
---
Rag will be down faster than 6 weeks.
---
Yesterday on a private vanilla server, someone made fun of me for leveling as a prot spec warrior (I am lvl 23). I enjoy leveling very much, why should I want to kill every mob as fast as possible?
---
M guild never got him. We didn't disband, just kind of tried and failed every week lol :(
---
I'd prefer no changes as well but I could see after a few years if the massive majority of people in classic want something and can prove it by being voted on with accounts that actually play with a minimum number of votes and massive majority i could see it happening and would hope its only minor things like...... idk...... way to change demon pet name? seems dumb but you never know.
---
Personally i'd likely vote no on everything and the only change im fine with atm is having battlenet on your friends list because i think even warcraft 3 and the like has that now.
---
Level 30 threat is very different to level 60 since you have very few talents and the rage generation is much lower. Strong AOE threat is always a bit of a challenge unless you use a sapper, but there's a lot of optimisation you can do to improve boss threat at 60 (which is what matters in raids). Mostly involving speccing heavily into fury and dual wielding. At level 30 all you need to do to keep single target threat is spam sunder.
---
It's 80 now I thought.
---
You went to sleep with a half an hour before you had to leave?
---
I came to this understanding of what the lack of raid/dungeon finders the better experience, and that's because I need to rely on others for my own goals and me for theirs. I can't very solo SM GY, so I need some other to play with. But even more than that, I realized that I want to play with the same group more often for numerous reasons. 
---
Most of the party will compete for items, so it's better to befriend the same group and farm til everyone has what they want. Instead of always finding a fresh group with everyone always competing and being at the mercy of RNG. At least with a consistent group, you all will eventually EARN you loot, even if you're the last to get the item. When it's rng against new faces everytime, it feel more like luck and not rewarding.
---
But there even more demand for friends as well, because some task that you want to complete others will have no interest in and vise versa. Take the Warrior WW axe quest, most other classes could care less. But I for one will volunteer because I may require their help for something I'd like later. It's good to be in debt to the same players and have those players in dept to you. This is how communities are create and friendships are made, and it only gets better when everyone can look back and see how far they've come, together.
---
Source on them doing 16 debuff slots from the start? that should come at ZG patch.
---
Three of us have been spending most of our time in the Beta developing one and plan to have it ready on launch. It doesn't use any API calls that "must-have" addons (DBM, Recount, KTM, etc) use, so to disable us, Blizzard would have to disable them.
---
country roads
---
Thank you for the information! How is 7 days possible if you need a reset for the second BWL?
---
I haven't been jealous of these beta testers until I watched this.
---
There should obviously be dynamic respawn in starting areas
---
What? If 10,000 people try to enter a server and create a character the starting zone is going to be fucked. But with layering Blizz will slice that into 3 separate layers (worlds) that only have 1/3rd of the players in the starting zone. How does your claim make any sense
---
yikes i got absolutely crushed here ggs
---
Undead frost mage was my main for a long time. I rolled a human warrior cause friends went alliance. Aoe grinding in eastern plague lands was the biz.
---
Cities (some maybe all idk) have weird phasing issues on retail, this is likely a hold-over that they'll fix (enough people are bitching and have reported it).
---
Still hoping they put in more checks to stick people to layers, such as a 10-30 minute timer, only changing in main cities, and sticking to the same one 100% of the time unless joining a different layer player's party/raid.
---
Holy Paladins have no issue healing any content in the game.
---
Holy Paladins are the best healers in the game.
---
I found a huge bug, it goes as follows 99% of the population plays aliance... not sure if bug.. but reporting it anyway
---
Truestrike is pre bis as in pre raid. T2 is far better than that. You want your entire tier set.
---
guess that's what happens when your race evolved from trolls who discovered a magic mojo fountain
---
Vanilla raid bosses didn't have that.
---
Pro tip btw
---
I've won the fishing tournament 3 times on characters too low to even see STV mob levels and it was pretty hard.  12 Gurubashi chests isn't even in the same league.  It's impossibly hard to pull off and absolutely deserves to be the BIS item for every twink.
---
I always wanted that tiger, grats man.
---
They're the best healer for 5/10 mans.
---
Good post. I agree with every thing.. except if you hit 20 in less then 15 hours, you are amazing and must have twink items. =P
---
The LFG/LFR addon was satire.
---
Yea, seems like we we both wrong. I looked up classicdb and it has the pre-1.12 venomstrike with 16-30dmg + 3-6 nature dmg. It was later changed to 16-30 plus 31-45 nature proc.
---
Now we need someone to make a 19 twink on beta and check if the proc makes up for white damage loss
---
The quest chain will be released on a Tuesday. You can complete it the following Tuesday.
---
Have to deal with paladins
---
I don't think that will much of a problem. In the stress test, I saw one person complaining who was clearly trolling
---
Orc, Orc, Undead Male.
---
Ahh thanks.  I stopped playing before all of the server consolidation and combinations so this is all new to me.
---
it's only for the first hour, and grouping will still be the best way. 
---
It's just that there are so many people that grouping won't be enough, we need grouping+dynamic respawns
---
AV is rigged for Alliance to win. No pride in a victory that is literally given to you by map design imbalances. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbpgWkPbNc4 6:43
---
The UI improvements alone are inarguably better. It was so jarring to see no debuff timers when watching the beta streams. Totally forgot about that.
---
The one a few friends and I are developing is not.
---
Why would you go to sleep if you had to work 30 mins later?
---
Not your personal army.
---
/r/thathappened
---
Fingers crossed for Kara and Crypts content in 1-2 years.
---
(As long as they leave some servers on permanent Classic).
---
I think orc female looks good. If they nerfed stun resist most people would be UD not because of looks, but because they would be stronger.
---
Imagine going to blizzcon to play the beta and spending 3 hours on macros. Best of luck finding the answer you need though, no kappa.
---
Not sure about retail, but pre-cata, pretty much any race could fit into the crack. Never tried with a Tauren tho.
---
Orc Warlock is broken. Your biggest counters will be rogues and warriors, and resisting a stun or charge can flip the fight in your favor immensely. 
---
WoTF is not as strong imo because there's very few Alliance Warlocks.
---
Very happy to see the ironforge votes. I was afraid that with all the changes wow went through players would hang out in stormwind since that kind of became the alliance main hub instead of ironforge. Super happy to see the OG wow peeps voting for the TRUE alliance hub. See you guys on the bridge :)  left pillar is mine!
---
Lolol magic bow to Gmaul rip
---
I agree.
---
Wish the times were a bit later, converts to 6:30-8:30 am my time :| not so bad its my day off but damn
---
&gt; 19 twink rogue called Dirtybishop who got exalted with Shatari Skyguard to get an epic trinket from the vendor
---
how tf and what trinket was it
---
Not sorry - this guy has been posting snide comments in this subreddit for a year shitting on a game that (by all appearances) he has no interest in or intention to play. He does not participate in this community in good faith. His main concern is defending retail out of insecurity, as BFA subs sink like a bag full of hammers. 
---
Classic fans are accustomed to shit talking by retail players, but unlike the wall of no days we don’t have to take it lying down anymore. He can get walking back to the deviant art page that passes for the retail WoW subreddit these days.
---
Where lies this "Wombat of Slaying" of which you speak?!
---
The main developper of vanilla just said there was dynamic respawns in the starting areas, what more do you want ?
---
Also, if you’re like me, it’s easier and faster to read along with the text as it is written, instead of getting a block of text all in one go to parse.
---
That's Samwise Didier, one of WoW's (and Warcraft's) art directors.
---
true. But they also allow you to preorder stuff with down payments. I love that. Very convenient if you have shit Spectrum internet, or your laughably small switch SSD is already hard drive space capped. .
---
You guys will bitch about anything.
---
Why? Don't worry about what other people do/think. Just do you. If people wanna hate on something you enjoy, just ignore them.
---
2v1ing people
---
Feeling special when you have "just the right spell for the job"
---
Curse of tongues etc
---
Troll mages are rare compared to undead.  If you want to stand out from the crowd, roll Troll.
---
Yup. And sadly this will likely carry over to raiding.
---
Definitely worth considering then! As a healer berserking gets you some more mileage as well (and disc priests for PvP spamming mana burn faster is real good -- grab blackout and Shadowguard is going to be a lot better than Devouring Plague ever would be in that scenario too). 
---
Orc Shaman's a great option too, of course. (For PvP you'll probably end up as Elemental then though rather than a dedicated healer)
---
Warcraft II will give you that feel. WC1 as well though it's preeeetty dated. Warcraft III , while one of my favorite games of all time, plays out the "Enemies must unite to face a common threat" thing.
---
By "balanced correctly" what do you mean? I'm having a hard time finding hard numbers on this spell which is why I'm asking here. I can understand that there might be little support for the skill, but is  as bad as there being zero scaling?
---
I am talking about new skills with new content, and levels.
---
The aggro range is stupidly short in the beta. So really there's no need to dismiss your pet.
---
Thanks.  I hope I can still jumper cable in boss fights with FD.  When they removed that I was sad.
---
and the 40 man raid fan boys running around with them 24/7?
---
I don’t have a source but I can back it up they will have 16 debuff spots it was in some blue post
---
Did you reply to the wrong thread?
---
Straw man means I put up a "weak argument" or "weak example" that can easily be defeated to "prove" a point.
---
I'm not sure how your reply is relevant.. Kids get killed and are ok with it.  
---
Has nothing to do with the fact that lots of people are choosing to participate in a recreation of an event, and even though they know before hand exactly what every ability, every stat, and every loot item in the entire game is, They are still going to pick  races and classes based off of false information, and then complain to have the world changed to smooth over their mistake.
---
Just restrict the damn cross hopping between layers all together. Don’t allow it under any circumstance. You and your friend end up on different layers? Tough. You will be on the same server eventually.
---
I would rather put up with that than be okay with layer hopping for a couple of weeks and completely ruin the economy.
---
I’m interested what they do. I think there is validity in the whole “layers/sharding” ruins my experience. That said, I intend to group with my friends which will put us in the same layer—that’s all I care about. If I were flying solo I’d probably want more people around. But as it stands, I want my world to be about as full as the beta is. Give my buds and I maximum room to navigate. 
---
For me, I almost want a beta size 1-5 experience. Maybe 10-30 of us in there. Then as I get to goldshire layer me into 100 people. Then once I’m in SW or Westfall and beyond get me into the continental layer.
---
Ideally that multi tiered layer system would exist for the first couple days then enough people would be spread out that global layers could be the only layers.
---
lol you don't change your damage type just because a boss has extra resistance.
---
And that wasn't just stress test?
---
You need to write an entire tell-all novel.
---
Ideal situations have people at lvl 20 at about 9 to 10 hours played and that's not a launch type scenario at all.  Throw in the fact that 18 is on the lower side for deadmines (I would say 20 is better this allows for natural quest progression getting over to red ridge to ensure you have all the quest)  I would do dm on day 2 if planning for 12 hour sessions.
---
Oh no doubt that at lvl 30 threat generation is not the same as 60, hence why I said I would reserve judgement until then.  I was just saying at this point the only concrete evidence that has been displayed is that threat generation is an issue.
---
My Vanilla memory is hazy but it seems I recall the only real AoE threat generation were:
---
warriors demo shout, thunderclap (via stance dance) and cleave.  
---
Druids had swipe. 
---
Paladins (lol y u no holy) had consecrate. 
---
Am I forgetting any?
---
I took a screen cap for my guild forum avatar back in 05. It is such a scenic spot. Nice picture!
---
Yeah I know bu there was still a lot of people that couldn't afford the wand so I did a lot of trades for cloth instead. Good times it was.
---
Hahahahaha the excuses begin. Ur shaman boys are too weak for our paladin men.
---
This is inherently true. Although slightly increases spawn rates just enough to keep a legitimate incentive to group with others would also be possible.  Just got to find the right balance if that’s how they do it. I’m also assuming we’re operating under the idea of starting zones only. 
---
Personally I think even the stress test was manageable solo. I was able to get most quests done before my attention went to raid and faction bosses spawning.
---
Spoken like a true beaten whelp.
---
Most guilds will take 3-4 warlocks just for banish. Take any more and you're arbitrarily lowering your raids dps output.
---
Why don't you leave Classic and go back to Retail. I'm not going to argue about how Cata ruined my game. It did...end of story. My reasoning doesn't matter, It's mine to worry about.
---
16 debuff is confirmed.
---
Probably instant mail.
---
No changes brother!
---
With 40 people half the battle is getting people the shut up
---
You are one of those who want to see vanilla fail right? 
---
I just want to know the idea behind that.
---
I would assume so ..... you will probably have to have a US subscription to play on the US realms.
---
&gt; Loot Council is by far the EASIEST system to corrupt.
---
Don't play with a corrupt loot council then.
---
The only thing after playing the last couple days is that a proper Guild Tab would help out with guild/raid management. Not guild banks... just a guild tab!
---
Would like to know this too
---
This is such a stupid line when applied to newbie areas. I’ve never made a connection with a player grouping for the named scorpion kill in Valley of Trials or whatever. People just group, kill the mobs in silence, and disband. It’s brain dead easy so no communication is required, and no connection established, it’s like grouping in modern WoW. The meaningful social interaction is grouping for elite quests and dungeons where communication and CC is required, and good groupmates stand out.
---
GW1 is still running.  I still play it a lot with my kids.  It's chill, still looks great, and I don't think I'll ever complete all the content in it.
---
Since a layer is the size of a full Vanilla server, how is this "removing as many obstacles as possible"?
---
There are reasons to be against layering, but population density is not one of them.
---
Less buff refreshing as we are on 1.12
---
I miss most of the features they added in BC:
---
Guild banks
---
Class balance
---
Itemization/sets for all specs
---
I also like the new LFG tool (not LFR or Dungeon Finder) where you can easily search for a group doing a certain quest or dungeon without spamming trade chat.
---
Transmog is also nice, especially with the clown suit items. Luckily cloaks and tabards can hide a lot of ugly chests/legs and helms can be hidden.
---
Out of curiosity what’s the difference between looking confused and looking visibility confused :)
---
Call me optimistic but I don't currently have any beef with Blizzard.
---
Modern WoW's difficulty curve is exactly like it's gearing curve.
---
They just throw gear at you until you're ready to raid and then you hit a complete brick wall where the overwhelming majority of gear that drops a is trash.
---
Difficulty wise it's the same thing, most if the content is just litteraly nothing. Nothing is a challenge at all. Until you hit Mythic Raiding/High M+ keys then it's a nightmare at times.
---
Even with the 16 debuff slot, Mages are simply more valuable and wanted by guilds. Really the only reason guilds bring Warlocks is for Banish.
---
In my experience people never really change, only circumstances do. That said, I think there will be a lot of awesome people and quite a bit of not so nice people, just like there was back in the day. That being said people are still gonna bitch about 'all the toxicity'
---
Do the nameplates show regardless of LoS?
---
Did you even watch the clip? Mark developed the actual game, and he said there was dynamic spawns on launch back in the day.
---
Same, i'll take a few hours of madness over not feeling like my server is my server.  If something cool is going on like a raid on Orgrimmar , or i'm waiting for a rarespawn to pop, but some i can't see is killing it - that feels like a disconnected experience.  Give me a single server where all the same people play on it, and don't phase me in and out of other servers.
---
My dude, you went to bed for 30 minutes of rest? Not worth the risk. Bear through it and buy coffee/energy drink/tea/whatever that can make you stay awake. Gotta rough it out.
---
They do. Just like it was on live or is now whenever a server goes down, only one continent crashes at a time. That doesn’t mean multiple continents can’t fail at once, but they each go down on their own. 
---
On beta you will see like 20 guild members go offline at once, you’d see the same on live, EK or Kalimdor going down. 
---
Presumably EK layer 1 links to K layer 1, so they feel like one servers the user.
---
Layering is implemented so server populations don't die off after a month after the tourists leave. Instead of releasing a bunch of servers and having some inevitably become low population / dead, Blizzard is releasing a few servers, but allowing multiple instances of that *entire* server to be run.
---
For example, lets say our server name is Hogger, and the max amount of players allowed to log in at once is 3,000. At launch, lets say 21,000 people create characters on Hogger and try to log in. 3,000 people will get in, and 17,000 people will be sitting in queue.
---
With layering, the first 3,000 people will go into Hogger1, the next 3,000 will go into Hogger 2, etc. until all people trying to log in are in the game. In our example, there will be 7 layers of the Hogger server so all 20,000 people can log in and play.
---
Afterwards, lets say 16,000 people are tourists and quit after 1 month, and you only have 5,000 players left. Blizzard now disables layering, and you have a healthy, stable server population all in one realm, Hogger.
---
The alternative is, releasing a bunch of servers so everyone can play. Lets say they make Hogger, Ragnaros, Nefarion, Sarkoth, Thrall, Jaina, and Ratchet all servers. At launch, the 21,000 people spread across all 7 servers and there is no layering or sharding. This is all good for the first month, but following our example above, 16,000 people leave after this first month. This leaves the remaining 5,000 people spread across 7 servers, or an average population of 715 per server. This is basically a dead server population.
---
The other alternative is to release a few servers with no layer, and making you sit in queues of 20,000+ people which will take hours to log in, basically making the game unplayable at launch for a large portion of the player base.
---
Better yet, though not often thought of:
---
Instead of doing a 180, simply walk through the mob, you end up with him casting in your back without having to flip your view. Then backpedal back in front of him, ez clap
---
Unless you’re a streamer.
---
Play what you want to play. I was so set on min/max picking the "best" race but tbh theres gonna be WAY more factors that come into play. Are you max level? Are you under geared? Are they even a warlock/priest/warrior? Are they even good? If you think about how many encounters WOTF will be a game breaker is pretty slim. Don't get me wrong tho when its time for WOTF its amazing but I wouldn't pick it over character aesthetics.
---
He's one of the original developers and is almost certain a dynamic respawn that was absolutely definitely in vanilla isn't working right.
---
I mean I agree, group up, it might nerf your XP and you might have to grind a few extra boars to make up for it but at lest you get the quest rewards in a timely manner.
---
But all the same, this may be a legitimate bug caused by the new client not knowing how or even if it should spawn extra creatures. It used to work that if a certain amount of any given creature in one of the starting 1-6 zones were dead more would automatically and immediately spawn. It's not quite the same as modern dynamic spawns I don't think, but think of it as an early prototype that might be legitimately bugged.
---
So what makes boss fights different than fighting a normal mob? Will FD vs any random mob (that still has aggro on another player) answer your question?
---
This many.
---
hes a legend. i used to listen to his videos in business school for the soundtrack alone. 
---
That was... 15 years ago. :'D
---
I have no problem Interface changes, there will probably be a mod for that anyway.
---
just the game mechanics ones.
---
I wonder which one he played on
---
2 years ago
---
Drinking is less dps than using pots, so that's likely the reason.
---
Just saving this whole thread for all the console commands.
---
3k is the goal for the whole SERVER 
---
With sharding there would be hundreds if not thousands of shards to handle initial server load
---
With layering, they said you’d have like 3-5 layers all together
---
From everything theyve said layering doesn’t appear to help start area congestion which is why lots of us are totally fucking confused because the point of it was supposed to be that
---
Now if they change that and say you can have hundreds of layers, welp there goes server economy
---
You've got some weak-ass eyes. Should get them checked out.

^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)
---
From the article you linked. Holy crap! 
---
"18 hours is not the length of the fight, it is the length of our attempt. There is no doubt in my or anyone else's mind that to beat it, you would need another 2-5 hours. Making this closer to a 20-24 hour fight."
---
People also seem to forget that quest design has played a big factor in removal of community, arguably as much as LFG and LFR.
---
In Vanilla, you had basic mobs being scary at times. You could easily overpull on accident (or get spawned on) and get destroyed. Mobs took longer to kill then, and spawns were shared/fought over.
---
As the game has developed through the expansions, individual quests take less time/effort to complete. Outside of a few handful of quests, they can all be easily solo’d. Even the group quests (like Ring of Blood) can be solo’d by some specs with ease.
---
So now any time you group, it’s for 1 or 2 quests (usually just for an elite kill) and you’re done. Just passersby. In Vanilla, the general length/difficulty/competition of quests lead to just continuing on together and sharing in the struggle or easing the boredom. They were no longer passersby, they were co-adventurers.

Ever heard of Morrowgrain? Easy darn exalted if it still exist

LOLOL.
---
They already stated that you wouldnt be able to layer hop.
---
You people just need to STOP. You saw people trying to abuse it during a test run. Literally the first test run.
---
I think so, yes.
---
Vanilla didnt have as many players all starting day 1, also vanilla didnt have as many players, communities, guilds, discords, streamers, friends all trying to play together.  Something needs to be done, they chose layering. It may not be perfect, there may be a lot of problems(hopefully they fix them before it releases) but its a temporary solution, if you dont like it wait until they remove it.
---
If there are only two level 60s on the whole entire server (and layer), the odds that you will be in the same place at the same time are already low. Even if you are in the same layer and in the same zone, the odds that you run into each other aren't 100%.  And as more and more people reach level 60, you will run into more and more 60s.  And as people leave Classic, the layers will collapse and the community will coalesce (even if, against what blizz has already said, layers persist past phase 1)
---
And what is your solution to when the population drops by 90% a month in?
---
Im think utility wise. Either you get your group to the right continent or you summon the 2 stragglers to the dungeon.
---
You underestimate the no lifting of this
---
People hit 60 in under 5 days on pservers. Pservers didn’t have exact numbers so they erred on the side of more damage too
---
Plus, the hype here is massive
---
People are going to smash those previous nolife records
---
Fuck I’m just an average nolifer, not even the most conservative, and I can hit 60 in 6 days played. Average idiots like me will have access to unlimited nodes for weeks on end
---
I used to be on MMO-Champ all the time. Then the MLP threads started popping up. Bronies are something else.
---
YES, YEEEES.
---
Give me more of these! Amazing!
---
An addon people have to actively seek out for pugs. Idk why people would care if you did that tbh. 
---
3-4 months after release it will be useless if you actually have a solid core guild/friend group to play with. Good luck, interested to see How it fairs if you finish it.
---
I raided in Vanilla and I’m not an elitist or a prick. That’s on you, you don’t seem fun to hang/chat with.
---
I'm not sure where you've heard a month, but the popular answer and blizzard notice I saw was 2 weeks. Hope this eases your worry. As much as people hate it, no one wants to fight 40+ people for a small spawn point for quest mobs you can't share the drop.
---
Any tips on getting your framerate so smooth? Granted I haven't played on this client, only pservers.
---
[Meanwhile in Stormwind.](https://i.imgur.com/Kw030rX.jpg)

I very much know what Im talking about.

You are the one who is clueless.

Did you see how blizzard's servers struggled even with layering? It would be impossible to hold 10k people, each small zone with a thousand.  
---
Absolutely clueless.
---
If PvP go engi IMO
---
Burn the witch!
---
Lets talk about it in of the many other threads...
---
I get the intent of the macro...but how is that a one shot?
---
Makes sense.  But giving it to the healer would be my first choice because that was an endurance fight.
---
Can't believe I didn't see this before. Was a DnT raid member during vanilla/tbc. Blacken represent.
---
Doesn't sound liek they would have to tweak too much to fix that to be honest. If he winds up and you drop down to far he could just leash to the next highest threat or something to that effect - just change targets. Or not have a specific target if he is just spinning.   
---
going off your description - never fought him myself
---
Xrealm bgs made me quit bgs altogether. It was less fun when I didn’t recognize the people I was fighting against.
---
I love these posts. Thank yous can go a long way. I hope some of the community managers see these from time to time. Video game development feels like it's becoming such a thankless industry due to review tanking and trolls.
---
That's a terrible idea, for a slew of reasons.
---
This is to deal with initial launch tourists who will leave. Congratulations, now you have a bunch of dead servers after launch. How do you fix dead servers, since it's a nighmare to merge them? Sharding. Good job, now it's in the whole game instead of just phase 1.
---
Blizz doesn't just assign high pop and low pop; they have no control over where people end up going. So what are you saying, it's enforced by pop caps? Great, have fun with 6 hr que times.
---
Layering is a great middle ground honestly, I can't come up with a better solution. There's improvements that could be made, but solutions like dynamic spawns and more servers will just cause more problems than they solve.
---
Miss!
---
Re-evaluate your priorities.
---
Cept it will be shut down. Also the api for chat search across realms is disabled. You would know, that is part of what makes a lrg addon work. They don't in 8.1 and they won't here. You knew that though being a "addon" dev thought, right?
---
Oh yeah they're god awful. Appointment in the works! ❤
---
So if you can be the "sanctuary holy pally" for your raid, you can EASILY do some sick AOE farming in the world.
---
yea and i played since vanilla, thats potentially 6 years earlier my guy
---
People who played Warlock during Vanilla and TBC.. what were some of the pro’s of playing Lock?
---
The original purpose of my thread was to ask if bosses sent out agro pulses in Classic beta.  Since they didn't do that in Vanilla.
---
I definitely agree with you on raiding. Even as the rest of the game has started to deteriorate since WoD, raiding has been the one shining beacon of the game that has continued to improve over time.
---
I personally hate BFA with a passion. I hate that they've continued to push systems introduced in WoD and Legion. I hate that class design will probably never again reach the peak we had in MoP. I hate that Blizzard seems to be choosing to pretend they know what's best, even when it's falling apart. However I'm still subbed and log in a few times a week to push mythic with my raid because it's challenging content that I enjoy. We just downed Mythic Blockade this week and have started progress on Mythic Jaina, and I couldn't be happier. Just sucks that the rest of the game is burning down around us.
---
you and one million other people
---
jk bro keep the hype going
---
It is.
---
Lmao, I bet the boats are made for humans like everything else in the game.
---
Agreed. I hated the weirdness that was being choosen to hold onto this iconic thing. Specifically with the Wound in Silithus, when you are standing next to Rekthar holding onto Doomhammer, and Eitrig holding onto the Scale of the Earthwarder.   Those homies, ARE the best shaman and warriors.. who the hell is Darkblessing, other then a new alt of my 12+ 110s

I've found heroic raiding challenging but fair.  Good to do with groups of friends even if they all aren't all stars.
---
When did the meta switch to human?
---
I equate words like failure with regard to MMO's as the private server Community does the word dead. It lacks meaning unless you specifically Define numbers for it. How many people does a server have to shrink to for it to be considered dead? What's the arbitrary number of subscriptions an MMO has to drop to for it to be considered a failure? Or is it a question of profitability? Or is it nothing more than an individual players feeling?
---
Curious question for you guys - How do you feel about WoW classic needing a sub considering the classic game was carried until today through private servers and labors of love mostly?   
---
I want to play the classic game but a full sub for a game this old (at the end of the day) seems kinda odd choice from bliz. Unless I missed something?
---
Well played
---
Don't forget that during bwl launch for up to maybe a month, the servers would take a huge shit during prime raid times. You would maybe be able to get 2-3 lagless attempts a night on a fight that can wipe anywhere from 10sec to 2 min. Having to deal with that also attributed to a massive delay in vael kills especially with all the tank swapping people not moving when they get the debuff that grants 100% dmg but kills you after 15 sec (can't remember exact numbers). 
---
Not saying vael and to a lesser extent razor won't kill guilds but I don't think it will be as prevelant as in vanilla.
---
As a player who's raided all content in vanilla, I would highly advise AGAINST HotW spec. It's just so watered down that you'll really be struggling at fulfilling either role you're trying to fill for (without over gearing the content).  Instead I would recommend going 8/ 11 / 32 as feral charge can be great in Dungeons, PVP and Raiding. Swiftmend is so powerful I personally wouldn't leave home without it. Also don't underestimate how challenging threat management is in classic, and HOTW druid does far less threat than standard full feral. 
---
Just my 2 cents, if anything, try all the specs and choose which one you prefer, you know until you experience. it.
---
You just made me chuckle, thank you
---
I didn't lose quest items or xp, my abilities stayed in their locations but I lost my keybinds and interface option customisation.

---
haha yes very cool 😎
---
&gt; I've never "subbed" before, but I get my next paycheck next Friday and I'll grab a twitch sub, you're awesome dude. 
---
If you have amazon prime, you get 1 free sub a month to give out to any streamer you'd like.
---
The blog says the system was "invented" for TBC, and that anonymous comment where they say they don't "think" that it was any different from what Blizzard was already doing in starting zones is simply hearsay. There's no evidence to support it. If dynamic respawns was a thing in Vanilla, that code would've been ported over instead of actively removed from the 7.3.5/8.0.1 backported version of Classic where it did exist.
---
Just like the damage values that were proven to be accurate, Blizzard has a reference version of the game (server and client) with the original code and data. They can compare to see if the spawns should be dynamic or not. If it was meant to be dynamic, it's safe to say that it already would be.
---
It's just one of those \#NoChanges things. I personally don't have a horse in the race either way, I wouldn't mind if they did make it dynamic in the starting areas. The purists will riot about anything so.. it's unlikely to happen.
---

"but its still just poor play to run after your opponent with sprint on when u are crippled."
---
People say this but he juked him, thats why he got his intercept off, thats why the rogue says something like "how did he get that off" 
---
"he did have recently bandaged from the start on closer inspection so thats fair that he couldnt bandage earlier"
---
He actually bandaged a second time but accidently moved and canceled it, its one of his biggest mistake and no one seems to mention that.
---
Also to the warriors credit he is specced for Concusive Blow wich is the 21 point talent in protection, it stuns for 5 second and people have no trinkets, but the rogue dodged it, so that was kinda bad for him too.
---
I never did find my Wombat of Slaying in all my playtime during vanilla.
---
Ah, well on retail they use a similar system called sharding. The main difference is sharding encompasses multiple servers and they use it to both alleviate congestion, and to make older zones more populated. Layering however will only be players on your specific server, since cross-realm stuff is gone in classic.
---
once humans got their stun breaking racial. In vanilla they do not have this. they only have perception (stealth detection).
---
Gnomes still have the same racial to this day. It's second best back in vanilla. second only to WotF for undead.
---
I feel like people have forgotten the fun of leveling and truly exploring in wow. There is this meta feeling of rushing through the levels so you can hurry up and get to end game and then be bored. 
---
It doesn't help that blizzard has included multiple ways of leveling faster to almost pressure players.
---
You definitely can't go wrong with playing the Warcraft games before Classic drops. You'll enjoy exploring the world all the more after experiencing the lore the way the RTS games set it up. Warcraft 3 in particular has a great story that sets up the way many of the borders on this map were shaped, and introduces many of the most iconic characters in WoW (Illidan, Arthas, Jaina, Medivh, Malfurion, Thrall, Sylvanas, etc), on top of being an all around fantastic game to play.
---
XD
---
I mean version control wasn't a strong suit for *a lot* of game manufacturers even into the 2000s. Squaresoft was notoriously bad at this. It's why re-releases of ps1 FF games still use the old low-res pre-rendered backgrounds instead of higher res re-renders or retextures. The 3d backgrounds used to create them are gone. They didn't back them up anywhere.
---
Blizz mentioned that version control wasn't very good internally through vanilla WoW, either.
---
I'm not convinced it was as big a feat to recreate vanilla WoW as they made it out to be, but it's possible that they really didn't know where the backup was kept and had to do some spelunking to find it. I also personally believe they knew exactly how much work it would be to update the 1.12.1 client or port the data over to the modern client and simply couldn't justify the cost of doing so. Keep in mind the security updates over the years would have to stay, along with updated hardware compatibility and performance, so using the original 1.12 client and server was completely out of the question for a Blizzard-quality product.
---
Shadowpriests will be prevalent from the start though which will add a lot of damage. Also with the upgraded gear and especially PvP gear they can probably do more dps than most think.
---
Even so, the average player in Classic is going to be a lot better than the average player in Vanilla. Making up statistics here, but if the average Vanilla Deadmines group wiped 2 times, the average Classic Deadmines group might wipe, say, 0.5 times. The feeling of accomplishment in Vanilla definitely stems from more than just wiping/experiencing failure, but I really think Vanilla was the sweet spot in that aspect, and I think Classic should incorporate lessons learned from the private server scene.
---
I posted this exact same text almost 2 years ago and got only 470 upvotes lol.
---
This is great lol.
---
Yes, that's another big part of vanilla's fun: You feel very weak as a player. This just makes every accomplishment feel that much better.

He's misremembering. The system didn't exist until TBC. If it existed in Vanilla we'd have it already in Classic. They have the original game unmodified running internally to compare Classic to so it's accurate as possible. If there's no dynamic respawns in the reference client, then there's no dynamic respawns in Classic. The code for dynamic respawns wouldn't have been removed from the 7.3.5/8.0.1 version if it was meant to exist.

Technically technically, it was put into the game in Warlords.

For some people it washes out the colors/contrast by being so bright. It seems for some to make the monitor too bright, but I have the opposite problem.

My monitor is pretty old and I always have to turn brightness/contrast all the way up to see anything. In deadmines I turned both my monitor and my in game brightness/contrast/gamma all the way up and still couldn’t quite see in darker areas. (It doesn’t help that my monitor is in front of a sw facing window)
---
Also, when I turned off the glow in teldrassil it was like it was noon and then suddenly midnight. 
---
These are probably problems due to my set up, but it’s one reason that it’s nice to have the option for glow or no glow 🤷‍♀️
---
&gt; Lesson #11: If everyone likes your game, but no one loves it, it will fail.
---
I would like to point to a game like Stardew Valley to counter this, even though I agree with the application and reasoning towards wow, just not games in general. Stardew is generally a game realy like by many (kinda holds through for the genre), it is also not one of those games that people tend to have extreme feelings about one way or the other. 
---
&gt; Lesson #7: Allow the players the ability to make the game personal. I think this part is expressed strongly through our class identity. Each class is unique and brings their own flavours to every situation. Every class has a specific toolkit, and it makes it so personal. I love the fact that if I'm a shaman, I'm the class that's going to be able to reincarnate; I'm the class that's gonna frostshock a warrior around until he ragequits the game; I'm the class thats the master of the elements, shooting my lightning everywhere! This applies to so many classes, and the talent trees implemented in Vanilla allow us to go even further into making it personal. 
---
I would also like to agree again with the aplication and reasoning towards wow, but find this lesson to not work for other games as well, like Civ6 or Eu4. I think one could make the case that these games are personal in that you are the driving force behind your creation, but I don't think this fits the spirit of the lesson truely. In Eu4 you get a new king, you look at his stats once and ignore him and continue to startegize, in Civ you don't even get new rulers. Binding of Issac, Enter the Gungeon, Slay the Spire and other cult roguelikes don't tend to have highly personal play, but remain largly popular to this day. Fortnite, PUBG, and other battle royals don't tend to have a high level of personalized play either, change a skin and thats about it.
---
TL;DR While I think these lessons work well for some games, especially WoW Classic, I do not think they represent gaming as a whole. The miriade of genres we have make a standardized list of lessions very difficult to make imo, and must be very generalized to encapsulate the multiple differences.
---
Basically you never use thunderclap AFAIK, as a warrior you should demo shout on pull, then tab between each mob and sunder, but spam battle shout as much as possible between sunders since it does AOE threat (this was known in vanilla and was used to do stuff like tanking twin emps with two warriors).
---
What really helps with AOE threat is items like engineering bombs, sappers, and oil of immolation that do AOE damage, and items/effects that do damage when you are hit, such as thorns, crystal ward, retribution aura, and shield spikes.
---
My original post was coming from the perspective that if you have a full prot-specced warrior with a shield tanking a raid boss, its quite likely that any good DPS will have to hold back at some point since that spec just doesn't do enough threat, which will make the fight longer. Hence the meta of fury/prot spec and dual-wielding tanks. Druids are also good for that since they do more threat naturally and can farm an item (Manual Crowd Pummeler) to give them a massive threat boost for a 90 second period.
---
Does not use the original launcher either. 
---
Makes the game more digestible for people who play retail and vanilla. If you want to degrade the quality of the interface I'm sure some lad will make that possible with an add-on.
---
I dont think layering has anything to do with population control... just imagine, if there are many layers on a single server but each layer is overgrowded (just like on stress test) then what for is layering?
---
It is to reduce queue times.... no other reason. You see when alot of people try to login and theres only ONE server aka one layer to play on, they have to go into queue... but if there are multiple layers on the same server then the queue wont exist, instead everyone gets to play... just not on the same layer.
---
It has nothing to do with zone population imo but rather everything to do with login queues.
---
Layering effectively doubles, triples, quadriples the amount of players that can play on ONE server at the sametime.
---
because this isn't a raid, it's a group of level 30s running a dungeon tuned for 37.  Feign death would be resisted by the skull-level boss, just like 90% of all abilities the group used in the whole dungeon.
---
The priest was soulstoned so he could afford to die during the fight, but if he went down the tank would die and the tank's armor would break.  The only way to win the fight was to have the hunter survive, because he could technically solo the boss.  FD/Jumper only works if you can afford to have the other 4 die, which would have ended the run in this case.
---
I’d rather see changes made to live. Make Live more like Classic. No more CRZ, bring layering to live. Merge dead servers.
---
 Make gear matter again from patch to patch. Give reasons to be in guilds again. Make the open world more of a challenge. Bring back more RPG elements and class identity.
---
"snutz is nutz" haha :D
---
Mark Kern happened to be the dude who took the Classic petition to Mike Morhaime in person. A former developer for Vanilla WoW. If you have followed Classic at all for the last few years you'd know pretty damn well who Mark Kern is. One of the few notable individuals directly responsible for pushing for Classic to be a thing in the first place.
---
At that point you can allow free server transfers, just like they did.
---
I don't want to see Classic fail. But I also don't want to have to sit in a city looking for a group. This way, we'll be able to be out questing (or even on alts) while we look for a group.
---
Goodjob you pass
---
news to me
---
It was changed the same time they did the adjustment to Max Level peeps getting bonus gold. in 1.4 and prior, if you did a quest EXP capped, you got the same coin an a leveling dude.
---
They have literally never done that to fix dead realms, it's one of the major cry points of retail.
---
Still is, but used to be too. :D
---
They didnt? Im pretty sure it was just as successful as a launch back then, when it was the only game of its kind, versus now. Something that can be done is allowing more servers. Just like they originally did.
---
In one of the recent classicast podcast those guys have they were wondering why skeletons and copses were removed, this was the reason :D
---
^ This
---
Oh wow I'm so sorry to have inconvenienced you and wasted your time with my opinion on reddit.
---
Yeah this was a thing in vanilla.
---
IMO, the trash that follows Vael is the real gut check. BWL had pretty relentless trash pulls that made it a real grind. You can't really just turn your mind off and shoot the shit while playing on auto-pilot ever in that raid. Suppression room required coordination, CC on packs and getting the pulls right after Broodlord. No one part of it is particularly difficult, but there's just a constant feeling of being engaged the whole time that wears on you.
---
Especially during a content drought. Several months after clearing BWL the first time and you're still clearing MC (gotta get those bindings and the one or two rare drops off Rag!), Ony 2x, BWL, and ZG 1-2x a week.
---
there  will be layering only in the starting weeks. keep that in mind
---
It's a melee range ability, you don't get hit by it by out-ranging it.
---
He's misremembering. The system didn't exist until TBC. If it existed in Vanilla we'd have it already in Classic. They have the original game unmodified running internally to compare Classic to so it's accurate as possible, along with all of the original source code. If there's no dynamic respawns in the reference client, then there's no dynamic respawns in Classic. The code for dynamic respawns wouldn't have been removed from the 7.3.5/8.0.1 version if it was meant to exist.
---
Bruh...I listen to the vanilla wow game music while I'm not playing the game. Why wouldn't I also listen to it while playing?
---
unless you play orc
---
in retail if you can't do a quest, come back in 10-15 ilvl.
---
I'm your mother, so just do what I say because I'm always right. even when you are an independent adult living on your own. also everything you like is bad, and everything I like is good.
---
I love the atmosphere around Classic. The whole community coming together to have fun with actual human interaction. Thank you Blizzard and the whole community for making this a reality.
---
RemindMe! 100 Days "Weather"
---
Was stated during the blizzcon panel
---
The summoning quests comes out with Dire Maul, which I think is phase 2? 
---
There are many theories on how enslave demon works. The spell has a duration of 5 minutes but I think only Blizzard knows for sure how long it will really last. Things like level difference, resistances and spell hit are theorised to play a role.
---
They fixed it originally. The same thing happened back in true vanilla. They offered free one time server transfers to and from dying/overpopulated servers.
---
I know blizzard doesnt assign pop caps. When you choose a server, you can see the population. You know that high pops are associated with wait times and fighting for mobs. And you know low pops have neither but have less people. The choice is for people to make.
---
No time is wasted cause your paying for it ;)
---
Pro - 
---
1. Orc has 25% resist to stun 
---
2. Cooler mounts (imo)
---
3. Zug Zug
---
Cons-
---
1. No Pally buffs 
---
Thats all I got..havent played Alliance in along time and havent spent alot of time on horde either.
---
This comic just punches me in the gut for some reason. She looks so fucking sad that it makes me genuinely sad just to look at it.
---
one of, if not, the best dueling/1v1 class plus big raid dps
---
They don't have access to level 70 weapons to do level 60 raids.
---
&gt; Unless I missed something?
---
You missed that Blizzard is a company and not a charity.
---
&gt;which just defies belief.
---
Version control was a weak spot for some game companies even into the 2000s. I gave an example in another comment--Squaresoft. Squaresoft was notoriously and hilarously bad at this. It's why ps1 re-releases like their FF games still use the low-res pre-rendered backgrounds instead of re-texturing and re-rendering them--the 3d sources are gone. They never saved them. Hindsight is a cruel mistress and I think somewhere after FFX they got better at it. The HD remaster of that one still needed chunks of the game including some character models remade from scratch because they didn't save all of it.
---
These days it seems inconceivable but in the early to mid 2000s some companies were still slow to catch on. Blizzard and Squaresoft were two of them.
---
Snutz is crazy good, being a warlock doesn't hurt either.
---
I’ve noticed a few places where the game rolls in an obscene amount of colored fog instead of a regional darkening or atmospheric effect.  Biggest offenders were that cultist hill in N barrens (was like swimming in blood fog, couldn’t see shit) and near morbent fel’s house in duskwood (dark blue/purple fog, can’t see mob names 10 yards ahead) - but I went to this again this morning for the first time since the pre-stress test hotfix and it does not give that weird opaque fog now. It seems they are still tuning things (go figure) so who knows how it’ll end up.
---
This hope died for me when they anounced wow :'(
---
Tailoring and Enchanting have great synergy, but keep in mind that enchanting is the most expensive profession to level.  All the greens that you normally sell you have to DE.  These greens are one of (if not THE) main source of your gold leveling up.  Mentioning this because this is a "hidden" cost of enchanting that people forget sometimes.
---
Having said that, as a warlock you get a free mount at 40.
---
1 to 3 then hearth to razor hill and start smashing mobs was what I tried.
---
The undead zone starts with a quest where you have to kill the mindless zombies, so everyone is just in that small area. You then face another bottleneck for the rattle cages and then another to kill Sam then yet another for the scarlet crusade guy. Bottleneck after bottleneck. I’d probably go and grind spiders if I were undead.
---
Durotar has a similar quest where you have to kill boars, but there are more areas you can farm this, it’s more spread out, and you can pick up some other quests such as killing Sarkoth, so you don’t face the same bottleneck.
---
None of this applies to WoW, at all. You have to understand you are talking a out one of the biggest games of all time, already loved by millions. Next

Was watching his stream when it happened.
---
Alliance since they will need the numbers. I expect horde to dominate population on PvP servers 60/40. 
---
Hope I'm wrong though.
---
No, I don't think you are a paid shills, but when someone starts asking questions and saying hey guys, I think this layering thing might not be a great idea because it's full of unintended consequences (just like the rest of wow's improvements), there are hundreds of people that come out of the woodwork saying, it's just beta, and they'll surely fix it, when blizz has an awful track record of really fixing anything that's not a bug in the code when it comes to their beta. And the main argument in support of blizzard and layering is this is beta, they'll fix it. No one seems to think it's a great idea, they just don't have any alternatives, which is a little worrying. I don't think classic is dead due to layering, I just think it will be easily exploited making it not as fun as it should be.
---
We all know who fucking Mark Kern is.
---
No it's not
---
Yeah but it's still just enough time to get some friends, go far off the shore of Tanaris somewhere, swim underwater, and warlock summon your buddy.
---
Im not a native english speaker so I think ill survive.
---
\&gt;I feel like Blizzard will have to address this issue before classic release, or the exploiting will ruin the economy just for starters.
---
I think Blizzard still feels economy does not matter until 1 month into release when people start hitting 60, and at that point they are assuming 9000 players will dwindle into 3000 players. At that point, layers no longer exist.
---
I personally feel that there's going to be the giant servers with 6000 players and then they're going to be scratching their heads.
---
Touche.
---
Good in small fights, gets completely nullified in proper pvp by dispells. Literally a useless class if the enemy has magic dispel.
---
Wait, you think the amount of players playing day 1, minute 1 are going the be the same?
---
I guess the title I chose to go with implies that WoW retail is dead, which wasn't what I was trying to say, I was expressing that the reason why WoW classic didn't fail is because people loved it. I don't think retail is a failure at all, it is loved by certain people the same way classic is.  
---
But I would define a game as a failure to any game thats become let go by its user base, which in terms affects the profitability and the longevity of the game. I would say that they're all combined, since a game that isn't liked, won't be played, and thus won't be profitable. If its not profitable, it won't be kept up and there won't be any subscribers anymore. MMO's are a grey area, since they can vastly differ in player population, so it can be still successful even if it has 1% of the playerbase WoW has.
---
You didn't say anything new. Majority of people assumed to be these tourists and they assumed to stop playing the game around lvl 30-40.
---
&gt; When was the last time you made a friend from, if ever, in lfg or lfr?
---
If you're blaming LFR for not making friends, then you're just trying to find an excuse. It's 100% possible to find a guild and make new friends in retail, you just need to move your ass.
---
Sorry but it's irritating to see all the complains about how the game killed communities and friends while it's still absolutely within reach with a little effort.
---
Considering Mark Kern, one of the guys who made the damn game in the first place, says that there should be dynamic spawning, the comment has some credibility.
---
&gt;They can compare to see if the spawns should be dynamic or not. If it was meant to be dynamic, it's safe to say that it already would be.
---
By this logic all the bugs in the beta currently are actually working as intended. Dynamic spawning is easy to miss in internal testing because you won't have the kind of player numbers where it becomes evident.
---
Excellent, thanks for the info.  Its been so long since I played that all this stuff is purely from my memory from over a decade ago and I have no doubt that some of it is incorrect/not the whole story.
---
Backpedal
---
&gt;I was under the understanding that you were stuck in your Layer once you created your character.
---
That would be extremely dumb. If I roll on the same server as my friends, but I got put in another layer for the next three months I would probably stop playing.
---
Most of the hunter DPS was auto shots. That  doesn't cost mana.  Heals do.
---
One Punch Man is a whole parody of a hero who is to strong for everything and is basically just searching for something meaningful to accomplish.
---
It is not fun being an omnipotent superhero, it is fun achieving things by getting over obstacles.
---
Just remember that enchanting is very costly as you cannont sell your greens.  Besides selling wands there is very little profit in enchanting until you reach 60.  As a tailor I can vendor back the 20 robes I just made.  As an enchanter I end up re-enchanting my own bracer 20 times for skill ups.
---
I told myself that I wasn't that jealous about not beta testing and that it's better to wait anyways but... NOW I'm fucking jealous!
---
Dude streaming classic WoW is going to be a death sentence in the open world. Streamers in OW get their games thrown so regularly it's going to be funny watching people like Asmongold getting wrecked everywhere they go. Even if they are are good PVPers I promise you guilds will just camp their bodies.
---
Am in beta, they’re still tuning many things including lighting and atmospheric effects. (See my comment about the red/blue fog that seems to have been fixed within the last 2 days).
---
People need not feel betrayed that it doesn’t look how they like or how they remember. (I know you didn’t assert this, but the other guy did)
---
*should* 
---
I don't think anyone can guarantee blizzard will fix something by release.
---
I say this not to be elitist but simply to set the record straight that there are simply more efficient and more sensible specs for raiding. Will a ret / feral / shadow priest / enh. shaman ever come close (within 35%) of the damage of a rogue / warrior / mage ? No, they shouldn't. What's worse is that as content progresses, these 'optimal' classes have overwhelming power spikes that will put these snowflake specs into the absolute dumpster. 
---
Its the reality of classic. If you ask yourself the question "What spec is the most optimal for 'x'?" simply refer to the Tier 3 sets for each class as a default. The only real exception is warriors who have the best gear pool of non-tier set items in the game.
---
So it’s less of a lack of a suspension of disbelief and more of a “I want stuff that feels rewarding to get” which they still do with stuff like the Green Fire quest and Challenge Apperances in Legion (they need to keep doing that kind of thing though. Afaik BfA lacks something comparable) while, iirc, Mythic Raiding is challenging and at least still has unique colors for the gear that drops there and maybe one or two other rare drops exclusive to it.  
---
Because let’s face it, after doing all the stuff your character does, in non-dungeon/raid quests alone from 1 - 90, why is it a shock when they start getting fame and glory when WoD starts?
---
My Tauren had TB and I didn't pick it up.
---
im going to lvl with tailor and skinning. 1. tailor is kinda a must for locks 2. skinning give you that extra cash and is ued in alot of tailoring recipes which makes you good money. 
---
But also alot of ppl will drop skinning once they get to lvl 60. So when you do MC you need the corehound leathers for the soulshard bags. I kinda want to have skinning in case noone has it.
---
I will drop skinning once i feel like its time for mining, then drop that and lvl up engineer after.
---
I disagree - based on my time in retail I think the average player will be overall similar in ability to players in 2004. I think control/keybinding improvements will be offset by failure to accept/adapt to vanilla mechanics. Threat dynamics and mandatory crowd control, for instance, will have to be entirely relearned by the masses. The first 10 minute corpse run where you can’t Aliyah vote kick your tank or abandon the group and reque is going to be a shock for sure.
---
Servers cost money to maintain and keep online, to say they can just release more servers to then have servers die only to offer a paid service off those servers seems like a massive waste of money and time compared to thier solution of layering the start of the game.
---
read again, 20 mins and you can join another party in a different layer
---
Plenty of F2P games out there --- esp in the MMORPG space so thats an awful response.
---
Actually no, the addon works for people using it, even if the people they want to group with are not.
---
If you type "LFG XXX" in a channel with someone that has the addon, or any number of the other popular ways to abbreviate your message and instance, it puts you in the addon's queue. Anyone in the realm, no matter the zone, can see that queue.
---
There are extra features when everyone's using the addon, but our goal is to make it useful even if you're the only one on the realm using it.
---
How did he bubble?
---
How many times has blizzard had a dumb as shit idea  in beta that everyone pointed out and they didn't fix it? That seems pretty par for the course, and the only way to get them to fix it is if you make a big scene about it.
---
Damn those lucky bastards! That's gonna be a blast
---
Sorry for the negativity but wtf :
---
\- 50 min bag video ==&gt; just buy or craft them, be happy if they drop they're not farmable
---
\- 55 min shaman tanking video ==&gt; just don't, you're going to waste everybody's time
---
Do you intend to specialize your YT channel in useless classic knowledge ?
---
There are so many subjects for videos : levelling, attunements, dungeons, PVP, gold making etc
---
Free idea : how to gear your elemental shaman in phase 1 for PVP where +spell mail is very rare (3 pieces outside MC iirc).
---
That's interesting and useful and I'm pretty sure nobody covered the subject.
---
/rant out
---
Take the resurrect, get opened on, pull 4 of your buddies into your layer to turn the 1v1 into a 5v1 :D
---
I hope that people find out the best way to game layers for rare spawns and herb/mineral nodes, but only so that Blizzard can figure out a way to combat it.
---
I helped my self son make a character in my everquest account when he was 4. He was a natural born role player who made an ogre then wandered out to The Feerot to "frighten skinny people".
---
On his first wow character he made a troll, ran it to shadowglen, then hid in the pond to rp jump out at nelfs (was a pve rp server).
---
#notallmums
---
Thank you you're the best
---
It makes everyone looks epic, even though you might have earned those looks. To me, it also takes away from item progression and the sense of adventure, as there is no visual indication of gear improvements. Without transmog, you visually express your progress and status.
---
I feel like there's going to be that one server that has 12,000 players dwindle to 6,000 instead of 3,000 after the first month. Then they have to choose between maintaining layers or giving people hour+ log in wait times.
---
This just screams "race to 60" to me, idle time searching and talking with/for people its not bad, one thing that vanilla do is to create a community and being social, an addon that remove part of the human interaction is not good to me.
---
Ok btw got the point and have a nice day sir, still i hope it wont work tbh
---
Most things have a required level of engineering.
---
Copy paste for our hardworking brothers at work:
---
"Greetings Beta Testers,
---
Starting on the afternoon of May 24, we will be enabling the PvP Honor System and the Warsong Gulch Battleground in the WoW Classic Beta realms. Beta players are invited to queue for Warsong Gulch from 12:00 p.m. PDT to 4:00 p.m. PDT on Saturday, May 25 and Sunday, May 26 as we try to spin up as many instances of the battleground as possible. While we’re targeting that timeframe to help capture data, players who are logged into the beta will be able to queue for Warsong Gulch at the Warsong Gulch battlemaster in capital cities at any time throughout the weekend.
---
As a reminder, queuing for Warsong Gulch requires your character to be level 10 or higher.
---
We have a few known issues related to Warsong Gulch:
---
The Battleground Scoreboard does not currently display Flag Captures and Flag Return statistics.
---
The Battleground Scoreboard stat numbers are misaligned with player names.
---
Have fun racking up those HKs and don’t forget to submit any bugs or issues that you encounter using the in-game bug reporter 2."
---
That was epic
---
Oh yeah definitely, but then if we're judging success Again by subscription numbers, and if that is also what gauge of how many people love the game versus like it, then burning Crusade would be even more loved than classic and wrath would be even more loved than burning Crusade.
---
But there's no way to know how much of a population loves a game and how much just likes a game, I mean it's an interesting hypothetical discussion but we can't quantify feelings. Also because it's totally normal for how strongly a person feels about a game to change the longer they play the game, in fact it's inevitable.
---
Then we discuss what constitutes a different game, is each expansion a different game? The changes happened a few at a time and the point at which it became a different game is again different for everybody.
---
thank you very much, its callled Hunter Over number 71 on the list :), its nothing special but it inspire me back in thhe days :)
---
There is always a guildie who can craft your stuff. Robe of the Void is tailor only but Robe of Winter Night is almost as good. Bloodvine doesn't require tailoring, only the 2% crit set bonus require tailoring.
---
It definitely was not as popular. Vanilla launch had 1.5 million people. Wow now has somewhere around 6 million. That’s a HUGE difference in the amount of people who will be playing or even just trying out classic. 1.5 million was a lot for the time but it’s no where near what we have now. I agree with a lot of your points though as I hate layering, I just wanted to make you aware of the difference in subscriber base.
---
Low effort
---
layers shouldnt exist in the first place
---
I suppose I agree, Heroic is decently challenging.
---
But outside of that I think my point stands.
---
Normal/Heroic/Mythic dungeons are all face roll.
---
World content is face roll.
---
LFR/Normal is mostly faceroll as well.
---
The way I understand it is that a new layer would be created when a continent is crowded, not just one zone. And with a layer size in the thousands of players, it would take massive coordination across several guilds to be able to reliably create a new layer on demand to farm. It might be possible to take advantage when a new layer is created organically, but it seems unlikely to me that you'd be able to do it regularly. But if it were to become a problem, there are ways to mitigate it with timers or lock outs or something.
---
They did offer xfers off dead servers a few times and they also offered free xfers off high pop to selected low pop servers to try to fix over pop.
---
Think WSG is the fucking best!!! Excited for those streams.
---
Yeah. I was sold on Layering when they announced it, but honestly it's probably gonna do more damage than the sharding in starting zones only.
---
Ideal would probably being unable to change shard above, like, level 35 or something.
---
Hope they raise the level cap soon too.. i cant get enough of these streams.
---
We had free transfers from Cenarion Circle to Farstriders at the 2.0.1 patch launch. They did do free transfers from high pop servers to select lower pop servers spread the load.
---
Pretty good video, at this very moment I'm planning on going orc enhancement shaman. Never played a shaman other than the first 10ish levels or so. Want to experience classic as big as a noob as possible. Even though I've been playing wow off an on for 14 years.
---
The real social interaction, grouping with players you don't know, is unaffected. If anything, our addon promotes more of it.
---
It already mostly works, we're just adding features at this point.
---
I've already made attunement, key, gold making guides. More importantly, however, I make the content that I want to. I know it's rare nowadays. I don't make guides because loads of people will watch them. That isn't the point. If I'm known for useless classic knowledge, so be it
---
Watching those WSG parkour tricks is gonna be fun, non mount bg's are also a lot of fun :)
---
My man just likes anime navels.
---
I'm also sprawling for info. 
---
&gt;" such as staying on the same layer for your entire session. "
---
So does this confirm that you will be able to switch layers by simply relogging? Yuge if true. 
---
Also, is it pretty much 100% confirmed that the Auction House will be shared between Layers? One Auction House for the 10k players looting and mining and crafting in the game?
---
haha yeah, only was it close to private servers when I was in a very high level zone I had huge aggro range
---
I kinda don’t like how these events were only on one layer and not the few that were up last night during the stress test. Didn’t really care for the fact that you could watch streamers be on layers with Ragnaros and other shit but other people were on layers with just people only.
---
Many things point to horde outnumbering alliance this time around.
---
Get up in there and dog slap a few hoes and what not!

I was part of the Alliance raid that camped the island. Good times.
---
bit late mate, try reading the front page ffs
---
I did consider this when making my comment.
---
i am so jealous
---
Yeah layering as a concept is literal dogshit
---
What should I do with reincarnation, though?
---
So you'll be fire specced during bwl? Idiot..
---
Hi, /u/simoncools

Elves always bring them back. The Horde has no elf this time.
---
Sacrificed Voidwalker
---
But don't forget to shame MinMaxers again tomorrow on /r/ClassicWoW!
---
I would also like to know this, so that I may apply.
---
No it doesnt. Just make more servers and merge them later.
---
It's Okay To Be Minmaxed.
---
Somebody else mentioned a retail population of \~2 mil.
---
I wish I could remember why this number specifically is significant. I think that at some point Blizz mentioned that was their "sinking ship" figure, which is still very successful in the MMO market, make no mistake, but for WoW specifically that's a significant low. I really wish I could remember where this idea in my head came from, if it was Blizz or if it was just a bunch of us kind of theorizing on the forums. I believe this discussion revolved around switching to a F2P model, though, not releasing legacy versions of the game. Again, I don't remember if Blizz officially chimed in on this or if this was a figure some of us forum regs asspulled.
---
Either way, I've always felt that before we ever saw a vanilla re-release WoW would have to hit some kind of threshold, again for some reason my brain is telling me it's \~2 million active subscribers. I was super excited to see the Classic announcement but at the same time, my immediate reaction also included an "oof" for retail, because as far as I understand it may indicate retail is near or at that "sinking ship" threshold.
---
I was horde in vanilla and going dwarf rogue this time.
---
Playing Alliance because that’s where I started. 
---
Alliance Vanilla-Wrath
---
Horde Cata-BFA
---
i am 8 and i find this offensive
---
Just remember to keep it up and it will take 10 alliance just to take you down.
---
DrakeDog approves. Man I do kind of miss the old over the top vanilla pvp videos with metal in the background.
---
You don't need tailoring to use Bloodvine though.
---
Orc is the way to go for hunter. Pet dmg increase + 25% stun resist. You couls even utalize the axe special
---
Grab instant spell
---
Wait near ranged

Tag mobs while they hit em
---
Help kill em
---
Get loot/quest shit
---
Invite them to group

If they don't agree camp their mobs

profit.

I loved the self sufficiency while still being a pure dps class. Healthstones, soulstones, drain life, siphon life all give good options to heal yourself and stay alive (or resurrected) in the world. It's really hard to kill a good warlock and if you don't do it super fast (rogues and PoM mages) then the battle will probably last a little bit and the longer it goes on the better odds warlocks have of winning. 
---
Run out of mana? Life tap. Run out of life? Drain life! 
---
And as far as PvE goes the computer is so predictable that you can stay alive very easily using your pet. Let your pet draw agro and you run away. Then summon a new demon when it's safe. 
---
I also loved having this self sufficiency in dungeons. I'd often whisper the healer and be like "as long as I have many don't worry about healing me" because if you're aware of your threat you can just keep doing damage and then life tap and continue doing damage while you heal yourself. Healers seemed to really like me because I could make their job easier and still do almost as much dps as mages. 
---
If you go undead you get canablize to heal yourself between fights and with that, all your self healing spells, and first aid you almost never have downtime. 
---
I also felt like they were WAY more interesting to play than mages. Mages seemed like an intro-to-caster class where shadow priest, warlock, priest really gave you interesting things to do. Frost mages were a bit more fun for me, but a pure fire mage might be powerful but damn was I bored playing one. Not to mention how squishy you are. As a warlock I hardly felt squishy, especially when specced demo. 
---
I made the mistake of rolling a Warlock as my first class in vanilla and I honestly had a hard time leveling alts because I just didn't like them as much lol.
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
&gt;Taking 6 hours to so a single quest at level 1 is a good thing!
---
Opinion discarded
---
50 mana no cool down that is basically unending
---
Any twitch vods?
---
My envy has turned to Jealousy.
---
And almost no one used those, and on those servers, they became as imbalanced as the high-pop servers they tried to recruit from. It didn't work, at all. If it did, they wouldn't have added sharding.
---
*Blizz has no say in what's high pop or low pop*. People will just randomly pick servers, not knowing that server A has 5 big streamers on it and will be massive, or that no one is picking server B. You won't figure out what the pop is until months later when it's stabilized. It's not a choice, it's a roulette wheel.
---
You haven't thought this through, don't realize why they are doing layering in the first place, and just want to complain.
---
server transfers are not a good fix, server transfers fucked my server during vanilla wow. It was 60% 40% Alliance Horde Imbalance and a very high pop (Fun server to play on, had top 10 world first guilds). As soon as blizz gave a free server x-fer a top horde guild used it which caused a chain reaction of horde guides to leave, fucking faction balanced permanently. Another thing which pissed people off is every single high profile ninja looter x-fered off the server removing the downside of being ostracized.
---
As someone who played Warlock for a long time in Vanilla, I have to say that it is one of the strongest and fun classes in the game, imo.  
---
SM / Ruin (31 affli / 20 destro) is the best spec for raiding and it is also viable in PVP.  
---
You will start dealing some serious damage with the full bloodvine set crafted after ZG is released and hit rating will be your pref stat. On AQ40 and specially on Naxx, you will be the best single target dps in the entire game hands down.  
---
High threat will be your greatest enemy, so always keep an eye on that.  
---
With more than 3,4k hp or so, with some spell damage and a few jumping DoT tricks, you will be able to solo the entire DM East dungeon (yes bosses included) as you can enslave demons to tank the bosses for you. If you're an enchanter you can DE the blues for shards or you can even boost some rogues and fury warriors who will want the bow from the satyr that sacrifices people as it is pre-raid bis and make some serious gold.  
---
If you also have mining, you can get some high level rare nodes after the last boss is down for some nice income aswell.  
---
Looking forward to play a Warlock again!
---
When did Earl Boen die?
---
I'll probably devide my time between some questing, leveling my professions, and some PvP or being ganked to hell 🙂
---
But it will be worth it all
---
Oh god its going to be so much fun watching these streams
---
Great now I need gear.  Gonna get popped like a balloon.
---
Gold is pretty damn important. While you are leveling, you need to make sure you have enough gold to buy all of your new spells as you rank them up. They get progressively expensive and from 1-40ish you are upgrading/learning new spells almost every level. Buying gear/upgrades/potions at lower levels is usually not a great idea unless you absolutely need something. The items you get from quests and dungeons usually keeps you going no problem. The biggest hurdle that a lot of people struggle with is at level 40. You can buy your mount/training for mount and it costs a total of 100g (unless you play paladin or warlock). 100g is a ton for someone still leveling up. So picking up a profession like mining, herbalism, or skinning is usually a good way to make money while you level.
---
This but unironically 
---
Also you go-to example being MOP says a lot
---
God I don't want to be waiting for hours to do singular quests man. I'd rather see the world of warcraft, not a few square meters in the starting zone.
---
Like the fuck is that? The more efficient strat will be to roll an unpopular race, or run to an unpopular race's starting zone.
---
The guy above you has the same obnoxious opinion as you do and literally disagrees with you. 
---
He agreed mibs were hitting harder on beta (it is actually more then 5% but it doesn’t matter) and 5% more incoming damage is no joke when the average leveling time is several hundred hours.
---
Furthermore,  as I told your friend there, I am the only one here with experience in both vanilla and pservers so frankly I trust my own opinion comparing the two more then yours.
---
I was a druid back then and in the first phase of Razorgore I had to put one of the drakekinspawns in the edges to sleep since we had not enough damage to deal with the waves quick enough.
---
But silly me back then used to click in spells.
---
Right next to the Sleep spell: Insectswarm.
---
You can guess what happend... More than ones :D
---
I got nearly kicked. Everyone was pretty frustrated back then
---
Double gathering for money. Herb/ alch or mining/ engi. Probably switch to herb at end-game regardless for the money.
---
If you just want to level fast, then ignore all prof's.
---
Yes, a significant portion of your time will be spent farming gold for gear, enchants, consumables, repairs, etc. Getting your epic mount alone will require a lot of gold farming, and some players might not ever find the time to do so.
---
Depending on the class you roll, and if you become pvper and raider, youll find yourself spending 50g for a talent respec a lot of the time. As I remember running a paladin in classic I was constantly flopping holy and ret. Holy for raiding, ret for pvp.   
---
Not sure what other MMO's you played but gold is very important in WoW. You use them to train new abilities for your toon and for your profession(s), you use it to buy gear for leveling and for end game, you use it to tip people for portals to cities you don't feel like walking to, or tip for enchants on your gear. You need a ton of gold to get your level 60 fast 'Epic" mount training. The list can go on.   
---
A lot of people level a specific toon strictly for farming whether its gold farming, or material farming for resell. I myself spend a lot of time end game farming for gold.
---
Yeah, seeing as they can invite people globally into the same servers, it sure would be nice to have the option to select US/EU realms at will.
---
I've always heard this about WoW, is there a reason why?
---
Am I crazy or did you whine like a bitch first? Weird...
---
Extremely important. Gotta pay for skills, mounts, respects, ammunition/regents, etc. gold isn’t easy to get, so making just making a few g an hour makes you feel extremely rewarded. Hell I remember farming for the first mount and being happy making 5g from like 3 hours of farming.
---
Arenas
---
True, gonna farm 2k thorium on day 2 and destroy the server
---
Gold is very valuable.  You can buy stuff on the auction house and do some minor upgrades from NPC vendors, but this gets expensive.
---
You need to grind to get gold and to buy your skills.  You wont have much (if any) left over depending on your class and what items you decide to blow gold on.
---
What race? Took me 85 minutes to get 1-6 quests done as a forsaken priest
---
You’ll be good in pvp right away. Or at least once you get a few pieces at 60 (r8, t1 etc.)
---
no? do u know how vanilla gearing works, you can achieve the same spell power as rank 13 gear easily the only problem is survivability. Early game warlocks are glass cannons. There is no counterplay outside of trinket to seduce -&gt; CoE -&gt; soul fire -&gt; death coil -&gt; immo -&gt; conflag -&gt; shadowburn and it should kill anyone 100 to 0 in the early stages of the game.
---
It reminds me of Europe and America.
---
Lordaeron with its old kingdoms is europe and the vast land which got discovered is america.
---
As a skinny person I dont even really look at them as females, just have a body shape closer to mine than the bulky Male character models of warcraft
---
Interested to see if there are any jumps left in WSG. Some should work since they are not as "texture based" or whatever you call it.
---
Will be interesting to see for sure.
---
UI is very clean. Setting up a clean minimalistic UI was always a good time for me.
---
Relatively important, skills cost gold while leveling and compared to what you're bringing through normal questing it's a big chunk.  Mounts are obviously a big gold sink at level 40 and 60.  The best gear is BoP gear but you will be spending money on enchants and potions etc... depending your professions.
---
It’s not as though they can’t level a second character starting week 3. 
---
If I had the time I’d be all up in the race. Nothing in gaming, imo, is more fun than the race to rag/ony on a fresh vanilla server. Some people go to Rome others the Great Barrier Reef. My ideal 2 week vacation is a virgin azeroth with a dragon and firelord waiting for me at the end. 
---
That said, I I’m not doing that and can’t justify 2 weeks for a video game. But I totally understand the mentality. The race happens once, casual leveling? That’s there for us from 8/27 until blizzard fails as a company.
---
A chosen one of many isn't new
---
Tips didn't do shit. 
---
I like his videos but as a player he is bad.
---
Playing a lock is pretty nice. You can play by yourself in that it is easy to solo multiple mobs and some elites. Warlocks are generally the quicker classes to 60/70.
---
The class includes some fun mechanics like enslave demon, summon infernal and Curse of Doom that you can use in many different ways. Furthermore, warlock is one of the few classes in Vanilla/TBC that had huge aspects of lore mixed throughout. You really feel like a warlock when you play one. You also get a free 40 mount, which is huge. Your 60 mount is cheaper as well. 
---
You are very powerful in WPvP due to your ability to CC, chase, selfheal, and Battle res. All of this also makes you very powerful in BG scenarios. 
---
Raiding as a warlock can be a mixed bag. You have some very specific roles such as creating healthstones/soulstones, summoning, banishing and maintaining curses. You may find it frustrating to raid because you will almost never be able to use your full damage kit due to debuff limits and the need for soulstones/curses for raid assistance. 
---
All together I’d say warlock is one of the best classes in Vanilla WoW. With the unique flavor and decent power throughout the various areas of the game, warlocks are awesome.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought. And that's why it cannot be tested yet, as there are no bosses available on the beta right now. Regular dungeon "bosses" are just named elites and not classified as bosses.
---
Surely there's a better, even perfect solution that Blizzard can find to any problem I have!
---
I like Horde locks better, people will berate me for this but ive seen enough convincing evidence from both sides of the aisle on the who is harder Horde or Alli. Ive played on both I find Horde harder, and don't rate windfury for 2 classes over kings for everyone, when better healers can let the ratio of healers/dps lean even more to dps. I like more of a challange, basically I feel Horde is closer to an ironman/hard mode than Alli, thats a pro for me maybe a con for others. Racials on the horde side don't do much for locks in PvE, except while lvling cannibalize is good for reducing downtime for UDlocks. I think farming for mats as a Horde lock is easier, the flight-paths are closer to herbs you need for pots/flasks except for maybe gravemoss. Undead/Orc locks look the best in lock gear, the character fits the look of the gear when imo gnomes and humans do not. UD WotF racial can help on Nef if you get morphed by a wandering mage during their class call. Horde have a better ability to gather raid buffs, DMn is closer to the Horde FP, Org is closer to Felwood Songflower buff than Darn, Org has zep to STV for ZG buff, and ZG, TB is closer to Onyxia than Darn. &lt;--- Basically just to point out that Horde lose less time on buffs between points.
---
The main issue with this strat is that all your gear and damage is focused around spells. If you do melee you can still do some damage and you can optimize it with thigns like that item you linked. But no matter how hard you try to go that route you still won't hit hard physically. 
---
I bet you won't find an issue leveling solo, locks are self sufficient and even shitty specs can solo 1v1 any mob your level. But in dungeons you will probably be the least effictive dps person and in PvP you just will be gimping yourself. You don't want to have to melee a rogue to do your full damage potential because then you're just gifting them the ability to be next to you. 
---
Being far away from melee targets is a huge bonus for casters, and this spec basically gimps that entire idea. 
---
That said my buddy's first char was a "battle warlock" he melee'd with until level 42 when we made him switch to Horde side. He said it was slow going but he just wanted a warlock that did melee so he made it. And had fun.
---
Wouldn’t that be a streamer with a sponsorship?
---
In Vanilla, they actually took up real bag space.  You didn't have a void pouch that fit like 28 of them.
---
Good chance I roll a Warrior for classic.  I've played warlock for 15 years, and the Vanilla / TBC days are the reasons I will not roll it now.
---
Depends how badly you want skills or professions or mounts.
---
The leveling is really nice. Got pets, lots of utility, with demonology talents you are virtually unkillable. They also have some cool class quests. They have an extremely high skill-ceiling in PvP so you have lots of space to improve.
---
Its not elitist... I am a casual player and I prefer the TBC model. In TBC my biggest achievement was to kill leotheras the blind. Never cleared SSC or TK (except lootreaver). Yet I much prefer this. Even what I did felt great for me, it was a milestone for me. 
---
Plus the game was much more immersive. Knowing there are places that are too dangerous for you is great. I always had a chilling when I was outside of black temple... I was looking with awe its entrance. This is more valuable for me than que and kill a retarted version of illidan and get a nameless and forgetable epic that I will replace next day.
---
Yes, I can be on my computer about 80% of the day
---
Well, the Alliance might have Paladins but at least the whole faction doesn't have WoTF or Tremor Totems to fuck with your CC. (I'm going Priest myself.) I don't have to deal with Purge spam/Earth Shock either.
---
I'll be that annoying gnat spamming Hex of weakness, dispels and mana burns.
---
You are retarded if you think layering will be gone in 2 weeks and that it won't crush the economy. People aren't stupid, they're on beta right now testing how to best abuse this. By the time layering is gone the economy will be fucked for good.
---
Good suggestion. There needs to be some kind of solution for these exploits.
---
They need to lock names at the beginning if they plan to merge servers eventually. You can't have it both ways.
---
This is worth silver or gold imo
---
dude me too, all the gnome rogues kept throwing fkn knives too and giggling... fkn gnomes
---
I am responding super late... but wow, just googled it... those graphics are insaaaaane
---
You don't understand how layering works.
---
When I was a game tester at EA I usually played wow 4 to 6 hours a day.
---
It's extremely important. The primary things you'll be needing it for is mounts + riding skill, consumables, buying/selling tradeskill items (both the end products and the materials,) and respeccing when needed. Not all specs are viable for end-game raiding so respeccing from your pvp to your pve spec is common.
---
PvE: Forsaken, but just barely. Slightly more Int and a couple of bosses have fear, making will of the forsaken useful.
---
PvP: Orc. Stun resist is really strong against rogues and is definitely good against warriors, paladins, even some hunters. Will of the forsaken is strong, but only against classes you dont have trouble against.
---
Style: Forsaken male. Best warlock animations, but thats subjective.
---
Bonus
---
Leveling: Forsaken. Cannibalize synergizes really well with lifetap and dots and if youre killing humanoids you will have absolutely no trouble managing resources.
---
True, but it'll be better than being unable to play for a week.
---
Well for Stardew Valley, I'd argue it does have a place on the hate/love spectrum. People hate it cause its just a basic farming game, growing stuff, collecting stuff, fishing, spelunking, but other people love it cause it can be peaceful, fruitful, challenging. You take a game like Frostpunk, which is good, liked, but didn't blow up like Stardew Valley, which will not have the same longevity as Stardew (Taking away new content patches, xpacs, etc., different argument). It's not "loved", just liked.  
---
I do see your point on that note about how those games aren't super personal, say, like WoW. The personal bit really applies in multiplayer games, as in singleplayer, being personal doesn't really matter that much, you're the only person playing, so you're already unique and sticking out cause you have no one to compete with. But if you're playing a multiplayer game, like fortnite or PUBG, the skins market is what makes it personal, and its thriving. That skin makes it your character, not everybody has it, you stick out. You get to "make it yours" persay, or atleast be a small minority where you feel as though it is (Which strongly applies to hard-to-get skins, or super expensive ones).
---
I feel you gotta mold the lessons around the game, they don't just apply outright.
---
Sharding isn't a bug, it's an intentional design choice that's partly responsible for the dogshit that is retail
---
No, he's not. The system was changed in TBC.
---
In vanilla, it was a derpy hard-code. When a non-unique quest creature dies (e.g. a wolf in Northshire Abbey), if it is the last of the wolves, immediately respawn a new one.
---
In TBC, they made it much more natural--they made it so that the actual *respawn timer* changes depending on how many people are in the area. Since in vanilla, they'd only spawn one-by-one. You'd kill one, only then another single 1 would spawn, kill it, only then another spawns, etc. But in TBC, if you had 30 people in the same area, any creature you kill will respawn within like 5 seconds. It made it much more fluid (and more dangerous).
---
Eyyyyy my boy Murphy and Kargoz are there. We got the goblin smasher together and raided north shire all Wednesday night lol. I guess I wasn’t in that raid :(
---
Im not offended by anything , i was just playing beta yesterday and felt so good to be back i wanted to spread some love
---
You fundamentally misunderstand how layering works. This is embarrassing.
---
quinn eksD
---
Do you know my mom? This hussy wanted to build a "gaming computer" to play flash games.
---
No, I'm not kidding.
---
maybe stop betting on classic wow to fail and planning around its failure
---
I’m a field service engineer in the IT industry. Sometimes there’ll be no tickets to attend so I can stay at home and do what I want: aka play games. Also get home early a lot and leave later too fairly regularly, leaving more time to play games!
---
Wife hates it though.
---
The only solution for whiners will be to quit the game. Simple
---
End your existence.
---
It is not hard now and it doesnt kill Guilds like Vanilla, so people have the Knowledge an Addons.
---
Our Guild was first Guild on Aleria ( all cleared and geared 2 Months before BC came out), and i was the first Hunter in lvl, Gear &amp; Rank ( with white wolf) on Hord side.
---
For me this Classic Feelings ( Vanilla ) never come back, it was another Time and Tech.
---
The drums of war thunder once again.
---
Dude..layers _do_ have dynamic population limits..they can scale up or down both the number of layers and the size of the layers.
---
Paladin
---
Layers and servers are both... computers or groups of computers. The difference is how people and what they are doing in the world, is distributed amongst these computers. 
---
Layering will allow them to start and stop computers at will in a seamless fashion. You wouldn’t want the servers popping up and disappearing in the same fashion because that’s visible to the player. 
---
However essentially it’s identical computer resource cost for either method. If you want to host a million people then it’s going to be the same cost either way. Servers or layers. Blizzard originally owned all their hardware but these days I doubt that is the case with the rise of cloud computing farms globally it’s a lot easier to rent this resource when you need it.
---
Ah interesting, I guess that orc one would be viable.    
---
Yeah for undead I could see that, one my idea was around skipping rattlecages, but grouping for zombies. Although then you'd have to try grind through the bat and wolf drop rate quest, and after that do spiders / grind til 4, if ahead enough snatch the named mob, and skip the crusader part 100% of the time. Though the crates quest was do / not do depending on respawn timer
---
I think you mean 30/21 ;)
---
&gt; “(name) requested an invite to your group”
---
I really hope this gets removed.  As someone who leads pugs on Live, the amount of spam of this I get after someone I just invited wants to invite someone else is annoying.  I cannot possibly imagine dealing with it in a 40-man raid size.  I'm not opposed to people recommending others, just that this popup gives me no way to check vital information (are they geared?  Do I need their class?  Are they even max level?) before deciding whether or not to invite them.
---
Oh no Reddit police.
---
I'm willing to bet I could program and grind mobs at the same time
---
You can using the all powerful artifact wreathed in mist and legend known only as "Daddy's Credit Card".
---
Once a mob goes grey, or a quest is six levels below you, you lose 20% of the total reputation possible for the kill/completion for each level. This goes this way for four levels, until you reach the minimum reputation gain of 20%. 
---
AFAIK this was changed in Wotlk and that would explain why the beta doesn't have any reduction. 
---
Source various wikis and I remember being told in Vanilla (not pserver) that if I wanted to grind a faction I should start doing it early. However wikis only document the mob reputation change after Vanilla and leave the wording 'completing low level quests with a level 80 character now gives full reputation.'
---
Ahhh the true classic experience though... I love playing alliance, though yes it is typically a 60/40 split on PvP realms.
---
I actually like that in retail the game does a better job of teaching you an actual rotation, or at least allows for it. 
---
Everyone praises all the utility spells in vanilla but going all the way back to then I would just get confused by why I would need something like a sentry totem. If they really didn't directly help I just wouldn't skill them up

Shadow Priest damage is calculated in Gold Per Second because of consumables you have to chug to keep it going. They are very strong 1v1 but outside of a controlled environment duel they can be overwhelmed quickly because they lack consistent Burst damage and the healing provided from shadow damage is more supplemental than a real heal source.
---
Yeah this was a different group before we raided Northshire but damn was that a good time! What was your name on the stress test?
---
I haven't done one at max level, but I did do one after it went grey. It rewarded 100 reputation, so it seems to be giving the full amount. 
---
Note that starter zone quests don't reward spillover points to the other reputations in that faction, whereas most quests grant 25% to the other reputations of a faction.
---
Additionally with grey quests, since they don't grant experience, they don't give you any bonus gold in place of experience once you reach max level.
---
Well fucking said
---
You can laugh all you want, mate... at the top of your lungs.   Sharding and layering are not one in the same, and are separate technology.  Full stop.
---
&gt;Pets are mostly useless in dungeons and raids
---
Imp buff, succubus CC, Fel Hunter anti caster machine, VW offtank..
---
In raids I agree, but in dungeons I disagree completely. I felt like I was always managing my pets and often felt like I Was playing two roles in the group. Do you need this stuff? No, most dungeon content is pretty easy. But my buddies and I would 3 man dungeons all the time with my VW tanking and stuff like that. 
---
If you want you can ignore pets in dungeons, but if you want to play the class to full potential the pets have very useful things for dungeons.

Probably my own confirmation biased that I havent seen any hate about Stardew, about the multiplayer/singleplayer aspect, both Eu4 and Civ6 are multiplayer games as well, I just don't think grand strategy games/ realtime startegy games fit this part of the mold at all.

Aint that the truth brother
---
Same for civ 6. Get an early snowball and the game is over.
---
Looks great! :D
---
Definitely a consideration of mine! The things I read about Ret worry me. Is it pretty much guaranteed I would be a buffwhore for raids?
---
What everyone said, id like to add that the best gear is usually from content and not bought.
---
Amen, brother.

Hey neither am I \^_^ and even if you were there's always room to learn and improve :D
---
its none of your business which faction i play
---
I will tell you my class is paladin tho
---
Enlightened?
---
Yes! I am medical physicist at the oncology clinic. So...
---
Come on Blizzard! Let us all in.
---
Yes exactly. Fixing bugs (which is what beta is for) is not a design choice (which sharding is). Thanks for proving you dont have a point though.
---
this is so fucking sick!
---
The first and the second war are good games too, but the lore isn't that epic than in the third. It's basically orcs vs humans. WC2 beyond the dark portal is nice tho.
---
&gt; By this logic all the bugs in the beta currently are actually working as intended. Dynamic spawning is easy to miss in internal testing because you won't have the kind of player numbers where it becomes evident.
---
Most of the legitimate bugs I've seen are of technical nature (animation bugs, portraits spazzing, etc) related to the port-over of old code, rather than design-oriented bugs the likes of dynamic respawns and others. Most if not every bug that's been rather publicised on the forums (hunter deadzone, attacking backwards when close, NPC damage values, aggro radius, polymorphing tagged targets) has been confirmed by Blizzard not to be a bug, and instead intentional due to being accurate to Vanilla. Why would they bother intentionally ripping out/disabling the already existing dynamic respawns from the modern server code if it was meant to be in Vanilla?
---
On top of that, this is also one of the "not a bug" things listed by Blizzard: **"Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth."** which could be construed to mean no dynamic respawning, though a clarification by Blizzard might be necessary so people stop complaining about it still.
---
yea i tested it in the test server, it does work, you phase out. you just need a fresh character to invite you before you die. nice theory tho.
---
yes but you can raid instances as a 40 man, you just cant complete quests during it, which is why no one generally does it. 
---
40 level 10s running though RFC? sounds like mini-Molten Core to me!!! Can't wait!  
---
we successfully 'raided' gamon several times and while heading to elwynn forest in a raid we 20 manned one of these [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dust\_Devil](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dust_Devil)  with all lvl 5s. BELIEVE!
---
[So Jealous!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP3wnYe6Muw)
---
Yes, they did.
---
Thank you!
---
Did someone say Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
Love it. I have so many buddies who I'm positive would love dark souls but they're still out off by the idea that it's the most difficult gamer test ever invented. They're harder than the average modern AAA game, but no harder than the NES/SNES classics from our childhood. It just bums me out some of the most immersive and engaging RPGs have a meme surrounding them about difficulty that puts people off.
---
Thank you so much for the reply 😊 
---
You guys are awesome!
---
I’m curious though, is the xp worth it?
---
Dwarves are criminally underplayed.
---
Do you think the amount of people they logged into the stress test mimicked what a normal server with layering would be (ie ~8K)? 
---
I’m guessing the stress test had wayyy more people packed into that one little server than we will see at launch.
---
&gt; And almost no one used those
---
Do you have data to support this? Because I used this service multiple times.
---
Legit, fucking memories
---
I think you’re misunderstanding layering. Like I said, if 10,000 people tried to join “Realm 1” on launch without layering what do you think is going to happen? The starting zone is going to be unplayable and there’s going to be an hour long realm queue. But what if Blizzard could take a single realm’s population and split it up into smaller chunks so instead of 10,000 trying to get into the realm, only 3,000. I’m using those numbers as examples.
---
From mmochampion on summary of interview with Omar:
---
&gt;A new technology called Layering will be used to smooth the launch. It allows them to have multiple versions of each of the two continents running as needed. They are not cross realm and are only used so that an entire realm population isn't competing in one area at a time and to lessen login ques. The only way you can shift into a different layer is through party invites from others on your server who are in a different layer.
---
&gt;The technology tries to sticky you to a layer so that you see familiar names often. It also only exists to control population at launch and will not continue once
---
I agree, to which I think TBC or Wrath could be more successful (money/player count wise) than Classic.  
---
Well it's hard to quantify feelings, but you can get a general sense if you use like a rating scale. I'm sure if you ask people about Classic on a scale of 1-10, most answers will be in the 1-2 or 9-10 range, which is indicative of that love/hate relationship. If its just a consistent amount of 5's or 6's, thats more "liked", but not loved.  
---
I would argue that every expansion is basically a different game. They change so many talents, areas, abilities, story, that it's more unique. Sure some of the core mechanics are the same, but every xpac is so different, I'd classify it as a different experience, so a different game.
---
its funny because classic is so easy you can play hardest content on controller without issue
---
Wow how did you do 50% of the damage with 3 guards on it too?
---
Yep, Software Developer 100% Remote. During 45 min scrum calls that could have been an email that has no bearing on me - Wow time.
---
Yeah you’re definitely a buff whore as a pally, but eh it’s not bad. Soul shards aren’t terrible to manage though if you’re looking at playing lock.
---
My boss got triggered when I told him I was gonna stay home to play the stresstest, so he said;
---
«You know anon, the computer at the office can run Classic just fine.»
---
you wont be in a raid as a ret, or in any premade.
---
Quite
---
You have to familiarize yourself with all nuances involved when it comes to launching classic wow, and it would be naive to think that the devs aren't miles ahead of you when it comes to understanding the issues.
---
Tourist players will be a thing that will hurt long term populations so it needs to be accommodated for. If you throw everyone on just 1 server(without layers) day one you get a situation like the stress test. This is a terrible experience that never happen in vanilla because the player base grew over time and their weren't "tourist" like players that left. As WoW sub count grew and grew, it was easy solution to just add more servers. Rare were the problems of underpopulated servers in those days, unlike the mass exodus that will happen with classic.
---
Another thing to consider is time frames and days that people will usually play. So lets remove tourist from this equation, and just use consistent players. A lot will plan vacation around the 1st week and almost all who intend to play will be there on day 1 right when it goes live. Over time the playerbase will average out for current online players as people will tend to play during different times and on different days. This is the target populations that the devs will plan for, not the initial week of online players and way after the tourist have left. 
---
The best solutions is layering, to not only to avoid long que lines but unplayable experience in the starting zones. And don't worry, even with layering, you will be competing way to much with other players and it will still suck in that regard but won't be unplayable. Also, once the online population averages out, layering will be phased out, and the sooner the better for everyone. As long as Blizzard can take measure to prevent node exploitation via layering, everything will be fine. We'll all get to play, it may be crowded early but not unplayable, the server won't feel dead by time the Pop averages out, and phase will cease to exist by the time it could cause any major issues(like 2 Kazzaks).
---
So relax and looks up some dev interview on the subject and I think you'll realize their goals/intent. Everything will be just fine.
---
&gt;I like playing the dark horse class of any game
---
Druid will be the least played, almost assuredly. They also have a pretty dedicated community around them, with a very high skill ceiling in both PvP and PvE.
---
&gt;Currently leaning warlock because of their late game potential and utility
---
That's pretty counter intuitive to the first quote there
---
&gt; However I’m not thrilled about pet mechanics or soul shard management
---
Not looking great for warlocks there
---
&gt;Would playing shadow priest be a huge detriment to my group compared to warlock
---
Yeah, pretty much no way around it, the only thing you are bringing to the raid is shadow weaving... But you can do that (and better) as a disc priest with PI and going heals.
---
&gt;s it unrealistic to hope to pull big dps numbers in raids even as a thinked out spriest
---
In PvE, yes, you'll be outclassed by any other non-meme spec. Even hunters will be beating you in later raids, and you'll be struggling the most in early raids.
---
&gt;What other classes/ specs might you guys recommend considering I am looking for a less popular but still high ceiling choice
---
Druid?
---
I work from home, so yes!
---
It's just for phase one.
---
So your 2 best examples are:
---
Saronite Bombs - Every raid member knew what they were doing on Lich King with Saronite Bombs and it was part of their strategy. It was clearly an exploit and nobody could have possibly been that being done and went "Well thats normal".
---
Martin Fury - Even more absurd to think that everyone involved didn't know what was happening. Suddenly every boss in 10 &amp; 25 man Ulduar get 1shot and nobody thinks anything of it?
---
No person involved in either of those incidents could possibly claim innocence.
---
No, they've given free transfers from overpopulated realms, not from dead realms.
---
Stopped a few weeks ago. Just chillin till end of august.
---
 [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9DHtuNjHnkgDve6fYUiE2OYEDpI6akc5KOmhgGODgWCaoTw/viewanalytics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9DHtuNjHnkgDve6fYUiE2OYEDpI6akc5KOmhgGODgWCaoTw/viewanalytics)  dont know how accurate this is but hope it helps.
---
WoW didn't launch with an existing subscriber base of between 2-6 million people.
---
Thanks for the clarification.  A lot of the bosses in classic just behaved like big elites, so it never dawned on my that they weren't.
---
I had a similar experience and the horde had what looked like two 40 man raids attacking the borders of goldshire. At some point half their raid 'poofed' and they were scattered and we were able to wipe them out. For the next 30 min there was an all out battle in elywwn forest with small packs of horde rezzing here and there. It was amazing, we were trying to cleanse the forests of horde and it was really memorable.
---
90% drop in playerbase is not a failure, it's the nature of mmos, especially one as niche with as much love for its franchise as classic wow
---
That's why they're likely going to be on PvE servers first and probably transfer to PvP servers later on. They have confirmed modern day things, like character transfers, will still be available.
---
6 years and still a girlfriend. You are playing with fire. :D
---
Yes, **from** overpopulated realms **to** dead realms.
---
I would bet either next Tuesday, or the one after that considering alpha players are at 50 cap at minimum. Though that's a pretty wide range of a guess
---
Ruins PVP for me because you can't see how powerful someone is until after they've hit you
---
For anybody who likes watching streams, and is unfamiliar with the pserver community e-celebs, you might enjoy watching them play wsg. 
---
They are disgustingly good at it.
---
What’s IMO?
---
So it doesn't solve the issue we're talking about here...
---
You do for the set bonus that makes them stay bis.
---
That zoom in and audio of the voidwalker buried me 6 feet deep
---
Nostalgia but with face cam.
---
90% in 1 month, 99% in 2 months, 99.9% in 3 months, dead game by the end of the year, that's the nature of niche mmos, thought ya did but ya didn't get it
---
"shitters full" was all I could think as I plunged my toilet for an hour yesterday.
---
You’re ignoring the part where you’re wrong and unable to admit it.
---
They are always relevant but their roles shifts with gear. They start out as being peelers and controllers because their damage is quite low. Once they get some good gear their damage shoots through the roof and they start to take on a nuke role. With a shadowpriest at your back and a trinket you'll easily push shadowbolt crits in the 4k range which is really quite dangerous in PvP. Its short cast time only adds to the glory.
---
Rofl. Okay. Don't explain or anything. Just say I'm wrong and move on. Nice.
---
Cool thanks brother.
---
I could bite my bottom that I threw my boxes a few years ago, when we moved and the baby came. Never thought I want to play it again.
---
Horde since its what i played all the way back then. also going same class. mostly for nostalgia. have not played since pre Lfr cata.
---
What am I wrong about?
---
When your primary criticism of a game it's something that's only relevant for a small fraction of the length of the entire game, maybe it's worth a second look.
---
Now who's planning for the failure?
---
I think it's whatever layer is least populated. I'm sure it's not set in stone who gets moved. At best, I think it's 50-50 if you can avoid combat.
---
BTW, I think this is almost guaranteed not to happen. Nobody is going to have a level 1 character invite them so they can avoid PVP. Why even join a PVP if you do this.
---
I think it's less about trying to resurrect WoW and more about stabilizing it. I see this more as a sign of Blizzard preparing to put WoW into maintenance mode. They've made it no secret that they didn't want to run a 2nd MMO alongside retail, which is why Classic is being rolled out the way it is. If they do have another MMO in the works that hasn't yet been announced, it isn't going to drop before WoW is put into maintenance mode and handed over to the Classic Games department or shut down entirely.
---
I would be concerned for WoW if Blizz announces another MMO in the works. Like I said, "Word of God" so to speak is they don't want to run 2 MMOs side by side. If they announce a new MMO, I think that means it's because they're done with WoW.
---
anyone you would suggest? particularly interested in horde players
---
Thanks for your time to respond I appreciate it! Druid would by my choice if my leveling buddy wasn’t already doing it. He was a Druid in classic. 
---
Will warlocks be very popular do you think?
---
If it worked, they wouldn't have done sharding. Not enough people used them for it to matter is my point.
---
Engi for sure if pvp since its pretty busted in Vanilla. if for money i would go skinning and mining and then switch when you have enough money to whatever you want.
---
oh god, the rotating minimap is killing me
---
If you can’t see it I can’t help you. Enjoy your weekend!
---
I would imagine a large portion of the playerbase of classic will be ex raiders with day jobs that still have all the skill but not all the time. So 3 day a week raids with about 4 hours those nights.
---
Dude stop dreaming, those boars are not gonna kill themselves !
---
Sure, but I've seen quite a few locks who think you need tailoring to even wear them. The items alone will be BiS until possibly AQ where you can maybe switch it out for garb or T2,5.
---
u are.
---
i say wow classic will continue to grow after release
---
Sonic Syndicate is also on my WoW Classic playlist.
---
“Anon”? We’re not on 4chan, pal.
---
yea, but that's a long time to wait just to join a group for something
---
No but the drops are,  im def the richest level 5 on the server.
---
&gt; Would playing shadow priest be a huge detriment to my group compared to warlock especially considering another of our more active friends will be playing priest? Is it unrealistic to hope to pull big dps numbers in raids even as a thinked out spriest? 
---
I think you could manage a Spriest, especially in a high Lock pop guild, they make locks output 15% more shadow dmg. With 7 Locks you create a 8th invisable Lock thats is 5% better than the average of the other 7.
---
&gt;I dont think layering has anything to do with population control...
---
Everything Blizz says claims that's what they are using it for. Same for most of the people spouting off defending it on any forum. Their entire reasoning is modern servers can handle more than Vanilla Servers, therefore Blizzard is going to have massive pop caps on servers, therefore having only 3000 per layer is less. But that ignores a massive part of Vanilla, which is that the game world was balanced around the pop caps at that time and putting larger population caps will break the game world as it was balanced at the time.
---
This is why I just don't game anymore. Games have become linear and they spoonfeed you everything you need to do. I play competitive games like HoTS and Starcraft randomly but as far as new games that come out? Meh. The dark souls type games also just don't appeal to my interest, so while I admit they would be a fun challenge, I'm just not interested.
---
I miss games like OG tomb raider and the sense of exploration.
---
This right here.
---
Oh my god can we hop off the streamers dicks for fuck sake.
---
ND had no lag, neither did K3. 10k player launch
---
Seems like sharding-exploitation will be a skill you're going want to master if you want to farm nodes effectively. Without exploitation, you're going to see your income take a massive hit, as you'll be competing with people that are simply netting 3 to 4 times as much material as you. It's not necessarily bad, but interesting! 
---
Is anyone making a shard-switching-Addon that would allow us to hop layers effectivelly? (connect various players temporarily for the switch) I like being competitive, but don't want to have to set up a large social network just to be able to use gathering in the non-pleb way.
---
when server opens, you can usually buy leather from the auction house for less than the vendor sell out price.
---
After there is a little money floating around, someone will come along and buy all those up and vendor them, and that oppurtunity never comes back around again.
---
**TLDR:** Leather is very cheap until you get to end game.
---
I don't even think it was that big. WoW sold only 240,000 copies in NA on launch ("only", it was the best launch day in PC game history). I imagine plus maybe another 10% of that in Australia which also launched on day 1. They only hit 2 million subscribers in the summer of 2005 I believe.
---
What do you want to do in raids? Warriors can dps or tank as good or better than anyone, rogues are great dps that never go oom, and shamans are ok healers but can only heal.
---
I telework so could technically do it, but don’t.
---
You only need to hit it once to get exp and loot.  The more damage you do the more xp you get but I don't remember it being like this in retail vanilla lol.....  This would mean a low level could drag world bosses to guards and get loot from it.
---
That’s a huge stretch. I’d say they added sharding because the pop dipped too hard. There’s a handful of high pop servers, and this probably makes up 90% of the population, in turn making shards necessary. 
---
It’s not a reaction to people not transferring, it’s a reaction to the population being too low to span more than the realms they do now.
---
That's evil. Not as evil as bubbling and ressing someone with rank 1 ress while standing in lava though.
---
If you think the population 1 month in will be greater than the first week, you're absolutely delusional... will it continue to grow from 3 months in an forwards? Absolutely.
---
Congratulations! You’re the 5,000th post today about layering!
---
Can it give you bone spurs when you need em too?
---
No idea wtf you’re even talking about. Layering = sharding = will be heavily abused.
---
Okay thanks!
---
Still less than in 2004 Launch :)
---
Pick your battles
---
New Wave today? Kappa
---
Where is you info from? Pservers? How do you know ignite isn’t fixed? Puss off scrub
---
People will 100% complain about Orcs, undeads, engi and all the silly stuff the comes with Classic wow
---
Oh gosh I miss downranking spells to have a wee bit of fun. \\\^\_\\\^
---
What makes it even worse that WSG comes in phase 3, which means it might not even come until some time in 2020.
---
The dead server transfer were a rarity during vanilla but high pop transfers were common, not to mentions new servers being introduced.
---
The Vanilla + BC player base grew steadily over time and dead servers were pretty much a non issue, unlike the exodus of tourist will happen with classic.
---
I didn't include Darnassus, because, well, its darnassus.
---
Planning on making a hunter twink, thanks for this lol
---
Sorry for leaving that detail out then. That tailoring bonus is what makes them bis until late AQ
---
you dont only need a level 1 but thats easiest way atm since no one knows each other on test server. i also tested it with other levels in the same area as me /who elwynn (elwynn as horde) since the layers are not connected by chat you can ask them if they see ur message in general, if they cant then you found your layer jump. go pvp and wait for that invite, its incredibly easy. did this around 5 times during the stress test and couldnt be killed. as far as mobs and grinding go its even easier. complete joke of a system how it implemented now.
---
That’s basically what layering is achieving.
---
I think there's a minimum carb intake, as well.
---
Be fair, the 4,967th.
---
I need a filter that removes all posts with layering in the title.
---
*dead horse* beat beat beat
---
Sister?  I can't believe it!
---
Yep, horrible looks, great stats.. very vanilla.
---
Even so.
---
I tested in on stress test and it is the same
---
I don’t think that’s necessary. You can only change layers on group join right now, which is already super limited.  The stuff you saw in the stress test was just bugs.
---
Alliance has 2 cities people want to hang out in. The horde has no cities people want to hang out in.
---
Yes, they will be popular. They were unpopular in vanilla because they weren't good until later; but on private servers, people have realized how good they are and they're one of the most popular classes alongside warriors and mages.
---
They level quickly, are monsters in PvP, are very good gold farmers, and can top meters in PvE once you start hitting the later raids. Bloodvine set and geared tanks for higher threat do a lot of work for them. They have very few objective downsides once you get them geared, assuming you like the playstyle (which is subjective and up to each player).
---
You'll see 5+ warlocks in raids pretty consistently, but you'll only see 1-3 druids.
---
So true. When everyone has epics nobody has epics.
---
I always thought ironforge had the coolest aesthetic with a pretty convenient layout as well.
---
&gt;My point on this topic isn't really my opinion on which launch day strategy should be implemented, but a potential method that could be used to alleviate the starting zone crowding issue on launch day: Dynamic Population Limits.
---
This is something that has been confirmed. As people spread out they will be able to put more people into a single layer and will require fewer layers per server.
---
OMAR COME TO HORDE SIDE NEXT TIME! WE ALSO LOVE YOU!
---
I was also in a horde group looking for PVP in Elwynn before server shutdown, it was dead! We heard that streamers took everyone to STV so we ran that way and a hilarious corpserun ensued. I think some made it but not me - I ended dancing in the STV GY with some other Hordies.   
---
See you all next week! Hope we get to keep our toons. Anyone know if they've confirmed either way?
---
&gt;The items you get from quests and dungeons usually keeps you going no problem. The biggest hurdle that a lot of people struggle with is at level 40. You can buy your mount/training for mount and it costs a total of 100g (unless you play paladin or warlock). 100g
---
Remember no free mount for locks and pallies in phase 1
---
To be fair there are still few such quests in the Cata revamp zones.
---
In Aratis Highlands for example you have to take down 5 elite elementals one by one and these guys are strong. I died a few times and had to wait for a 5min CD at every attempt. Was playing Enh shaman and i doubt most dps classes will be more successful.
---
 (Was around lvl45 iirc ? For the folks who didn't play lately, all Azeroth scale with your level until lvl60, allowing you to complete the storylines without outleveling the zone)
---
I wouldn't mind seeing more of those though, this kind of outdoor dungeon is really great although it can be quite unrewarding sometimes.
---
Some mobs are hitting harder on the beta compared to one private server. I agree with that. I don't think that amounts to "leveling is significantly harder in the beta" AT ALL. You are always taking these logical leaps that make no sense.
---
Your opinion doesn't matter. I played original vanilla too, but not a whole lot.  Didn't hit 60. I was 13. Just being there for retail vanilla doesn't count for much at all when you can't form logical arguments. You think MS warriors out dps mages. You think healing paladins will spec ret just because the bad ones you played with did. All your arguments are arguments from your anecdotal experience rather than facts, like mine.  Good players knew how ignite worked in Vanilla. Good players knew you needed hit gear on your tanks. Hell, even blizzard knew this. Look at T2.5 and T3 hit on many pieces. You are a completely selfish player and have shown that a great number of times.
---
Even if you're orc. Without sl in early world pvp a rogue doesn't need stunlock to put it in your butthole
---
in my opinion
---
I’ve always played horde but stormwind seems fucking beautiful, while ironforge may seem beautiful as well it seems super confusing.
---
Soda loves druid mainly because of flag running but I've been watching more alliance guys so idk what he said recently
---
So good to see Snutz in the spotlight.
---
Drakedog would be smiling.
---
You're welcome :-)
---
most of his dps was auto shots because he was running out of mana trying to get stings applied with a huge miss chance.
---
We don't talk about Warlords, it was a dark time.
---
Remember that more than any other expansion, different classes bring individual perks to a raid
---
Pretty sure we were in the same raid!!
---
You sure do.
---
Herb is nice for lvling poisons too
---
Hey, top of Org bank is probably my most visited place in wow
---
Seriously. Ive basically stopped being as interested in this subreddit because of the sheer number of posts and nothing but handwringing, misinformation and doom calling.
---
Not sure, my server was about 60% alliance. I assumed classic would mean the same thing. It'd be a little disappointing to switch sides, but I don't want to be waiting in BG queues.
---
I do love some druid pvp. I used to run an heirloom druid through 10-40 and then reroll.
---
Gonna be real with you I don't think anyones done LFR since it was added and everyone has always hated it. It takes too long and its pointless idk why everyone thinks its a major part of retail wow.
---
This presents more problems than it solves.
---
At least, in Alliance, you can be a Pally. DPS is soooo strong! Kappa
---
he is terrible at the game but thats enough for low level dungeons. tanking raids isnt that easy but im sure his raid will carry him
---
Minus all the ways to abuse layering. Like layer hopping to avoid world pvp or collect mining nodes for example.
---
You should probably roll a dps class then. Or warrior. They might be the highest dps class with good gear and are the best tanks as well.
---
Hi, /u/tinkertailor0
---
The music when you first step into SW as well, is a special place in my heart
---
Just punish people who abuse the system. Layer hopping to get nodes? Do it once it’s fine, do it at every node or several times and you get a temporary ban, do it again get a longer ban. I would think anyone who is going to do this frequently would be detectable by some algorithm, and if you do it once in a blue moon, it’s not going to affect the economy enough to matter.
---
They had one fight before the 1v2 here are the vods from each PoV from the first fight. Keep watching after the 1v2 for the LUL.

I know. The point I was making by my last sentence was that it doesn't matter.

If you play horde you have to just settle for something.

Apologies in advance for your karma!

Going out and looking for a guild and friends in retail is like using tinder to find a girlfriend. You have to put effort into it and you never know who what kind of person you're going to get matched up with.

Finding friends in vanilla is like finding a girlfriend from being at a mutual friend's house. You didn't need to put in any extra effort and you know what you're getting yourself into.
---
Lmao what an utter dunce
---
I think it depends on 1. The popularity and 2. The amount of resources ultimately dedicated to Classic. 
---
The seasons would have to last a while though, leveling and progression can take a *long* time.
---
classic is the most accessible, most anticipated, most community-driven wow ever to be released, yes, when everybody who's anybody is going to be playing it their friends will join in and their friends will join in even if it's only the fortnite effect the only way for this game to crash and burn is if blizzard is planning to fail and doesn't provide enough server space
---
Problem is that by the later expansions, it wouldn't have made sense for the player characters to 'just be an adventurer.' The player character by that point has done way more heavy lifting when it comes to protecting Azeorth than any of the NPCs, so by Legion, it makes sense for them to be the biggest person in their class. In BFA, it was kind of jarring for the main characters to suddenly be ratcheted back to mere elite soldiers for the factions.
---
Having a bigger world with the player having a smaller impact does feel immersive and logical at the lower levels of Vanilla. However, come the later expansions, the player character *not* being treated as a legendary hero would have been more immersion breaking than thousands of people running around with Ashbringer.
---
Mark it as a bugg please
---
I had that poster beck then.. can‘t find anymore... feels bad man
---
Yea I knew I wanted to roll a dps, it’s between rogue and warrior right now. I’m thinking rogue because I feel like warrior is a more common class. But thank you for your help
---
Well anyone with half a brain will be playing on a PVE server anyway.
---
It’s not even that, it’s the fact that everyone and their brother needs to make posts about it.
---
Yes Asmongold can facetank 6 level 35 elites because of WW Axe... oh wait...
---
I had to do the captcha where you have to choose the images and that's just too much work for a poll. :(
---
Full authenticity is stupid and hard headed when it comes to things that change absolutely nothing with what is important which is the gameplay. Menus have 0 impact on anything important. You are only annoyed because you WANT them the old way, not because it really affects your gameplay.
---
You obviously don’t realize that all those “negative” things to you are deeply missed by older MMO players because it adds to the immersion and sense of reward.
---
Love this
---
If chat channels are layer specific how are you to communicate with your server for grouping purposes or anything else?
---
If anything chat channels should be realm specific so you can find people to group with or sell to. Also so you have the whole realm actually connected rather than just individual layers.
---
APES vs Soda's crew should be fun to watch
---
 No.
---
Watch Sodapoppin then. He's a fuckin beast
---
I don't think it ruined the game, and whilst I KNOW I would enjoy something like that in Classic, I still stand for #nochanges .
---
I look forward to TBC mainly because of arenas to be honest, since I don't see much fun in raiding at all
---
Get over it. It doesnt harm you. You have no reason to be so salty, other than jealousy.
---
If you dont know what you doing, you might not even have enough money to buy all skills while leveling. :P
---
Alliance have paladins. 
---
Choice made.
---
If I recall, when transfers were introduced you could go PvP to PvE, but not the other way around.
---
I likely will just try to get this set then! I love the way it looks haha.
---
I messed around earlier today. You still get full rep gains. Lvl 30 doing intro lvl troll quests as an undead I was getting the full org rep.
---
I pvp exclusively and rarely participate in Arena, So I doubt it.
---
How so? This means you will always see the same people and everyone on the realm.
---
&gt; Layering isn't the same as sharding
---
Right, it's just sharding wearing a mask. It's still the same tech, and it still causes the same problems even if they are less obvious  to players who are unaware of it. This is their way of rebranding sharding to trick people into thinking it's totally not sharding.
---
I work in tech support for a company and get to play most the day. I get about 15 4min calls in a day so I go AFK sometimes.
---
I reported it.
---
My comment was about raiding content, not this temporary max level 30 content.
---
Also stamina is a good (best) stat for tanks and lhh has exactly zero.
---
Welcome home friend.
---
There needs to be a flow chart. 
---
Was it in Vanilla? Yes? Then it’s allowed.
---
No? Then it has absolutely no place in the game.
---
Yes sorry xD
---
Shifting argument again. So I guess you admit that you trying to argue that MS warriors out dps mages was silly and wrong?  
---
How do I know ignite isn't fixed? Why would they make changes that came after vanilla ended?  Regardless, Nightfall exists. They can't "fix" Nightfall.  
---
But aren't you all about arguing based on Vanilla? Vanilla ignite worked as  I describe, 1 debuff for all mages and you still try to argue MS warrior is good. Come on man
---
Hi, /u/NewWorldAura
---
Also World chat isn't a default channel, so make sure you /join it when you log in the first time.
---
" Without transmog you visually express your progress and status. "
---
My counter argument to this..  MANY vastly differing qualities of gear and drops have the same appearance. For instance, the crafted mythril chain is the same as a vendor set of lvl 20 mail. I do concede that chase weapons are unique looking, but the BIS for the average caster is greens of + Healing/Frost Damage until phase 2. So you have no visual means, of seeing if this weird bag of skittles looking dork is worthless, or got a server first Rag kill 6 days after launch.  
---
" It makes everyone looks epic, even though you might have earned those looks. "
---
If the set gear was actually better then other stuff, I would say there is an agreement to the earned unification look. But, as a dude who has no intention on healing on my pally, the only set of gear that I want at launch is the Deathbone. Even that doesn't have Shoulders... and for what ever reason the coloration on the legs are way off compared to the chest. Its odd, and I really don't want to look like my cats barf but I accept what it is for classic.
---
It being burned was an inside job.
---
It's the same amount....
---
Arena did not ruin wow wpvp, flying did. Those who suggest that arena killed it didnt play all the way throughout TBC, as this was explicitly obvious to anyone who had eyes at the time. Halaa was basically DoA, 90% of the time after an hour of dropping bombs 1-2 people would fly by then just look at you cus they had worse armour and left. Most of the "wpvp" people experienced in TBC was a mage jumping off mid flight to cast fire blast on you to then cast slowfall to the ground over and over.
---
I feel like too many games tend to drift too far one way or the other.  Many will add seemingly complex mechanics to artificially get in the way, and provide superficial "difficulty".  Classic seems to just hit all the right marks without being too intrusive.
---
It isn't a difficult game, but it manages to hold your attention long enough while still providing good progression throughout the world.
---
When I play Horde, TB is where I usually go. But it’s no where near as cool as Ironforge, Horde needs to hire the Troggs or something so we can get a sweet mountain city.
---
Yeah, there's certainly an optimal way, but not a "correct" way.
---
More like lvl 35-37.  You can do SM Cath 37-40.
---
[Obligatory](https://youtu.be/qY9D15JD2yw)
---
I feel like the analogy can still hold up in RPG design outside of the aspect of difficulty. For example, a ton of people (myself included) played the Witcher 3 on easy difficulty and I feel like that game still is incredibly respectful of your time even when you are facerolling enemies. This is due to the quality writing and the elements of choice in the game. That being said, I also know there is a significant portion of that game's fanbase that advocates for only playing on the hardest difficulty. 
---
I personally feel like there are other aspects besides difficulty that make the time spent worthwhile. And if we are focusing strictly on RPGs, I would argue that storyline/writing and player agency are even more important than finding a satisfying challenge level. Those elements are what usually keep me engaged in a game.
---
When the discussion shifts to strictly look at MMORPGs, I feel like the importance of difficult does flip the other way for me. I do think MMORPG design is benefited from a steeper difficulty. This makes your accomplishments more satisfying and also (at least based on my memories of vanilla WOW) ends up promoting more social gameplay. The story and writing end up being of lesser importance to me compared to emergent gameplay and socializing. 
---
This may also just be influenced by how I interpret my role in the grander story of the games, too. In a single player game I often enjoy playing a role where I am all-powerful and the savior of the world. In an MMO, however, that seems silly. I should be a small part of something grander.
---
Arena didn't necessarily, but resilience and balance around 2's and 3's really kind of fucked the game up in different ways.
---
IF has the best layout, SW even has inferior layout to Darn imo but the location weighs it up.
---
Just wait til they do bc servers for arenas. And to answer your question no arenas didn’t ruin wow.
---
Stormlingx, Perplexity, Tribe, Monkeynews, OhhGee, Grandwizard. Pretty sure they all have beta access. 
---
Stormlingx will be the stream. 100%
---
Not just layering, I also see a bug.
---
And nowhere near as good as druids ;-)
---
Personally I enjoyed arena, and I felt a sense of satisfaction when I climbed through rating. Like I was definitely improving and my rating is reflecting that. 
---
Though I would not want this to be the main focus of pvp, I just like having an option that it’s there. I still enjoy bgs and world pvp
---
Darnassus! I love it. :( Such a pretty city.
---
&gt;And where are all the #nochanges people?
---
Still wanting layering to be removed. But since we know that's not going to happen, at least we can try to mitigate how bad it is.
---
Warrior may very well be common, but every group needs a tank or dps, so grouping as a warrior might be the easiest it of all. Some of the best naxx guild would bring at least 10 warriors as well, so there will be spots. But rogues are also nice. Try both and pick the style you want.
---
Of course, if you only want to dps, and never ever tank (why though? I think it's fun) then pick rogue. Warriors are expected to be able to tank when needed.
---
I think Darnassus would be a more popular hang-out spot if it were not so far out of the way. It does not feel as epic as the other two cities, but it has an aesthetic charm I enjoy.
---
Did someone say ***[That Item]***??!?!!?!
---
Not for me personally.
---
Serpent sting isn't worth the mana.
---
Naw
---
2004: World of Warcraft
---
2019: World of Cloakcraft
---
Well of course just removing the difficulties now will not change much for retail.. there is a list of things to be done to "fix" it and i doubt they are willing to do it or that it will be popular for current retail players.
---
Lets just be happy that we will bot have a version of game that we like, classic and retail players :)
---
The issue is that only memes and shit shows are all that anyone cares about that get any kind of notice. Even if speculative I'd like to have reasonable discussion about it. Maybe this subreddit isn't the place for reasonable discussion. Keep up voting shit memes.
---
Every raid besides aq40 will be cleared the week it's released.
---
Right, just didn’t know if certain npcs appeared or “quest boards” would be accessible
---
&gt;Most of the legitimate bugs I've seen are of technical nature (animation bugs, portraits spazzing, etc) related to the port-over of old code, rather than design-oriented bugs the likes of dynamic respawns and others.
---
Hunter pets are buggy, some Hunter abilities like Raptor Strike and autoshot are buggy, Rogue combo point mechanics are buggy... Basically anything that's implemented in code rather than purely in the database stands to have bugs. This is one such thing.
---
&gt;Why would they bother intentionally ripping out/disabling the already existing dynamic respawns from the modern server code if it was meant to be in Vanilla?
---
They wouldn't have to "rip it out". Chances are the code involved in that changed over the years, and whatever new dynamic spawn system they have doesn't work with the old data out of the box.
---
&gt;On top of that, this is also one of the "not a bug" things listed by Blizzard: **"Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth."** which could be construed to mean no dynamic respawning, though a clarification by Blizzard might be necessary so people stop complaining about it still.
---
They're obviously talking about respawn times in general, while this is a special case only affecting the starting sub-zones.
---
i manager a family flower shop. whenever there are no customers or things to manager at the shop, i would use to farm profession material on my orc warrior from a priv server
---
Interesting, always thought server transfers where a way to go to your friends server.
---
Sac the most broken thing at this level lol
---
What is this nonsense? Org is the best city in Vanilla without question
---
I don't know if specifically "ruined" it, but it did affect PvP in a significant negative way IMO:
---
1) You absolutely had to play arena if you wanted to stay competitive in PvP, otherwise you got gimped by resilience.
---
2) Blizzard pushed it as e-sports, meaning a lot of balance changes to classes revolved around arena performance.
---
3) It was all about being the FOTM class / build to get anywhere. Old school PvP allowed you to play fun builds and any class combo.
---
This is what I remember from TBC.
---
No. If arena papers wanted to world pvp they would world pvp
---
God damn that fight deserves respect
---
Best heist ever
---
Now THIS is good! I didn't think these kind of videos would make a return after the "Vanilla era" but holy shit was I wrong, it can work and it DOES work!
---
*Well I sure am glad that not a single person here is claiming classic raids are harder.*
---
It definitely matters because one option is fixed and one is variable.
---
Good question. I was thinking BC made you sit in org/SW while queuing for arena, but in classic i thought you had to travel to the instance area.
---
These are going to be the only classic WSG matches in 2019, so it’s definitely hype!
---
There’s literally hundreds of posts in the last day wanting “reasonable discussion” about it. Why make a new thread?
---
True
---
It better not come before 2020. I can't imagine being in Phase 3 after only 4 months.
---
Im looking to play a class that will be a contender for highest dps in endgame raiding, and viable in PVP. Choosing between lock and rogue.
---
no one plays ret
---
sorry :D
---
Monkeynews and any &lt;apes&gt; games. They are alliance though. Stormlingx/stormx is a horde Druid though I imagine he will be clowning people.
---
Well it's not really twink if they do it at 30 since that's the max level.
---
whats the significance of gurubashi arena again?
---
Well yes at their own certain time. Rather than hunting for kills and their prey, they could just queu up
---
Very insightful
---
What you probably don't get is that there is this belief here that hunters are shit DPS in raids hence why they don't believe you.
---
I have no idea where the truth lie. My hunter was a farming alt in Vanilla and he never saw a raid so I can't say.
---
You wouldn’t be able to access them until you were in the quest level range anyway. Maybe if they raise the cap, we’ll find out.
---
Rogue was more common that warrior when I played launch-2007... easily.  Good luck finding groups if you're not leading them, you'll get a lot of "full on DPS, do you have a healer?"
---
I feel like a lot of these points are going to be moot this time around. Things like everyone using different items. Yea that’s not happening. Everybody now has things like a pre raid bis list and every single person knows it.you will see a hell of a lot more conformity this around around regarding gear and specs. Also about the community, 2019 is a different time than 2004. The community will not be the same as it as sin 2004 for several reasons. One is because a huge portion of the player base already knows the game and where to go, do, etc. that feeling of wonder and exploration is dead and gone for a huge portion of the population. All that being said I’ll definitely still be playing,
---
This was not the person with the statement that entire guilds got banned for what a few members did fyi
---
You're high if you think any of the vanilla raids are even close to LFR difficulty.  
---
It's much closer to normal difficulty than LFR, which is worlds apart.
---
I'm not sure a Classic WoW fan is the same type of player interested in "seasonal reset" type of content.
---
Also, this is a preservation project, not a "Let's re-do WoW" thingy where new content gets added o\_o
---
i wonder if they have fixed any exploits people did (one thing i kinda hope they change) i also wonder whats gonna be the longest WSG in Beta they can last hours
---
Over in the Heroes of the Storm subreddit, whenever Anub'arak is mentioned in a post title it automatically gets a "bug" flair
---
That's better, but people will be 60 by 2 weeks. There's no point in layering the 30+ zones IMO.
---
I'm not going to talk you through your blog post explaining exactly how you're fundamentally wrong.
---
You get full rep. from grey quest in Beta. Just tested.
---
&gt;quest boards
---
Came way after Classic.
---
That is completely debatable. Having just stamina is certainly not great either. Effective HP comes into play. Having 0 hit and just stamina would be absolutely terrible for nearly every encounter and situation in this game. 
---
You really need a balance of stats. You need enough tankiness to not die and your healers to be able to last with mana. Then you need as much threat as you can to maximize dps. LH Helm is very strong early, and you can easily balance out the lack of mitigation stats by wearing more tanky stats elsewhere. Since LH gives 2 hit, that is a third of the hit you need to cap as a human/orc 1 handing. Without LH Helm, you have to wear 2 subpar hit pieces to get the same threat early on. The tradeoff of 2 mitigation pieces just makes LH Helm so value. Everyone knows this. Its not up for debate.
---
This one was hard. On one hand I can see the idea of server wide chats being desirable, but my opinion mostly has to do with keeping the volume of chat traffic at reasonable rates. If the layers have vanilla like population, then layer specific chats would have vanilla like amounts of traffic which would mean vanilla like group formation and vanilla like professions ads/trades.
---
well, lets hope its jsut bugged
---
WOW! I hated the basilisk in desolace. This is insane. Thanks OP
---
So is it Dead on Arrival or will it be dead at some point in Phase 2?
---
Oh wait, never mind, the idea of a dead server is a boring private server Community affectation that boils down to a player feeling alone or unsatisfied.
---
&gt;Sad truth is that vanilla raiding content is probably ~~as hard~~ as LFR these days 
---
Easier.
---
Needed more game sound effects overlayed at super high volume
---
My point my have been over illustrated, but the fact remains, "Retail is easy" is a constant meme...its the subject of your post. 
---
Classic certainly has harder aspects--like time investment, or the entirety of the leveling experience--but come on, not even LFR raiders celebrate clearing LFR.
---
If classic goes live with NO layering. 
---
It will also be dead because no one will be able to log in.
---
They spawned Hogger and Rag afaik on Horde side as well
---
&gt; I want Wrath and a major turnaround in retail's design choices.
---
##LOL, pick one.
---
Yes, that's why I said "if it get traction". I'm sure that if there is enough playerbase they would invest in it.
---
That’s what I meant by ruin. The effects of arena (is balance, queuing, mmr, gear, composition, etc.) 
---
At least that’s what I took from the guys comment
---
You're right, I'm sorry.
---
Nice job reporting something you have no idea if is accurate or not.  From everything I know about vanilla this would work, at least it did with real players instead of NPC's so it probably works the same.   I did same thing in vanilla retail with actual players instead of NPC's so your cata baby brain is probably incorrect.  Don't report bugs if you don't have a clue about vanilla.
---
Layering or not, I am sure they will fix stuff during the betas. I don't expect new stuff to work straightaway.
---
I always like to be the Thorium Brotherhood Rep Tailor, when I first started vanilla that was the first server I chose because a friend was already on it and invited me to play with him. I wound up outpacing his lvling on (me) Alli v (him) Horde and beating him in a duel when we were close to the same lvl and he got so upset he quit. I had other friends who had started playing at that point and started anew on a different server, but i'll always remember being on TB and hold a special place for their faction in my heart.
---
Your argument about the economy is fundamentally wrong. If there is enough people to create 4 layers, there will be 4 times the resources but also 4 times the amount of players. If you use this exploit to farm, you will take the resources from another layer. The thing is, even if you did not do so, they would have been most likely picked up by someone else native to that particular layer.
---
??? What does this have to do with anything Iw as pointing out his comment was a bad response not that I wouldnt sub to the product. Curious as to thoughts of there being a sub. But thanks for adding 0 to the conversation
---
So fucking be it then. That's how it was back in the day on launch day. Just take your hands off it, eventually the server will stabilize by themselves.
---
I dont understand why layering idea isnt scrapped yet. Just put 5-6k cap on realm and brace yourselves for few days of shitstorm on launch and its smooth from there just like private servers launches.
---
Just ask sylvanas for a favor :)
---
Is it really 2v1 if one of the players thinks the starting gear with no stats is a bug and instantly bubbling the first fear? I'd say more of a 1.5 v 1 and that's being generous.
---
It would be like soloing a raid instance and a pally bubbling. The encounter would read "no target found" and stop the adds. Then, when the DI is over, Razergore could go ahead and break the eggs without the spawns.
---
You and I guess other people are completely missing the point and probably didn't saw the blizzcon panel.  
---
  In using both clients mashed together, the zones resulted in a mix of both clients, for example, in the panels we see twilight highlands, we see the dam with water being held back but it's also destroyed, elwynn forest lights have no texture, wrong things everywhere, etc.   
---
  The map is a mess.   
---
  However, hyjal, which cannot be accessed, seems to be fine, suggesting they fixed it just like they had to fix other zones.   
---
  Which means they could possibly be already thinking of using this zone considering they went through the trouble of fixing it, even if people won't see it.
---
Mindcontrol is so fun :)
---
Yeah that’s so true! I didn’t think of flying making that big of an impact but it does. Especially flying through all of the content.
---
I thought it didn't, but now I think it did. It added to the fact that each class is more similar than different right now.
---
It has no place in vanilla, it would do more harm than good because it would take a bite from the world. 
---
Fewer instances - livelier world.
---
So you dont want to be able to do dungeons back to back because you're stuck in the wrong layer?
---
is that a retail thing or do you mean like wanted posters in towns?
---
I too thought that reputation would decay, and have based an entire quest completionist guide around it, but I’m here now to report some results that may indicate otherwise.
---
As soon as I got into the Beta, I immediately started playing through every single Alliance quest (as a human with the 10% rep bonus) at the appropriate level, and here are the results for E(xp)erience, Stormwind (SW) rep and (Sp)illover rep for some low level quests:
---
1 &lt;- My level at quest turn-in
---
[1] A Threat Within 40xp, 55SW
---
[2] Eagan Peltskinner 85xp, 55SW
---
2
---
[2] Wolves Across the Border 170xp, 110SW
---
[2] Kobold Camp Cleanup 170xp, 110SW
---
5
---
[2] Wine Shop Advert 130xp, 82SW, 21Sp
---
[2] Harlan Needs a Resupply  85xp, 55SW, 13Sp
---
[2] Package for Thurman 130xp, 83SW, 20Sp
---
Now, here are my preliminary results for those same quests on another human turned in at higher levels. Quests with no values next to them were simply noted for their color (green/gray) but were not turned in until later.
---
6
---
[1] A Threat Within Gray 40xp, 55SW
---
[2] Eagan Peltskinner Green 
---
[2] Kobold Camp Cleanup Green
---
7
---
[2] Eagan Peltskinner Gray 85xp, 55SW
---
[2] Kobold Camp Cleanup Gray
---
[2] Wolves Across the Border Gray
---
[2] Wine Shop Advert Gray
---
[2] Harlan Needs a Resupply Gray 85xp, 55SW, 13Sp
---
[2] Package for Thurman Gray
---
8
---
[2] Wolves Across the Border Gray 140xp, 110SW
---
[2] Wine Shop Advert Gray 100xp, 83SW, 21Sp
---
As you can tell, quests that go from green one level to gray another level (5 levels above the quest level) receive full rep and experience. However, once you go 6 levels above the quest level, the experience value starts to go down but the rep levels (both SW and Sp) appear to stay the same. Wine Shop Advert actually goes up 1 point of SW rep, which might be a note taking error on my part or a rounding anomaly. Once I reach level 9, I’ll report back with the results from those remaining level 2 quests.
---
Unfortunately, I don’t have a level 30 character yet, and my highest level character is currently level 16, having completed every single quest up through level 11/12 quests, so I have no lower level quests I can check.
---
Yeah you’re correct, I was looking at q1 2005 numbers to favor a higher number.
---
Working as intended. Sprit Tap always worked that way.
---
Ironforge for pre-flying, Stormwind Post flying
---
The key issue is that without some sort of a solution the game would not be playable and/or servers will be unbalanced. That ruins the experience for a major part of the community. 
---
Whatever solution they would have come up with, people like you would have cried about it. Ruining the experience for a minor part of the community. 
---
I don’t feel bad for you and those, because your petty behavior made you a) ruin it for yourselves and b) ungrateful and undeserving for and of classic. /r
---
I have been posting in them, and most of them get down voted into oblivion in favor of memes/controversy. I took a few of my comments and others' discussions that people seemed to like and consolidated them here.
---
there are actually people who say this is a bug layers aren't supposed to work this way
---
this is exactly how layers are supposed to work
---
Yeah. She doesn't like how they changed a lot of stuff. She isn't used to the new skill rotations compared to back then. Shes never had too much manual dexterity, so hotkeys were never her forte to begin with. Every action she had was manually clicked by mouse.
---
As you can imagine, she wasn't popular in the raiding scene. Pvp however, she could do just fine.
---
I wish I had played in MoP. I keep hearing class design was amazing and I love the eastern philosophies that were introduced to the game.
---
Woulda been fun to play a monk tank in the brewery dungeon...
---
So basically what you're saying is that Naxx 40 is on par or easier than content where half of the raid can literally try to sabotage it, and still win?
---
Too bad hes Horde and will be hit with Paladin seal of Justice
---
are you dumb? lol
---
Man look at us how cool we are 😎and how pathetic retail babies are lmao 🤣👌 
---
Any updoots fellow boomers
---
The ones with the elite quests in hinterlands... not the retail ones...
---
1. Unless you're ahead of every other mage, you probably won't be AoE leveling uncontested. All of the AoE spots are known and documented. Mages are decent levelers even without it, but not even comparable to something like a hunter if being forced to single target killing.
---
2. Is Dire Maul going to be released at launch? You won't have your level 55 water until it is.
---
3. See #2 for farming Dire Maul for the fire protection potion mats.
---
I'd almost agree with this, if I wanted to play on a dead server.
---
I mean having rares up anytime I go look for them is really nice, but really might as well play a sandbox game at that point.
---
They have absolutely said layering is only and will ever only be used for the 1st few weeks of launch, you are the one too retarded to even watch a single interview about classic wow. Now get out retail scrub.
---
Yup, classic will be dead guys. This guy called it so it must be true!
---
It’s literally a beta and shit will be fixed. This is the purpose of the beta.
---
Layering is needed for a seamless experience. If you can’t see that, then you’re just retarded as everyone else up in arms of layering. No one wants to fight in the starter zones against thousands of people. It will be removed and be fixed.
---
We found out after a few months into TBC that our hunters had gotten together and decided not to kite the mobs they were supposed to around the room, and instead dps mobs down. The sole reason our guild never made it past Razorgore.
---
The key element missing is scarcity of look and the quality of its appearance imo. Nothing in the last few expansions feels as amazing as week after week saving up that dkp until chromaggus finally drops your last piece of t2 and you have that full set.
---
I always felt shamans where mana efficient enuf but I might be wrong, whit clearly defined healing targets I never had a problem, sure I used alot of pots/glyfs but it might just be me. Having the highest number on healing done was never a goal of mine I always strived for lowest posible overheating. I'd only bring one resto druid because of the lack of raidbuffs. You want one for hots on tanks and you want a feral for fairy fire 2 inervate might not be the best you can get but I'll trade if for tranquil air and tide in caster groups.
---
Let's be honest.  Most people, myself included sometimes, don't watch streams to see skillful ONLY people.  The most successful streams are lead by personalities.  Dr. Disrespect, Tyler1 types etc.
---
Well if you want to be a paladin you have to be alliance. Choice made.
---
Also the horde suck sooooo.
---
The character progression that it provides is so huge. It provides such sense of satisfaction when you finally replace that goofy piece of gear. 
---
Also that feeling of seeing someone rocking full T2 and Thunderfury, you immediately know the effort that went in to getting that. It would always motivate me to become better and be the one wearing that. 
---
I don’t transmog but I understand the appeal of it and that’s what a lot of people enjoy in WoW. Unfortunately, I don’t know if there is a solution that would combine the best of both worlds
---
That's correct. I think sometime in wrath or cata was when they lifted that restriction. It killed my server basically.
---
This. Lol Sodapoppin has for sure embraced classic, but he still doesn't hold a candle to the company on that list.
---
Hi, /u/Elukka420
---
So on the beta, layers still have shard zones like that 
---
But layers have the added negative effect of being farmable and exploitable
---
This is exactly what I had in mind when it dawned on me we'd get new PvP montages of vanilla content. I love this shit. It's like I'm back in high school again.
---
Not everyone is crossing days off on their calendar waiting for Classic release. Only the hardcore nerds are. Classic, if it's good, will draw in new players for weeks after release.
---
Personnaly, no. 
---
I like to have a feeling of being more powerfull, more rich etc. This is the problem for me in retail WoW, it feel like a season grind and need to start all over gain with a new big pacth/xpac.
---
Where is the preview?
---
Some of this is accurate, but remember just because it's patch 1.12 doesn't make it early 2006 again... most classic players will have some (or major) WoW experience, and then you'll have folks in a 40 person raid that are windowed, and distracted watching Netflix on their second monitor...
---
I’d never say my actual name on reddit either. Anon is a good way of keeping it hidden imo.
---
I hope so too but it's not really new stuff, it's sharding the region rather than a zone.
---
In all honesty they should lock people to a layer since they are mini servers within a server. 
---
What is the benefit of being able to switch layers... to avoid queues... if there are people farming and switching layers (which there will be without a doubt) then lock us to a layer for a 24 hr period and if thay layer is full put us in a queue.
---
Honestly, they don't even have to outtag you.  
---
  You are nothing.  
---
  That's how it is, even if you outtag them sometimes they will still have 50 times the leather you can get.  
---
  If you put it on the auction house they can just snag it back and put it back at their price and keep controlling it.  
---
  You simply won't put in the same time and effort and coordination they have to control the market, so you won't even be a little dip in their plan.
---
The problem is in all blizzard discussion they’ve mentioned having like 3-5 layers per server
---
Having that few layers isn’t gonna help much when 15000 people descend into a server
---
So either layering has sharding built into it, or they intend to have far more layers
---
Launch day had 100,000 at peak throughout the day, across something like 90 servers.
---
Hey I've got *great* news for you buddy:
---
Layering is going to be in the game.
---
You can go ahead and unsubscribe from the subreddit and re-plan your summer, you won't have to play! A real burden off your mind.
---
That is the point of the system. A report is basically telling Blizzard, "Hey this seems off please check it." You don't have to know 100% without a doubt if its wrong or not.
---
Yeah the horde didn’t get shit during the shutdown because horde suck. Reroll.
---
They said start of phase 2 at the latest, which means start of phase 2. And even that might not be true. Blizzard has gone back on their word plenty of times
---
I don't know what to make of this very vague sentence.
---
I've never played Alliance and I'm excited to read all the quests as well.
---
Neat! Hopefully they surprise us with something really cool!
---
Arenas are fun but they definitely ruined the PvP community.
---
Some form of seasons is one of the first ideas I talked about with friends after the announcement. Like in diablo the seasonal toons could be tossed to a static server after the season and the rewards could be very miniscule. This ofc brings the problem of server community. The community could be built on the server by just having the same server progress through the seasons and resets (name locking?)
---
A season could be a server cycle or parts of it and wouldnt really need to bring anything new (items). Maybe just make a list on the site about top 100 fastests levellers, clear times (dungeons and raids) and things like that.
---
So CRZ is another thing still remaining. This dev team really a lot of work on their plate.
---
I manage IT, if you get your tickets done and you're working at home, I'll likely never know... that being said, my team only works from home 1 day per week.
---
It always made me sad in wotlk when I started that nobody ever used UC. Hopefully this time around I can make that my spot.
---
Not to mention he said phase 2... When we won't even have layering by then.
---
The system that is being suggested to have existed back then is *not* dynamic spawns. Dynamic spawns affects every mob spawn in the game and speeds up/slows down the respawn rate dynamically in an area around players. What Mark Kern is suggested is a system that only applies to the starting zone, and rather than being in any way dynamic just sounds like it's merely a trigger. Instead of saying something like "increase spawn rate by 20% for every player nearby", it's something like "if there's less than X mobs, spawn a new one".
---
I don't know if it did or didn't exist, but this sounds like they just slapped a makeshift solution onto the starter zones. It doesn't sound like a proper system like dynamic spawns. Some shoddy solution pasted over a certain area of the game is something that I can more easily imagine that they'd have forgotten about or simply failed to spot in the first place.
---
3 at max. Wouldn't be surprised at 2. UNLESS private servers really were that undertuned for raids... but everything else looks like they were overtuned so far...
---
Area was a great addition to wow. LFG, flying mount, phasing, mob sharing, gear normalization and lower difficulty were some of the bigger issues.
---
Neat! I'm in that picture. Had just finished a hogger raid when all of a sudden horde everywhere!
---
Yep in the beta it doesn't seem to decay, which is a bug/change from vanilla
---
There is no world pvp now
---
i feel like there will be more of these videos now more than ever. the fact that so many of these streamers will be streaming all their content, someone can just make them a video
---
Hopefully not i til very late 2020 or eaely 2021
---
Now I’m just sad that they went with buffed itemization and 1.12 talents without buffing pve content to make the EXPERIENCE Blizzlike. 
---
Classic is gonna be looking for raid level ez 🙁
---
Faces will be melted.
---
Which leaves people not able to raid up until the point they finally get frustrated enough by the dying population to transfer and then they have to pay for it or blizz gives it free ? Either way ; once they do transfer now they have to make all new connections. Find new groups to raid etc with . In classic so much is based off your social interaction and the name you build for yourself rather it’s PVP or PVE . Let’s say blizzard transfers you free after a point (probably weeks at minimum of you not being able to play how you would on a populated server ) , how many more weeks until you meet a decent guild to raid with on the new server ? It would be months long process between your server dying , transferring and building a reputation on the new server .
---
"Is it unrealistic to hope to pull big dps numbers in raids even as a thinked out spriest?"
---
If youre much more prepared than the rest, no, you might be visible in the top somewhere. But are you willing to take 8 hours to prepare for consumables each week just for the raid?
---
Another thing, most guilds won't have more than 1 shadow priest, so you might have a hard time finding a spot.
---
The reason the bosses go down is because people don't play shit specs mate.
---
The game changed all the time, with each expansion, and which changes were more or less impactful to the game our Justice subjective as what qualifies as ruining the game.
---
But no, Arenas did not ruin wow.
---
Only in the first phase then after that they're removing it at least thats what I heard
---
That’s very much a bug.
---
I honestly find it more efficient to turn the 180 than to do any sort of back peddling.
---
1) you stated that beta testing/presence of bugs is how we get to retail. But then state the problem with retail is the systems.  
---
2) layering = sharding. No, they were pretty explicit about how layering is intended to work. Are there bugs? Sure. Does a beta 3 months before give them the ability to see and fix those bugs? Absolutely. Additionally, layering has been stated to not exist past phase 1 (if it even lasts that long).
---
They are decent, but they lack the spirit regen of priests, which really is significant.
---
Probably won't be an issue on Classic. It was a huge problem on private realms due to the nature of how they were set up. Massive population on oftentimes a single server. That won't be the case here.
---
Important enough to skip the bullshit professions and be a double gatherer, I usually did herbalism and mining.  I may not always skin a beast, but humanoids drop cloth and picking flowers/rocks is available in most any place.
---
This 1000x
---
You do need it to activate the set bonus, and so not having it as a serious raider is leaving free stats on the table.
---
&gt;  most anticipated, 
---
And that right there is the problem.... at lot of people who wont stay for 2 months are very much looking forward to classic.
---
Comparing it to Fortnite is the most rediculous thing, I've ever heard, lets take a lot at some of the key differences that impact the growth curve.
---
Fortnite came out of nowhere, classic has been hyped up for nearly 2 years
---
Fortnite was a brand new genre while wow is known.
---
Fortnite is f2p, wow is sub based.
---
Does conflag feature in this spec, love the spell..
---
&gt; I personally feel like there are other aspects besides difficulty that make the time spent worthwhile. 
---
None of this is about *difficulty*, strictly speaking. I know "Dark Souls = Difficulty", but that's not the tack he's going on at all.
---
Let's go back to what he's saying:
---
&gt; Because if you're engaged, and challenged, and accomplishing - [the game] is not wasting your time.
---
Challenge can also be trying to find the items to progress a quest - let's take the example of the Ruins of Mathysra in Darkshore. I watched a streamer miss quest progression stones repeatedly. He finally figured it out and bitched about how long it took.
---
I simply posed the question in his stream "But will you forget that quest? Or the next time someone asks in General about the final marker for that quest will you rememberr *exactly* what he's talking about?"
---
Challenge did have to do with beating the (rather difficult) mobs and juggling that with looking for stones. But it wasn't just enemy difficulty. But it did create a very memorable experience.
---
yes and the 2-3 people doing 150 DPS less is going to change the outcome of the raid , i raid and play on private servers, it doesnt matter. lol. You're not wiping because of a few meme specs
---
And you simply did not play classic.  
---
Private servers numbers were way off, and classic semi casual guilds didn't care what spec you were. Filling 40 people with specific specs was really tough to do.
---
Same but its tied in with a worry they will eventually raise cap till 60 and I personally don't think that's a good idea
---
IT was a bullshit comment, if he actually had a game history as a hardcore raider throughout the different expansions as he said he did, then he would know without being told what the what the needed hours commitment would be. As it has never changed, just gone from raid prep to more time in dungeon.
---
Post talks about live and let live let people enjoy the game how they want... Comments mirror trade chat.
---
This loot lag is visible for streamers on the closed beta, too. It's quite longer than pservers. I'm curious if it's blizzlike behavior or is it lagging extra long due to spellbatching.
---
Erik wasn't there to protect Quin PepeHands
---
Well, interestingly enough, another user just said the exact opposite "end game content is clear a week after it's released". Of course it's bullshit.
---
I remember that levelling was quite a big part of the game and that's why I left an **X** in the amount of months.
---
I was playing back then and ended up raiding in a guild that, for the time, was between the ones considered hardcore for the server. I think it took more or less 9 months but I definitely couldn't play every day either when levelling, nor while raiding.
---
About PvP I wasnàt very much into it (PvE guild) but wasn't it subject to seasons already back then? Or maybe I'm getting confused and it was just a constant grinding to be in the top of the ladder (I think I reached only knight-seargent or something like that?).
---
Wouldn't it be better if there was a "closing" instead of an endless grind in which new players just find themselves struggling against a formed "elite" players?
---
Private servers are elitists.  They are only a small percentage on live compared to the casuals or nee players that will play for the first time.
---
Raiding? WTF are you talking about. Servers would be consolidated after 1.5-2 months. I don't give a fuck if the no life NEET autist goblins are inconvenienced a little, they'll bounce right back. Extra servers at launch and a consolidation of them shortly thereafter is much better than layering for most people.
---
This just in: Man invents imaginary scenario and plunges into fit of public rage on video game subreddit, causing his peers to question their sanity, more at 11
---
Except i did.... and ive killed KT in vanilla when it was actually hard. and private server numbers for raid bosses arent "way off" lol
---
Me too :(
---
lol would rather the game be unplayable.. don't let the door hit you on your way out princess
---
Fuck your WoD models, no fucking changes.
---
Horde because I play rogue
---
&gt;From everything I know about vanilla this would work, at least it did with real players instead of NPC's so it probably works the same. I did same thing in vanilla retail with actual players instead of NPC's. Don't report bugs if you don't have a clue about vanilla. 
---
................................
---
&gt;probably works the same  
---
&gt;Don't report bugs if you don't have a clue about vanilla. 
---
Excuse me? An yeah its always worked for player tagging, never recall this ever working for Npcs maybe very early on but this would have been exploited to shit back in the day.
---
I participated in the beta and the stress test and I did not see any shards. If they were there then its not intended.
---
I think they're saying that the 1.9 is actually 1.09 and blizzard just did it like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12 .
---
Yeah, you're right unfortunately.  C'est la vie, I suppose.
---
Good luck and be well :)
---
I'm fine with it, I'll play regardless and so will a lot of others. If a bunch of toxic private server players don't want to play it we'll all be better off.
---
I played hunter a bit in my time and I certainly can’t wait for the competition for rare hunting again. Having a rare spawn as a pet, especially with a unique skin, is a great feeling.
---
That would make it "Ten Minute Breath". It just doesen't have the same ring to it.
---
true
---
Server merges aren't as open to abuse as sharding.
---
Private servers overtune the raids.
---
Was ML a thing in vanilla?
---
I wonder if this is some how a ploy to adjust respawn rates while playing dumb. Gotta make sure they can get a half million casual subs for a month.
---
You don’t care if another group of paying players is “inconvenienced” as long as things work in your favor . Got it .
---
Thank you everyone for the feee back &lt;3
---
&gt; this is a preservation project
---
IMO we should all be very clear about this. This is NOT a preservation project. This is a make-more-money-for-Blizzard project. Nothing more. nothing less.
---
I dont think you understand how much people like classic wow. 
---
People aren't going to quit because they have layering or because they are having trouble getting quests done. 
---
People have legit been wating years for this game. 
---
I have been holding onto vacation time for 2 years now so that I can nerd out for weeks straight when it releases. 
---
I spent 45 minutes last night trying to get the 1st quest done in the undead starting zone because of how many people where trying to kill the same mobs. 
---
I enjoyed every minute of it. 
---
People love classic wow. If you quit classic wow because they use layering for the first 2 weeks at launch better for the rest of us.
---
Rofl. Sounds about right. "Nuh uh! You're wrong!"
---
"Oh, how?"
---
"I'm not going to waste my time actually explaining myself! You're wrong!"
---
My "blog post" is 6 sentences. You're right. Too much thought for you to handle probably.
---
In the clip the nameplates are working as intended but digging through some comments and such a beta tester pointed out the script and used it in the beta, thus altering the rules of Vanilla nameplate mechanics. 
---
Just trying to shed some light on something like this.
---
Had no idea, poor pallies lol
---
Have they mentioned anything about an open beta? I'd be surprised if there isn't an open beta in July that lasts for a month or so.
---
There's a little hyperbole in his statement as raids got harder towards the release of BC, but they're definitely nit anything I would call difficult.
---
Utilitarianism.
---
And most of the time it didn't work as people didn't want to leave a good realm to a bad one. It was only if the high pop realm was in very bad shape because of it that meaningful amount of people would transfer to the low pop one. Also something that happened very often is the exodus of one faction where one low pop and high pop realm turn into two medium pop ones with one having most players being Alliance and the other Horde.
---
The term "gatekeeping" needs to fuck off. New flavor of the month word huh?
---
We said no changes, we want vanilla. Vanilla did not have sharding.
---
For the majority of all vanilla raids, yes. Your rotation is now head-to-keyboard levels of simple. The fight mechanics will be the easiest they have ever been in the game, ever. Half of raid teams who had no idea wtf was going in Vanilla would regularly get pulled through raids from a group of people who did, pretty similar to LFR now. Times have changed.
---
This sub is full of elitists and very few of them actually play Pservers.
---
there
---
Locks are fun in PvP when they get a lot of gear, but without death coil up rogues and warriors will be a huge problem especially if you are alliance. They have a pet for every situation but the odds of having the right pet out all the time is low. When you solo you’ll have VW put weaker against casters, in PvP you have fel hunter out weaker against melee. 
---
For pve you are a support class. Your damage is not good. You are brought for curses, summons, soul stones and health stones. Your damage is mediocre, takes too many debuff slots and is too threaty. If you plan on primarily pvping locks are great. If you want to focus more on pve go mage
---
Raids are a lot harder on Pservers.
---
can we get this posted on warcraftmovies.com
---
Fine, then enjoy Classic WoW. But I hope you enjoy the inevitable side effect that people will have 1000s of gold as well.
---
The values are off on private servers. But so far, classic mobs has less HP and less dmg than private servers.
---
Some private servers even tuned the bosses harder.
---
Ofc, silly me. Brain fart.
---
After I reach level 9 to verify those last two quests, I’ll head over to Dun Morogh and Teldrassil to confirm the same results on quests for those other factions (just in case the lack of decay is somehow faction specific).
---
This. Besides the closest blizzard game that currently uses seasons would be Diablo 3, but that is already not applicable because Diablos seasonal progress gets transferred to the normal account at the end, something classic Warcraft would have no way of doing. There's no mechanism in place for that.
---
Perhaps, Perhaps at the end of classic when they start servers on burning Crusade, maybe they will open a few new servers with classic. But I really think they would wait at least until the end of Wrath to Open classic servers again, the private server player mindset of jumping to every fresh classic server when it opens is not something that can be reliably transposed onto a blizzard classic server. Very few private servers, even ones claiming to be Progressive, will not have the lure of staying power that a blizzard Progressive server will have. We know it is going to be around forever. We know it is going to progress without a doubt. And we know the population will always be healthy.
---
Well, you just made it obvious you've never seen an expansion, launch, or new server on an MMO... People go ape shit for those.
---
&gt;Classic, if it's good, will draw in new players for weeks after release
---
Yeah and what would you call 6 hr que times? Think that's going to attract a bunch of new players?
---
Oh but layering is way worse... which is why BFA is *still* ongoing when they've had sharding for years now. Somehow I doubt it'll be DOA.
---
World PvP, is kind of a big topic.
---
Because sometimes your talking about stalking your prey for an hour or more just to catch them weak enough to kill off out of spite, Sometimes your talking about following around some ganker and rezz camping any healer willing to group with them, sometimes your talking about coming around the corner and suddenly come face to face with a surprised enemy, and sometimes your talking about you and 40 of your best friends running around killing anyone you can find.
---
Arena's help raise the pvp skill floor, because so much was discussed about missed oppurtunites and what could have been done.  However it was "artificial",  Certain classes really rocked out in world pvp, where they could kite for as long as it took, could move the fight to more favorable terrain,  and were artificially constrained by the arena environment.
---
Just like battle grounds, it offered another (more controlled) version of pvp, but it never killed off world pvp.
---
Resto druid or resto shaman are your best bets.
---
I thought it added a lot of skill to the PVP scene. At the same time it also made people roll the FOTM class that was overpowered at the time. If I remember correctly S1-S3 was all about SL/SL locks and druids dominating the Arena scene. 
---
As far as it impacting WPVP I don't think it did that at all. I still fought the alliance for control over Central Nagrand in TBC. That was way better than getting ganked 100 times trying to fight boars lol.
---
That being said (&lt;/Ion&gt;), Mark Kern isn't exactly known for having great judgement.
---
Yea you’ll still clear the content if people carry you. Doesn’t mean people want to do that though
---
It's a "donation" that someone is profiting from, as income. It's really more like a tip. 
---
Donations is money giving to charities that use the money to put back into a community to service them. The money streamers get from "donators" aren't being used to fund a public service or anything like that. They're using it as income, like you would from your regular job.
---
No, brain glitch. I forgot those.
---
Windfury totem ftw.
---
its not your game. its the game for you. 
---
Hybrids have never been a thing. Characters--played by players with any sense--suffered the hybrid tax despite being specialized for a particular role. Blizzard may have intended the paladin to be swinging a hammer on rag and throwing the odd heal--but no one did that. They specced holy or ret and healed or damaged. 
---
As a shadowpriest, I actually kept Renew, Shield and POM until WoD. So if your definition of a hybrid is capable of fullfilling multiple roles, I most certainly was, assuming the tank and I worked together and the lack of a healer meant additional dps. 
---
Ill even give you that Im not a big fan of turning it from a class based to a spec based way of designing the game. But thats not the talents. Youre angry at the wrong system. The talent system as implemented has functionality with the spec system, but could be easilly retooled to serve as general talents for the entire class--we could even return the glyph system for another layer of "talents".
---
The idea that every character needs to fulfill a specific role be it tanking, ranged dps, melee dps, or heals is what youre angry at.
---
Apart from the entire hunter class and its pet ? That’s broken
---
I think a lot of people are just done hoping BfA will get good at any point. Especially with no class changes coming before 9.0.
---
There were 6hr queues during vanilla launch, worse than that. Was the game unsuccesful because of it?
---
Did this script work in vanilla?
---
You mean 4th best single target dps? 
---
Fury, mages, rogues are all better than locks for single and multi target fights
---
I think its running on retail client, initially they said legion client but its been updated.  I would shoot for retail requirements.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Any fellow gamer dads who will go slow and enjoy the quests with no addons? 😎
---
Nice sex brag, bro
---
150 dps? lol try 300-400
---
also so you want to be a special snowflake and get carried by people who's actually specced for the encounter or what?
---
Well fuck, if this isn't the most surprisingly accurate thing I'll read today I'll be amazed. Up vote for you, sir.
---
Oh dang, I thought it was 3 per server up to x characters total. Must have completely misread. Now need to decide if I want my #1 across 3 servers or top 3 on 1. That stinks.
---
You make a good point on Vanilla mechanics but the average player today will absolutely be better for a number of reasons. Information is disseminated much more quickly in 2019. Platforms like Youtube, twitch, and discord are widely popular. Back in Vanilla I tanked many dungeons with a 2 hander as arms and was healed by offspecs like shadow priests and feral druids. I also specd into all 3 talent trees until someone messaged me in arathi basin and told me I should pick one tree. 
---
Private servers have had success buffing dungeon content, sometimes up to 50-100%. Maybe this is too much for the average player, but it should definitely be scaled to provide the right level of challenge.
---
It worked that way in vanilla for sure I used to do that all the time in STV
---
You really think they aren't going to fix that? 
---
We all saw the bug yesterday and so did blizzard. 
---
They will resolve the layering issue and they said they would only use layering for the initial release while everyone is trying to get out of starting zones. 
---
Have a little faith in blizzard and the people working on it.
---
&gt; 1)
---
You are probably right, but I guess it depends on the lvling routes. The fact that mages can teleport accross continents 24/7 also makes a huge difference in efficient lvling. Or if they are taking the common melee route to just quest in zones where are mostly green-lvls where they probably could pull of some AoE questing. 
---
I am not sure, I never played mage in my entire wow career, but I am absolutely certain that you can't go much wrong by picking a mage.
---
&gt;2) 
---
Yeah, you are right on diremaul not being out, I forgot about that. But again if you hit 60 as a hunter you are one of the least wanted classes for dungeon spamming, while mage can get into almost any  instance instantly. Like Strat living where they can just farm the crusader enchant reagents or whatever.
---
Layering isn’t sharding.
---
Nope. Conflag spec is typically 19/0/32 or 17/0/34, picking up nightfall in the affliction tree for some instant shadowbolts
---
But I sort of also want to be able to play.
---
I am not too sure, apologies for that. I am just relaying information that might be a discrepancy between original Vanilla and the current iteration of WoW Classic.
---
the dynamic respawn was only a problem on one realm and the devs themselves admitted they fucked up big time, that realm was famous for mage aoe farm leveling within hours.
---
That is beautiful 👍
---
If you ever hit 60 you have no idea how mage v MS warrior damage was on vanilla.
---
Just because mage spell dang coefficients are fucked up on pservers has fuck all to do with how the dps will compare in classic.
---
Considering I played significantly more then you (1-60-Part of AQ) , if my opinion doesn’t matter then yours matters even less.
---
A 5% increase in damage IS a significant increase in difficulty alone, considering it is a 5% increase over the course of 200+ hours of leveling.
---
Even beyond this, if you played vanilla you would realize leveling was significantly harder precisely because there were no dynamic respawns, and the mob density.
---
You mentioning logic is funny. you are trying to refute my premise because it is anecdotal from vanilla, while simultaneously making an alternative premise that is also anecdotal but based on a fucking pserver.
---
None of this, by the way, even matters considering you never addressed the original matter of dissagreement that is: you somehow feel entitled enoug to tell people how to spec, but think they aren’t entitled to tell you not to tank in dps gear.
---
Personally, I support the (1) log cool down to switch layers (2) area at starter points and cities to go to to layer switch. Given that, I like the idea.
---
You're the one going on about how the game is going to crash and burn, not me.
---
No I do not know what implock is, go on...
---
Didn't you hear? They all raided naxx in vanilla to completion, and we're all in the top 5 guilds on the server. Everyone worshiped them!
---
Sure they do, they also probably mess up other values.
---
It is, just tweaked. Just because they slapped a new name on it doesn't mean it's not sharding.
---
I'd assume that at 13 (s)he would be 13. Only stands to reason.
---
I'd love to see updated raid mechanics for vanilla, but the shrill screaming from the "no changes" crowd would be deafening. That, BC spec balance, and a new model toggle and I'd be ridiculously happy. I know, I know. Slippery slope.
---
Venruki
---
I think it can't be fixed, it's an inevitable side effect of layering.
---
The problem is most people don’t want to carry bads. I played a rogue on pserver and would farm full consumes for MC. Did I need to do that? Probably not. However, when more people consume for fights, the raid goes faster. This improves morale and ends up using less of people’s valuable time to clear raids. Also when BWL is out, the faster you clear MC the faster you can move on to BWL. Also you have to consider that world buffs take time to go and acquire, so when you’re fully world buffed you might do really crazy DPS, but if you don’t have consumes on you will likely not finish the raid before the world buffs expire. So when I played and did hundreds of more DPS than other rogues who didn’t bring consumes, that becomes incredibly annoying because I spent the time to farm those buffs and to go gather world buffs.
---
If you struggled back then, hopefully the guide will help you now.
---
Any utility a shaman has, a paladin has a better version of.
---
&gt; to fix dead realms
---
Maybe you can't see it? Because it never fixed the dead realms. No-one wanted to leave a healthy realm to a dead one, unless it was a concertaded mass migration of one faction to the other, which pretty much caused 1 good and 1 fucked up realm to turn into 2 fucked up realms.
---
It's not like they have a lot of other buttons to press :D
---
It will if there is sharding
---
Okay that was the last confirmation that you're a full retard.
---
I think you mean old-school DrakeDog PvP movie style.
---
&gt; To be honest, I'd prefer NO difficulties whatsoever and just have an easy introduction raid. TBC did this so well, Karazhan wasn't really difficult for the most part, but was a fun and well made place.
---
Agree 99%. However, I'd also like to give an honorable mention to Ulduar. I loved that you could just fight the boss in a different way and get a whole new experience with better loot rewards. It was a fresh take on how raiding had worked up until that point. You could tell that the developers probably spent a lot of time designing exactly how each mechanic would change and how each one should be triggered to give the best difficulty. The best part was, after bashing your head against the harder version and failing all night long, you had to give up and kill it in the normal mode just so you could continue on with the raid and finish the zone before the week was over. It was not a style that rewarded the weak, but even the weak could still kill them on normal mode and make progress. 
---
Ulduar was my favorite raid of all time. But it was also the one that caused my guild to fall apart. It made our raid leader quit WoW. 🤷‍♂️
---
Icecrown, on the other hand, was a huge step back from that creativity. It's so sad that they chose to go with that model for future raids.
---
r/MurderedByWords
---
But it isn’t sharding. It literally is nothing like sharding. 
---
You people are the worst.
---
Yes, but still there is the time needed to level up and to get the right equip from the lvl 60 dungeon.
---
Private servers with their 10x experience rate kind of make you forget that.
---
I’m an attorney. I have my laptop in my office so I can close the door and play sometimes. I generally do it sparingly though and only if things are a bit slow or I can pass work off to associates or law clerks. I don’t think other than blocking out my calendar and hunkering down I could raid or myth plus. But dailies maybe an LFR or a leveling dungeon yeah no prob. If I really just want to wow I won’t come in. But nothing stops me from doing so at the office.
---
Dayslastserende mentioned Blizz finding issues, so just added to that saying I encountered an interesting crash while playing the stress test and reported it.
---
I think people really underestimate what a grind vanilla was :P  
---
Think after MC/Ony is on farm the playerbase will really drop
---
Transport and logistic manager - I play pretty much all day in a 10 hour shift. Only meetings interrupt it for long.
---
To answer your question in a different way than the rest of the comments: there's one boss I can think of that you can solo, and it's Gordok in DM. A Lock could probably kill him but you'd have to get there solo, which would be tough/impossible solo. Hunters can get there with FD.
---
Well you did a great job explaining why it's nothing like sharding. How is it not like sharding? It creates several instances of the world on the same server, just like sharding. Except sharding is zone wide and layering is continent wide.
---
Walk into the inn in sentinel hill?
---
No one is saying that what people are saying getting a few things wrond =/= to everything wrong...
---
Method killed Argus in 330 pulls (or something) and honestly if your guild took 600 pulls to kill the boss with all the video footage and addons after world race, then you are more like part of the 20% and probably a pretty shitty guild in the scope of raiding.
---
If Classic gets a few million subs they will sure as hell run with it and make improvements, and expansions. I don't want WoW classic in maintenence. I want it to be a new chapter in the WoW universe. 
---
Blizz was caught off guard by the latest expansion being so bad that their subs are at catastrophic levels. They have nothing in the works to replace it but Classic. It's the only current project that can bring in the subs they want. We could see BC-C 6 months after release.
---
If Blizz was going to put Classic in maintenance mode they wouldn't have spent all this effort in porting it to the modern engine. They would have opened up Classic/BC/WotLK servers with the stock OS, and called it a day with little expenditure of their own.
---
It can be easily fixed. 
---
Only allow layering every 1 hour or only when in major city's. 
---
I have faith in blizzard, I'm certain they will resolve the issues before launch. 
---
There's a reason they have stress tests and beta testers so they can resolve issues before launch.
---
It’s definitely less demanding than retail. On the beta I’m able to crank everything to max and get well over 100fps. On retail I have to lower it to about 7 to keep a steady 60fps.
---
I want what comes on 8/27 to be OG 2006. But if blizzard wants my sub after Naxx has been beaten, I need vanilla+ or CTBC. 
---
The debuff limit, simple class mechanics (this one I can live with--it makes for digestible pvp), and simple raid mechanics are the only things wrong with classic (outside of bugs and exploits). Fix those and I'll be in section 8 housing eating hot pockets grinding boars till in 80 years old.
---
Four days for hitting 60. Two days for farming fire resist gear. Leaves one day for clearing the raid.
---
What it comes down to is that vanilla raids won't be difficult cause you'd need to figure out how to tackle bosses, but because you need to fulfill certain requirements.
---
People should play what they want and not stress.
---
Unless their Guild has rules for showing up to a raid with a certain level of preparation or gear or spec. Something about if you don't like it, make your own Guild and do it your way.
---
Would you be willing to switch roles in and out of raids vs pvp or dungeons? Maybe hybrids including paladins are able to grab gear healing while they play a ret lifestyle outside of the raid group just fine. Adds more dynamic aspect to the hybrid classes vs a pure DPS or pure healer
---
I would love to see factual data supporting these claims .
---
This is why LFR is good.
---
Why would focusing on Stam gear make levelling slow? It's not like there's a bunch if spell power gear lying around in vanilla. In fact I don't remember any at all on my mage, though I leveled to 60 pre-1.5
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined too :(
---
Yes! 1 week of being stuck at a low level before being able to get to the crowd would be way better then being left out of raid because the lack of consumables because of horders... Or not being able to level professions at max or make gold for mount by farming nodes or mods because people will abuse phasing.
---
Theres plenty games where u keep chars from beta.
---
Regardless of how hard the bosses are, no one wants to spend hours and hours clearing raids if you can clear it much faster. That’s why people bring consumables and world buffs. Just like no guild wants to carry people who won’t farm consumes, few non casual guilds will want to carry multiple meme specs. Yes it’s ok to have 1 or 2 if they bring some type of utility like leader of the pack etc
---
Voice acted trailers like this are fucking epic, I wish they were still done
---
People have explained it to you. It has been explained multiple times by blizzard employees and people on this sub. Obviously you don’t want to listen.
---
And why is that bad?
---
I admit that it very well might be the case on PSERVERS that mages our damage melee.
---
In fact, based on the observably inaccurate spell damage I have seen on every PSERVER I have been on, it seems a  likely inference that mage damage would be significantly buffed enough to overtake some melee in a raid.
---
The problem is, NONE OF THESE NUMBERS MATTER because they are not from the vanilla fucking databases but from PSERVER databases.
---
Your argument is contradictory and makes no sense whatsoever
---
Are there any nameplates shown in this clip? I thought nameplates were the things you see when you press 'v', but in this clip I see none of that, even though he's virtually touching other players?
---
Tbh I dont really understand how people can freak out about retail paladins having one to two second gaps in their rotation, but then also have people excited to play "autoattack: The Game", where every mob consists of you turning your seal on and tabbing to YouTube for 40 seconds.
---
It feels like these two viewpoints shouldnt be able to exist at the same time. But here we are.
---
I did not see this even after browsing this sub all day. Thank you. I will post over there.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsjk4v/thoughts_on_layering
---
Was just a stress test, took over 5 hours to log into the stress test, only to be able to level to 5
---
As of flying mounts, Stormwind.  Pre-flying, it was always IF, as I suspect it'll be in classic.
---
Can we get layering on this subreddit? That way we can put all the bitchy littles girls crying about layering in their own layer.
---
Why are you planning on playing a game where you believe the developers will intentionally sabotage the experience and lie to you about it?  
---
Like, go play a private server or something you own if you don't trust the guys making classic. If you think they're going to lie to your face for profit layering tech should be the LEAST of your worries.
---
This a horrible idea for WoW. Who wants all their progress reset? You want that delete your character and start over it’s the same thing.
---
I still use that as an avatar for many things
---
Have you tried asking them nicely enough though ?
---
You’re wrong on many levels and I’m not gonna waste my time explaining why. Just know you’re wrong.
---
LAYERING! SOMEONE MENTIONED LAYERING! GAMERS RISE UP!
---
That's not fixing it, that's just applying bandage solutions to an awful system. If they have to gut layering in order for people to not abuse it, maybe it's not a good idea.
---
That doesn’t seem that great for the environment...
---
I gave you a big boy adult answer. You got caught up in the first sentence busy being offended.
---
People also forget, when BWL comes out you will likly be spitting your 40 man into 2 20ish mans for Onyxia and MC, as you will still be running those places for loot/head buff. You need to bring a well equiped/talented group to do these places at 1/2-2/3 of a raid, and to still get them done in a timely manor.
---
Ya know there is an industry centered on the preservation of old stuff to attract tourism, right? The authentic and all that stuff.
---
There is value in a well-preserved Classic WoW. Modification of this preserved virtual space is to be questioned.
---
I'm saying if they got that wrong there's no telling what else they got wrong.  They apparently also mess with things like drop rates, they probably mess with damage out put numbers as well.
---
3 to 4 months after release it could also be mandatory if your group of friends is missing a few spots they need to fill in for a full raid.
---
The irony will probably be a group finder add-on will be the most popular add-on in Classic.
---
You know what? I read half the comments here and I don't understand shit. When the pandas came out I came back to WoW and quit after that. 
---
I never experienced Mythic raids and shit like that, but I remember all the good time I had playing Vanilla. 
---
Last night I found a screenshot of my first Rag clear with the old guild it was in mid 2005. I remember the grind for the fire resist gear, the fine tuning of the equipment, preparation, potions, many many attempts with great guild members. 
---
I remember the fight seeming impossible when we first try it, then the grinding and find tuning of strategies. Then we downed Rag for the first time, great feeling of accomplishment and we knew that the week after that would be as hard as it was this week. Weeks over weeks the fight got easier, one because we were getting geared and second because we knew what we were doing.
---
People saying Mythic is harder than Vanilla raid is the same feeling that I had when we downed Rag for the first time. It seems hard now but with gear and practice the process will become a no brainer. 
---
All i want to say is, that it's not a Classic vs Retail battle, I am not bashing on Retail because i don't know shit about Retail. But people who started late in wow and never experience Vanilla should really really play Classic and give it a go before stating that it's way easier than Retail.
---
&gt; go pvp and wait for that invite, its incredibly easy.
---
But, you're not explaining, who would do this, and why?
---
If you don't want to PVP, then, you don't roll on a PVP server. If you want to escape a death, then you don't have time to wait for an invite, because, once you're messing around with inviting, you're dead.
---
aren't warriors still pretty bad for 1v1s / none group content ?
---
You cited the wrong private server, never mentioned that one
---
Completely ignored my criticism because you know I'm right. GG bro nice talk
---
Where did you get all this data from???
---
You already admit you didn’t play endgame at 60 when vanilla was live, so that leaves only one possible solution...
---
This is just my post on some of the ways I think could be used to solve exploitation issues and improve player experience. There's quite a few posts on layering if you search by new, but they get down voted immediately so it's difficult to find one with good discussion.
---
In any case, they can just simply compare to reference and make sure it's the same. Though similarly to things like the damage values people were up in arms about, I suspect that this will soon be posted onto the "not a bug" list and people can stop fretting.
---
It's not akin to WoW selling classes, and a WoW token is 10x more P2W than a champion is. You can buy gear/enchants/consumables that you wouldn't be able able to without a lot of time spent just by spending money. You might be able to get a bigger champion pool with money, but once you are in game in means nothing. There's no difference between someone with every hero on Galio vs someone with 10 heroes on Galio, once in the game. This is excluding the runes, as those were obviously p2w.
---
You are also DEFINITELY moving the goalposts, argue against it all you want but it's clear to see. You just don't understand what you are talking about it, it's okay man.
---
I started a post asking about the capabilities and limitations of layering but it will probably go un-commented on, but I will repost some of my post here: 
---
Is there any way that layering could be applied to a subset of items in the game? Similar to how when you're not on a certain quest you can't interact with quest items on the ground? 
---
Why can they not use layering to make it where all gatherable profession items would be assigned to specific layers, and when you start the game you are assigned a gatherable-layer that can't be changed by the player through obvious cheesing. Meanwhile, there could separate social-layers that players are assigned to and can choose to change on their own. This would not prevent players switching social layers to kill specific quest mobs but if splitting layers like this is possible it would eliminate gathering and chest farming during phase 1 to a much larger degree but would still let you join with your friends without getting lucky or having to go to a major city etc.
---
This could lead to some odd behaviors where two people in the same social-layer are in two different gatherable-layers and results in a player bending down to pick an herb that doesn't exist to the opposing player. Opposingly two players might appear to be picking the same node but are actually picking two different herbs in different layers. This still seems like it would be better than people cheese farming early on until layering is phased out of the game.
---
It's been a very predictable slippery slope
---
Well, then it wasnt wise idea to use your real name as your nickname, mrcoulrophobia. /Jk
---
I'm so sorry, but this made me laugh harder than I was prepared for.
---
No but if he had nameplates on he still would've met the same fate. I am just pointing out that this script might've not been working in Vanilla and so it shouldn't work in WoW Classi .
---
Hey, likely proved me right.
---
People who insult others for something so trivial and say "nope lel I have a life" are usually projecting.
---
Do it.
---
No changers don’t want it but what can we do. Blizzard clearly doesn’t care about vanilla warts and all like they said.
---
Never actually seen a druid run this spec in any decent guild.
---
They either go full feral and dps when they aren't tanking or they go full healer. 
---
It doesn't make sense to go from tank to healer throughout a raid. This would mean for bigger pulls where an extra tank is needed your guild loses out on a healer.
---
I've only ever played as Alliance from 2005~Present. I have never made a Horde character, ever.
---
They're a bunch of shit flingling savages living in mud huts, IDGAF. They need to be brought to heel and be taught to act in a civilized manner.

If Lionel Messi is the best soccer player from my town, it doesn't prove the statement that all players from my town are good. Naxx40 being hard doesn't make the rest of the raids any harder, it's just an outlier.
---
&gt; Hybrids have never been a thing. Characters--played by players with any sense--suffered the hybrid tax despite being specialized for a particular role. Blizzard may have intended the paladin to be swinging a hammer on rag and throwing the odd heal--but no one did that. They specced holy or ret and healed or damaged.
---
If that is your opinion then leave. Classic isn't for you. Blizz already made your game in Retail. Don't ruin ours.
---
I had a Disc spirit priest with all the spirit bonuses. A caster DPS pally with tons of SP that could also heal like a MF. and a hybrid druid.
---
Classic is all about choice. If you don't want choice then they already made your game....go play it.
---
I fail to see how asking a question about a function of the game is bitching? Thanks for your helpful input.
---
Thanks a lot =D
---
I think the 8s max pvp cc was introduced in tbc. So, while the chance to break is higher than a regular mob, it could last the duration. One reason mage and lock are so deadly in pvp.
---
And lots of us don't care because it won't affect our experience.
---
I'll take ghost wolf over a free mount
---
Okay, I get what you're saying, but layering is very much the harder way
---
Then dont play.
---
I'm right there with you. I guarantee we get a CTBC if Vanilla does well. It'll probably be an optionable one way server transfer.
---
I think a lot of these issues could be resolved with some simple changes.
---
My thoughts:
---
My thoughts are, if this is possible, when you choose a realm you also choose the layer. Those characters are then static on that single layer, as if that layer were its own server. The server does not chose which layer to put you in at random. There will be no layer swapping when grouping up. And over time as populations decrease, blizzard decides which layers to merge. Exactly the same way they treated server merges, only difference is all the layers share the same character name database from their respective server. Players and blizzard have complete control over which Azeroth that character is in. It is never random. 
---
If over population is a problem, lock the layer and create a new one. Over time as population decreases, merge the layers. Try to keep each layer around 3,000 - 4,000 or whatever blizzard deems reasonable. The key here is we, as players and blizzard, have total control. Its never random and its never open to exploitation. 
---
At no point in Classic WoW should characters be porting in and out of different versions of Azeroth. They should be static, living on one single Azeroth. Swapping in and out of different Azeroths kills the spirit of the game. We may not think its a big deal now, but that is only because we have been dealing with sharding for so long. Layering is another word for sharding. And sharding is not classic at all. 
---
So let’s discuss. What are your solutions to the exploit i linked up top? Be constructive. Be nice. Have fun.
---
Edit: As for the “only first phase” argument, what happened in this video is not acceptable. Not for the first week, or first month, or ever.
---
There's a blood-elf in that video, and I'm pretty sure "Blade's Edge Arena" is written at the top right.
---
And I'm pretty sure the only time Classic saw Arenas were in the tBC pre-patch. *Maybe.*
---
So you mean that using  **/run SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance", 80)**  would have enabled him to see the enemies behind the tree?
---
I think I’m gonna need to find me a Wombat of Slaying... just imagine the power!!
---
Yeah, any mention of layering, whether it be inquisitive or positive is still labeled as complaining 🙄
---
I know you could change camera max distance in vanilla with a similar script. (It was changed in tbc or wotlk iirc) so maybe there was the similar script in vanilla for nameplate? I was 15 so an idiot at the time &gt;&lt;
---
There is NOTHING good about LFR.
---
Yes you are right I meant to say dodge. I think there are definitely better builds for leveling that enrich the power of the Warrior. But that build was meant to be a fun way to do dual-wield ;). Hope you still enjoyed the video and thanks for the feedback.
---
I agree with your idea. The one counterpoint I've heard to this, which it good, that you are merging layer economies potentially disrupting them. Whereas if you are bouncing between layers everyone is more part of a single economy. 
---
Though I would say as long as the ah is cross-layer still even if players aren't, that would mitigate this. It does give an advantage to anyone who luckily picked a less popular layer or layer whose pop dropped quicker. They have an advantage on collecting resources and the advantage takes affect when the merge occurs.
---
If they merge layers aggressively fast when decline is happening it minimizes that case though. And I'd be ok with that as long as those players on the low layer didnt get weeks alone to utilize it.
---
Nothing bad or glitchy or economy breaking happened in vanilla ever no siree - Nostalgia goggled fanboy
---
I'll always play a gnome mage, setting things on fire while hiding in the bushes - or a dwarf rogue.  I like the shorties, just the way it goes.
---
Arena is the higher skill cap of PVP. Don't be stupid.
---
That's good to know I've been one Reddit like all day haven't seen anything special for horde at server ens
---
I've always been curious about what people's logic is here. If someone sees your name on reddit, they're going to do what exactly? Hunt you down? Steal your identity? 
---
I'm 99.9% sure this is a meme
---
Because you’re wrong. They already explained that layering will be 3-4 per server and have set player limits. 
---
Sharding was a smaller scale issue for each zone and that’s why you can see people disappear. 
---
When I login into Classic I will be in the same layer as people in both factions across both continents. Not like sharding where it is limited every time I switch a zone. 
---
I ignored what you said because you are 100% wrong.
---
Tribe is super chill and interacts a lot with chat (t.tv/tribe_tv1) .
---
Personally like him the most of any wow streamer
---
Oh look another one of these posts.
---
Oof the comments contain salt. Melderon gj mate and i appriciate the time you put in it. Dont worry people will look it and eventually use it. Maybe not in the start of classic but later if mains/ alts are out geared. People get bored and want a challenge. 
---
Goodjob mate.
---
The thing is, in recent days, doing a 180 was pretty annoying, cause the camera has a bug in every other patch where when you swing your camera it jumps way further... So I started being more careful with that to not lose track... Going through is honestly faster as a melee classe, way more efficient. Walk two steps, hop back, repeat
---
For you.
---
That's just like, your opinion man.
---
I thought it was still a thing on retail, tbh. I haven't been to shimmering flats in fucking forever and always avoid it and most of the world in general when leveling these days, so I had no idea it was ever removed. I actually thought this post was a satire on how stupid streamers are until I read the comments and saw they were serious.
---
Yep no telling, execpt for blizzard who can quickly chect using thier base client. This isnt a spreadsheet you can just Ctrl-F to find all the differences/duplicates, they need a shit load of people combing through and any bit of reference to those people, be it a 10+ year old memory or a Pserver gives them a basis to flag bugs. With no basis, there are no bugs, as this game isnt being made to be perfect. Things that would be bugs in other games could be features in wow, like the tauren hit box. So even if you have no basis or reference you are going to be tagging non bugs, just like someone with a 10+ year old memeory, or someone who played on a Pserver. NONf of thr beta testers have wow omnipetency that people seem to requier of this beta for some reason to flag apparent bugs.
---
Fuck people who want to share their opinion on a controversial topic. Is that essentially it?
---
I always just ran a couple of steps backwards to outrage it
---
No one cares that you can't defend it.
---
So is this another US only wave?
---
Can anyone confirm?
---
You do realize this is a beta? And these are the things that people are reporting so it hopefully doesn’t happen on launch? I don’t get why people are freaking out so much over layering and other issues in the BETA. This is literally why they do this. To find these issues... Have a little faith. Blizzard has been on the ball for most everything Classic WoW so far.
---
So why not blame BG?
---
holy shit night at the museum
---
PvP Seasons (arena seasons) were introduced in TBC. Vanilla used an honor point system using Honorable Kills and Ranking Points to determine a rank you would grind out. The higher the rank the better gear/mount/title upgrades you’d get. Of course this could somehow play a part in your season idea.
---
Don’t get me wrong here, I enjoyed the post and you thinking outside the box. 
---
Are you looking to combat the “what now” factor, months after phase 6 (final release in classic)? It’ll be interesting to see as I’m still thinking about the options myself.  Do we perform a server wipe and do it all over again? Do we introduce a system like you mentioned? Do we keep the server and make a TBC Classic server that you can rollover you lvl 60 on? Do we continue newly developed lvl 60 content?
---
I know the devs appear to be open to options based on community feedback.
---
I played a raiding (top-5 guild) holy Paladin from 2004 through BC and left in 2007.  I'd never play a paladin in vanilla/classic again... the Blizzard teams admitted they never got it right until the expansions, and they're right, same goes for druids.
---
That whole experience made me crave damage, and thus I embrace the mage as my go-to main, and my guilty pleasure, my spoiled alt rogue.  Blizzard will try to tell you otherwise, but they only handled the specialists properly in vanilla, the hybrids (and anyone with a healing spell)... they fumbled.
---
ok kid
---
Again, they said you will be in a layer for a certain period of time even when you logout. 
---
Now I can see an issue where if someone invites you and you switch layers then yeah you can possibly loot the same node
---
Ehh.
---
In hindsight, wrath was okay. I did the raids from 10m Sarth 3d to Yogg 0 and HLK. Good fights for the time. But the game was being casualized around us the entire time. A lot of the systems we look at with disgust now, were introduced in wrath. 
---
For me its BC &gt; Vanilla &gt; MOP &gt; Wrath &gt; Cata &gt; Wod/Legion/BFA
---
Even BC introduced bad things, like flying mounts and daily quests. BC also doubled down on one difficulty for raids and had
---
I'd rather wait a week that have a fucked up economy of phasers.
---
I won’t play without layering. Like. I literally won’t be able to get into the game and progress
---
Thanks! I'm used to it at this point.
---
Yes, way before he is supposed to. He would've seen the ambush coming and just back off.
---
Resting zone. Out of combat. and make it a 30s timer, like /camp
---
Lots of us only realized the limitations of our class after being 60 for a bit and trying to raid and what not. For me, my oh damn moment was wishing I rolled a better raiding class when I started getting serious about it. This time around people know the classes and what they do well.
---
there are surely some toxic people on this sub, as there are on any other sub. the wow community, classic or not, also carries a lot of the same problems as any online gaming community, this is especially apparant on private servers with no moderation and free subs.
---
...but most people's idea of toxicity on here seems to be 1) old people complaining about the ''streamers these days'' 2) people making memes about the ''you think you do but you don't'' mentality. not what i would call toxic
---
Remindme! 100 days "do this"
---
This type of discussion has largely contributed to Blizzard's decision making in the past before all the retail fan boys came over. Go back to your memes, you're just making classic worse for the rest of us.
---
2v1 is harder than you think, unless the 2 are brain dead and undergeared, it’s not something you’ll be doing a lot of at all, but I agree with you mages are a brilliant class in vanilla I’ll be making one too :)
---
Who?
---
Absolutely! I feel that way as well.
---
motherfucker do you even play this game? how are you this dense? you need me to hold ur hand through every fucking explanation? 
---
"once you're messing around with inviting, you're dead." lol...alright except i already explained this to you and how it works easily. i think were done here reztrap.
---
Hilarious. Why don’t you link all the other posts too?
---
Methinks you just wanted the comments in your post and not someone else’s.
---
You won't, see  the clip I linked in OP
---
Yeah so they were never world pvpers, they are pvpers who prefer arena and BG.
---
A true world pvper would do world pvp
---
 thing I'm wondering is, how does blizzard analyze populations when they get past the first month and start thinking about layer consolidating? Especially especially since classic accounts are apart of retail accounts. And just because somebody decides to stop playing classic does not mean they're going to delete their classic character, so the character population on a server is not necessarily reflective of the activity on the server.
---
Maybe if you join a group you get "You're about to go to another layer, this will incur a one hour cooldown before you can change. Are you sure?" Sort of prompt.
---
Obviously more direct than what I said, but you get the idea. Hopes to prevent exploits, especially ore/herb farming and Devilsaur Mafia.
---
Hunter 2 shot crit kills on clothes.  Something about killing a mage on his mount and watching the dead body drop to the ground after the mount goes poof was so satisfying.
---
Realm merging has always been very difficult process, not to mention merging of the economies of the servers involved. Layering is much more elegant way of solving population issues. Also, it does not ruin economy ať all. If  there is enough people to create 4 layers, for instance, there will be 4 times the resources but also 4 times the amount of players. If you use this exploit to farm, you will take the resources from another layer. The thing is, even if you did not do so, they would have been most likely picked up by someone else native to that particular layer.
---
The first time I tried grinding as a warlock by fearing/vw tanking two enemies with dot’s at once.
---
I felt like a god of demons who should be feared by all of those puny raptors who dare defy my level 14 wrath.
---
I'm Horde. We don't ask nicely, we bash skulls and stomp groins !
---
I also made a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bse7zo/a_command_that_maybe_should_not_be_in_classic/) about this today.
---
Glad it seems to be getting more attention.
---
Except with people lose their name because they were merged with another server. To some that is a HUGE deal, their name is their identity.
---
That paladin was not good, you never use bubble at 95% hp lol. He could of just waited until he was covered in dots a bit first before using it. You should only use Bubble when you are covered in debuffs and below 40% life. I also do not think the paladin was using SoC, it looked like he used SoR instead.
---
The definition of dynamic respawns here is anything that adjusts the respawn rate of monsters based on a set of variables. Weather that is how many people are in an area, or how many of a set of creatures are alive is just details. It's all dynamic respawning. The respawn rate is adjusted, dynamically, based on variables. 
---
Mark did confirm that dynamic repawns were in fact in the starting zones in the launch of Vanilla, and to him, it seems to not be working properly.
---
Yeah I'd rather have layering than wait for my dead server to get merged because all the tourists left, and then have to change my name.
---
In what world is that a better solution?
---
Ok dad
---
Hopefully, there you go. Hoping for something is always a bad idea with Blizzard. If people don't freak out this shit will make it in as is.
---
Yep, german beta player here. But i dont think there is an extra server for europe.
---
I think in due time, you will be proven wrong.
---
Skyguard Silver Cross was the trinket. He also had another level 70 trinket too it seems.

I found this article talking about it when it happened:

---
powerful
---
Except that consistently when they do check things that people say aren't working in beta because of either private server experience or just faulty memory they are in fact working in beta the same as they did in 1.12.
---
&gt; What about the class you wanna play makes you giddy inside?
---
Warrior, intending to tank.
---
What makes me excited is the idea of leading a group through a 5 or 10 man dungeon.  The thought of comments after the run being things like *"good run, great tanking."*  Marking targets for a good group and seeing things go according to plan.  Having people add me to their friends list for being good at the game and reliable, and making friends in whatever guild I end up in as "that guy who's always down to run some dungeons."
---
He was arguing against the design choice and philosophy though. It's not a mark against his advice that the implementation fell flat. We did get a successful implementation of LFG later.
---
Same, I thought it would have been fun to do some wPvP in Beta but this changes everything, I spent so much time in BGs and getting to play them way before they come to live is something I'm gonna be sad about missing.
---
I don’t really understand the animosity, personally. I frequent both and I some culture from both sneaks in.
---
Hardly the focus of my joke either, but I apologize for using terminology foreign to our locale
---
LFR is always a shitstorm the first few weeks its open.
---
The master looter can ninja the item.
---
Yes, the master looter is a position of trust that is filled by someone who is a leader in the guild, but some people give in to greed.  Obviously the person cannot do this and then stay in the guild, but what if they were planning on leaving anyway? Maybe they got invited to be in a new guild on another server.  Or maybe they just got pissed off at their current guild and decide its worth it to burn that bridge.
---
I know some of these situations must have happened in the past.
---
Woahhhhhh hol' up. The Wetlands walk as a NE is skippable? How have I never heard of this?
---
Compared to what? Vanilla. Has anyone raided in the beta yet? Until so, I don't think anything can be said for certain.
---
EQ2 had layers, the economy is fine.  If you don't know what you're talking about, don't talk.
---
Damn i never thought of the economies. Good point. Maybe AH can be shared just like character and guild names.
---
That's an interesting idea. I'm not sure how Blizz architecture is structured, but this would require a massive system overhaul to pull off on private server architecture. I'd imagine it would for Blizz as well.
---
Ah I see, thanks for the clarification. Seems like something the devs should look into.
---
I figured resilience was pretty huge back in the day so ppl would farm all that before world pvping. 🤔.
---
NPC's don't have DR.
---
Druids are still the least played class on private servers.
---
They are only good in dps with stuff that doesn't work in classic (i. e. the gnomeregan item)
---
&gt; 15 years ago i raided being completely shit and we still downed bosses 
---
Yeah I was shit in a shit guild for the first part of tbc, it wasent until I switched to a better raiding guild, saw how bad I was doing and how much time you save in raid with a good efficient group. Sure I don't mind whiping on progression and toughing it out for weeks on a specific boss, but when you take super long on bosses you have killed for 10 weeks stright it can get pretty soul drining
---
You would do more damage with almost any combination of other abilities.
---
Even if ur doing it for fun, if u throw up DoTs while meleeing those dots will do more dmg.
---
Yeah the UD starting area was a pain in the ass. Lots of people but low amount of mobs and spread around in a way that makes it hard to find one and camping one spot takes forever too to get enough kills.
---
It was in the stress test. Notified everyone when horde were attacking goldshire
---
Boohoo

The Guybrush Threepwood buff

There was a EU only beta wave just last week.
---
Brings me back
---
In sole reference to TBC, neither arenas or flying mounts ruined world pvp, I dont know what people are on about I'm pretty sure they dont remember the massive amounts of world pvp at daily quest zones or isle of quel'danas or most importantly the fact to queue an arena you needed to go to a arena master to queue and you would literally see the team you just fought in an arena at the arena master and would attack on sight..... TBC was the best expansion by far, it added the things vanilla was missing but kept the community intact.

Razorsteel shoulders
---
It’s the other quest reward from the diamond flask quest
---
They have well optimised stats, and you’ll probably need a shoulder upgrade and +hit rating by the time you do this quest, but it’s not worth it. You replace the shoulders with dungeon blues or early raid gear, but you never truly replace the diamond flask.

Skinning/mining drop skinning for engi at 60 when you have the cash/mats to level it, vendor all the skins to get money for your level 40 mount.
---
No. That is how first aid is leveled in the game. He acts like a 2 year old when he runs out of wool. Learn to bring enough cloth when visiting a trainer, pretty simple.
---
Im actually going for a personal record and level up to 60 in a slowest time possible
---
Disagree hard there. Stormwind is harder to navigate imo but that might be because I have Org memorized
---
Well, some of them regret it at least. I assume some still love like some retail players love it. But ya some certainly regret it, and it was actually originally planned to be a TBC specific feature.
---
There's no separate servers for EU and there was a single EU invitation wave, it's lopsided in favor of US but what can you do. They did have the game out for longer time.
---
U don’t understand layering I c.
---
&gt; Just merge the servers...
---
What would this accomplish that layering doesn't?  It's the same thing, except with merges you're also going to force people to rename their characters, break guilds apart, and even more negatively impact the economy.
---
To say nothing of the periods of dead-servers that will exist before they can get around to merging them.
---
Your charts contradict you. They clearly show druids at the top. And the other top ranking healers almost surely benefited from an innervate. That means that part of their healing was provided by another player. Once you account for that, your charts show a clear picture of druids being together with pals and priests at the very top.
---
I'm not  claiming druids are contenders for topping the charts, I'm just pointing out that the graphs you're showing us are evidence of that.
---
I think people are overreacting to exploits which will likely be a very insignificant issue. If exploits are so easy then that means there will be a lot of people trying to use them, which means competition, which means the exploit is no longer profitable. The examples people are giving seem to envision a world where there is only a single player interested in farming these resources, hopping between pristine copies of the world at their leisure.
---
Don't let perfect stand in the way of good. IMO the cons of implementing such a rigid system outweigh the pros of solving a minor exploitation issue.
---
This guy wins the screenshot battle
---
So much time spent making a perfect design.
---
Just to see someone else's and think FUCK it's so much better than mine T-T
---
Well, you can only 2v1 / Nv1 against crappy people.
---
If he went against gladiator/pro players even a 1v1 would be difficult/competitive, so yeah, OP classes aside, every outnumbered PvP victory relies on your opponents being stupid.
---
And not just you yourself walking either, because people will point out "Well you can just stay on the ground then." It's also immersive because you see a living breathing community of players running alongside you, or crossing your paths.
---
I mean, I think technically speaking, server merges would be the easier way. Layering seems like a complex way to handle an issue, and it's purely for the benefit of the player.
---
With a few things, have you looked at the list? because I think you are just looking at the bug reactions on the sub, many many many more positive bug reports have develped from the pserver comparisons than people with no comparison to make at all. The stickied post right on this sub, and the one that the devs have been updating
---
Did that happen to you? what did you play?
---
UK beta player here. As mentioned, there's no separate server for EU or anywhere else. The two beta servers are based in north America some get a teeny bit of lag (about 100ms usually).
---
I was referring more to retail going into maintenance mode. It'll hit a point where they stop making new expansions, content, and other updates.
---
I just remember the 2 million figure standing out but I don't remember why, but I think that's their threshold where they start considering options. I think Classic is one of those options.
---
from your other posts you say you want to dps, and that you have never healed and never tanked.
---
If you play any hybrid class than can heal, (shaman, pally, druid, priest), end game your going to have to heal if you want to go. (unless you get very lucky with a good guild that can and does go has enough healers that they can take you as non-heals). 
---
Warrior is strong if you have gear and/or heals.  Otherwise, your going to spend a huge amount of time eating and bandaging while leveling.  (you only have to do this once, so it's a problem that fixes itself eventually)
---
Rogue is nice because you can skip tons of content you don't feel like messing with.  In groups, and raids are often lead by the  Main tank, who is usually warrior, and they have no qualms at all about filling every melee dps spot they can with rogues to keep other plate wearers from rolling need.
---
Yea you think that's snazzy. Most of us are here because we like Classic, and want to play classic. We don't want to change it from what it was. We never wanted all those shitty changes they instituted in Cata because it made the game worse. We simply wanted more content.
---
WoW grew to the size it did on the back of the system they had through WotLK. It's what the community fell in love with. Don't bring your change it crap here. If you don't like how it was done then don't  play it. We all could do with one less whiner.
---
I was questing in Darkshore from 12-20 and I ran into one of the beached creatures that I missed - the quest was grey but when I completed it, I still got the same 50 rep as from the other beached creature quests that I handed in alongside it which weren't grey.
---
i don't believe so but I appreciate the concern :p
---
Bad info. No one needs a diet. Eat meat, carbs, more vegetables, drink water. It’s that simple. People have lived to 90+ without a keto diet. In fact I’d like you to find me one person over the age of 90 that’s been on your diet their entire life. That says all that needs to be said.
---
So there’s this thing called a beta that they are playing in. Blizzard has already talked about this and will be fixing it before release. 
---
But, people like you who go crazy over one clip will continue to be wrong as you are now.
---
Arena and resil is BC
---
Ok, I'm done. Can't even have a calm discussion without throwing a hissy fit.
---
Reported.
---
I commented here on the specific points of this discussion and linked my in depth descriptions of my opinions instead of reposting them all.   Thanks.
---
So then explain to me how layering is more disruptive to the server community than server merging?
---
After every server merge you get a ton of unknown players from another server transfered to your server over night. Tons of people you have never seen before, who didn't level on your server and nobody from your original server knows anything about.
---
They implemented it for this. You have no clue how much work it was or wasn't. There's no way merging servers is more work than developing the layer tech...
---
No, but if half the raid actively sabotage it, it's a wipe. It's not actually possible to wipe in LRF. You'd need a committed effort from 75% of the raid to pull it off.
---
Someone posted a Vurtne video and got hit by a huge wave of nostalgia...
---
But if there was - would it ruin the game :)
---
I agree, and I'm sorry for the rant. I just really want this all to blow up into what we should have had all along.
---
I like the idea of having a static layer. That's kind of what I was leaning towards by having chat separate so you didn't have the ability to even know other players from other layers to try to transfer. Also if they realibly stabilized the layers then there wouldn't need to be much forced transferring. Only issue I see with choosing ones and not being able to transfer is when friends or guilds don't coordinate which layer they're on. Or the layer your friends joined is now full and you can't play with them.
---
Planning my alta, have 1 name with 3 characters and 1 with 12, so hopefully your right. I feel like 13 was too many though, I remember it being like 10 or something
---
That is the plus side. However this exploit should never happen. Ever. I hope they figure out a way to fix this.
---
...Right, I know. That's why I said that. Dr_Ambiorix seems to be suggesting that there shouldn't be a keyring in classic.
---
Would highly suggest watching payo (undead rogue). He’s funny as hell with his Canadian French accent, and really good at playing rogue. Got no doubt he will be going at it in WSG
---
Layer hopping will ruin the economy by the simple fact that you can force yourself into another layer. Also if not enough people quit they are either forced to keep the layers or open new realms. How is it difficult to merge databases in 2019?
---
This should never happen. Ever.
---
This is awesome not only because of the classic editing but because this was my favorite song back in 2007 lmao. 
---
0:53 - 0:56 is BIS editing.
---
The warlock Soul Drain talent works similaly based on killing blow, and has a similarly vague tooltip
---
Sure, but if you have 30 people that actively try to wipe the raid it's gonna be a wipe. In LFR you'd need a committed effort from more than 75% of the raid to manage to fail it.
---
[That Item] [Spite]
---
No, not everyone got into stress test.
---
In what way is it easier? The servers are all virtual anyway. Hosting 10,000 players is hosting 10,000 players whether they're in 5 realms or a single realm with 5 layers.
---
Spending time and money developing a new server management implementation doesn't sound like "the easy way out."
---
They took up bad space until cats, where they turned into the class resource it still is today
---
im finding voidwalker on beta right now is fucking awful, especially at 17-19, 27-29 where your damage starts to really outpace torment before you get a new rank.  even with 3/3 imp voidwalker i will pull aggro with 3 dots + wand.  i know one specific pserver had busted voidwalker aggro, not sure about the most popular one but id definitely switch out to imp drain tank spec at 40 even if its less effective than the tbc version.  didnt play warlock in vanilla so im unsure of how accurate the threat generation of beta voidwalker is
---
I remember early on in my time of playing a rogue I had some random quest that had me go into a tower to kill a named mob who was chilling at the top (not the poison quest, just some quest in an early zone). The tower, naturally, had mobs all throughout and then at the top the named guy had another mob standing next to him so it'd be a 2v1. 
---
Being a rogue, I naturally didn't feel like fighting all these mobs that wouldn't give me progress toward a quest, so I stealthed and started slowly making my way up the tower using distract and sap when I needed it. I get to the top, sap the dudes buddy, pop out and kill him real quick. I didn't feel like stealth walking all the way back, so I popped sprint and ran through a few mobs till I got to the stair/ramp area, jumped down a couple of levels, aggroed more mobs, jumped again to the bottom aggroing even more, sprinted to the door and popped vanish and I was a ghost. 
---
Essentially, in the eyes of all those mobs, I just snuck into their highly defended tower without them knowing, killed their boss and before they could even blink I was gone never to be seen again. I'm a fucking ninja. That's why I kept playing rogue.
---
This is awesome not only because of the classic editing but because this was my favorite song back in 2007 lmao.
---
It is for sure 12 or more.... Timthetatman is 12 characters and hes rolling around on the Beta right now. I am almost positive it is 13
---
Exept this particular thing was already solved back then
---
Im starting to feel you on this.
---
This is a blank black box for me.
---
Actually heroin was invented by a chemist that wanted to get rid of his addiction to morphine.
---
It worked ... sort of :D
---
u dumb
---
Do quivers increase your wand speed ?
---
Ya World PvP could be more interesting when you could use the terrain. That became limited when PvP became a matter of dive-bombing each other.
---
Yes it is
---
N0rthd@l3 or whatever the fuck is the new one? Idk about that shit im not retarded enough to follow scam after scam that started with 3ly$ium     
---
you mentioned K3 which I addressed as well. It had nowhere near 10k concurrent ingame players. I would know, I played it on launch.  
---
either way, lets just say blizzard is cheap and wants to save money on servers and private servers use better ones:  
---
the 1# reason for layering is so servers wouldnt crash and burn; #2 they also dont want stupid respawn timer on mobs. Imagine going into cave and all the mobs you kill just keep respawning 10 seconds later or something  
---
Pretty sure they talked about this somewhere  
---
They want "authentic" experience and to not have dead servers after initial hype dies down. Layering is for that.
---
My first WoW toon's name was 11 characters long... I don't know what was the maximum but @rmnesbitt is probably right
---
Lol that would be one hell of an interesting real name
---
LMAOOOO, man didn’t stand a chance. I love Asmon but good Lord the immune was wild
---
Yeah I’ve read the comments and they don’t convince me that much. There are various things that over time it might be annoying like having reagents for everything. If I remember correctly paladin buffs only lasted 10min. Or something like that. I mean the game itself might age well enough because WoW will always be the best MMO out there and they have the formula right since the beginning. Its just that there will be lots of QoL changes that are not present. Like having ammunition for ranged weapons. Crafting the best ammunition. 
---
I guess it had more flexibility with classes because you had more options to allocate your skill points but... you know in the end there will be always an optimal setup. So overall you will have fun and hopefully they progress through BC and stop at WotlK where it was the golden era for WoW.

Ah bummer
---
Getting the Whirlwind Axe for the first time as warrior.  
---
It's like a from rags to riches kinda moment. The 30-40 part is so smooth thanks to this weapon, it's like a revival.
---
OH DAMN I HIT LIKE A MOFOCKIN TRUCK!
---
I mean some of the vanilla raids are 100% lfr difficulty. Bosses with 2-3 mechanics, not really engaging. Also lfr and normal are both absolute snooze fests, would hardly call them worlds apart.
---
Vanilla raids are going to be absolutely stomped, but that's fine. A lot of fun will come from many experiencing 40 man raiding for the first time and the huge guild communities.
---
I, for one, have never really used back peddling. I mained a Hunter in Vanilla, including the epic hunter quest, so 180 turns became a thing of nature and to this day, I still use it for situations like this. It's a playstyle choice for sure, but some people would probably prefer it to moving around.
---
I think layering will work if they put up some safeguards. Like preventing group layer transfers unless in the same zone prevents most exploitation.
---
Here's my detailed explanation
---
Layers are just virtual server clusters that share the same database of players.
---
To my knowledge nameplate distance was hardcoded back then.
---
Is that lock SL or is that not even possible at lvl 30?
---
Awesome! up voted that thread as well.
---
doubt it, blizzard hasn't ever done a open beta with wow (since its been released that is?)
---
Necessity for...making nodes, spawns, and players fade in and out of existence for seemingly random reasons?
---
I don’t always participate in the most secure things on the internet. So I tale extra steps to keep myself hidden. Not that I go out of my way to be an asshole or anything like that, but there are things that are frowned upon in some societies.
---
The only reason it was hard is things like having to decurse everyone in a pug...
---
Otherwise it'd be a joke. 
---
I understand the sentiment, but it really wasn't any harder than LFR.
---
We killed the bosses in the end and nobody had a clue what was going on and just facerolled to a free clear.
---
Not to mention since its LFR most of your group is undergeared/afk/dont play that alt etc.
---
There are multiple guids out there that tell you what path to take if you want to get a mount from X faction.
---
Or in the same zone
---
Layering will be in the game, and you will either play it and shut the hell up. Or you will not play it and shut the hell up.  
---
Clearly this is not intentional and they have 3 months to fix it since I mean, this is the BETA. Jesus christ dude go get some sun and quit being such a rage baby. Enjoy your downvotes and probable ban from the sub.
---
Curse debuffs are not insubstantial
---
r/gatekeeping
---
People that want vanilla want the grind. The focus on only raiding and the speed of everything is why I hate BfA. So go play BfA. I’ll play classic. Win/win.
---
Yeah and I would say the same about modern WoW.   Everything is either mind numblingly easy or so difficult so few want to do it.
---
I remember it as 3-12
---
I wouldn't at all be surprised if CTBC did better than Vanilla. If nothing else solely due to the existence of  OG Karazhan.
---
Don’t like it, don’t play. Sure are a lot of engineers on Reddit that seem to know better than the billion dollar company on how to handle things..
---
I‘m awake, I‘m awake !
---
It’s unfortunate to see you feel so strongly about something you know nothing about.
---
Video games were more fun when we all were bad at them
---
As far as vanilla, those are the hybrids. 
---
I think warriors are well implemented, and they tank by default, and can DPS quite well but they’re strongly gear dependent. I don’t find vanilla warlocks that compelling, and they’re a damage class. Priests are strong healers but their damage branch is not that amazing.
---
OR they shouldn't bringe Blood Elves to the horde so alliance people could still stick to alliance instead of whinning "ugly"
---
Been hoping for this also, seems like a no brainer at some point in the coming months
---
Can confirm played with 2 character name in vanilla.
---
If you carry the 2 and divide by pie the average percentage to wipe a raid is 39%. 
---
It's okay to say LFR is easy.
---
It's okay to say Vanilla raids are easy.
---
It's not okay to say LFR and Vanilla raids are both easy.
---
I'm done.
---
I have big dreams for classic. Mine will probably never see the light of day. I dream a dream of expansion servers re-tuned to vanilla mechanics, balance, and design, stripped of most if not all fluff and QoL beyond what was added during TBC and maybe Wrath (I say Wrath because that was WoW's most successful period and probably the best compromise between the old and modern games)
---
Yep, I rolled a shaman and resented being forced to heal. I embraced it though and became a guild and raid leader, but even as a healer I disliked managing totems and envied the spirit regen mechanic of priests. I leveled a priest but stopped at 49 as a shadow priest twink. That guy owned so hard. 
---
So, I'll be something else this time and maybe make a 49 twink shaman, which is a level they are still very good at.
---
Warcrafttavern
---
When?
---
All layers are connected by one auction house. They are also not static so there is no layer specific economy. So, no, it wont get ruined.
---
He actually told Morgaine to run in if he started losing, and they both got their ass beat, lmao. Fucking Quinn.
---
So you can sacrifice void, re-summon, and still keep the shield? And do it all over again indefinitely?
---
Except for the fact that we'll have the phasing problem at the start, dissuading the players that wouldn't be tourists.
---
Ulduar was 100% my favorite for this. Everyone fought the same bosses but you could ramp up the difficulty by changing how you do the fight rather than just swapping difficulty on the interface. Still best raid ever for me
---
[full disclosure : I started playing about a year into TBC]
---
I played Enhancement Shaman (once I actually settled on a class) into raiding in TBC and Wrath. Hitting level 40 was the hell-yeah moment for me. At level 40 I got :
---
- Riding
---
- Mail armor
---
- Dual wield (not a thing in vanilla/classic)
---
I had managed to farm a bunch of potions to be able to afford a mount. And I picked up some mail items and even a couple of daggers to DW. 
---
Then I died to a level 8 or something boar outside Org because with 0 skill in daggers I just couldn't hit it. Not paying attention to my HP also played a part in that debacle.
---
I mean I started Horde from (my) Day 1 but I'm just saying it's easy to see why so many people rolled Belves.
---
Vanilla had an open beta.
---
It solves the problem for tourists but makes a problem for non-tourists.
---
I like a CD + wait to switch approach too. 
---
30 min cooldown on switching, a deserter buff of sorts. To prevent people from constant layer switching, and make it at least feel as punishing as most classic things are. 
---
20 second layer switching action, like logging out not in an inn. To prevent people from layer switching in PvP situations instantly, or to look for xtra nodes, ect.
---
tbf you can still abuse my system once every 30 min, but I think it might be better for grouping with friends
---
Priest Mage Rogue dominated for a while too. I was a Priest in s1-s3 and got Gladiator title of our PMR combo.
---
Deleting people with LS -&gt; NS -&gt; CL -&gt; Shock.
---
Why would you be waiting? Does everyone forget all the player emergent content in classic? Instead of waiting, form a group and go raid Durotar or something. I don't understand why everyone wants to stick their head in the sand and grind quests without interruption.
---
Gnomish Mind Control Cap. Use the player to help kill his friend and then finish him.
---
nah that's default. you can check other vanilla vids too
---
Setting cvars was for sure a thing in Vanilla.  You could use it for ground clutter and all sorts of things.  They all just resided in config.wtf file that you could edit manually if you wanted.

Nah thats a little much

It's the stress test and warrior is the default class.

No because not everyone will complete the content even in years. The 1% tryhards that will rush through everything and then complain can just start a new character or account.

As it is, diablo 3 seasons are too short for the average player. I've never played it enough to think, I wish the next season would start. Instead I get put off from playing seasons at all because I know I'll just have to start over sooner than I'd like.

If blizz want to open a new set of classic servers 5 years in, that's fine. It shouldn't disrupt people who are attached to their toons and server and just want to keep going.

Oh god no.  The game died with Wrath and I haven't been back since.
---
See you in two months!
---
spot on
---
You should get out more
---
For sure man congratz :D
---
Only allowing group layer transfers when in the same zone as someone else coupled with the "sticky" layer preference when reloggong will prevent any abuse.
---
... Goddamn it. I stopped trying to get in around 10pm EDT on Wednesday after the servers went down. I figured it was over.

Yeah, I bet your name is something crappy and common like "Zack"

Thanks for confirming guys!
---
I understand about the order in which content came to vanilla and so on but not having WSG until that long time is a bit counterintuitive. WSG is available from level 10 and is great for PvP at lower levels but when it finally opens everyone will be 60. Sure you can level an alt but still.

I like your beta testing technique
---
I remember finding this shortcut back in vanilla! I'm happy to see it works exactly like 15 years ago. Good job devs!
---
Classic yes, BC no. #Nochanges
---
Lategame has always been Civ's weakness.
---
lmao!
---
Transcendent?
---
That moment you loot stoneslayer as a mortal strike warrior in your mid 40's.
---
It was a beta test.  It's very possible they set it to randomly assign you to a different layer when you logged in just to observe how multiple layers interact and to actually stress test them.
---
Yea but they work because they are so corny that it's funny. I feel like the joke will get old pretty fast tho.
---
On launch day I would very much expect more people to be on a classic server than a bfa server but that's not indicative of the true classic desire. By October I would assume the populations will stabilize and then we will see how the community at large really feels.
---
Layering should not exist, have more realms with shared name db, divide em into battlegroups and then join from within the groups if needed.
---
I kind of wish Blizzard would occasionally launch weird servers like this. It'd be really cool to see the meta change depending on the max level or other factors.
---
I remember your guild. I played with this same username on Sargeras. I ran a guild on there that eventually absorbed into Mob Mentality. I mostly tooled around in World PvP as a Rogue and Mage. Kinda grew away from the game as raiding became a bit more than I wanted to commit at the time.
---
What is it about classic that makes EVERYONE better?
---
It’s almost like the no lifers are the problem. “It’s not layering that kills servers, it’s no lifers with layering who do”
---
Sorta similar to “guns don’t kill people...people kill people”
---
Unless we ban the no lifers (lock up the crazies) we have to accept some drawbacks, as like the second amendment—layering isn’t negotiable in the short term. 
---
Luckily classic wow isn’t the us constitution, it’s presumably easier for blizzard to implement rules that limit exploitive behavior.
---
Flying mounts in vanilla #nochanges
---
Yes. I have been playing vanilla wow as I work.
---
I do mortgages and work from home. My computer setup is 5 monitors. 4 for work and one for my pc. I mostly take calls all day and it is easy for me to play as I do this.
---
Ya I'm sure people like it. Some people like being tied up and socks put in their mouths.... Some people even like BfA. I won't tell them how to live their lives.
---
Honestly think we should have to join the same layers as our friends rather than just being invited to them.
---
Well if it is intentional then please see the first part of my argument :D.
---
Layering will be removed by the end of Phase one anyway. Economies will stabilize and life will go on.
---
So either you will play it or... well you know the rest. GG.
---
Just don't accidendally create a bot lol
---
I too was once 12 and unmarried.
---
haha exactly and he was talking like i'd never played wow and i was just like CMOOOON MAN JUST SHH
---
When my level 29 hunter was farming leather in hinterlands on a PvP server.  I attacked every single  horde that came near me (they were all skulls to me)..  After a week the horde stopped coming anywhere near me. After I left a higher level guildy needed some leather so I sent them to the same spot..    After a few hours she messaged me.. "Um the horde are all acting really weird here, they run up to me, /salute me, then /cry then run away, what's up with that?".
---
Says who!?
---
Yeah, but then you have to play EA games :(
---
lol so sensitive? did you figure out how to invite someone yet?
---
Hi, /u/bestia62
---
I honestly don't give a shit about the 4 difficulties.
---
Why? Because I don't run them.
---
Why? Because I mythic raid.
---
Outside of maybe wanting to target a specific trinket that just wont drop and is awesome even at a low ilvl there is no reason to run LFR or Normal.
---
Heroic is run for maybe 2-3 weeks then its speed farm clear if you feel like it as you go to mythic.
---
I'll never understand people who talk about the 4 difficulties as if you have to run the 4 if you're a mythic raider.
---
LFR / Normal and to a large extent Heroic are simply for the super casual people.
---
Removing those difficulties would have zero impact on someone raiding mythic.
---
&gt;But why do that when you can just cut mechanics and call it content? Way easier and investors love it.
---
"Investors" love it because PEOPLE who play the game love it. Because PEOPLE who play the game but aren't good / dont have time to raid get to still see the storyline raid content. So they stay subbed.
---
Casuals who do LFR/Normal are generally NOT actually that stupid. They just have neither the time nor inclination to learn to play, or to raid.
---
I can understand how it might remove the "oh shit that guy is in tier 6 gear holy fuck wow" vs "oh shit that guy has my armour but its purple i guess he does mythic" but the reality is that  they made the change because the vast majority of the player base never got to see the raid content at all.
---
And honestly, I think after 15 years the 'awe' factor has long worn off and you wouldn't have that feeling any more anyway.
---
God damn, I really want to see a group of 10's kill VanCleef. That would so badass.
---
That is certainly possible. Or it could be a round-robin type balancing system to keep the layers marginally balanced population-wise. So there's less chance of a "dead layer".
---
This stuff will have to be relearned but it probably will be quicker. There is vague stuff you might disagree with, like people playing games for longer/more of their life, being used t more complex encounters and classes. Maybe plenty of them wont enjoy a time investment grindy gamestyle and wont do it but thats not really not being good enough. The irrefutable arguments are that people across the board probably have much better online communication for holding guilds together, disseminating information, and straight up having 40players with good internet is way more likely to occur
---
you can do that in fraps to. Just have to set a timer before. Bad thing is that if you set like 5 mins and the fight goes for 6 mins you will lose the last min.
---
I mean I hate to call it \*all\* clunky and outdated. Some of them were designed with intent, not necessarily because they were broken. And by 1.12 things had become much more properly fleshed out. I just think it was all... different. Not setting the expectations we have now of "Well my class should have \*all\* the tools it needs." And maybe having slower combat is not something to look down on. Honestly I kind of miss my old turn-based JRPG mechanics. Even the new FF7 remake is revamping that aspect, and it kinda got me down.
---
Fast paced games are exciting, but I'd love if more new games took a slower gameplay pace too.
---
They are working out all the bugs so when you get in you won't complain about broken things.
---
Nah, they won't. Six months is more than enough to permanently damage the economy. See garrisons in WoD
---
"hey you wanna join this group quest ?"
---
"sure just give me 40 min to run to stormwind so I can get on your layer"
---
yeah great immersion
---
We need a filter on the sub that filters out any post with the word "layer" in the title.
---
&gt;I was up at 1am, and my alarm goes off at 4am for work,  raiding Hogger with a bunch of level ones during the stress test and it was the most fun I’ve had in the game since my TBC days.
---
It's been amazing reading stories like this :)
---
These are the kind of events with deep emotions, events that transform into long lasting memories. The kind of things you will most likely remember 5, 10 years from now on.
---
..I didnt? I dont think Mark Kern is a household name lol
---
Edit: just asked my mom. She doesnt know who he is
---
Do people say retail is easy? I mean questing is a bit mind numbing at times etc but any  mythic plus/raid etc  content is light years ahead of classic. Most people complain content is just boring sadly
---
I expected this so hard when I saw this post. And it didn disappoint me
---
Lol you don't even need to do the barrel jump or whatever, it's pointless, you can literally just walk off the edge and fall down on the platform below.

---
The vile familiars are red in Valley of Trials
---
It's the only thing to talk about at this stage, or would you rather have 100 more 10 sec twitch clips from tips out dying to WC bosses?
---
It really has. It's important to keep bringing this up until people know what layering actually is, and what road it will lead down to. Thankfully there is still time. I predict if layering will make it in, you'll see a big change of mind from the folk who have settled with it as a way to deal with launch, because the effects as they will play out will make it clear as to why it has no place in classic.
---
I just don't want to be "forced" to layer abuse. It is likly going to be the optimal way to farm if left in as is now, and I would rather play the game like its supposed to be played to farm, but im going to chose the optimal way just like i get worn down to do in every game I play, that has stuff like this.
---
People think the sky is falling because they're testing out layering.
---
It‘s edited like in 2005 but it still looks too good. Go record on fraps with 1GB of ram :P
---
Just kidding good job :D
---
We're going to try anyway :) 
---
I'm thinking maybe camping a resource spawn location. Not sure I could do more. Maybe fishing on "stretch/bio" breaks or something. Or AH work.... but I hate the AH game.
---
Any of these happen to be a priest? Im debating warrior or priest seems like every streamer is a warrior.
---
Yes, by 0.1%, so it's absolutely worth it.

I was looking at my old screenshots last night and found one of my 60 spec I believe its a 21/8/22 spec... As for the gear I don't really have screenshot of detailed item but I have some of my 60 gear I believe.
---
Getting of work in 2hours ½ if no one posted and answer I'll provide my screenshot.
---
Wow that's retarded beyond anything iv read here today. So you want to screw the community. the people who don't win at rng lottery when picking the same realm? Rofl. How about 0 layer crap.
---
tbf at this point mods should just make a megathread for layering instead of there being 200 posts that mainly all mention the same points
---
probably this?  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheoRxzZGcZVMecc0o](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheoRxzZGcZVMecc0o)
---
Teleport is nice for sure, but with efficient and timely use of your hearthstone, it's really not much of an issue. Also, a mage still has to travel to that city to train the teleport/portal spells from the portal trainer anyway. I just find it odd that you're so staunchly defending mages when you said you've never played one, ever. I have and there are some extremely frustrating level windows where it feels extremely slow, and that's because it is at times. Spell ranks can feel both good and bad. Getting a new frostbolt rank feels good...for a few levels, then it feels pretty poor for a few more, and so on and so on. Without ample spell power gear (which you won't get a lot of while leveling) you simply don't scale up while leveling in the same way physical damage dealers do.
---
But you make your own food and water right? Maximum efficiency! Oh wait, you train a new rank every 10 levels and it takes three full mana bars to make a few stacks at the beginning of those levels, and 5 more levels after that you can just purchase more efficient water from a vendor, meaning every second half of each 10 levels you'll be using less powerful water unless you buy it.
---
In regards to hunters being "least wanted classes for dungeon spamming".... are you sure you played vanilla wow? If you did, maybe you only ever played with terrible hunters? They're one of the better damage dealers to bring to a dungeon. I played my hunter well during vanilla and on private servers and had no issues getting group invites for dungeons.
---
* Good burst damage which is perfect for dungeon trash/bosses. (yes, they fall off pretty quick after T1 raids)
---
* Freezing Trap isn't limited to specific mob types like poly/shackle/sap/etc. are.
---
* Target tracking can help find rares, and specific targets (Lyceum in BRD for example)
---
* Aspect of the Pack!
---
* Kiting has become such a widely adopted strat for some bosses that I'd wager many groups couldn't kill General Drakkisath without a hunter in the raid.
---
You should seek help
---
The argument is that no transmog motivates people to actually do the content, whereas with it people arent motivated to do mythic and improve or to admire good players, they just roll through an old raid and now are indistinguishable. Aesthetics are a big part of rewards in an rpg, and collapsing the reward structure is obviously damaging to the game
---
/u/Pikseh is right. The mage never simply turns their character around... he keeps jumping away and then turning. I did the same thing on other servers, you just outrange it and it doesn't go off.
---
I did the same with my pet when playing as a hunter. Recall your pet when the cast time starts and your pet doesn't get petrified.
---
Because I don't want to fight orcs
---
yeah but its not the end of classic or completely fucking economy like people are saying, and anyone thats spamming mining logon/off in the 1st two weeks wont be leveling much
---
Damnit, I had just gone in at that point. About 1 minute before they announced shut down in 15 minutes. Stupid work. See you all in the next stress test! (Or probably not)
---
I think you're misinterpreting! I don't use backpedal for every other situation than that very specific one; it's simply more efficient to go through your enemy than to 180, especially if you wanna keep track of what's happening where your enemy is. In other situation, I 100% don't use backped haha

now combine them: TBC style progression where raids increase in difficulty and will always be relevant for at least some portion of the playerbase, and Ulduar style hard modes where guilds can adjust difficulty (and reward) on a per-boss basis... congrats, you just made the greatest MMO of all time.
---
yeah the face cam and stupid adds on the right ruin this clip, no thanks.
---
Well and that's the thing with Retail v Classic to. Yes Retail can offer challenging and engaging content, but you have to trudge through much less challenging and engaging content (leveling) to get there. Classic's leveling experience is my favorite aspect of it, and it's challenges and set back is what made the game entertaining throughout.
---
I’m an IT consultant, so I can technically work anytime that I want regardless if it’s for WoW or not, as long as I get my 40 hours in for the week. I definitely set my schedule up to have more free time in the afternoon and work earlier in the morning to get my time in.
---
I did know a guy that would wake up at 3am and work until around 1 PM to get his time in. He’s spend the rest of the day playing games and wouldn’t go to sleep until 11 PM usually.
---
Okay, but if you want to do the hard shit, you either slam your head against overtuned bosses hoping for perfect RNG on raid mechanics to barely scrape by a kill (Jaina, Ghuun, etc) while Blizzard nerfs it every single week for average guilds to actually be able to kill it or you spam ever-increasing variables of bloating damage and health until your gear level literally doesn't allow for the possibility of completing the content (HIGH keys).
---
So, if you want a base level experience, retail is easy. The slider between what is expected of you and what is possible are on two completely different sides of the player power spectrum. Most of the difficulty in classic is doing the content at the start or middle of your gear treadmill. Of course you could always equip a bunch of fucking level 30 whites and get assfucked every single pull and boss for 3 hours in Blackrock Spire in Classic if that's your idea of challenge, but it's not like anyone would sit here and say that's what makes the game challenging.
---
Or maybe, stay with me here, layering is built off of sharding technology so until they fix it some of the same issues might exist? Crazy idea, I know. Game devs never re-use old tech as a starting point, especially not Blizzard.
---
Rbg also contributed to that. But even with wsg etc. In Vanilla there were no drops in world pvp action.
---
Who are you playing with where people are sabotaging? Don't PUG.
---
There is a fuckload of content to run when you’re at the ZG patch and trying to get your guild geared for AQ. Speed clears are a must because raid morale can destroy a guild.
---
Okay as someone who is new to twitch (as of the beta) I’ve been too shy to ask... wtf do POG and OMEGA mean?! I can intuit omega, pog I have no idea. Please educate me kind sir
---
LFR and Vanilla Raiding are both easy.
---
His first example was bc bud
---
As a 12 year old in 2005, i did not manage to play vanilla at endgame (7 months to lvl 42 🤦‍♂️), but i do remember SL/SL lock in TBC. My question is: was it siphon life or soul link that dominated in vanilla?
---
Do you like the taste of dog shit?
---
We need layering to only last the first week.
---
WHICH CLASS SHOULD I PLAY?@??@#?@
---
RemindMe 96 days "Do it"
---
What Classic does well as far as leveling is that your sense of power gain is jagged and bumpy. You come across some mobs that start kicking your ass, until finally you gain a level, get a new rank of your abilities, get a critical talent, get some new gear etc... Then those level of mobs start feeling easy and you get the feeling of actually being rewarded. Then you reach a new zone and maybe those guys start kicking your ass again, but you check your trainer and your talent tree and look forward to the next thing you know will help you overcome the challenge. That's a strong reward cycle that is missing in the streamlined retail version.
---
lol oh shit
---
It would be impressive if we could play a full height orc; I’m just saying that despite how much I don’t like male blood elf’s posture, it is better than having scoliosis. Trolls and Orcs both have npcs that don’t have broken backs, moreover, if an entire species suffered from such a thing, they would hardly be able to fight let alone take part in a war. 
---
It doesn’t hold up in a RP setting at all...
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/34530
---
2-12 characters
---
Be warned, gw2 is even more streamlined than retail wow in terms of getting around the world, queueing for things and instancing of things. Gear is almost meaningless and the majority of gear progression is aesthetic only. Its a gorgeous game and great for exploring. But its a completely different beast than wow.
---
I'm pretty sure that's a normal Vanilla thing that has nothing to do with Phasing.
---
You could do this in vanilla too.
---
Glasses that block blue light, fam! My eyes are always far less sore after starting at computer screens all day (work and play).
---
Straw Poll: which class do you plan on playing?
---
I agree we need layering but the implementation should be done better then it won't matter if it lasts for the first week or the entire phase 1.
---
That's actually pretty funny :D
---
Who in the world does not know about this shortcut? Like honestly..
---
&gt; model of gnomes is fine i like it personally so deal with it
---
that's a good argument if I've ever seen one
---
Yea they won't die in 15 seconds if no one is buffed and no on is playing the right spec tho
---
YOU don't get 40 man raiding
---
Trust me, you start letting everyone do waht they want. And what they want is not optimum as a PvEr. 
---
What should be very easy encounters all throughout vanilla will ramp up in difficulty by quite a bit. Which is not a good thing in a guild full of plebs who don't even pick the optimum PvE on a 15 year old patch
---
40 man raiding is about standards, the reason Esfand doesn't get into a good guild is because he woudl break the stanadrs. No one cares if you play ret pala perfectly if you're still beneath all the real DPS. Certainly no one is going to sit around and wait for you to drink. No one competent anyway
---
Layering does not make Classic WoW the same experience.  They said they were putting everything back the way it was.  There was no layering back then.  It's going to change everything.
---
so lets make taurens a bit bigger
---
That's an interesting idea actually. Might be! I wonder what the other clips that were posted look like.
---
This is really good info as zin’rokh will spend most of its time sheathed... on hunters backs
---
So many people trying to convince me to level up slower, but they're clearly all just trying to keep the high-level zones to themselves. I'm onto you guys. :p
---
God im so tired of this subs salt. Fuck off ya no life cuntberry
---
Nah - sharding killed all social interactions in the game.
---
Yes, and one is A LOT easier than the other. To the point where comparing them to each other and making them equal means you're pretty dim.
---
I get it, you're to cool to be able to analyze them as anything other than some shit you do with one hand while you make five photo models orgasm with the other. I respect that. But it means you're cool, and a moron.
---
I will be going into vanilla with this mindset. No add ons, no searching up quests. I am just going to enjoy the game in all its glory. I remember doing this troll questline in the hinterlands and for some reason that really stuck with me. I had no idea where it would lead me or what was the point. I remember running all over the Eastern Kingdoms to complete it. I loved it.
---
couldn't tell you a single great questline from the last 7 years.
---
lol.  The same.  Got geared up in PVE MC/BWL/AQ gear and PVP'd as a Marksman hunter, with the Rhok'delar bow.  2 shot crit kills were common.  I too had the Unreal Tournament mod installed that would shout out kills.
---
I wish I had video of that, I will have to check my old PC when I get home to see if I have some screenshots of kills in PVP.
---
I also remember Alterac Valley Wolves and ZG Bats in PVP... :)  This was before blizz normalized pet run speeds, so they both would sprint at like 200% move speed at clothies, and then attach with their 1.0 speed auto-attack.
---
I named my pet "Lexiesmom" after one of the alliance Grand Marshall Paladins on our server.
---
That, and finished the Rhok'delar hunter quest with the reward popping up, and then a server shutdown in 5 minutes message having me worry that I was going to lose my bow!!
---
If you stop 10 levels sooner you can use [Staff of Jordan] in your bis weapon slot. Windfury weapon + staff equip proc = 180+26+46*2 = 492 on windfury procc on a max hit, before armor.
---
Some numbers may be off because I'm just not great at the maths, just watching big numbers fly.
---
The beauty of this is that the staff works on windfury weapon so you get that extra 26 damage on top of the 46 attack power from rank 1 windfury.
---
This isn't even accounting for other bis gear.
---
There's a reason why shamans are a terror in the 35-39 level bracket when they're twinked.
---
Me, been playing since 2004.
---
The average LFR boss fight has more mechanics to manage than the average classic raid fight.
---
You're really confused. I'm talking about 40 mans in Vanilla.
---
What I'm saying is that the degree of difficulty in vanilla raids is VASTLY overstated by a lot of people in the community. A player with a modicum of skill (and a decent group of likeminded friends) can easily watch a few videos and defeat any of the vanilla raids in the course of a week given decent gear and a knowledge of skill rotations. The mechanics are just not that difficult.
---
Also, if you think I'm trying to "look cool" in a Classic WoW forum, you're even more confused than I thought.
---
If you're intent on trying this, I've been theory crafting as well and encourage you to instead try https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zE0hqoxVMdV 
---
Since weaving autoattacks doesnt work in classic.
---
You could conserve mana by increasing the damage of your melee, and if you go completely oom for whatever reason you could still do damage while not casting to allow spirit to kick in.
---
Youd cast lightning bolts in melee until you get a crit. Then youd swap from your caster weapon to a 2h axe with windfury (your Swing timer is already at 0 from casting so you aren't losing anything) and then melee while you have elemental devastation with flurry, with decent gear it's probably about 34% melee crit chance. You could either cast shocks during this to look for more crits if you have high mana or you could cast nothing at all, letting spirit kick in after 5 seconds and regaining some mana. When devastation falls off you could cast more lightning bolts until you get another crit.
---
 **Since it's pretty apparent that Layering is here to stay.** What? Did I miss something?
---
That's your individualized opinion, but I strongly disagree with it. DPS is, for the most part, a cycle of the same exact rotation over and over again. Healing is reaction based and I find it extremely satisfying.
---
was a warr in vanilla and took a lot of pride in what you are describing. Not going warr this time around so i certainly hope i meet and make friends with a couple people like you.
---
Don't forget they love to spawn quest mobs in packs of 5-6 so even with cc soloing is a nonstarter.
---
I needed a group for these fucking gnolls in Wetlands
---
Great post. Thank you.
---
Oh I'll probably have a 19 twink by then
---
This aggression will not stand, man.
---
No one even Said it would last the whole of phase 1.
---
If some1 Gets shits load of iron it does not matter.
---
I believe it will be gone when the first player hits 60. Maybe short after.
---
Also, they May change it so relog wont change layer (save for relog of say several hours)
---
No one knows how it will work excatly, so no, irs not DoA. Maybe for you, but go play a pserver then, I guess you can play with Alex :)
---
I never saw the old talent systems as offering much more than the illusion of choice. Most of us just googled cookie cutter specs and sometimes you had a few leftovers to play with. I didn't have a problem with the new system considering how many talents were added on by that time, but I would have preferred they just space out talent gains and made them more meaningful than revamp the system entirely.
---
Oh I didn't know that! Good to know
---
What?
---
you can share your opinion in the same threads instead of making a new post though =/
---
Priest is the other class I was thinking of rolling 😂
---
Definitely twelve. I had to shorten my name by 1 “L” because 13 was too long.
---
The funny thing is that unless you sort by new, you don't see anything constructive about layering on the first few pages.
---
It's also ironic that one of the top all time posts about layering is encouraging people to have discussion because blizzard listens yet in actuality, discussion is down voted no matter how constructive. 
---
Now all blizzard gets are memes and shitty twitch clips.
---
Congrats on doing your part to prevent the positive development of this game.
---
&gt; FRAPS recording all the time
---
Back in my day we had to anticipate the clip and start capturing because fraps had a 30 or 60 second limit.
---
&gt;Or am I not understanding this correctly? Is it players 1-6 layered, or specific subzones like Valley of Trials, Shadowglen, Deathknell, Northshire Abbey, etc?
---
That's the tricky part - the entire region is layered.
---
So I agree if it was in fact 1-6 areas only then we are all good! 
---
But blizzard can't guarantee that since something like STV will be so populated after a few days that we'll just move the 1-6 experience to other zones.
---
Also six months, where is YOUR source? You keep asking youself :)
---
If you head to the Ruins of Ordil'Aran (north of Maestra's Post in Ashenvale) there are mobs that have imps/vws summoned, and they will spam you full of shadowbolts until the end of time. Fighting these on my bear prior to getting cat form was the biggest challenge I've faced on beta so far.  
---
Mobs on pservers are for the most part just not scripted right, I agree, but this particular example can not be applied globally.
---
All classes need gear and all classes need gold.
---
10 hours is a bit hyperbolic... I think I dinged 10 with 59 minutes played but with overcrowding on launch this might be 2 hours. If you break away from the pack and get more space hitting 18 under 12 hours is easy. Really just depends on launch size crowding.
---
The thing that is really nice is always the first alt character.
---
No matter what your main is, you shovel money, gear, recipes at your alt, and suddenly the gimpest class becomes a powerhouse, and strong classes become gods gracing the mortals.
---
But what if getting that next skill or rushing is the only way I have fun?
---
Yeah im just lvling on a pser now to practice some routes ect, and going to try and get 100g by that point so I can prep for it in classic
---
Vanilla also had no where near the initial population Classic will have.
---
Don’t let anyone tell you how you should play, period. Especially if you’re 15y older than when you first tried the game. You have “no balls” and want to play the game slowly, focusing on PvE and exploration? C’mon... so what? I’m actually surprised so many people keep saying a great part of vanilla was about the journey to lvl 60 and the feeling of gradual progress and they want to rush the game at the same time.
---
Wow, that's impressive. Not sure what else to say.
---
It's faceroll... when you have lots of gear.
---
At the very start of the expansion the first Mythics you step in to with your garbage gear aren't any easier than dungeons used to be really.
---
The thing to remember is that wow doesnt have progression through raids any more. You're skipped to the current tier.
---
So if you're trying a mythic dungeon months later when the world quests drop gear thats 10x better than what was available at launch then no shit it's a face roll.
---
LFR is for people who have zero time to raid and just want to see the cool boss / story aspect.
---
Normal is for people who just want to experience the social aspect of raiding with their guild/friends but don't have time / care to commit to learning their class or studying boss guides etc.
---
Heroic is for people who don't want to put in much time, but still want something of a challenge - without really caring about min maxing their character or getting weak auras set up etc.
---
Mythic is for people who want a challenge.
---
Vanilla wow raiding didn't really have a solution for that either.
---
The raids up to MC are faceroll easy if you look at them from todays perspective.
---
The 'challenge' is getting enough people to show up who spent time grinding consumables before the raid. Another faceroll activity.
---
I like vanilla a lot. Infinitely more than retail as a game to sink time in to, but the raiding aspect is just infinitely better now than it was.
---
Just asking a simple question. I mean, its all subjective anyway right? ;)
---
No, but it will matter if someone gets a shitload of devilsaur leather / black lotus / dreamfoil.
---
No, you can't. If you expect a gouge coming, face the other way.
---
 E.g. Good druids in TBC turned while casting for this exact reason after faking a kick, to force KS or blind or eat clone. So much depth to a seemingly simple game.
---
I expect it's the same with mage pokies in vanilla.
---
Profiting off layer phasing by habitually changing layers to mine more ore than would otherwise be possible is abuse of game mechanics or at best “clever use of game mechanics”. 
---
Doing this could and in my opinion should be considered cheating.
---
Blizzard should implement tech to limit this. People who find ways to abuse layering—even for habitually dodging wpvp should be subject to bans and suspensions if caught.
---
*insert gif of De Niro shaking his finger*
---
oh yah that was nice. 
---
it's like who replaced my char with this little bad ass.
---
&gt;It's not at all akin to selling classes, you don't pick a champion once and then stay on it. Arguably that's what an expansion pack is selling a class anyway  
---
Neither do you in WoW. Most people have multiple classes and specs ready whenever they are needed for progress whether it be PVP or PVE.  
---
&gt;you just seem like someone who is so against spending money that you'll cry the second a free game monetizes something  
---
If the game is free and it monitizes cosmetics its fine. As long as its not predatory (massive gambling) or making everything else super ugly in order to sell cosmetics.  
---
&gt;Most people wouldn't consider Apex Legends p2w, even though it's the same mechanic  
---
Apex sells characters? You would think they learned from Fortnite.  
---
Its p2w if it sells characters. And most people are dumb so I wouldn't consider what majority thinks.  
---
&gt;Don't let the internet decide your opinion, it's a real easy mistake for the older generation to make since they are newer to the internet  
---
I decide my own opinion. I grew up with completely free games or games that are b2p and give you all content. If you're a zoomer that grew up with extreme p2w games, I can see how you can't see that LoL and alike are p2w as well, sdly.  
---
&gt;Also the game didn't even have ranked when it shipped lol, it was just blind pick  
---
Sure. Your point? It added ranked later.
---
Graphic Designer who works remotely at home for real estate. God help me.
---
Not just that but back in the day server stability was still a very real thing. There were nights when we couldn't make any raid progress because the server lag was too hard to deal with. We were on Bleeding Hollow (which was big but not enormous) at the time and I'd imagine it wasn't uncommon for decently sized servers.
---
Sure lets clear naxx by december. Why the fuck not
---
.. and instead only pray to the one and only real god that actually exists. Proof: the bible.
---
Arena and Flying Mounts literally ruined wpvp.it was totally feasible to get enough honor in world events etc. But because the best gear for PvP came with arenas, the only wpvp you saw was lowbie gankers and people fighting over mat farms, which is most events you would just fly over anyways. Then with the introduction of resilience it completely divided the PvP and PvE player bases, the removal of resilience came too late and then PvP only gear was a thing that the masses liked, so they had to keep it going forward and ended up ruining raiding with people clearing raids in mostly full PvP gear by the end of WoTlK.
---
Yeah same xD
---
Clearly you have to put mayo on both slices of sandwich so matter what layers lie beneath, you get a taste of mayo before anything else.
---
Yes, I actually made another shaman in vanilla and stopped at 39. I didn't gear it as well but also a great level. I also had a 29 Hunter and 19 rogue. I liked it lol.
---
I was lucky and got a spot, playing from Switzerland.  Average Ping of 120 so it is a bit laggy. I won't complain though:)
---
tbh, by the time he's relogged I would've found 2 more nodes by running around.
---
That said, if this bug exists on launch day, it will be a problem. 
---
Although I still believe Blizz when they say that it's only a few weeks.
---
Except the mechanics in LFR fights can and are ignored in almost every case.
---
When I did naxx in vanilla my lock was consistently ahead of all other classes. But yeah, might have just been bad idk
---
I've definitely relied on nameplates to tell me where an enemy player or mob is sitting, especially in BGs.
---
This needs to be fixed because it's a literal game changer.
---
It’s easy to find group as rouge when every group brings 5 +
---
Bro if you played Vanilla you would realize that BG's were released fairly late after Vanilla dropped. And originally didn't start at 10, but 21 because the BG's were 21-30, 31-40, 41-40, 51-60. 
---
And you had to actually walk to the instance portal of the BG in question.
---
So its really not counter intuitive at all
---
I really wonder, is no one willing to just let the classic launch be fucking crazy for a couple days, as you'd expect from a MASSIVEmorpg, in fact the most massive one out there? The devs have stated there will be queues regardless of layering, and sharding originally was created to battle queues, that's it. 
---
So at launch, with layering, you'll when you finally make it in, play in one of the "Worlds" of Warcraft (and you won't know which one) rather than one World, one Azeroth and it's characters residing there (aka your server). You'll eventually get to see behind the curtain of what machine is running this world as you'll eventually see other use layering to their advantage, taking away authenticity. It instances the whole world into multiple instances. That's not the classic experience. And it may last longer than you'd expect right now on top of that. 
---
I'd take the shitshow for a couple days anyday and get to actually play classic, over playing a layered version of it and see the ripple effect layering will have on the game play out.
---
I'm a try hard as much as anyone but the last time I tried to tell people that a good portion of the fun in WoW is the leveling process I had a bunch of try hards downvote me.
---
What can one do? The leeway is insane, broken..
---
Damn that looks interesting. I will definately give it a try, thanks for the response!!
---
Alright, boys. Put away the pitchforks and REEE horns. Looks like we got the wrong guy.
---
Cities Skylines is poop
---
Every city is the same, because they HAVE to start the same; due to the objective mechanic
---
Having a mod to unlock everything from the start made the game, well, actually a game - so much better
---
I'm really disappointed that you did not take the opportunity to make a better/butter pun.

You can also just step out of melee range during the cast to avoid basilisk stone gaze
---
People forget when WoW first launched it wasn't the biggest thing, server pops climbed throughout all of the original release. You never had something like Classic WoW where a shit ton of people are gonna be there day 1
---
nah
---
Shadow Priest would be great.  We always raided with one shadow priest for the Vampiric Embrace to help heal the 5 man they were in.  The debuff slots in classic will be 16, so Shadow Priests are more viable.  They will never be the #1 DPS class, (Warriors, Rogues, Mages) but they can be useful in raid groups that have a spot for them.  We also had a lot of Warlocks in the guild, so the Shadowpriest was pretty beneficial to that group.
---
That was pretty impeccable timing. Might be on to something.
---
Huh? He was talking about WSG coming out in 2020 and you said you thought it should be early 2021. Who the fuck wants to wait 1.5 years for battlegrounds?

You need to get the betterTTV and FrankerZFaces browser extensions so that they shoe up as emotes.

Classicuck downvotes because LFR is way harder than any vanilla instance LMAO
---
I don't understand why people like him.
---
Just cause you can do something doesn't mean people will take you for that. You expect people to take prot paladins to raids instead of bringing them as holy?
---
It technician, at summertime me and my collesgues play some sc2, but now it Will be wow classic, and this is when we have nothing to do so yes, i can play games.
---
Classic is using the same height/skeleton as Retail.
---
Your post makes no sense.
---
OP is comparing Vanilla (not Classic) to Classic (which like I said, uses Retail height)
---
It's twitch chat emotes. PogChamp is the emote for an excited, mouth agape face. https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/36g6b3/what_does_pogchamp_mean/

I remember the max was for sure 12 characters. I remember this cause I wanted my first character's name to be something over that and so I had to make it shorter until it fit the max letter requirement.
---
Do you even know what layering is?There will not be an empty layer. That would be stupid. You either refuse to understand because of your bias or you are intellectually incappable of it.
---
Leader of the pack is way stronger than Nature's swiftness unless you're doing pvp. There's little reason to go so deep in feral and not take the best talent.

That was the free version. You knew who didn't buy it from the people videos who only had 30 second or less clips stitched together.

Why is it always this bickering on reddit. It's a joke, dont take it as anything else guys. :D

We're not downvoting 'just because'. We're downvoting because we have this thread EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

The beta has been out for a week, and people (like you) are acting like everything is set in stone and completely unfixxable, like the world is about to explode if this isn't fixxed RIGHT NOW.

I'm just fed up with people crying wolf when there's no reason to.

STOP USING PRIVATES TO COMPARE STUFF!!!!!

The main difference between layers that will merge and servers that will merge is that when we join we don't know what servers will merge with other servers. We know the layers will merge into the single server.
---
I played as a Rogue on Sargeras during vanilla WoW and cheesed it up. I played a Mage afterwards and did well with that class as well. I think I may go different this time but I may cheese it up with a Rogue once again. Hell... I havn't really decided if I am going to focus on PvP this go around or maybe actually do some real raiding.
---
I wouldn't want to see that under any circumstances. I would be willing to look at layering, say, all of Durotar, Elwynn, Teldrassil, etc but definitely never ever beyond that. By that point people should have trickled out enough that while zones will be crowded players should be on many different quest stages and more spread out.
---
im not sure what this means in the long run, but a blizzard employee on the beta whispered me the script for name plates...
---
 RemindMe! 96 days "Console Command"
---
It's funny cause my original char was a druid, I got to 60 and suddenly healing was what everyone wanted from me, and my fun char wasn't fun no more. (you mean you just want me to follow you guys around, mash 3 buttons, until you tell me to mash one of the other two.(battle rezz or mana refill), you don't want to to hit them, nuke them, nothing.. just those 3 buttons?)
---
Ironically, now days I play almost exclusively healers,
---
They get it 99% right and overtune it slightly so the content isn't completely braindead easy.
---
NPC’s still have DR, but in vanilla it applies to fewer spells and resets more quickly/easily than live.
---
People who don't sort by new confuse me.
---
Cultured?
---
Horde back in vanilla beta/release and always horde.
---
I think a lot of people will start with lock then once they get to stv and get one shot by a rogue a lot will reroll because that shit feels bad.
---
Can't say for certain but it's very likely at this point seeing how much easier dungeons are on the beta.
---
Layering will destroy movie popcorn. We didn't layer our popcorn back went we went to see The Incredibles. The only reason movie theatres want you to layer the popcorn is to cut down on the free-refills.
---
I wouldnt even say this is all that effective, I mean shit 35-45 secs between nodes isnt that pretty fucking normal time span, in fact if you in ungoro you should at least have the lvl 40 mount and running around the rim should net you nodes even faster.              
---
                
---
Granted layer hopping means no combat but still doesnt seem anymore effective then just killing 2-3 mobs and getting the next one...
---
Imagine that you have a cake. You pile a bunch of sugar and shit but there's so much that, like, you can't add any more or it will fall over like a jenga game. So you take your jenga and put it on the cake. Somebody wrote "find a solution to overpopulation on classic wow servers" on the block. So then they have to do that.
---
Yea BC was right there with wrath but I thought the quality of life changes up to the end of wrath were quite nice.
---
Iam back from work :p
---
Yup. Not sure where OP is getting his info.
---
Jesus, calm the fuck down dude. It’s about a fucking battleground, not a whole raid tier.
---
It was a blast! Even though it was so short, i've had such memorable experiences from this test. Haven't had this much fun in WoW for a looooong time! It really showed it's strengths as the community was able to come together like this. And also it's current weakness, by having layering interfere strongly with said community as it tried to come together to have fun. I really hope they'll pick a different solution until launch.
---
Your the one who seem biased. You seem to see no cons with this community and immersion breaking crap. You think it's better for blizzard to save some effort and money than to prioritize the most important part of classic - the community. There will obviously be layers with less people on them than others. And blizzards plan would also not work if people don't leave in mass as they think they will. But your not alone, it jus baffles me how many on this reddit just eats this shit up without question.
---
Ironforge for centrality, and very good layout. And know it mostly by heart. But after the AH became linked I 100% moved to Darnassus. Serenity, peace, and it was mostly me and this Night Elf Warrior from a Russian-or-it's-like guild, which meant low traffic for the poor shared home computer.
---
You're confused. This argument started with the statement that LFR raids are more difficult than raids in vanilla. MORE difficult. LFR raids are not possible to lose as long as a handful of people are trying to win. Can we agree on that?
---
Now you're saying that a group of not complete idiots that want to finish the vanilla raids, can do so. I'm not arguing.
---
Now, for the finale. Would you say that content that requires no person of intelligence, not watching videos or knowing strategy, where a handfull of people are even trying to sabotage the event, IS HARDER, than content that you, yourself, use "people who have watched the videos and are like minded guildmates" as a baseline for?
---
Is that correct? You're saying that content that can easily be beaten when noone cares about tactics and a few people are making active moves to fail is harder than content that requires even slight teamwork from guildies? That LFR for the first boss of an entry raid, is HARDER to finish than a 40 man Nefarian or mid vanilla raid boss?
---
If yes, I'd say you're a moron. If no, then I don't understand why you're arguing with me.
---
Yeah, well, considering I know a lot of where the location of quests are, and have a better understanding of the game as a whole, I'm thinking a month is about the time.
---
I had a huge layering fail yesterday. The lasagna sheets were slightly smaller than the dish, I tried alternating which side I put the noodle to, but it meant the layers were not really clean and the ends were effectively too thick.
---
Eh, don't bother. You and I would look at a massive swarm of players or a raid on Ironforge and think it was awesome, because that's the point of an MMO. OP would just bitch about having to wait 10 minutes for Bronzebeard to respawn or not being able to collect their 10 wolf assholes for whatever forgettable quest they're on. 
---
It's an entitled attitude of convenience at the expense of everything else which is how retail snowballed into the shit how it is today.
---
Yes, yes, yes! I hate blood elves so much. They ruined the horde. Former alliance players flocked to the horde, faction balance was ruined, and suddenly the once beautifully ugly horde became &gt;50% femme elves. And then Ret pallies became favored and Enhance shamans left to suffer!! Horde. Ruined. The transformation brought by blood elves is 100% unacceptable.
---
Yeah because not grouping with a friend that you didn't make in Classic will totally ruin the community in Classic! 
---
Fuck logic.
---
You get assigned layer 1. Your friend is assigned layer 2. You can still make friends within your layer 1, and you will eventually merge with your friend from pre-Classic after phase 1.
---
And I love how "it's only for a couple of weeks - it's fine to exploit layering" is acceptable, but "it's only for a couple of weeks - it's fine not to group with your friend from pre-Classic" is not lmfao.
---
The retardation is beyond belief.
---
I think you might actually be retarded because you are doing a the things you make fun of people for doing first, LOL
---
A *butter* pun you say. Hmmm, any ideas?
---
Oh awesome ty!
---
&gt;You expect people to take prot paladins to raids instead of bringing them as holy?
---
If they had a taunt ... maybe.
---
Undercity. I loved/still love the Forsaken as a race so much that I actually started a guild before WoW came out that was going to be only Undead... until I realized that wasn't practical and we invited everyone in.
---
Good times. Undercity was always so peaceful for me and I could craft/chill in peace and quiet.
---
" **Only allow layer changes from grouping to occur when players are in the same zone.** "
---
"**ALL chat channels should be layer specific.** " 
---
Did you not read what you wrote... 
---
Chat channels should not be layer specific. How would you even group with someone in a different layer without seeing them in chat to begin with. No.. If anything, Nodes should be linked across layers so if node(a) gets taken it will disappear across all layers. That is the best way for them to do it since it would be the exact same way once layering is taken out.
---
&gt;Vanilla did not have sharding
---
lul have fun never leaving starter zone

Kevin's takes on game design are super interesting and valuable to listen to! Can't recommend his stream enough, especially if you wanna learn and get an insight what made WoW so amazing in the first place.

As someone who never had a consistent enough schedule to raid normally, I love LFR. Yes it’s easy, but without LFR, I would never set foot in any current raids. I just use it as a form of raid tourism, it’s great.
---
Anyway I’m really glad it’s not going to be in Classic
---
You should just stay in the singelplayer version of the game known as bfa, good grief.
---
We actually had a sister guild that had a druid main tank. They only did 20 mans, but if we needed people, which we often did because roster management is the hardest thing about vanilla raiding, we pulled from them for our 40 mans. I was a purist and wouldn't have had a druid main tank (though they were fine off tanks).
---
Not gonna watch a 11 min of a guy talking unscripted about why he thinks classic is good. Especially since you know.. I agree it's good.
---
Let me chime in here that you will not crit for 4k (even with sp buff and trinket). Base shadowbolt dmg in full t3 is around 1.2-1.3k. Its still a lot ofc.
---
Insta sub for me
---
That always bothered the crap out of me. How can you dodge an attack you don't know is coming?!?
---
I wonder if having a hidden cooldown on the same node, since they spawn in the same places, is enough to prevent that. This node won't spawn for lets say 5 minutes, you use layering to bypass that, but there is now a hidden cooldown in place on your character only for that node to prevent you from mining it again.
---
Shamans can tank spell casters really well, and hold their own AT BEST as an offtank.
---
Caster / ranged tanks they are excellent at, because of the interrupts, reduced elemental damage taken, grounding, and elemental resist totems.
---
Tanking a normal attack based mob they basically suck because of gearing -- mail armor mixed with no realistic way to get high amounts of +def.
---
But stick a shaman on Bellinda in AV? Hell yeah.
---
Use a shaman to tank General Drakkisath, Maybe not such a great idea.
---
Tanking all the spell caster bosses in Scholomance? Solid.
---
Tanking trash packs that hit hard in any random instance, not so great.
---
&gt; Just let me choose when the switch occurs. I don't want to be auto switched when gathering a resource, or fighting a mob... etc.
---
From what they've said and what I've seen of the beta, this doesn't happen. That's how sharding works, but layering is only supposed to occur when you relog or change continents.
---
You can draw a direct parallel to how the devilsaur mafia controlled a limited and valuable resource on private servers. Being able to swap layers will give a lot more power to organized players that form similar coalitions for resources like black lotuses, arcane crystals, tidal charms, etc.
---
No, not everyone will be able to exploit it. But the people who do will have increased power and control over specific resources.
---
Here's what I've learned as an old person:  
---
All the text coverts to emotes / faces if you bother to install extra shit  
---
POG = derived from 'play of the game' = now just a way to exclaim 'awesome'  
---
OMEGA = a modifier like 'EPIC' used to be when I played 'EPICLOL' 'EPICFAIL' something like that
---
Somebody who refers to anything as a Time sink is already having personal, unaddressed burnout issues that are an unalterable part of their enjoyment of a game.
---
you didnt want 2nd video....
---
Part of the problem, yes you are.

"You get a much butter distribution that way" is an easy one for starters
---
Just get Bloodvine set lool.

Invited today?
---
Let's not make assumptions about the number of layers because I doubt anyone has accurate information on that. Instead we can analyse experience and observation. During the stress test I could see hogger and various boss spawns. It was strange though that your position had an influence on what you saw at a distance. I imagine the goal is that it feels like 1 world while technically it's not? While in Stormwind last hours of the Stress test realm, I didn't see any Ragnaros spawns etc. Question is, why didn't I? My guess would be that to maintain stability there is a limit to how many players can be present in a layer and since I was solo and not in a raid or something my priority to join was bottom.  
---
There is work to be done, good testing!

No you see this isn't a game about interacting with people it's a game about making numbers go up and if I can't do my quest to collect 5 boar dicks right now I'm going to screech and holler.

---
I don't think it'll be worth it to make many classic-esque changes to retail at this point. 
---
Instead, if Classic is successful I hope that they will take many of the lessons learned through the Classic design philosophy and incorporate in a new MMO. 
---
Be it WoW 2.0 or something else, I really want a new Blizzard MMO that captures the excitement of classic WoW with modern gameplay and graphics.
---
But doesn't ping across servers. So it "could" work but only same realm. But blizz will break it like they did the others.
---
IMO season 3 rewards of arena ruined PVE for me because that was the point that the weapons you could get from the top ranking were better than what you could get raiding 40 man stuff like black temple and caverns of time, minus legendaries.
---
Yes, we're all wasting our time playing video games. 
---
The real question is: Are you enjoying yourself? If so, that time isn't "wasted".
---
My small guild had a race through every zone on ground mounts, that was a lot of fun.
---
Agreed
---
\*insert Morpheus meme\*
---
What if I told you that all games are time sinks
---
I do note a significant Alliance population bias here.
---
So let me get this straight, Asmon beats Perplexity in a friendly duel and for some reason we should care? Also why bring in Tips into it all?  
---
Could we just stop with the drama fishing, or should this sub be merged into r/LivestreamFail ?
---
Gotta make it more than 10 minutes to get the money!

---
What are you talking about?
---
More people per zone in contested zones is objectively better
---
The whole point is it's supposed to be a warzone. And in a PvE server why are you even playing classic? lol
---
I am not saying hunters can't do dungeons, but they wouldn't be my top priority, and thats mostly their range limitations that can be awkward in hallways, or other situations.
---
They are completely fine, they have good utility. And are on the same lvl as warlock, with their own niches.
---
And yes, hunters gets free spots in UBRS.
---
And rightly so.
---
He speaks pretty coherently and it isn't rambling, but thats fair. I was just putting it out there for people that couldn't put why they liked classic into words.
---
Nice old school styled edit. but it must be 1024x768
---
Why though?
---
People will be using Discord instead this time around as a tool to find groups. The social activity wont be any higher in classic than it is in BFA really. There are just too many out of game social tools for it. And the beta aka streamers arent a representation of it, they have people sucking their johnsons and being friendly because they worship their streamers.
---
Each of us is responsible for crafting our own Community experience based on who we ignore and who we block and who we group with.
---
AKA, random assholes are everywhere.
---
Modern eq does this pretty simply with their pickzone system but classic enthusiasts would scream if implemented .
---
No he's not, the system shouldn't be exploitable.
---
Okay thanks a bunch. I care more about PVE so will take that into consideration. You think rogues are one of the top dps in endgame raiding?
---
Uhm, guy. No one is arguing...
---
Also, you're actively confusing me with u/baretbh. He's the one who started this. I actually said he was being a bit hyperbolic.
---
Also, seriously, if your day is going to consist of calling people you've never met a "moron" because you misunderstood something they said, it's time to make some life choices.
---
I hate blood elves so much. They ruined the horde. Former alliance players flocked to the horde, faction balance was ruined, and suddenly the once beautifully-ugly rough-around-the-edges horde became &gt;50% soft femme elves. And then Ret pallies became favored by Blizzard while Enhancement shamans were left to suffer!! Horde. Ruined. The transformation brought by blood elves is 100% unacceptable. /spit arwwagrgh I'm getting pissed off all over again just thinking about them.
---
I did not.
---
there were battlemasters later on in vanilla, and as it seems from the WSG test, they will be in at start of classic as well.
---
Kind of sad but it's true
---
Alliance also has paladins, which makes raiding much much easier.
---
L o L
---
Because we know what sharding/layering is and does to the game, and whether or not they're testing it is irrelevant. We know that it will have a significant and unavoidable impact on the game, no matter how it's finally implemented.
---
OP's suggestion is really the only way to handle layering while minimizing the negative impact it has on the game.
---
I made a few friends when I used to drop some acid and do raid finder and join random discords.
---
Probably. But because there's more alliance on this subreddit or because they care about their cities?
---
You are probably right. I played till the release of mists before I lost interest.  Came back in 14 made a daenor level capped all my characters and quit again.
---
I played with basically the same people I'd never met in real life every night for almost 6 years.  I gave my account to one of my wow friends so I would never come back.  That was almost 5 years ago.   I should of kept in touch but never did.....
---
That's the word I was looking for, yeah!
---
Sadly no argument will ever persuade them. Think about how popular fortnite is for example, and the millions of people that say that it still sucks no mather how popluar it is. They will never change their mind. They will just think we are stupid for liking it.
---
You can't group with people on different servers in WoW Classic... that's not the point of our addon. Nor can we teleport you to the dungeon.
---
If they break our addon, they'll be breaking Recount and DBM and KTM. We're only using API calls that those addons depend on in an effort to make sure Blizzard can't do anything without severely changing a guild's dependence on these addons.

---
&gt;Or maybe, stay with me here, layering is built off of sharding technology so until they fix it some of the same issues might exist? 
---
Oh I know that, but a lot of people actually think layering is totally different. The bugs that have been showing up in the beta and stress test confirm that layering is just a version of the sharding tech. Being on a different layer is 100% equivalent to being on a different shard, because it's the same.
---
&gt;On a sidenote, can you point to me where Blizzard said they wouldn't ever shard?
---
Not sure about Blizzard, but for most people in this sub, sharding used to be the number one thing people did not want in vanilla in any form. And then the very moment they announced sharding, everyone started defending blizzard and naming anyone who dared to cricitize the decision as being "toxic".
---
I was pretty sure that tagging a mob with 1 damage and still being able to loot wasn't accurate, that's why I tested it and reported. Nice job being an asshole.
---
So I can waste my time watching a youtube video about wasting time?
---
Fuck yeah it was. My ass was working in a pizza place trying to scrape together enough money for wow cards, gas and a girlfriend.
---
Leveling a separate class first specifically for gold farming is the opposite of tactical if your goal is progress another class entirely be in through PvE or PvP.
---
You don't group with someone in a different layer unless they're already your friend. That's the point.  It's a way to isolate layers into pseudo separate servers while maintaining the capability to seamlessly merge without the issues of a standard server merge.
---
If a layer has a traditional vanilla pop limit, then you should be able to find people in your own layer to group with and have the same level of difficulty finding a group as in vanilla.
---
Oh damn server shutdown just when you got your bow.  Worst that will happen is you'd probably have to turn the completed quest in again.
---
That quest made me a better hunter. I had to learn how to melee with macros to kill the one demon.  I went full melee hunter in PvP to spice things up after that.
---
Upvoted because I am literally hitler. Go Alloance if you want a new experience you aren’t familiar with.
---
I could, but I’m pretty sure they blocked the port for battle net on night that I was just playing hearthstone and league of legends all night long :(
---
Omar Approves.
---
While it's a nice analogy, call a spade a spade. Finding a girlfriend from being at a mutual friends house is more like being invited to a guild because your buddy is already in it.... which happens in both retail and vanilla. 
---
You have to put some effort in to make friends, whether classic or retail. You need to reach out to them, or they need to reach out to you and you accept. Most of the community that regularly uses LFR probably didn't fraternize that much in retail anyway, and aren't looking to make friends. There's also a lot of other ways to find people looking to raid other than chat these days, since wow doesn't whole hog a pc anymore alt tabbing into a browser isn't a pain in the ass.
---
If that’s the case I would hope they would just roll out more servers and offer transfers like they used to
---
That's pretty much his argument. Time invested vs. Reward gained. He was saying an actual evidence of a Time Sink is doing a M 10+ at midnight on Monday to get your chest and it ends up being your 6th ring with the exact same stats. So, it feels like a waste of time.
---
That's just the thing about raids though, if you don't have the time or don't prepare for them then you shouldn't be able to access them. That's what makes them special and dangerous and elite feeling.

Gonna tell all you guys out there thinking of rolling a lock:
---
I commend you. They are very rare and most the time I see a warlock, it's Alliance trying to kill me. Anyone who has the patience to level a lock in Vanilla is a useful addition to any group in my humble opinion as a melee class.
---
"Oh look, another dang frost mage AoE grinding mobs again... no wait, it's a lock! Hell yea."
---
I buff them. They give me underwater breathing. It's a good day in Azeroth.
---
Those facts have no real relevance to their point. The subscriber base was still growing and as such, those lower level brackets had activity. WoW was at 4m subs before BGs in Q3 2005 and were at 6m only 6 months later. With classic and everyone starting on day 1, I find it very unlikely we'll still have millions of people joining by the time BGs are released.
---
Low level brackets will be twinks and stragglers with nothing more.
---
I know BG's were dropped late. I'm not saying it was available or easy to access in vanilla. I'm just saying that its a bit weird to have a part of the game for low level brackets, not available when most people are leveling. I don't really mind either way, it's just an observation.
---
You're browsing new on r/classicwow, you're already wasting your time , welcome lol
---
Easier? Maybe. Faster? No
---
I honestly  dont plan on raiding (IRL family and work) but I will PvP.  In Vanilla I did have a 60 Shaman but as soon as TBC came out I mained a Pally for 4 expansion.  So I do like the idea of playing a paladin.  Plus I heard they are decent 5 man tanks.
---
Right and shaman taunt is an earth totem. The same type of totem they use to put down either an armor buff, a butt to stats like blessing of kings, or a fear removal. Taunt or more armor? It seems counterintuitive that you have to choose between two things needed to tank more effectively.
---
Meanwhile on the alliance side, which cant get shamans in vanilla, they dont run into that problem. Paladin doesnt have taunt so we agree they aren't tanking. But as a healer and maybe even as ret if your guild is kind enough you can still toss out auras. You can give your tank blessing of kings to give the stat boost plus the aura that increases armor. That means the warrior and possibly bear tanks will be more durable than a shaman tank. Something wanted in later raids as bosses start hitting harder. On Horde you can only achieve that by having the shaman go as resto, not really ele as they had mana issues, and dropping the corresponding totems. Yes, shamans can tank we've never denied it. But it hurts the group in the long run to bring them outside of dungeon content.
---
not a boomer but will upvote ya for truth

---
The editing sucks, but the fight was good. Good job.
---
Also, server wide nodes would artificially inflate AH prices compared to natural gold inflow from drops/quests and would be a disaster when layers collapsed. Straight math, indisputable.
---
please test! for science!

ive been thinking about playing a lock in classic this gets me so hyped.

Pog is not play of the game. Its an edit from PogChamp, a global twitch emote, which is gootecks face from a video of him playing pogs
---
As hard as this is going to be to grasp for you, you are only able to do that because the raid boss isn't going for you. Which it isn't because there's a tank and a healer involved. Here's the difference (brace for it, this is gonna be a real head scratcher); in vanilla you'd need the tank and healer to somewhat try to kill the boss. In LFR you don't. That makes LFR EASIER than Vanilla.
---
Does this mean that vanilla is HARD? No. But there's a concept of comparing things to each other even if they both fall into the same category. I think this is somewhere amongst the first few years of human development.
---
I'm pretty sure a four year old could say that one piece of candy is less than three pieces of candy, even if none of them amount to how much candy he or she would have wanted.
---
Are paladins slow to level?
---
Makes sense, I mean honestly imo you lose out if you don't experience both factions , and it's not like.. that big a deal if you regret, rerolling is always an option classic will be out for a long time, hell about half the players who played vanilla started after patch 1.8
---
if you don't have the time or don't prepare for them then you shouldn't be able to access them. That's what makes them special and dangerous and elite feeling.
---
I like to think of it as an investment.  Like playing the slots.
---
I am a bit mad at myself for never saving all of my screenshots from WoW beta and its release. All gone. :(
---
These are cool to see.
---
I'll never understand the obsession with Ironforge. 
---
Yeah, it's nice. But it could be so much better if they just added some lighting to the ceilings; as is it's a little too dark. Also the narrow two-floor shops are kind of annoying to navigate.
---
Nameplates? Or "V bars" as people have come to call them? I know V bars don't show until a specific distance on private servers running Mangos, but I don't have any memory of how specifically they functioned in actual vanilla.
---
To each their own, but I absolutely loathe the new raiding layout.
---
I don't hate the raids themselves, as I actually enjoy them.
---
But the multiple tiers of difficulty and other aspects I do not like.
---
I've always heard they were fine as dungeon tanks, and Off tanks, but I didn't dabble in vanilla druids again until several expansions later.

Yes. But the real reason why horde has faster clear times is largely due to windfury totem
---
Didn't even have to healthstone. Well done.
---
They could just make two difficulties for dungeons. Lets say normal and hard   ..wait
---
They do not. Only on private servers :)
---
Inaccurate spell damage or not, there is no way you can argue that mortal strike knocking off debuffs that increase multiple classes overall damage by 15% or more is ever a winning trade off. Ever. Especially when you can be fury, do more dmg, and not fuck over other classes for your own selfish reason.
---
You cant win this argument. There is no good reason to be mortal strike in raid. Period.
---
That isn't what most people want for classic. We like it the way it is. If you had your way we would all quit and this project would fail.
---
How is it not faster? Kings buffs everyone 10%, and salvation allows dps to go full throttle.
---
I think people are taking this way too far.  How much benefit do you REALLY think people are going to get out of this?  maybe a couple hundred gold or so in extra mats?  Not to mention that other groups will be trying this very same strat, so the layer-exploiters will be competing against other exploiters; so in the end, all layers are still going to be saturated with farmers, regardless.
---
I don't see this being that big of a deal.
---
Tbh I've hated the Male casting animations on my druid for like a decade and never did anything about it other than things like deviate delight, toys, etc. This time around I'm definitely going female.
---
And why do you care about killing Cthun and KT if its not an accomplishment?
---
I was always alliance and I know that inside and out and this time I’m going horde because I want to be immersed into that side like I never got the chance to back in the day since all my IRL friends wanted to play alliance
---
If you play something you have not played before it will increase the likelihood that you do not subconsciously gravitate towards other game selections that mimic ones you picked years ago out of a desire to recreate nostalgia
---
Kilrogg, horde

---
It's definitely viable up to about level 40. In fact there's this weird sweet spot around the end of scarlet monastery where Warriors are still wearing all the good blue SM mail, and Shaman can wear it at 40, where suddenly their mitigation will be on par.
---
Shamans have no taunt but if played well with the right spec they can do as much threat as your average warrior tank. Their main issue is of course mitigation, so you'll not be doing any tanking in raids until you overgear them (eg, get full AQ set, can probably tank in MC).
---
If you don't plan to raid much you can likely do well tanking 5mans but you'll need an understanding party. In most cases, Shaman Tanks are the "We have 5 people wanting a dungeon and none are a warrior" option.
---
Burning Blade US, alliance

Say blizzard doesn't change this for classic and leaves it at 10 and you go in and change it isn't that altering the file and you can be banned for that right? Or is this okay to do?
---
I'm a stay at home mom, but my free time is still rather variable. I am married with a kid. During school hours my time is pretty free, but that comes to a screeching halt in 2 weeks lol.
---
Most of my play time will probably be weeknights after we're done with all our daytime shenanigans. I don't plan on progression because the family comes first, so I don't feel comfortable making video game commitments I may not be able to keep.
---
My husband isn't even remotely understanding of my interest in gaming. He doesn't do video games. He reluctantly admits his past videogame addiction in which he spent 2 hours a day playing Halo /eyeroll
---
Having windfury applied to all dps warriors and rogues is an immense dps increase to raid bosses. More than kings can do
---
Layering isn't going to last forever though. You act like it's staying.
---
Woot for days, amen brotha!

Well in my 14 years playing WoW ive played all classes on both sides. While i started on alliance since all my friends were there, ive since then played both sides because nothing can beat the "lok'tar ogar" battle cry.

YOU'RE arguing. Read the comment chain again.
---
what? there is an world chat? \*head exploding\*
---
so /join world ?
---
I hate the effect Arenas had on Wow. Blizzard's success with Starcraft as an eSport made it want to turn wow into an eSport, and this started Blizzard down the slippery slope of nerfing and homogenizing all the unique and special class abilities for "balance." 
---
I think part of the fun of PVP in classic is slamming all these PVE-balanced classes against each other. Everyone has different and crazy abilities and there was a lot of rock/paper/scissors going on. It was not balanced, but it was FUN, and there is a huge difference between balance and fun. To me there was a huge appeal in taking all of these tools designed for PVE and using them on players. 
---
I am not sure which was worse, adding all the new PVP-specific rules like the "Resilience" stat and CC not working as well on players, or nerfing a bunch of abilities across the board just for the arena. None of these things made the game more fun and felt incredibly artificial. 
---
In Classic I like that my skills, expectations, and gear can translate between PVE and PVP with no weird rules changes or special stats. Going back to the Vanilla class balance, abilities, and stats is what has me most excited for Classic.
---
Lock CAN top dps in endgame raiding but I don't think it's consistently one of the top classes. 
---
The nice thing about a lock is that SM/Ruin is a top raid spec and is also VERY good in PvP so you wouldn't need to respec a lot. I can't say whether that's the same for rogues but I think a rogue trying to max out would do more raid damage than a lock. Locks just aren't built to be the most dps, that's what a mage is for. Locks have survivability and utility and because of that they simply don't do as much damage (in most cases) than a pyro mage who is a class 100% focused on damage output. 
---
If topping the DPS meters is what you care about Lock isn't the choice. They can do very well but you just will have a hard time being #1 consistently against rogues and mages. 
---
If you take a lock and do consistantly get top dps though, that's some real bragging rights. If you're a rogue/mage and you top dps people are just like "ur supposed to do that". It makes being top dps much more rewarding when you do it as a lock imo.
---

IS THIS REAL LIFE?
---
lol when i was playing legion and on farm status for instances my guild and i would use an addon for gambling. you roll a set number, person who rolls the lowest pays the person who rolled the highest gold equal to the difference between numbers. It made raiding alot more fun during the boring times.
---
I think a lot of it might be because in early Vanilla the auction houses weren't linked and at least on my server the IF AH was one primarily used.
---
Obviously the better option would be no sharding or layering. But that is not possible if you actually want the game to be playable the first few weeks. Sharding is a horrible option and layering I see as necessary evil. 
---
It is obvious that individual layers will not be equal population wise. It will not, however, be a huge difference, certainly not as big as you described. I would be for any effective solution and to me layering is by far the most effective we have seen so far. Server merging you described would be a long and difficult process and you would feel the pain in game. I played on merged server. I suddenly found that my gold had less value and the things I have farmed too. Layering at least means that there will be one economy and not two merged into one through a long, difficult and often devastating process.
---
U so cool wow
---
The devilsaur mafia is more myth than anything. In all the servers I've played on I've never had any issues farming devilsaur leather myself other than just regular old competition with other individual players. Yes groups form with the intention of farming but they are rarely unopposed and usually temporary.
---
At the end of the day it's the same result. 5 layers, 5x the resource, 5x the number of people, 5x the number of groups forming to dominate a resource, 5x the competition.
---
Alliance has superior leveling areas in the vanilla map. I normally play horde but I’m going alliance for this.
---
I upvoted because you said not to.
---
Username checks out. This is quite the echo plot a post.
---
Same for me, decided to look and just noticed.  Fingers crossed, friends!
---
If one comment from a random person causes you to post here about it, you may not have a good time anywhere.
---
&gt; Now for gathering professions. If node(a) is picked or mined in zone(x)  on layer(3) then node(a) will no appear in zone(x) across all layers.  That way it mimics exactly how it'll be when layering is gone. There  will be no extra mats in the economy at all with this solution,  considering it would be as if only one zone existed rather than multiple  layers of that zone with node on each layer. 
---
You do realize that this drastically cuts down the available mats across the server? Each layer will be as big as a full server. You can't just have the pop of 5 servers and the mats of 1 server.
---
same thing for me!

Good old Daddar. Made me roll a rogue back in 2005.
---
I’m not EU but I have the same thing right now, hopefully this isn’t just a mistake :(
---
Super casual play? You may want to check out the Mage. You can also do most 5/20 man content with your PvP spec. It's not optimal, but certainly doable. Mages have an easier time getting into dungeon groups over Hunters I find, but YMMV.
---
That's one of my favorite memes, something like "When I was a kid my mom told me don't talk to anyone from the internet because they're all scary bad people.  These days I just got a text from my mom saying that PatriotReeMan1776 told her that 'Hilary Clinton eats babies' so it must be true."
---
Summon is a 6 second cast with talents. So quite possible to fear -&gt; cast like he does in this clip, especially if your opponent is Asmongold and doesn't believe in shield bash.
---
It's likely a bug, because I see the same thing and I am only currently in the Stress test and don't have an additional dropdown (So I accessed this via the Stress Test PTR one. If you have both, it was two dropdowns.)
---
However, I am on the F&amp;F list, but I dont think the invite kicked in yet because it creates a separate drop down from the stress test.
---
[I'm in NA]
---
it is a bug :)
---
I can see it too - EU
---
In the end, we're all going to take a dirt nap. Might as well enjoy the time we have while we're alive. Don't let anyone shame you for "wasting your time". This is how I want to enjoy my time. No one shames people for taking the day off to go to a football game, or to pregame hours before the superbowl or whatever. I choose to play in Azeroth and spend my time adventuring, questing, meeting people and having fun.
---
Just to clear up some confusion, at least in Germany the term "twink" or "twinking" simply describes a second character, similar to "alt", which is mostly used in the US I think
---
VERY first server was Argent Dawn (eu), but I rerolled on moonglade (can't even remember why now).
---
I bet this is the bug since everyone sees it
---
Did you get an email saying you did? If not, no you probably just got access to the stress test like everyone pretty much did.
---
Open beta time
---
Horde Lothar,  baby
---
Priest.
---
Just got this as well NA btw  hope its not a bug lol.
---
same for me (EU)
---
If a healer thought I was too squishy to wear LH helm, I would oblige. I am not that stubborn. But they wont say that bc as you have said, you can tank MC in greens. If I can tank it in greens, I can wear T1 and Lionheart. Basic fucking logic. Not opinion, math and logic. This is simple tank itemization. Learn it or please dont tank in classic scrub. 
---
The fact that you think stam is the best stat for a tank is actually hilarious. 
---
You have no evidence abput mage spell dmg coefficients. It's irrelevant. 15% of all caster dmg will NEVER be worth less than your fucking mortal strike. I dont need tp raid original vanilla to know that. Noone does. These things arent decided by private server neck beards. This shit is fucking obvious if you have half a brain.
---
I'm going to assume you mean repair bot. Wish those little guys have you a cut of what they made lol
---
And you're still confusing me with someone else. Read up. Jesus fucking Christ, kid.
---
close enough. same thing. also might wanna tell google.
---
Reminds me that my music taste has been heavily formed by Vanilla WoW videos. That is how I got to listen to Tool, Disturbed, Static-X, Breaking Benjamin and all other bands like that. Forever grateful &lt;3
---
I think the "punish everyone because there are some bad people" approach would just makes things worse than if you had people trying to exploit.
---
In the end, if the exploiting even works like everyone THINKS it will, their gains won't even be that much, compared to say, finding a BOE epic, or getting the first crusader enchant recipe on the server.  Since any exploiters will likely be fighting against other exploiters, from both factions too, all layers will be saturated with people farming, si in the end, nothing really changes.
---
Cenarion Circle - Alliance.
---
BG's weren't available on release in Vanilla. BG's aren't available on release in classic.
---
I fail to see what's "counter intuitive"
---
There's also a problem where BG's give very good gear and the honor system gives very good gear comparatively which is just another reason to delay it. If you want the experience of starting in 2006 then you can avoid playing at release. If you want the experience of playing from release than you can play at release
---
Again, I fail to see what's counter intuitive about that.
---
Remember how iconic the Arcanite Reaper was around release? AV gives you a quest for a nearly equivalent polearm from winning a single AV anytime after lvl 51.
---
yeah for sure, I just know its usually more consistent and faster to click a nameplate than tab target on fights with many mobs stacked to find the one you want. so 30-40 yards would be fine as that covers pretty much all spell range
---
No way, Bear tanks are 100% viable throughout all phases of vanilla, and even on some bosses in Naxx. They're arguably "better" tanks than Warriors in 5mans too if geared right as they do more dps than your average prot warrior and are easier to play.
---
There's a weird period when BWL comes out where bear tanks arent great because there's basically no good bear gear in MC or BWL bar a couple of items (BWL chest, cloak and such, not much more) so you'l be in pre-raid BIS Blues for AGES but once AQ comes out bears are really a force to be reckoned with as offtanks and "threat tanks".
---
They do take more damage than warriors but not by as much as you may think if you gear them right. Just make sure to a.) take enchanting for the BOP Smoking Heart of the Mountain trinket and b.) take the Mark of Tyranny quest reward tank trinket from the level 60 quest over the DPS trinket options. Those two are the only good mitigation bear trinkets and are pretty vital so don't miss out.
---
God I love boomer memes
---
I am not in classic, I never played vanilla as a lock. I was a lv 27 hunter vanilla till I went back to ffxi.
---
But my wow addiction started with a lock in tbc.
---
Pretty sure 3 dots + wand would have pulled threat from the blueberry levelling in tbc. I have a strong memory of only being able to use 2 dots+wand in tbc.
---
There was a reason my first addon was a threat meter add on (omen or ktm) when levelling my lock. 
---
My memory might be flawed though, can barely remember what I ate 3 days ago so 15+ years ago is more than foggy.
---
I was gonna post about it since I noticed it in the stress-test but since I did not get a beta-invite I figured Blizzard was not worth me helping them.
---
Hi, /u/EncoreWeed
---
Quinn is such an attention whore
---
I always like to be in Thunder Bluff its so relaxings sitting at the pond while lfg
---
I hope so.....good luck!
---
I was in the stress test, yes, but that actually said "Stress Test" in the server name if I recall correctly. This explicitly says "Beta". Hope this isn't a mistake on Blizzard's part.
---
No, this is a bug.
---
MC sure but Cthun and Kel Thuzard are not LFR mode.
---
&gt; Shaman Tanks are the "We have 5 people wanting a dungeon and none are a warrior" option.
---
Or in my case (I was forced to tank WC, BFD and SFK as Shaman) "Our tank dropped and we can't find another one"
---
my only gripe with GW2 is the lack of seamless world exploration. That and the teleports   
---
 all over the map everywhere kinda trivializes most of that aspect. I do agree though, it's a gorgeous game and is super fun to explore around.
---
Hit caps from vanilla are well documented and npt incorrect on private servers, as are the stats on weapons.
---
And no, you are the troll here.
---
warlock and respect in 1 sentence lol
---
Dungeon and raid finder is not going to be in classic right? The whole reason I'll play is for the sense of community, not a mindless loot pinata.
---
Bad plan, if you are in the Barrens LFG, you have to go to OG to group together. This idea has not been thought through.
---
Obviously not from anyone informed from the past 6 months.
---
Just take out layering entirely. Limit the pop on servers and be done with it. QQ you had to queue. It's an mmo launch.
---
On every private server we've had problems with over farmed mobs and the like. Just let it be for a week or two and it'll be over.
---
They took the servers down to implement WSG and honor to the beta, so it's likely a bug.
---
Seems like everyone is seeing that rn, myself incl. I am a stress test only tester so its probably just a visual glitch.
---
I asked google and he said nothing about play of the game. Just correcting you, nothing personal my dude
---
This is from march.Blizzard announced it after.
---
I had a friend in HS who I was trying to get to play Diablo 2 LoD with me back in the day. His mom would never let him play it with me, because it had Satan in it, it was pro Satan.
---
These same people burned records because "Satan had infested records". I didn't learn that they had done that until I was in my late 20's though. These same people watch endless amounts of television.
---
My brother and I play WoW because he lives 100 miles away, and we always grew up playing games with eachother. It's our past time really. 
---
This does not stop our father from belittling the hobby every chance he gets. Because only children play video games, from his perspective. Meanwhile, these same people will watch and endless amount of football, basketball, or whatever sport. Cheer on the Olympics. All games.
---
My brother and I realized eventually that these people are morons.
---
So grateful to be in beta wish it was open until launch kinda like an early acess...idgaf when my toon gets deleted be fun to see how far it could go until reset on Aug 27th.
---
Priests are also pretty casual (leveling-wise), there's a ton to downranking, priority, stat priority etc. when healing but for leveling it's pretty much PW:S-&gt;mind blast-&gt;SW:P-&gt;wand till dead. They can handle multiple mobs at once, fear juggle with psychic scream, and have zero downtime so you can just jump from mob to mob.
---
I'm nearly certain they said they will have cross-realm BGs, so long queues shouldn't really be a concern.
---
I’ve gone twice in the last few years. For Horizon and for MLB 19 because I wanted the steel box + hat
---
Flying mount and resilience ruined wow.
---
Separating pvp gear from pve was a stupid move.
---
Ferals are easily capable of tanking any five man content, and are vastly superior to Shaman as tanks. Heck, there are times in raids where having a Druid tank is superior to Warrior, but it's a tight niche role and you don't need more than one in raid. You also have the ability to do some neat hybrid specs that let you tank/heal with the same spec. Shaman can pitch-hit tank if they gear/spec for it up through ZF, but it quickly gets plowed.
---
You have been jebaited. Get over it you arn't in beta.
---
Agreed, but there are disincentives for a randon asshole in a persistent community versus the transient, sharded mess that is retail now.
---
  Chances are high I will never see this guy again, so it's not even worth the effort to block him.
---
So nice to hear that. Thanks a lot for your quick responses. Hope i can help you out with something anytime in the future
---
That would suck so much dick if it’s true
---
Pretty sure Kings alone cancels that out, and some rogues argue windfury isn't even as good as poisons, and they are mutually exclusive, though I never mained a rogue so idk about that
---
They won't make a single layer the population of a full server. What makes you even have that idea. Layering is GOING AWAY after phase 1. That would make servers WAY too populated.
---
I WANT TO BELIEVE
---
&gt; No, that is not reductio ad absurdum. He provides a valid counter argument.
---
MY EXAMPLE is exaggerated to prove a point, not his. this one "you can have everyone being a miner on one layer and everyone being herbalist on another for example, or everyone being a miner on 3 layers.". he is talking about my example. i reply to him saying "yes, my example is streched out to prove a point". i really shouldn't have to explain this :|
---
even though if i think of it now this scenario is entirely possible.
---
have a realm with mostly former private server population. on private servers it is known that engineering is tier one profession for both raiding and pvp - &gt; a vast majority will go mining-engi because the realm is fresh. so here is an example that will be extremely likely that most layers will be filled with miners. this is for /u/alifewithoutpoetry
---
From level 30 and onwards you can get +shadow damage gear. Shadoweave and felcloth sets from tailoring, "shadow wrath" gear etc.  And then from 50+ there is dungeon gear.
---
Also, higher stamina allows you to lifetap more, but +shadow gear means that each lifetap restores more mana. In the end, you are better off with +shadow and sustaining a smaller life pool with Siphon Life and (occasionally) Drain Life.
---
Hmm. I was on board with layering until seeing this and reading some comments. Hopefully they fix it... At least there (supposedly) won't be layering for more than a month
---
it's a bug
---
There also won't be low level Naxx invasion bosses. 
---
The release of classic mimics the release of vanilla. The experience of leveling later in Classic will mimic the experience of leveling later in vanilla. Not counter intuitive.
---
S E E T H I N G
---
Well, right off I'd knock these off your list :
---
Warlock - have to farm soulstones. It's not *too* bad, but for someone crunched on time, u don't wanna do that.
---
Shaman besides resto - Needs too much gear to be decent, takes too long for someone very casual
---
Druid - same as shaman
---
Warrior - idk how casual you're talking, but if were talking a few hours a week, then I'd personally cross warrior off since the leveling is god awful. Probably the strongest overall class at 60 though, but the trip to 60 takes forever.
---
Paladin - same as druid and shaman. Basically just play holy or resto for those. The dps specs are already lack luster, and as a casual you won't be geared fast at all, so you will basically suck for a long time.
---
That leaves rogues, hunters, priests, mages. Any of those would be a decent choice. If you're going to be a few hour a week player, hunter levels the fastest arguably, so not a bad idea. If you are a bit more and don't mind the leveling, rogue is strong even in subpar gear. Priests are great tbh. Mages are probably the strongest overall PvP class, and very strong pve.
---
As far as difficulty ranking, I'd say it would go Hunter, Rogues, Mages, Priests. Honestly it's a toss up between rogue/mage/priest, with Hunter clearly being the easiest.
---
Yeah I think Ulduar was peak WoW.  And after Ulduar was when catch up mechanics started making raid progression pointless and general content shelf life started to expire really fast.
---
Man I still remember the big "Guild progression" threads on various realm forums.  My guild beat Ragnaros after the AQ gates were already open but we still felt like we had accomplished something when we did.
---
No you can just swim the border from tirisfal
---
Mega bummer, dude. :(
---
I'd assume they're sticking to what [they said over 3 months ago](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346) when they said it'd come out phase 4 after BWL.
---
*everyone
---
Day 1 Sargeras as horde. Ran a guild called Forsaken of Lordaeron or was in of Azeroth? It's bad I don't remember considering I created the guild... which was eventually absorbed into Mob Mentality if I am recalling correctly. I played in the closed and open beta as well. I kinda grew away from the game a bit over a year after its release but I do remember my gaming time in WoW very fondly. I definitely plan on playing classic.
---
tl;dr: No because if you do get in beta and stress test, it creates a new PTR account. You can also check your Battlenet account, as there would be a new PTR there.
---
"It's likely a bug, because I see the same thing and I am only currently in the Stress test and don't have an additional dropdown (So I accessed this via the Stress Test PTR one. If you have both, it was two dropdowns. For example: WoW3 and WoW4. One is for beta, one is stress test only.)
---
However, I am on the F&amp;F list so I should be getting the beta access, but I dont think the invite kicked in yet because it creates a separate drop down from the stress test and I still only have that stress test drop down.
---
EDIT: Lmao look at the comments. Clearly a bug guys. The beta servers went down without little warning for closed beta people, they are clearly just tinkering with things.
---
YOU ARE NOT IN THE BETA IF YOU DIDN'T GET A NEW DROP DOWN. STRESS TEST IS ONE DROP DOWN ON THE LAUNCHER, BETA IS ANOTHER. YOUR BATTLENET ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT WILL SHOW YOU A NEW PTR TOO IF YOU WERE TO GET IN. "
---
It's amazing what searching the internet will yield.
---
I actually don’t know why I reply to comments on this subreddit anymore. No matter what Blizz does, people are going to throw a bitch fit... It’s a fucking beta, man... There are THREE MONTHS to refine things... This is obviously not the final product. I might just delete the reddit app off my phone at this point haha
---
you mean a layer without posts about layering?
---
Why are you using new models for classic WoW ffs
---
Please re-read my comment because I did not say or imply that I want this change to happen. This is not "my way". I'm referring to the massive talent revamp in MoP that got rid of talent trees. They did that because so many talents were added in TBC, Wrath, and Cata that it became unwieldy (to the devs at least). I would have preferred instead of completely scrapping the system and replacing it, finding a way to spread it out and make it meaningful while keeping it managable.
---
This is not a problem Vanilla WoW was even close to seeing on the horizon, though. Again, I absolutely did not say I want the vanilla talent system changed. I just don't think it's this huge bastion of freedom and choice people make it out to be. Please do not twist or misrepresent what I said.
---
show it from perps perspective its complete bullshit xD gg
---
Downvoted the thread to cancel out the upvote. You're welcome. ;)
---
Also I really wanted to go Alliance for the same reason. I wanted to see the other side after playing Horde for so long. But no, friends want to Horde, sadly.
---
You cultured bastard, I love ya. &lt;3
---
The cities really are better though, darnassus excluded of course.
---
Though I do think thunder bluff is pretty nice, layout wise and aesthetically.
---
Laughing Skull - EU
---
Is this early character creation open to all or just those lucky enough to be invited to the beta? A little out of the loop here, and thanks for the response!
---
Are you basing this off of being able to see the servers? If so that appears to be a wide spread bug or cock tease by blizzard.
---
The beta realms are showing up for me as well, but they're offline now. Hoping it's not a bug.
---
Same! Which is one of the main concerns I have lol
---
Everyone sees the same thing mate
---
Paladin by miles
---
The goal is always mana efficiency. We're not gonna be getting new raids where we might in theory all be spamming our max HPS rotation for "heal checks" and that will matter. 
---
In a 40 man even if you had 100 spells you just spam a short and mana efficient one all throughout a raid.
---
Because of this Paladin is by far the best healer in the game in PvE
---
A paladin can cast his max HPS rotation MUCH longer than the other classes. If there is only a priest left to keep a tank up you're fucked if it's gonna last any time. He's gonna go oom. With luck a paladin could quadruple overall healing in a long time frame just by critting 
---
There are times when priests shine, but in vanilla it's so rare as to have no effect on whether or not Priest is the best healer.
---
95% plus of the time Paladin is the best.   
---
In short very strong soaks where you actually have to heal your whole raid, which is again rare in vanilla. (vael is theo nly example in the first two raids) Priest is good. But so is druid with infinite mana. 
---
In most fights it's clearly pala. Chain heal sucks and so do totems
---
 We know they are sticking to the old models, as expected. However, what worries me most is the difference in snow seen here as well as other weather effects including heavy rain, dust storms and blizzards. We HAVE to make sure these are included into the live version, as they play a major role in the game's immersion &amp; ambiance.
---
All video's I've seen from the beta have clear skies just like retail. Did the streamers notice this? Are they calling it out? Has Blizzard commented anything on the matter?
---
They don't contradict each other when you understand how layering works.
---
Think of each layer as a container within the realm - when enough people login to the realm, it spawns another layer to accommodate more people. Each layer has its own mobs &amp; resources so that when 10k people login on launch day, they won't all be going for the same mobs to kill and herbs/ore to farm.
---
It means that u got tricked
---
I remember the centaur packs maybe bugging out their patrols at least.
---
It's beautiful! I love how you made everything look so polished and clean.
---
If you don't mind some schmuck's constructive criticism, I have a few things that caught my eye.
---
1. The lightning on Thunderfury looks a little chunky. Is it possible to make the crackles thinner?
---
2. The eyeballs on the Skullflame Shield look too spherical. Is it possible to add a fire effect to them?
---
3. The Tauren's sword tip looks kinda wonky somehow. Is that just from the angle we're looking at or is the render off?
---
4. The shields look like they're being held at the edge instead of being bracketed on the forearm. Was that a stylistic choice as they're still preparing for battle? Can their position be adjusted?
---
Again, really great job. This is really impressive work! I can't wait to see your final product!
---
baited, not sure why it got longer. Just means like taking out from under you, you got your hopes up and then got it taken away.
---
I think it's a bug and we all "got in" my dude - the realms will probably disappear once they come back online
---
I want to know. If firestone scales with spellpower. What the ppm of firestone is. Can you enchant it? If shadow oil procs imp shadowbolt. If it uses imp sb charges and benefits from the dmg boost. If anyone can answer these questions (with proof) I would be greatly appreciative.
---
Why not just say tricked then?
---
Iam in too :D got even a PVE server but they show as offline. Was a stress tester before. Seems like a EU invite.
---
LFR justifies the existence of mythic that's why you can't remove it.
---
If you didn’t get an email saying you got into the beta. Not the stress test but the beta. You did not get in yet.
---
I don't think you understand just how useless firestone/spellstones are. They're literally a meme, nobody ever used them for anything except to joke around.
---
Good eye, no way to get old exporter to work in my pc or my other one. And it is rework anyway so I think it is fine.
---
since its also showing alpha its probably a bug
---
Doesn't this mean they can get minor run speed enchant on their boots?
---
It should DE into the shard required for it. Not sure what level was required to get enchanting high enough.
---
Oh crap! I see three servers now on the Realm Selection window. All three are Offline though. 
---
Does that mean I’m now in the official BETA?
---
Is the fact that it's a *BETA* not proof enough that things are subject to change and improvement?
---
Besides, Blizzard has discussed the intended use of layering multiple times already.
---
This isn't his twitch chat, it's not even that funny
---
How many classes have instant cast spell pre level 5? Druid moonfire is the only one I can think of
---
I came home 30 minutes ago..checked and had nothing.. Now i have it. I cant imagine blizz making the same mistake twice.
---
That has to be a bug. 
---
No way did everyone get alpha access.
---
I mean I hope I'm wrong because I would love a weekend of classic wow.
---
Issa meme
---
Is he really?
---
1. Drink a booze.
---
2. Go somewhere cool.
---
3. Take screenshot.
---
I have so many of these...
---
Look at all these people thinking they got in.... They dont know
---
AFAIK they do not. However they can have what’s called a “heartbeat resist” so they can resist a cc that has already been applied essentially breaking the cc early. Which is often confused as DR but actual DR do not apply in pve. At least not on any spell I was ever able to cast.
---
Phase 1 - launch (Mc/Ony)
---
Phase 2 - DM and PVP
---
Phase 3 - BWL
---
So you’re saying people should expect to be on Molten Core for about 20 months... I don’t want them to rush content either, but I think you miscounted.
---
happened to me too. pretty sure its just a bug that we can see them
---
Lol what?
---
Same, but I fear it might just be a bug on their side and once they go online they need to be refreshed and dissappear.
---
Oh and happy cake day OP. I hope if only one person gets beta today it’s you. jk IM THE TRUE BETA PRINCE
---
How is Quin level 40? Is he on the alpha server?
---
Dude, a lot of people have planned kids in their early 20's, I know like 5 people who did this, all very successful.
---
&gt;Being on a different layer is 100% equivalent to being on a different shard, because it's the same.
---
Aye, conceptually a layer is just a really big shard that you aren't supposed to be able to move between as easily, and isn't supposed to move you automatically. This has come about because people were vehemently anti-sharding even in starting zones only, adamant about how not being able to see the same people while leveling would ruin the game, so Blizzard is trying to make a different solution. It makes sense to start with sharding and go from there, I don't see it as a "lie" or a deception. And when you say "layering is the same as sharding" you are intentionally casting aside the intended differences between the two. 
---
On a side-note, I think it's funny how the subreddit as a whole shifted with layering being announced. The main attitude was that sharding was terrible and would ruin everything, now people are saying 'omg please go back to sharding'.
---
same as me
---
Also subbed since vanilla, no luck for me
---
Confirmed, he's trying to play coy but has slipped up a few times.  There are a couple of clips around where he's talking about his keys.
---
By the way, Happy Birthday Esmond!
---
Wrong. He's actually SELLING beta keys. You just need to donate. He won't even give them to his fans. Unbelievable.
---
It is. Everyone with Stress-Test can see :)
---
Hmm, if it seems that everyone got it then its probably a bug.
---
They're going to release it in a similar fashion to when it was released during vanilla.
---
I'm in the beta and that's what I see too - don't get your hopes up.
---
Thanks for this. Gosh im so torn!
---
They are like normal mode maybe. I mean again its not that vanilla is bad but Blizzard encounter design pre and post mop are just 2 different worlds. Those don't have as many mechanics as dungeon bosses in the modern game.
---
On my phone I can see it, it was on my work computer I couldn’t... odd
---
A lot of those ancient kodo would walk into the kodo graveyard and vanish.  But there were others that just did on the road to it, just like the clip shows.
---
Shamans or druids don't PvP heal. Shamans have terrible survivability because they can't afford to spec in to ghost wolf, and they run out of mana in 2 seconds. Priests are great for utility, paladins are tanky, provide utility and do not oom.
---
I'm so happy with this date. My summer job ends at 22.8 and my university courses start around 9.9, so I have plenty of time to spend inside my house, without making any contact with offline lifeforms.
---
umm i just jumper off the boat and swam to SW
---
Where?
---
Found the shit tier warrior.
---
Wait, how is it not? Don't you see the Ret Bull bot? Lol.
---
cancer streaming culture
---
We all got beta?! Sweet!
---
Stop breaking my heart, Blizzard!
---
Seems legit.
---
If your only seeing the server offline it and basing your invite off that its not it.
---
I read through the guide, and a lot of stuff is ridiculous from a practical standpoint. Sure its possible, but pulling a mob with lightning bolt, then switching your gear, sitting down to drink and dropping stoneclaw totem is way too much setup.
---
Between each pull I'm going to say "brb 5 minutes, gotta set up" never gonna happen.
---
Like I said - it works in a pinch for lower level content, but if someone wants to un-ironically tank a raid as a shaman, I'll just boot them from my raid.
---
They didn't say it would be in for all of phase 1. It could be removed after the first week for all we know. It's a tool they plan to utilize until they don't need it anymore.
---
&gt; YOU ARE NOT IN THE BETA IF YOU DIDN'T GET A NEW DROP DOWN. STRESS TEST IS ONE DROP DOWN ON THE LAUNCHER, BETA IS ANOTHER. YOUR BATTLENET ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT WILL SHOW YOU A NEW PTR TOO IF YOU WERE TO GET IN.
---
No it's not. It's the same one "Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic"
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BQJhzAXmic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BQJhzAXmic)
---
Has to be a bug, there's no way that many people got in.
---
You dont even really "become" your class until level 10. That's when rogues get duel wield, hunters get pets, warlocks get voidlord, etc. Before that your character is really like a classless level 1 character with a spell or two. To me the ride to level 10 almost seems like a tutorial before truly starting your character (or at least level 5-6 when you leave the starting zone).
---
$5 per key
---
sounding like a hater
---
Is this a new meme? Never seen this one posted before. 
---
Original.
---
Say it ain't soooOoooOooo...
---
Its true https://clips.twitch.tv/DaintyAmusedAlbatrossMcaT
---
Whisperwind here!
---
What good is a server if you can’t ever communicate with them unless you’re on the same layer?
---
Yeah. And the big thing about LFD is it removed the “sheep” so to speak from the world so the the “wolves” had no prey.
---
It's only $3!
---
wheres the source
---
Damn it’s a shame they aren’t having a 3 month long beta test
---
Pinnacle Kek
---
To the decurse/dispell point, can paladins remove both? I'm having trouble finding an answer or site that says which classes can remove which debuffs
---
that’s not entirely true. StaySafe only has one drop down menu, Beta and Stress Test, and he had both.
---
Heretic ! Burn the Witch !
---
I think its a bug too ._.
---
Was $3 until he started running low.
---
That looks awful. Internet has let me down yet again. :(
---
got in too pls no jebait
---
Have a cry m8....jesus.
---
Alright, let's clear some things up.
---
One: There are no keys to give out.
---
Two: Popular streamers do not have access to grant anyone and everyone they want into beta. There are exception (Asmongold getting McConnell in) but it works similar to friends and family. They do not get to request invites to 50+ people. Only a select few, similar to how it would work for a Blizzard employee.
---
I am probably one of the few that is just waiting for August. I have no intention of subscribing until that point. It's been over a decade since I played and since Vanilla's release since I played in any serious manner. I think I am going to need a couple months just to get myself gathered up and decide on a class and rather or not I want to join a guild now or later.
---
Lets atleast enjoy the moment
---
Pretty much. There's only two 'good' pvp healers, pally and priest. If you can't magic dispel really you're not much of a support class in vanilla. Your warrior/rogue just gets feared or poly'd or frost nova'd or entangling roots'd and they're screwed.    
---
Like you say pally is better defensively. 90% of that is just because BOP and DP are broken abilities, and of course they wear plate and have a low cd 6 sec stun. Not flashy but absurdly strong.  
---
Priest is easier to train and get deleted, but they do have much better offensive pressure with offensive dispel, mana burn, MC, fear. And of course horde doesn't get pallies anyway.    
---
Shamans get nothing from going full resto, so you're always going to go at least 30 pts ele. Ele shaman is about balancing dps/purging/kiting/WF/grounding/fear totems/heals.    
---
Druid is just a very sad pvp healer. Slow casts, bad efficiency, vulnerable to dispels, squishy and no magic dispel. Really the only person they're good at keeping is themselves, so it makes sense they are best as FC.
---
It’s a bug.
---
Daym that was a long time ago. They come from a town not that far from where I lived so I saw them live a few times on small pubs before they got fame.
---
The original members were so damn good together, to bad drugs have to ruin shit :(
---
The whole message here is play how *you* want.
---
They released ZG later in the original game too when it was supposedly irrelevant. And yet was very popular.
---
Tuesday evening
---
I oppose your sentiment, I like how when you master a difficulty level you can move up to the next one. While I have some big objections to current wow difficulties. I love the core concept because now each of the main demographics have raid setting that's for them
---
I got a new PTR xD
---
That is a World classic joke dude
---
Smolderthorn
---
To fill in the blank about druids, they definitely serve a niche in BG's. They're advantages are being able to shapeshift out of snares, roots, and retaining mobility while healing. 
---
Their detriments are mana conservation (innervate helps) and a lack of bursty healing output.
---
Much more could be said about them but this is better than nothing.
---
"likely no PvP will take place in the desired testing zones"
---
# GET UP THE HILL
---
Mail from Blizzard. They can be late with the mails though. At a certain point I had beta stress test access but I didn't get the mail until like 12 hours later.
---
Lame.
---
&gt; It makes sense to start with sharding and go from there, I don't see it as a "lie" or a deception.
---
Well the main deception is the fact that they made it partially worse by sharding the entire world, not just the starting zones. Considering it's still sharding, they could've left the name alone and discussed the limitations introduced, but they didn't. Instead they pretended like it was something entirely different, and (more importantly), people fell for it. Even I fell for it before I read into the details.
---
&gt; now a lot of those people are saying 'omg please go back to sharding'
---
It's a lesser of two evils situation. Ideally, I don't want sharding at all, but clearly Blizzard isn't backing down on this, so why not find an amicable solution at least?
---
Seems like I got one aswell, literally 15 minutes ago. Servers are down right now so could be a bug, if not I'll be really happy. :)
---
Yea he asked for a lot lol
---
Outside 40 man raiding it all changes.
---
Shaman sucks as a 5 man healer unless your group is all melee. Then it's very good
---
Looking forward to this happening when I eventually find rexxar for the Onyxia quest.
---
As far as tagging mobs at level 1, Druids are the obvious MvP. Hunters have their ranged attack which has a small delay and very fast travel time for the projectile. Rogues have Throw which has a small delay and then a normal (although it felt really slow) projectile speed. Priests have the cast time on smite, but no projectile travel time obviously. Every other ranged option has cast time and travel time which makes it hard to tag using spells.
---
Been in the beta since before the stress test, but my dropdown list only shows the "Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic" option. This guy is talking out of his ass.
---
Jebaited spawned from the Smash Melee community iirc. Theres a tournament organizer whose last name is Jebailey.
---
Good thing you found it, now blizzard can fix it :D
---
This is false. You do not need two drop downs, take it from someone who has beta access.
---
 Not saying that more people got invited, but this isn’t true
---
The lower brackets had tons of activity both twinks and not-twinks.
---
You need to be directly behind. Slightly off, mobs can dodge and parry.
---
[https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/tree/QuestieClassic](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/tree/QuestieClassic)
---
Still a lot of issues with them porting it but Aero is doing a really good job of working on porting features to the new code base and also catching errors. Report any issues you have on their discord (listed on the GitHub page) -- or on GitHub itself if you have an account.
---
Literally everyone who was in the stress test sees this. Not a single stress tester who was in isn't seeing the same thing.
---
We already saw that the servers aren't quite ready for that, and this same group of stress testers get to do the next stress test on Wednesday. From what they stated, this is usually not protocol, you are not guaranteed permanent stress test invites just cause you got in once. But due to the difficulties Wednesday, they didn't get to test everything they wanted, so the same crew is coming back.
---
Why would you lie about that anyway
---
lol how many subs does he have , there is no way he would risk his ability to stream wow now its out.
---
a few thousand for beta access is nothing compared to what he will make from twitch
---
not to mention he would need to be selling entire wow accounts
---
Zul’jin
---
You're wrong. I've got Beta access and only have the one PTR account in the launcher. I do agree and think it is a bug though, can't see them adding this many to the beta this soon and quickly.
---
1. You'll have 30% to crit.
---
It's not an "idea". It's what Blizzard said. 
---
[https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=331](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=331)
---
Well just got level 30, and now this happens. RIP all the world pvp I was hoping to enjoy today...
---
It will be a warzone, the same warzone it was in Vanilla because that's what the layer sizes will be. That's the point of Classic after all. So I could ask you the same thing, if you want something different why are you even playing Classic?
---
&gt; If i'm gonna have changes the change I want is 10k plus people on this fuckign server at the same time. Private servers already solved this.
---
Private servers serve a worldwide population playing across many different timezones. They very rarely have anything close to 10k playing concurrently. When they do, they haven't solved a thing, they just allow it to suck.
---
Started on Crushridge EU, which turned out to be the unofficial Italian server. At one point we got free migration to Genjuros EU which I did. That server turned out to be the unofficial Greek server.
---
I still know how to curse in Greek and Italian!
---
Why? Because of some dumb nostalgia addiction can't let you see someone hit 60? Would you rather the plethora of bugs people have found 1-30 just not be found and fixed from 31-60 so Classic can launch broken?
---
No email for me yet... I'm pretty sure blizzard legit hates me.
---
Wut?
---
New WoW is like reverse Dark Souls, instead of being stuck in hard mode and not being able to turn down the difficulty when things get rough, you are stuck in perpetual easy mode (when questing and doing any of the queued content) and can't turn the difficulty up.
---
probably a bug, but u never know.
---
Wondering the same thing, stress test realm disapppeared and these 3 appeared for me
---
You are correct, I don't understand. What I'm hoping to learn and understand is *why* they're useless. It seems no one knows anything about them outside of "it replaces your offhand".
---
Can we just let this one die already. Please. Thanks.
---
I just experienced a spontaneous layer change in the beta, just like how it happens on retail with sharding. So as of now they really need to work out some kinks with it. It seems like it might be moving people too aggressively. I never joined a party, or joined/left a guild. I don't think anything should have moved me.
---
I knew it was a shift because the target I had disappeared, then quickly reappeared along with several other mobs that had just been killed 15 seconds ago.  Same that has happened to me in BfA.
---
definetly yes
---
Oh the initial surge, for sure. But what I experienced 16 hours later felt like what they've been describing/promising with layering: a perfect amount of players where it felt busy, but not impossible to play. I certainly *hope* that's what it ends up being.
---
yes i think they did that. in the first edition d&amp;d rules males got +1 st and females got +1 agi (not a spell thing but still they had a difference for sex).
---
Fix by removing
---
Do we get a enough plates with intellect on classic? my concern is having to use cloth with a pally
---
Way too many people seeing this. Don't get your hopes up.
---
Time will tell
---
Currently it seems everyone sees all three realms. Was hyped for a second, too... :(
---
The sad thing is there *were* flying-designed elements in BC. Those damn kaliri flying over the sethekk areas in Terokkar, also if you tried to fly over the enemy faction's bases they had sniper guards shoot you down. Netherstorm was designed around flying for the most part, and you couldn't even get to Arcatraz or TK without it. Netherwing Ledge, too, and maybe some other things i've missed.
---
I think Wrath was OK too, but Cataclysm was definitely when flying went to shit.
---
That would be great! 
---
It may be a bug that there's no decay - but if it works as in tended and you can grind rep with low level quests you didn't do in zones you weren't in - it's game changing.
---
Want that skeleton horse as an orc, but you didn't run to tirisfal level 1? No problem. 
---
Want that tiger on your pink haired gnome warrior, but didn't travel to teldrassil lvl 1? Np! Just do it level 60 and farm those old quests. 
---
It does take away some of the prestige of getting another faction mount.. but I don't know how much I mind X)
---
brd lmao
---
Start streaming now, act like a childish fool like Ninja, give blowjobs to every sponsor that comes your way and maybe you'll be big enough to be on the privileged list if a TBC server ever happens in the future.
---
Gotta plan ahead!
---
I got a stress test invite but never got an email at all.
---
it's a bug, everyone with stress test access can see it for now.
---
Maintenance/patch for WSG.
---
same, i see it too. best not to get our hopes up.
---
Orc/troll and gnome/dwarf definitely get slammed the hardest with both races starting in the same area in each of them
---
no
---
I honestly hope so. Every 10 posts on my reddit wall have this meme.
---
1.   
---
10% + 20% = 30%  base crit + talent crit = total crit    
---
5% + 25% = 30%  base resist + racial resist = total resist    
---
2. 
---
8-12 secs * 1.3 = 10-15 seconds
---
maybe people want someone extra to complain about pointlessly, I'm not sure what my thought process was
---
Thank you for your service ^^
---
But... But..... He asked about PvP and you wrote exclusively about raiding
---
You're probably not invited. The servers are bugged and they show up for everyone. Being invited to beta wouldn't show the alpha servers since that's only for devs and their friends/family.
---
MODS!!!!!!
---
I think WSG is my all time favorite PVP of any game I've ever played ever.  Different strokes huh lol
---
Yeh you didnt get an invite.
---
Shaman heals are great in AV.
---
open alpha and beta
---
they killed that zone when they flooded it. i miss old thousand needles.
---
I hope they don't revoke the beta access to the people who just got in. Maybe delay the next invite a few days.
---
I'm going to roll alliance because that's what I rolled for my first character in tbc but going as a gnome mage this time instead of human warlock.
---
i don't play warriors, jerk
---
I stream, I get no invite. Oh well, guess I need to average more than 10 viewers lol.  And lol@me. :(
---
Been watching this guy. He's a great streamer.
---
The maximum is 100 on live, haven't bothered to check on beta, but it's probably the same there too.
---
You didn’t get invited. It’s just a bug. Everyone who was in the stress test is seeing this.
---
Blizz just teased the whole community lol.
---
It’s not a bug blizzard doesn’t make mistakes let’s goooo
---
hahaha.  ridiculous I know.  But hey ... they're chain pulling everything with no cc.
---
And bloodlust
---
Grey quests DO grant experience
---
Oh well, draw distance was lower back then too. Stop crying that every engine limitation inconvenience isn't here to bug us for another 15 years.
---
Yeaaaa that just isn't an option with 2 complete MTG alpha sets.
---
RemindMe! 96 days diz
---
Sadly on this subreddit if you compliment Classi: FUCK YOU RETAIL ISNT THAT BAD NOSTALGIA BITCH. If you compliment BFA: ARE YOU FUCKING STUPID ITS THE WORST EVERYTHING IS WORSE YOU RETARD
---
ts pretty toxic but there are some gems here
---
Its not a fixed number, its based on other peoples honor. You gotta grind more then like the 1% of top honor gained players.
---
Don’t be daft. Very few fights at the zenith of mythic progression truly come down to rng. If an individual gets targeted by an ability 3 times in a row—that’s bad rng for the player, but balanced in the raid cause no one else has to stop dps. 
---
99% of mythic fights have predictable ability cooldowns and predictable phase transitions. None of that is rng. 
---
Very few things truly kill your as rng with no chance to react—the vast majority of deaths are a result of poor individual decision making or a strategy that creates rng by how inflexible or truly inferior it is for the task at hand. 
---
I’m talking about mechanical challenge, something beyond decurse, move bad debuff out of group, taunt rotation, and step out of bad. Modern mythic raids have complex mechanics that require not only knowledge of ones own class but a complicated positional dance for the raid as well. 
---
Very few vanilla fights tick those boxes—the majority of them are in naxx. Mc is literally a 1-2 mechanic tank and spank. LFR CoS is harder than 8/10 MC. 
---
Even BC has more interesting mechanics than classic—there’s a reason when ony was rereleased in wrath she had more mechanics...
---
Make a high mobility fight...I bet hunters perform a whole hell of a lot better than mages do...despite hunters being inferior.
---
Make a council fight and suddenly warlocks can roll dots on off targets. 
---
How often does a mage use blizzard in a vanilla raid fight? 
---
Make more fights where you need 4+ tanks altering your raid comp with more of your fury warriors tanking, giving more incentives to bring a balanced raid comp.
---
Modern wow offers challenging bosses due to mechanics. Most of vanillas raid challenge is due to boss stats, needing higher ilvl, more stam, regen, throughput. 
---
There is a lot of stuff in classic raiding that holds up: 40 people, theme, itemization...but after 15 years difficulty is not one of them.
---
It is possibly a bug because a ton of people got invited when the servers went down. I'm not trying to be a buzzkill but it may be best to keep your expectations low so if its a bug you wont be disapointed. I hope its not the case though!
---
You didn’t get invited it’s a bug, everyone’s sees it.
---
You honestly think Asmongold and Esfand doing SM Cathedral was easy? Because I can assure you that anyone from their group, and anyone playing the actual beta will disagree with you.
---
Also, dungeons in vanilla were awful for leveling. It took them 3 hours to clear trash inside of SM Armory and if they could've gotten experience, they wouldn't have gotten much more than half a level. That's 1 full level in 6 hours (with added optimism), which is horribly slow.
---
What is this post?
---
No, humans had the it worst.[ Look at the Census+ data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AtheneGenesis/7d12e8fb1b510acab74e6f84c8d1b7ed/raw/73236dfa5b8ff7ccb3b5f1fdafb6919e06833a29/Classic%2520StressTest%2520%25231%2520%255B3h%255D) run for the peak hours. On the day of the stress test there were more humans than Gnome, Dwarf and Troll combined.
---
you have no idea.....
---
why hunters less popular because of NE?
---
you're clueless
---
For fun.
---
Warrior/Paladin is pretty gross, since you can just freedom the Warrior and nothing can stop him
---
it did to everybody, even on asmongold stream, we might still get in.
---
I really wanted to experience battlegrounds without twinks. Guess people don't care about that as much as I do.
---
Horde side: Spriest/Warlock is damn near unbeatable.
---
Warr/hpaladin extremely strong
---
mage/mage also god tier
---
They were chain pulling everything with no cc right?  My point being.  If you are able to do higher level dungeons past your level, the xp will be decent enough for it to be worth it.  As you pointed out, dungeons were terrible for leveling.  But past a certain level?  BiS?  check.   Gold?  check.  Xp?  check.
---
It's bugged for everyone
---
No he doesn't.   
---
He mentions Shamans being the best raid healers. lol
---
Mc - twin emps isn’t hard. It’s literally farming greater fire res potions, fire res gear if melee, nature resist gear as anyone, getting an ony cloak, showing up and dealing with 1-2 mechanics per boss.
---
CThun and beyond have a noticeable mechanical (hello eye beam) increase or are simply intended for an ilvl that require years of dedication prior.
---
no one else knows for sure
---

Everyone is currently seeing "Incompatible" on population now, even people that currently have beta access. it could be that Blizzard sent out more beta invites. Or it could be a bug. We won't know until the servers are fully up again.
---
I doubt they will play on NA servers though.
---
raid who? server is off for everybody, even first wave beta testers.
---
Same and I've been in since the 17th. Think they might be pushing an update for WSG and Honor sys.
---
Horde cities are trash, no matter what faction you play.
---
Early Classic, maybe. However Locks scale extremely well in the later raids.
---
Same.
---
I just made it in photoshop when I was able to see the beta realms. But apparently it was a huge bug for everyone in the stress test.  https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1132007681278009344
---
One thing that is great about them is that one of the best builds for raiding is also one of the best for pvp. So you don’t have to farm a ton of gold to respec often, and you also don’t have to feel like you are compromising.
---
Not if at level 30 you can clear level 35+ elites with no problem.  They are essentially chain pulling everything.  Like I was saying before.  Xp won't be a problem anymore.  Gold.  BiS.  everything.  
---
I'd love to have the best gear just waiting  for me as I hit that level.
---
Modern Sonic Syndicate is ass. They sound like a pop version of Papa Roach.
---
Half of the band broke away and formed [The Unguided](https://open.spotify.com/track/22WEfQLZwiOJaWiardAx8d), which is still a fucking blast, AND half of their album covers look like WoW expansions.
---
Doesn't mean you got in sadly
---
Me too. Right now im leaning on rogue 70% lock other 30
---
its a bug u retard
---
might be a bug, dont get excited yet.
---
Its a bug
---
Sorry to burst your bubble chief but all stress testers are reporting this. Seems like a bug although most of us hope it isnt.
---
It's already a big deal on modern WoW, hopping shards constantly for herb and node spawns, etc. The difference here is that economy in vanilla WoW is much more involved and important. Unlike Modern WoW where professions have been dumbed-down, homogenized, and over-simplified to the point of effectively being of little concern to most players (except maybe alchemy). WoW's professions on the other hand, and all resources throughout the game, are much more useful. Resources throughout the game more scarce and harder to acquire. The ability to effectively farm the same resource via multiple copies of the world is going to have a significant impact on the vanilla experience. So Blizzard needs to really get Layering constrained enough to keep that from being heavily abused.
---
4head
---
how does the beta email even look like?
---
we're hoping for the best.
---
You can just ignore the post. Most reasonable people aren't bothered by this.
---
I'm actually using it in the Beta right now. Works flawlessly.
---
You can find the Classic port here:  [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24931-ImmersionClassic.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24931-ImmersionClassic.html)
---
if a frog had wings, it wouldn't bump its ass on the ground when it hopped.
---
Completely unnecessary.
---
Man you wrote like 10000 words on your personal wow history who has time for this shit lmfao
---
Oh wow the invite was so minimal i got to give ya an congratz! thx for ps to
---
[The Unguided](https://open.spotify.com/track/22WEfQLZwiOJaWiardAx8d) is much closer to old school Sonic Syndicate than the weird pop music they make now. And half of the band broke away to make The Unguided.
---
I'm hoping I will get through Blizzard Police.
---
God is it August 27 yet?
---
As a resto druid flagrunner I never lost the sense of danger lol. Some of my fondest wow moments came from early WSG where there was no timer and I had ongoing rivalries with specific players on the opposing squad.
---
Probably.
---
Succubus sacrifice DS/Ruin is the highest dps raid spec. You normally go imp life tap so it ends up being 7/21/23. The last 7 points in destro don't do anything because they're for fire spells.
---
Guys shhhhh
---
Uhh yeah. Its quite known that wars/rogues/mages are top dps
---
Shitty engine limitation that should be increased anyways.
---
When I played during initial release I cheesed it up with my buddy as Rogues. Although I think if we had to take on 5 players it may have been harder. He kind of refused to give up his ganking days as a rogue so I rerolled as a Mage and we routinely would take on 5-6 players as that duo in World PvP with I would consider average gear.
---
yeah its the same one blizzard said that 100x, we might still get in even tho its probablly a bug
---
Yeah, I understood It only after posting. My bad.
---
You're destroying my hope.
---
is a bug. try clicking one and logging in. will update to say .incompatible
---
Hyped dude!
---
Do you put a War Lock on a Battle Chest?
---
I can change for you blizzard if you want me to &lt;3
---
Nah seriously seeing it now too T_T
---
Don't get me wrong I freaking love resto shaman in classic. You can make anything work, I just meant in premades for rankers people dont take resto shams anymore
---
See that big ass "report a bug" button?
---
Everyone already in the beta just needs to right-click on the realm selection screen to summon us in ;)
---
Shut up. Mr holierthanthou.
---
 https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1132007681278009344  Nope. We got jebaited.
---
Cause I didn’t kill naxx of huhu and beyond on live vanilla. I also didn’t clear sunwell. I’ve done every other hardmode, heroic and mythic in the game until I quit real raiding after soo.
---
Wow died for me with time travel. I’ve got 2.5 dungeons to finish and I’m a big enough nerd I’m willing to blow 20-30 hours a week for the next two years for the hope of doing the same for two more.
---
Then I’m never playing wow again. (Unless they do vanilla+ or bc+)
---
I'm sure Myth plus, dailies, and LFR should be no issue in Vanilla.
---
;D
---
beta here. no email.
---
I am currently studying for exams, but when I am done I am totally cracking these bad boys out &lt;3
---
Did someone say...
---
this is a slippery slope kinda change. this requires that a player make a change to their cvars. not all changes to cvars can be an advantage. action camera is accessed through changes in cvars, or an addon.  
---
on one hand, sure level the wpvp playing field. on the other, i don't want my potential ability to play with action camera taken away.
---
That's good though. It means you're most likely not a violent sociopath. You feel empathy.
---
The truth about those low level dungeons and groups and communication is that you healer probably hates all of you , especially the brain dead tank that oulls while you are drinking
---
Wrong
---
Take a glance at an example from retail: [https://youtu.be/Ew0SWlBPoC8?t=193](https://youtu.be/Ew0SWlBPoC8?t=193)  
---
And then take a glance at an example from vanilla: [https://youtu.be/CV8E\_GGFrjg?t=320](https://youtu.be/CV8E_GGFrjg?t=320)

You can call it anecdotes, but both are pretty good representations of what (mythic)raiding is like in retail and vanilla. There's not really an argument, mechanically raiding is way harder in retail WoW than it was in vanilla. I say that as someone who raided both in vanilla and during the last 3 expansions. 
---
However, the preparations you had to do to raid in vanilla, such as farming consumables and resistance gear was more elaborate than they are now. And organizing 40+ people is harder than 20+. There's also just small things like catch up gear making rerolling a lot easier in retail, how there are no longer any corpse runs in raids, how we now have mass resurrections etc. So really the main difference is that vanilla raiding required more organization, and had more down time. However once you were ready and standing in front of the boss, it wasn't really that challenging, not compared to retail anyway. 
---
I guess another thing worth mentioning that back in Vanilla there weren't really any addons as elaborate as DBM, bigwigs and Weakauras are today. 
---
But even if retail raids are more challenging than vanilla raids, I would still say vanilla is hands down the better game. Because the entire journey, from making your charterer to defeating KJ for the first time is a coherent experience. the 4 difficulties, the constant stream lining and how a new patch cycle makes all content before it irrelevant have removed the soul from WoW in my opinion. Or maybe I've just gotten older, hard to tell.

Well arathi is... odd. It was like one of the least affected by cata while being very close to multiple zones that were highly affected. It and hinterlands feel like zones that were just forgotten about. But because of this, they didn’t get a full revamp on the quest style that came with cata and the difficulty curve.
---
And I agree, I do like the areas like Stromgarde and Hinterlands’ area where you build the mallet of zulfurrak. But Blizz has moved away from that style of quest areas.
---
Ultimately, they want to have periods of classic mirror periods of vanilla.  In the early stages of vanilla, there weren't battlegrounds, so PvP, and therefore Honor, had to be farmed in the open world.  I think the loss of that period of time would be much more severe than making some people wait for WSG in their earlier levels.  It really is a unique experience, especially on a PvP server and people deserve to have a chance to experience it.  BGs are when World PvP begins its decline.
---
I believe it would be the group benefits of Imp, not the raid.  Auras were not raid-wide until WotLK.
---
There are several cutoffs:
---
1. You need at least 15 honorable kills each week to be considered in the rankings.
---
2. You need at least X honorable kills each week (based on the number of HKs across your whole faction) to be considered in the rankings.
---
3. Your ranking decays by 20% each week no matter what.
---
If there’s not enough PVP on a server, no one can ever reach rank 14.

I‘m in the same boat as you and will probably play a holy paladin. 
---
I really like the class fantasy of a paladin and our group still needed a healer, besides that I never played a healer but was always interested in trying it.
---
I won’t join a raid guild because of my limited time but I hope that I‘ll get invited to pubs because they’re always looking for healers.

Can I get your opinion since this thread is no longer on the front page?
---
I played a little bit in Vanilla, but mostly watched my brother play or played his SP in BGs while he was busy to farm. And I've played all the xpacs for maybe 2/3 months at a time.
---
I basically have no desire to do PVE endgame stuff. I want to PvP. And I LOVE leveling. If I manage to do pve stuff, great, but thats my last priority. 
---
I've not decided between healer or DPS for PvP. But my initial thoughts were lock and priest.  Is lock a good PvP class, or a great pvp class? Also what about SP in pvp? Do they do any damage or are they healers or a little bit of both?

&gt; And we are less than a week away from another stress test.. Which the same group of stress testers get to partake in!
---
Source? Next stress test is supposed to start June 19th.
---
Can they even get into those instances at level 30?
---
Dear Blizzard, nerf warlock fear.  Thanks.
---
Ok, then this argument just opens up patching out/in anything people don't like.
---
in my brief foray into bfa any quest not inside an instance that I couldn't solo when I got it, I was able to solo after getting better gear.
---
Oh man the forums are going to explode from the salt lol
---
Shhhhhhhhhhh
---
Another sky is falling post surprise surprise that makes 25 today so far
---
It changed back to Offline! Maybe you are right. In any case I’m back to hoping!
---
Time you enjoyed wasting isn't wasted time.
---
I tried both human and dwarf/gnome zones last night. There were easily 30+ human players just standing around waiting for kobold to spawn plus dozens more waiting on Defias bandits. I gave up and ran around picking up exploration XP. Meanwhile the dwarf/gnome area was relatively lightly populated, I had no problem finding mobs to kill.
---
This tops blizzards cucks so far
---
Noo :(
---
So many good memories with these. Doing a 5 man raid against MC was probably the most fun I've had in a card game (I was MC and lost but it was a blast). I actually just sold all my cards a few months back because they were just taking up space. I hope you have fun!!
---
Oh god easily. Guilds can clear all of MC in the time it takes most guilds to do that trash between emps and ouro/cthun. Luckily with a couple invis pots and situationally aware warlocks you can run right through it all, BUT that will be so rare, and then you have to hope you 1-shot ouro and that the server starts with the teleporters
---
this really blows
---
they messed up pretty bad with this lol people are gonna flip
---
Pog is the command for an emote on twitch for when you are "excited" whether that be tongue in cheek or actually excited.
---
This is extremely important on fights like Loatheb
---
Yeah vanilla was the wild west in terms of addon functionality.
---
Thank you ! This is so helpful actually. Toss up between hunter and priest for me right now. Hunter probably better for farming as a main.
---
Maybe it was just drama-less, as OP Said.  
---
Me on the other hand, I was 16 and awkward as fuck, so I'm quite sure I was the butt of jokes.
---
I remember being in BRD on my Pally with some guildies, we were terrible, noobs to the core.   We were in the emperors room and had died a couple times already.   We have another pally in the group and I remember as we were about to wipe, it hit me like a lightning bolt, "THAT'S what Divine Intervention is for!!"    I had it on my bar but thought it was dumb, why would I won't to kill myself?    When I DI'd the other pally and the rest of us died, silence, then everyone went "OOOHHHH!  That's awesome!  I get it now!"
---
No it’s a bug, no beta for you.
---
stfu
---
Maybe the over the top metal videos gag will get old, but I think the larger pvp video market will be bigger than ever. I think for many of the older returning players, wpvp videos are a way for them to really engage in the game at the same depth as they did when hardcore raiding, but without the larger time commitment that things like families get in the way of.
---
I'm suing
---
Realms came up for about 3-4 minutes, but said incompatible client. Restarted my launcher/etc and nothing downloaded. Now they're back offline.
---
Yeah and this dude is saying P3 should come late 2020/early 2021. Thats extreme lol.
---
Fuck those fuckers....
---
It's when they reach the end of their route they despawn.
---
Why does him not thinking he has an invite based off realm selection make him an idiot. People like you are why this sub is toxic.
---
It’s a bug 100%
---
Haha, true, but BWL wasn't that hard, not was AQ.
---
Wtf warlocks are huge assets to raids and required for certain boss fights. Their damage is great once you get hit gear.
---
Have fun on the stress test may 29!
---
Again we're getting changes
---
I have a choice between layering and dynamic spawns
---
Not login que times and more servers. If que times and more servers were an option. I would take that too. Better than layering
---
The real solution to population problems, which do exist. Is dynamic spawns. 
---
In vanilla they merged and let you transfer servers. 
---
The P servers coulda layered too. No one wanted that solution for a reason. 
---
These things have all been debated for over a decade.
---
It's a bug.
---
You do not have access.
---
 https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1132007681278009344
---
It’s just a bug. Calm down.
---
when did he call him an idiot?
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info
---
Wut? I just told him no and gave him a official tweet going with it.
---
I think its the opposite here. Like should i suck his dick next time ?
---
I'd stick my raid in that
---
They listened to the fans and then we got what retail is today. Lots of portal. Too much QoL updates. Easy questing, mobs getting killed in 3 seconds, etc.
---
HAVE FUN ON STRESS TRAT MAY 29
---
We aren't disputing any of that, everything point you've made is correct. We're disputing whether they are still going to be relevant when they are released due to differences in the player base growth.
---
I certainly don't think releasing the entire honor system patch on release is the answer, but BGs without honor rewards wouldn't hurt.
---
That’s assuming you can get 8/8. I’ve seen people raid for 2 years without seeing a final piece of their needed set drop. And in the meantime typically they get upgrades in their other 7 slots.
---
Heartbeat is for players vs cc.
---
All player vs mob cc should last full duration if it applies.
---
He said "didn't" not idiot...
---
Yup. Just run through the mob when it starts cast and your back will be facing them.
---
So. it doesnt seem like they knew this bug appeared at all until this? :S
---
What? Who called anyone an idiot?
---
Cant get into Beta Make your own
---
Unfortunately you haven't got in, it's a visual glitch as the servers are down for WSG install at the moment.
---
Yeah I'm hoping for about 6 months a phase at a minimum.
---
"If game bad, game bad. If game good, game good"

Not to mention your gear looks like total garbage, as it should since you are getting it from random people.

I’ve played a lot on pservers and no it’s not like that unless you min max like crazy. For 99% of players, assuming raids are somewhat similar to pservers, you are going to die a lot even in molten core. And if your raid is full of meme specs you will inevitably start to think about having tighter standards.

Arenas - No

Arena Gear - yes

Meh, Paladins can tank 5-mans just fine. Give them back Holy Strike, a taunt and tune mana costs/threat and it could work easily. Way better than Druids.

Tony Jay my dude
---
This is the only relevant argument so far in this discussion.
---
WSG will surely lower the amount of w-pvp but it will also lower the honor farming of quest areas which is a good thing for everyone trying to level.
---
Or they simply up the subscription cost to the same as a WoW token because they know all the classic fans will just have to pay as they won’t be able to buy the tokens.
---
 *V E R Y G O O D B O Y S*

Same to you friend! I'm excited for us both! :)
---
HHHNNNNGGGHHHHHHH
---
Every breath is unending. They last a lifetime underwater irl too
---
I can see that and that's fair.  It does make you appreciate the different periods and ebbs and flows of the game.  I just don't really agree with the "it took 2 years back then so it should take 2 years again now".   Maybe I'm speaking for myself, but we're all older now and while I do want to play the experience again, but I don't plan on putting near the effort of raw hours or addiction levels into the game and don't think I would stick around a full 2 years waiting for WSG when it was one of my favorite features that I played for years.
---
This hurt to read I started to sweat out of excitement
---
Is jebaited the word of the day or something.

ffs...

My point exactly... yet I get downvotes :l

This is completely false!

wrong next is in 5 days
---
Earl Boen was the voice actor for the opening cut scenes.
---
so there would be a character specific cooldown where that node doesn't appear to you and only you, whenever that particular node spawns on ANY layer? 
---
possibly, seems somewhat complex though. Made more complex by the fact that any number of layers could be active

Also World Defense, where you needed a certain rank to talk.

if the beta test servers are visible does that mean I'll be able to log on when they're up?

You're basically right on both. I you take engineering, at level 1 you will have 1+15 engineering (16) at the max at 300, you would have 315.

&gt;&gt; And yet Google tells me gen y was used first

My husband is in Beta and he only saw 1, not two - that was the case during the stress test also
---
WESTERN PLAGUELANDS...
---
This is great idea mate.
---
Let’s not bring the pog thing over here....
---
&gt; For example when I create a gnome do I get a instant level 15?
---
If, IF, you pick up Engineering as a profession your skill in Engineering will instantly be 16 (1 basic + 15).
---
The impact of that is that you will immediately be able to learn recipes for and craft items that require a skill level of 16 or lower. Effectively 15 since AFAIK recipes go every 5 levels. Any other race would have to craft enough level 1-15 items to reach that skill level. So you get a jump start.
---
&gt;  Lets say I max out engineering does the racial give me 15+ on top of the cap?
---
Yes. Though I'm not sure that there's any impact to having a skill level over the cap for Engineering. For gathering professions I believe there is some benefit since there's chance of failure when picking herbs and mining.
---
Rag will possibly be down in 7 days at the latest two weeks. Watch
---
They had in vanilla yes. The argument he made was that in classic that activity will be less.
---
Couldn't get in, (repeat that for 2.5 hours).
---
Finally get in,  Wall to tall humans and dead mobs as far as the eye could see. (warriors, Mages, Rogues mostly, then Warlocks and priests)
---
Unlike the undead, gnome, and nightelf starting lands which basically grouped up as fast as you could, the humans tended to want to fight for tag credit rather than  group up get the stupid kill quests over.
---
If Blizzard is going towards progressive *loot tables*, which they've strongly hinted towards, then it's highly unlikely that the eye/leaf will be in Domo's chest at launch.
---
It's a bug:  [https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1132007681278009344](https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1132007681278009344)
---
Yup! This game aint going anywhere. We've got a lifetime of gameplay ahead of us.
---
No offense to you 90-year old gamers.
---
I just meant for this beta WSG
---
For who? Every skill level? Every class? *what?*
---
I'm hearing such conflicted information about classic. Some people say elites are pushovers, others are saying the game is crazy hard.
---
Quest Items are not round robin.  They are either 'All Can Loot', or 'Each Corpse is round robin' regardless of contents.
---
Now I'm fucking sad. This is the next level of trolling.
---
With some habit you could tell how many hp the opposite players had according to the gear he was wearing.
---
Thanks for the elaborate explanations, I think that what made Vanilla so special is that we had this and only this. We did not knew about BC when we started grinding, we expected an expansion but never knew when it was coming.
---
So the grinding felt more rewarding because of the unknown,  now people pretty much know what to expect in term of expansion released. We did not have tons of boss helper addons back in the days, but I remember that we had some sort of BossAlert things...
---
The big complaint I have about the evolution of WoW is the lowering the difficulty in term of gear and game mechanics (Catch up gear, removing spell levels, everyone has a heal and looks like mass res is a thing now). 
---
Maybe we are right, we are getting older and we are just old and grumpy...
---
lol everyone knew it was fake. it was a publicity stunt for pals for life.
---
I’m at work right now, but there is an amazing video on YouTube exactly how to get exalted with Darnasus while leveling. I’ll post a link if I remember.
---
Frostwolf for vanilla 
---
Maine’s blackdragonflight since then.
---
I'm fine with opening stuff up over time as it happened. I don't like the idea of just picking and choosing what to patch in/out.  I just don't think something that ended up so beloved as BG's should be opened up a full 2 years later like originally happened.
---
Would be cool if they added these later on, if classic continues to be popular XD
---
Don't think anyone can check just yet.  But I know it was asked in an interview with the devs and they said that they are probably going to be in.  Of course we can't be sure until we can level up to that point.
---
The wow api \*might\* be able to query the quest and see if it's in.  but even if it can query quests that you can't accept, all the quests might actually be in just not accessible so that could be a false flag anyway.
---
Weird my battle net isn't updating it yet.
---
Is this normal to see if I just had been invited to the stress test beta? Previously, I only saw the Stress Test realms.
---
Cthun was like the king of rng bosses.
---
hahaha
---
So cool
---
The only thing more annoying than the streamers are the people that incessantly complain about the streamers.
---
Elaborate
---
The main advantage paladin has over priest and other classes in BG's is that the others require complimentary dispels to make sure you don't eat a long cc chain. 
---
Because of blessing of sacrifice/bubble/blessing of protection Paladin is vastly harder to lock down than the other classes. Yes shamans have totems but those are easily dealt with. There is no counter play to bubble. And counterplay is almost impossible with blessing of sacrifice 
---
ANd you can put blessing of sacrifice on your whole team
---
The thing you want to avoid teh most as a healer in vanilla is getting into a long CC chain. DR takes a long time a mage alone can sit tehre and poly you for a  literal minute while he burns globals on ur allies in between.
---
The main down side is paladin has no offensive options. So while they are the best support assuming your team needs support. They have no thing to do if they don't, and will bring very little to the group.
---
Which is why in AB Shamans are better than Pala. The only place in PvP IMO. Because Paladins don't bring any damage to the table. So you're basically useless when you want to nuke defenders, if the map gets to a point where there is no one who needs healing. YOu're just basically an empty slot
---
But the other healers pay a price for their CC/damage dealing abilities. Crappy support kit next to pala
---
Priest is important on alliance for manaburn/mindcontrol/fear ward/ and especially offensive dispel
---
No one brings them because they need a healer, you'd just bring another paladin. They are brought for their offensive options and buffs. Fort/fearward are great
---
No wide-screen monitors in vanilla days!
---
If there's no PvP system for over 4 months then what the fuck are we supposed to do? Level alts, farm gold and watch the grass grow?
---
Where do you see the new build numbers?
---
everyone who says "a few weeks" doesn't also add that it could be "a few months" *as per Blizzard's note*.
---
Two months is ample time for a top tier guild to horde shit ton of black lotuses, devilsaur and other rare nodes
---
You're underestimating the no-life ability of Classic players
---
n1
---
Yes...? That's what I said.
---
If you're in the beta, you wouldn't see the alpha servers. Everyone can see all the servers, even if they were only in the stress test
---
I didn't. A little part inside of me just died...
---
So, how fast did the other zones do it in? Grouping is great to get the quests done but you have to kill more mobs to get the same exp, if you grouped for every quest and didnt kill extra mobs, you wouldnt be 5 :(
---
If you don’t wanna look like shit, get your full T3 or R14. Otherwise, stop being a shitty
---
yeah indeed, I mean just listen to the voice com "uh yeah we have a 32.33 repeating of course chance of survival"
---
Yep, work in sales from home.   Depending on how effectively I use my time, could end up being paid for multiple hours per day on wow

Yeah having the appearance of an item you are actually wearing is a bad thing. Good one.
---
&gt; Vanilla is a casual game
---
lol, you must be new here
---
They currently give full reputation at level 24.  This might change if it's not intended.
---
If you like healing and want to go horde you have the following choices:
---
* Priest: Pretty easy to level as shadow (DPS spec). You can heal up until ~lvl50 dungeons even as shadow. For high level just respec to healing and you're good to go.
---
* Shaman (Horde only): Leveling is actually quite fun as enhancement (melee) shaman and not too hard imo. You can heal yourself, do decent damage while leveling, have tons of utility and on top of that get a traveling form (Ghost Wolf) at level 20. If you want you can even tank dungeons until a certain level (although it's hard), I guess healing also works until a certain point (with the second gear set). On max level you will have to heal with the class anyway, so respec at that point.
---
* Druid: Most people level as feral, which means you shape shift into a cat or bear. The cat functions similar to the rogue and the bear similar to warriors. I've never played it myself, but I heard it's quite fun. On max level you can again just respec to heal and go from there.
---
I have personally played shaman quite a bit and can only recommend it. The only downside is, that the class quests for the totems are quite lengthy.
---
I'd say that you can play any class casually. Some classes definitely take longer than others to level, but that should not be a real concern as long as you are having fun.
---
Nop
---
Play BFA if you want transmog.
---
thats sick bro
---
keep it up
---
get out...
---
Been looking around and the common answer seems to be you received less reputation for gray quests during Vanilla WoW. Been looking through the patch notes and can't find anything when they changed it to give full XP. A lot of people seem to think it was during BC or Wrath when it was changed. The beta is currently giving full rep for gray quests. I'm not sure that is accurate. I think more people should report t to Blizzard for double checking.
---
Actually going from 285 to 300 is pretty easy with engineering. You just need the thorium shell recipe.
---
How did anyone believe they were going to add EVERYONE IN THE STRESS TEST to closed beta?
---
Especially when they said that THE SAME STRESS TESTERS ARE INVITED TO THE STRESS TEST ON WEDNESDAY.
---
Come on guys. Use your head.

Same I've been in beta since day 1. Same exact option on the launcher. There's supposedly a launcher/client patch coming today.
---
My point was, Old Blizzard was all about the player experience. It was their top priority.
---
Old Blizz never would've approved a solution that sacrifices player experience so merging servers could be a small bit easier.
---
If there's ever to do a decently sized beta wave invite for NA and EU, it'd be a day when they push a new build bug fixes etc. Logically speaking, but it won't happen.
---
i do remember certain addons would stick nameplates on everything as soon as it spawned i don't remember if it was in vanilla or TBC.

Not exactly the point... The event actually happened and they reenacted it for this, which is cool cause it's both a real event but with a new script, adding those great quotes. Pretty sure some people didn't know about the details :)
---
There's plenty of dress up games on the internet if that's what you want to do. My niece has a good one I've seen. This is an MMO though, your appearance depends on the items you wear.
---
for humans you probably are better off doing the fedex / exploration to 5 since that takes an hour ish?       
---
Otherwise you need to be more specific
---
I thought the flood was a neat idea, but yea the retail version is waaay inferior. Doesn't have the charm of the original.
---
RemindMe! 95 Days "/console WeatherDensity 3"
---
No, either you care for stats or style. Not both.
---
&gt; it will be gone quickly
---
Potentially could be here the entire phase 1. Why is everyone so quick to dismiss that it could last the entire time? Just because blizz said "we hope its only a few weeks" is no guarantee whatsoever
---
oof 7% upvoted
---
you already are subbed to a game with transmog
---
I am out of the loop for years. What's really hard there? I mean, there is some amount of luck needed or it's mostly about getting all folks working together and knowing their stuff?  Or a combination of everything? 
---
As i feel it, wow is about knowing your class and tactics on a raid boss. Never played pvp, but i count it being hard, because humans are less predictable than triggers.
---
I mean for me "hard" means - Dark Soul or I wanna be the boshy, that's kind of stuff.
---
That depends on what you're trying to optimise.

Iam german and i wanted to get the sweet karma before checking how officialy is written :P
---
Thank god you didn't. We don't need anymore of you cringe twitch spammers in the closed beta.
---
There are clandestine (and official) gladiator pits in Azeroth. Betting rings, people who *own* their fighters... I think Varian was part of one once.
---
The Arena is just you participating in such fights!
---
agreed
---
People dislikes sharding, so Blizzard creates layering instead.... 
---
Cant they just create servers like they used to?

I dont mind wearing dresses sometimes, but you want to wear them all the time?!
---
Dig it!
---
yeah man what an emotional ride i just went on in the past 5 minutes LOL
---
I will watch their progress with great interest!
---
Read up on how the actual honor system works.
---
At least you're not a half asser
---
I dont mind wearing dresses. I have no shame.
---
blizzard can't even afford that many GMs for Classic, as evidence by their post on loot trading.
---
What an amazing attitude to have..you'll go far
---
This might be level 1-10 scaling, but I don't recall if that happened to spells as well.
---
No one's is I think, at least streamers. I'm assuming he's looking off of something else
---
here's hoping they have a bug fix list
---
One could run a service where you plant lvl 1 alts on each layer, with an addon that will invite everyone on a whitelist who whispers that alt to the layer. Then charge people a fee for each day to be whitelisted. Make server hopping great again!
---
I got it from here - https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/questie/
---
It works just fine but it is missing a TON of quests as it's in the early stage and lots of data missing
---
If you're in the beta, report it to Blizzard for double checking please.
---
Malakaaa haha
---
The buggy leap of faith quest was one of the best in vanilla wow IMO.
---
instances scale with you... until you cross an expansion boundary.
---
yeah, if you are trying to do classic dungeon with WoTLK gear, of course you'll steamroll it.
---
Just like you'd steamroll RFK if you came in with a BWL geared toon.
---
Would you say you guys did it fast? Like where you super optimized or just fucking around?
---
and i'll still giggle when i enter "breakwind canyon"
---
Not human, but:
---
I got 1-5 in about 2.5 hours /played.  Troll Mage in Durotar.  11:00pm PST - 1:30am PST.
---
Would’ve been faster if I had tried harder.  Was acting as a vending machine for everyone.

Rhok delar wasnt added in 1.4 it was 1.11
---
What do you think you could have done it in? 2 hours? 1.5 maybe if you super optimized?
---
They stated they basically don't want to set up enough discrete servers to handle the initial launch load and then have dead servers sitting around a month later, but they also don't want players to have to wait in long queues since they have the technology to alleviate that now.

---
This is very valid and persuasive. Thank you!
---
I watch IndyCar auto racing and NHL hockey, and the Olympics. (when they're happening) and obviously, I am also excited for WoW Classic. what now?
---
Let's not forget the fish scales you need taking up bag space along with the fish oil. And how small stacks used to be in Vanilla. (cries in Zandali)
---
&gt; The ability to ***effectively*** farm  
---
This is the key.  We have absolutely ***ZERO*** idea beyond mere speculation and some early clips on the beta that this is even going to be a thing.
---
Of course. There seems to be no definitive proof for either scenario which is why I hope Blizzard takes a look.
---
I’m having some serious hype about classic, so I decided to see if all of my old screenshots were on one of my hard drives. I was happy to see that they survived from 2006.
---
Your shitty specced hybrid wouldnt have been taken to any content after or even to naxx. If you were in naxx 14 years ago you were adhering to 1 or two specs for your role.
---
Hybrid wasn’t a thing in a raid. Your healed, your dpsed or you tanked. If you were one doing the other you were aiming to prevent a wipe or fucked up attempt. 
---
I’m here proposing additional content—you know wanting raids to be engrossing and engaging returning progression to tired strategized to death content. 
---
Also the disc priest of live is 3 times the hybrid that any classic wow class talent spec could produce.
---
But I’m not asking for retail wow. I want classic with real 2019/2020 raiding. I want my leveling to take 2 irl months with a job. I want agi on my cloth gear and spirit on my 2h swords. I’m even okay with classics simple combat rotations in the name of pvp digestability. But saying you are happy with vanilla raid difficulty just means you’re bad at the game.
---
Sound fading...
---
Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong, Thousand Needles, tauren mamma, take me home, country roads.
---
This is overly pessimistic. Legion and BFA launches were very smooth for 95% of people (note 5% of 4 million is still quite a lot of people).  
---
By all accounts Classic launch will be much more manageable and less rushed than those expansions. It's likely most people will be playing from the first hour completely fine.
---
It was 20 yards but ok
---
Wow corrected I stand
---
well, they could have added it for testing battlegrounds without stress test even if it's more meaningful to do it Wednesday x)
---
You mean way back when? Well there was a time were Stratholme was a 10 man raid.
---
did you miss the giant rock needles?
---
Yeah I mean it sounds staged as hell, you hear them holding the laughs in and all, but yeah still a great vid nonetheless for sure !
---
He's not, it's just an overlay
---
Why exactly do they hate dot classes? Cant leave combat with feign death? Been so long since I played
---
I think he was referring to Islands &amp; Warfronts, y’know the signature BFA content.
---
Yes it was true. 
---
Usually you did all dungeons with 10 man, only quest runs with 5  because quests did not work in raid. 
---
But it was changed later. So with 1.12 we will only have 5 man runs ;)
---
UBRS is 10 (was 15).
---
I mean in Vanilla WoW (and soon to be Classic WoW) yes.
---
thank for you for the explanation :)
---
Yes on both
---
You could back in the early patches of wow...quests could not be completed.  I remember in a private server that mimicked these content patches there was this warrior that kept spamming BRD lava runs with IF reserved and the group always had around 20 people in it.
---
One does not simply play WoW as a noob and not swim around exploring the entire continent.
---
My buddy and I wanted to see what was behind the Greymane Wall and explored all of the Gilneas mountainous coast. This was 4AM back in 2006. Great night.
---
It requires 20 on the beta server
---
Question is: How did they serve Illidan then? Were the Old Gods secretly supporting him?
---
Bloodlust was added in TBC.
---
You and me both, I thought I was blessed. :(
---
You could in early vanilla. You'd get loot but you couldn't complete any quests in a raid.
---
Yes. But I got patched. You won’t be able to do this in classic.
---
You used to be able to take in a full 40.  I know you can do 10 for BRS (upper is a 10 man, but lower is usually 5 and it's the same instance).  I don't know about other dungeons.
---
*looks at u/mrcoulropobia's l browsing history in terror*
---
Maybe 300 to use, but 315 to craft, so a gnome engineer can make it for others
---
Oh I see. That’s the part that sortave confused me because of all the streams and videos I watched of the beta only had 5 mans.
---
When you say you're 'apart' of something, it means the opposite of being 'a part' of something.
---
Fuck. This is exciting. I am pumped.
---
I'd say that's fine. You understand that they are all games and worth enjoying. Whether you are young or old. 
---
I'm talking about the people that say all games are just for kids, yet hypocritically watch sports all the time, or consume copious amounts of television. 
---
Sorry if that wasn't clear.
---
In the OLD vanilla it was. I dont think so on the current Beta. Nobody can grind to 60 yet and its also based of 1.12 i think and that is WAY after Stratholme 10 man.
---
in Naxx they go mental in damage.. 
---
I remember walking into MC in shadoweave set @ lvl 58 in vanilla  and out pacing everyone apart from rogues (even with hit issues.. and needing constant healing due to low hp/mana pool).
---
It's not that hard clearing Classic's raids, as you, your raid and especially your tank/s have farmed for hours for those precious consumables.
---
Just like the countless BfA issues that people pointed out in the beta that made it to the release?
---
SHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=16051](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16051)
---
You just need thorium bars and dense stone. Really easy to get at max lvl.
---
Software Dev. My boss mentioned they’ve had a few days where things have been so slow they’ll play games. All of our PCs could run wow. Maybe I’ll talk him into having everyone play WoW that Friday classic comes out.
---
Not to mention name changes due to conflicts for players and guilds.
---
Finally a post with some gonads! This is absolutely what should happen, and they should have stuck with sharding the beginner zones ONLY
---
Because battlegrounds kill world pvp. Besides, if you queue at level 10 you'll just get your ass handed to you by a premade of 19 twinks.
---
This is insane. What exactly will be ready before classic? The raid or the models? And what can we use it for? Just for looks?
---
I don't think you understand. The bug is that everyone can see every server. If you're in Alpha, you see only the alpha server, if you're in beta you only see the beta server, if you're in stress test then you should see no servers. But as it is now, every server shows up for everyone.
---
Like so many styles in art, the vanilla pvp editing was a design solution to a technical problem. The technical problem being how do cheapskates who can't afford a FRAPS license present a bunch of 30sec video clips without being jarring. To deal with this need to constantly cut, they embraced a variety of crazy transitions.
---
Is that good for the game's future? I don't want it to end like the last time...
---
&gt;Horde side: Spriest/Warlock is damn near unbeatable.
---
when the wife and I were 50 on this duo, we got jumped by level 60 Rogue + druid duo.
---
We ran acros the entire zone until eventually the fight end on the ocean bottom, the rogue died to dots, and the druid eventually died because we never let him escape the fatigue until he drowned... as a sea lion..
---
Well no one knows right now.
---
In WotLK I created Dora the Explorer and I leveled up way higher than I thought for just exploring.

---
I just flip my sandwich over after every single bite so it's like alternating between two different sandwiches.
---
Unless it's just a peanut butter sandwich. Obviously, I still do it, but it doesn't do anything.
---
I played Burning Blade alliance for s little while too.
---
It probably started by people checking wheter they were invited and noticing the listing for servers had changed. Overjoyed and to inform others people post screens and tell others that another wave might have gone out. Then people started noticing that there are suprisingly lot of those post and others reporting the same, the creeping dread approached that maybe something is wrong. The numbers keep growing, the chances of bug keep escalating, people still wish that somehow they got in especially with WSG and Honor being added.  
---
Then the final confirmation hits, hopes dashed, dreams crushed, hearts sunken, day ruined.
---
Don’t worry, we’ll add it to the not a bug list. :). 
---
Anyway, hearing him do the undead intro night was so epic.
---
no way to know. I can see alpha though and I am certainly not in that.
---
To make sure I understand this correctly... You gain access to recipes 15 levels early, but they still turn green at the same level as normal?
---
&gt;This does not stop our father from belittling the hobby every chance he gets.

I had an uncle do this until I started shit talking both his chewing habbit and the fact that he would spend tons and tons of time in front of a television.
---
ah damn you are right! i still have nightmares on brutallus where we tried to have one shaman per group to maximize the dps
---
Like this one [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVjjLozBC2g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVjjLozBC2g) . I tested it on Classic Beta and it still works, but you don't ress in Coldridge, you ress in Kharanos. Still worth it!
---
It doesn't work for me, it wont let me select my install directory as it's looking for `Wow.exe` (which for some reason is case sensitive) and the executable is named `wow.exe`
---
You can always progress in the game, just skip a couple quests in the starting zone. In the world it's not a problem since people are staggered in levels. Your level 1-6 experience is not more important that the whole game for months for everyone.
---
"low-key"
---
The other zone did it in 60-90 minutes each, mostly waiting on mobs to pop.
---
Basically yes.
---
I actually feel bad for people who have no idea what is happening and get super hyped up and then just find out, yet another bug... you aren't actually invited. This is the 2nd time they have had a bug like this, the first was when they sent out emails to players that never actually got invited. Kinda glad I haven't had this happened to me
---
I think if you used POG or LULW in the stress test you should be barred from getting into the closed Beta.
---
Interesting. I have a second PTR account as well.
---
Then why are you still carrying on this argument? You've had so many chances to say "yes, I agree, while vanilla raids aren't as difficult as raids today they are still a lot harder than content that is impossible to fail" and left it at that.
---
The people who pushed for a classic wow, who stuck to their guns for years while others told them to move on, aren't going to quit because of a queue.
---
Anyone leaving for that reason won't matter to vanilla's longevity; the players who pushed for it and want it will be here
---
SM armory is the cap
---
Cool write up, I started wow a year after the game was out and on a low population server with the consequence we could never gather 40 people for raids (maybe 26 at best) and reached Ragnaros as our furthest run.   
---
Eventually I got fed up, rerolled a priest and went on a busier realm where I joined a guild that was farming MC and BWL the same evening. I don't remember the fight being that hard but it helps for sure to be around people who know what to do. I am looking forward discovering how it feels in a slightly fresher environment.     
---
But yeah the 40 people requirement is just insane and cannot be stressed enough, it is a lot of people who have to all play together without breaks for a few hours. Also the drama, ah the drama, I did not realize people could be so much dramatic before I played wow, I remember this warlock who was super pissed for not getting her loot on Kazaak instead of  someone else.   
---
And yeah the part I am not looking forward too is finding myself with people who have trouble pushing 3 buttons, so many slackers or bad players in vanilla, I am sure the people honed on private server will be up to the task though.
---
You can but you won't make it back out.
---
thats true I phrased that badly
---
This is what happened with me
---
So an hour via exploration is a pretty safe bet then, thanks
---
I feel less bad about people who post without taking literally 2 seconds to sort by new
---
Ressing in Coldridge is not blizzlike though, doing this will "only" get you to Kharanos :) which is still far better than the Wetlands death-run and only adds about 4-5min from actually ressing in Coldridge.
---
The only time you should do a higher level dungeon is if you're being carried by those who are higher level than the dungeon
---
I'm not a streamer. I have access. Cry more about streamer 'privilege'
---
There's a stickied Beta Bugs/Problems MEGATHREAD at the top of the sub.
---
There was no point where I said Mythic wasn't difficult or that any fight in Vanilla was harder. Your entire post is structured like you're responding to a "vanilla is the hardest shit ever and mythic is for dice rolling RNG babies" statement.
---
&gt;Don’t be daft. Very few fights at the zenith of mythic progression truly come down to rng. If an individual gets targeted by an ability 3 times in a row—that’s bad rng for the player, but balanced in the raid cause no one else has to stop dps.
---
&gt;99% of mythic fights have predictable ability cooldowns and predictable phase transitions. None of that is rng.
---
&gt;Very few things truly kill your as rng with no chance to react—the vast majority of deaths are a result of poor individual decision making or a strategy that creates rng by how inflexible or truly inferior it is for the task at hand. 
---
Look, I'm not going to get into a whole thing with you here about world prog vs hardcore vs shitty straggler guilds killing fights after 30 nerfs, but over the last few tiers, the first guilds to kill end-of-raid bosses are killing them by cheesing problematic mechanics by stacking a class that happens to deal with a mechanic extremely easily. A lot of top 100 guilds will go into those fights with the same or similar strategies but not the same stacked compositions (and certainly not the same skill level), and that means relying on RNG, gear power creeping throughput or hotfix nerfs to push you through to certain parts of the fights.
---
&gt;I’m talking about mechanical challenge, something beyond decurse, move bad debuff out of group, taunt rotation, and step out of bad.
---
Yeah, great point, now they've really turned the fucking heat up on the current generation of WoW raiders. Now you have to STAND IN some things or else the raid takes damage! 
---
But seriously speaking, most of those things are trivialized by announcement addons, timers, certain class kits and giant blurbs of text plastered on your screen in case you happen to forget your singular placement in a strategic rotation amidst all the different timer bars, gigantic text announcements and .wav files playing that is typical to modern hardcore raiding.
---
&gt;Modern mythic raids have complex mechanics that require not only knowledge of ones own class but a complicated positional dance for the raid as well. 
---
Okay, you're just romanticizing and waxing poetic now. Name a single mythic mechanic in the last 4 raids that fits that description without making "use your [mobility or displacement ability] to place a mechanic in a certain spot" sound pretentious.
---
&gt;LFR CoS is harder than 8/10 MC. 
---
Haven't done it, but I'm kinda doubting LFR CoS is harder than Baron with a bunch of equally skilled players in greens and blues. Maybe they've radically changed their philosophy on CoS in the last month since I quit playing, or maybe you just never pugged MC with the kind of players that would be using LFR in 2019 lol
---
&gt;Even BC has more interesting mechanics than classic
---
No argument there.
---
&gt;there’s a reason when ony was rereleased in wrath she had more mechanics...
---
Maybe your memory is better than mine, but when Ony was rereleased in 3.3, she didn't reset threat when she went into the air. She wasn't immune to fire any more and her MT knockback ability didn't have a threat penalty either. Eruptions happened DURING and after fear in vanilla, not just after, and melee could never hit her in the air in vanilla either. Not sure what you're remembering but rereleased Ony was a joke compared to 1.0 Ony.
---
&gt;Modern wow offers challenging bosses due to mechanics. Most of vanillas raid challenge is due to boss stats, needing higher ilvl, more stam, regen, throughput. 
---
Modern WoW has a lot of what is called mechanic vomit, where you get thrown a bunch of shit that is simple to do on it's own but it's combination with 3 other things at the same time is what makes it hard and the real challenge is figuring out how to make them coincide because let's be honest, between addons, assignments and raid leader callouts, you as an average player are doing half the mental workload for most fights in the game.
---
Also, mages use Blizzard whenever there are enough targets to make it worth it, just like AoEing in retail. Add phases and retail boss fights are like exaggerating morons and Reddit. In classic there's more nuance, and "fuck it just throw some adds in there" is a lot less prevalent in the fight design.
---
Apologies for the rest but I don't even understand the other points you're trying to make. Hunters will get assfucked in high mobility fights too because they lose aimed shot. Warlocks have multi dotted as long as it's been worth it. 
---
&gt;There is a lot of stuff in classic raiding that holds up: 40 people, theme, itemization...but after 15 years difficulty is not one of them.
---
Agreed, but you've structured your arguments for it pretty poorly.
---
I'm saving this post for whenever I finally get access into the game, I will definitely give my support by installing. Keep up the good work !
---
Well ya, I wasn't speaking about the people posting, this happened to 1000s of players. A large majority got hyped and then realized it was all for nothing, that sucks
---
Is that even possible in classic? Like when did experience locking come into the game?
---
It seems my superiority has led to some controversy
---
2019 - People still don't know how to take screenshots.
---
I'm not sure about human 1-5 normal / good times questing, but I honestly think it's going to heavily depend on how much layering there is.    
---
I THINK it's going to be better than the *average* player for sure, since most will be slow and don't know what's going on.      
---
Honestly you might be better off waiting for the stress test next week and ask it again, since I'm going to bet that servers are slightly better and people are testing 1-10 routes.
---
Druids don't get moonfire at lvl 1 tho.
---
It's also beta and it's not working correctly, there's cross realm issues and players are experiencing sharding, it's not working as intended at this moment in time. Come release and if Blizz stick to their word there will be layers of, on average, 3k players, if you have about 6k players per server that's just two layers for a few weeks. It's hardly going to make anyone a fortune.
---
No, it is a visual bug only unless you were already in Beta.

How was that, a lot of competition for those scorpions? I am trying to see how viable my 1-5 via exploration is. I can get to 5 in about an hour (a bit less) with around 2.5 silver (before repairing).
---
I played the blizzcon version and I never used anything besides corruption shadow bolt and wand.  The CoA and immolate did not do enough damage ticks per mana spent, because monsters plainly didn't have a large enough health pool for the dots.  Sometimes if I wanted to make sure a monster died under drain life and they had corruption coming off in 5secs I would cast an immolate to get another dot going, but mainly wand and shadow bolt are better damage and keep you from coming under attack from too much burst damage and threat.
---
I don’t like you
---
pretty obvious
---
Nah sorry bro 
---
Mythic is just as much of a joke tbh.  The strats basically written by blizzard, and there are guides up almost immediately on how to kill the boss.  Furthermore, the raid usually completely outgears the content.  
---
Things like C'thun were tuned so high that it was impossible to kill them.   That's best gear, flawless play, best class balance, etc..  Now, your just handed epics at every step.
---
You're fucking hilarious. You completely misread what I write, and then keep doubling down when I won't implicitly spell out my agreement with you. You don't even need to read between the lines on this. What is wrong with you? You're either trolling or just...wow...
---
Also, don't bother responding. I won't see it or anything you say on Reddit ever again. Bye, Felicia.
---
That is what happened to all of us.
---
I think there's evidence like this that they really wanted there to be interdependence between classes, professions, etc. and uniqueness to characters and factions. The history of WoW since vanilla has been eliminating everything that made one character different from another.
---
There should be a streamer vs streamer kill count.

I just saw this, only got invited to the stress test and had no beta prior to that...

Is this the new standard or did I actually get invited?

I like skylines a lot. But the lack of difficulty is my major complaint—it’s neary impossible to irreparably damage your city. You can make your city completely undesirable in simcity4 borrow too much and lose.

For sure, I will likely be watching that one live. This past one I was in the hospital with my daughter the entire time and didn't get to watch any of it. Cheers
---
I don't understand why people are fanboying TBC, it turns the game halfway into BFA with all the shit QoL changes, and Outland mostly makes Azeroth obsolete.
---
portals everywhere, dailies, flying and extreme faction balance. All the shit we don't want
---
We get the rule 34 version of course
---
Even as someone who likely won’t play classic, I’m really happy that it’s coming back. Currently our fantastic raids are being paid for by a bunch of people that don’t even raid, and with how unrewarding bfa is right now, it feels like the casual crowd is slipping away. Hopefully classic will bring a lot more excitement and hype to the game
---
Skip between the start and end of the video, notice the fewer rain effects on the screen
---
I can hear the horde of Blizzard apologists charging towards this video.
---
I love how the majority of this subreddit was gawking about how layering "just works". Meanwhile the most basic, idiotic loophole exists...logging in and out.
---
Do you dare read around this subreddit before posting?
---
Number fucking 1 rule of Reddit: If you thought about posting it, it's already been posted.
---
finding a 5 man run for strat/scholo was pretty rare and only done to do quests, otherwise it was 10 man all day.  they were 10 man max for an entire year right in the middle of vanilla so moss people experienced them that way rather than 40 man at the beginning or 5 man at the end
---
Thats great mate! Good job  on digging that up.
---
That's the thing though, we don't know how many layers Blizzard are going to be using, it could be that it's 2 layers of 3k players for a total realm pop of 6k. It's hardly going to make anyone a fortune layer hopping in the first month of WoW classic especially when it's not going to be efficient nor will you know what character is on what layer to hop to. You could hop to layer 2 only to find out everything's already been gathered, it's going to be populated by another server's worth of players after all.
---
Edited to answer, my way was to go to SW through Ironforge, which makes Kharanos rez the best option! thanks for pointing it out ! :)
---
shamans get nothing from resto, so youll be elemental anyways, a dps dealer.
---
druids are just sad all around, might as well just /quit
---
pally is alliance, so not even an option if you aint a bitch
---
and priest, well who really wants to play a priest amiright
---
Your only choice being is shaman. And you wont even heal, youll be a damage dealer more than not.
---
The first one
---
Is anyone else getting really tired of these streamers?
---
Initially (2004) you could take a full raid into any dungeon.
---
thanks for the speedy reply, my heart is broken but now I know at least
---
Downvoting someone saying “No” to shitty advice? Alright. 
---
I don’t even know why I’m posting this. Speaking the truth once equals downvotes. Speaking the truth twice equals double downvotes, right? :&gt;
---
No, no you don't
---
You're welcome. If it's a toss up between those, maybe jump on a private server and see which u prefer more, as that's the most important deciding factor
---
That's some fine wallpaper material
---
Hi, /u/syphonmana
---
Good luck with that ingame 🙂
---
The first one XD
---
And some dumb mechanics. On the patch classic will be on, does it still require 8 specifically geared prot warriors to do four horsemen?
---
It’s a bug, everyone is seeing it
---
But the streamers will put in more hours than anyone else thus finding more bug than most other people.
---
o7
---
Yeah it was never meant that 10 man is "the usual" way to play those dungeons.
---
No I understand and have seen the tweet but your first post made a blanket statement that just because the alpha server is showing = no beta invite. Or that's at least the way it reads to me, just a misunderstanding...
---
Draenor EU
---
Alliance
---
the classic one XD
---
Outside VoT, there was hardly anyone out there.  Occasionally I’d have competition but it was pretty easy.
---
Just hugged near the VoT gate and around Sen’Jin Village Killing the 5’s-6’s.
---
Had to hit level 3 first because the resist was too much when they were orange leveled.  Once I had killed enough boats and camped the cactus quest, I pretty much just killed whatever I saw up to that point.
---
I was also dicking around with some people and running after them with water.  I’d say an actually GOOD player (which isn’t me) could do it in the sub 1.5 hours with the pop density I had.
---
The density was severely diminished Im sure because I logged in 3-4 hours after the stress test.
---
Try daring to take a few seconds and read the subreddit,
---
I don't think phase 3 is 2020... It'd be so much slower than Blizzlike.
---
Chill fam, I did check on my phone prior to posting and found nothing at first glance.
---
Sorry, you got triggered.
---
THEY JUST WANT TO KICK ME IN MY NUTS
---
The idea was neat, but the replacement is not. Honestly i never liked either of them.
---
Hey can u tell me do u have bfa installed? Because that looks like it wants bfa not classic. For classic it looks for wowb
---
I gotchya. Thanks for the answers!
---
Have fun on the stress test May 29!
---
What exactly requires patience?
---
Asmongold funny highlights
---
OMG Finally! A copper ore node!!  Let me just go mine it real quick before anyone else takes it..
---
\*dissapears in front of you\*  
---
Go to hell OP
---
The first one, but I honestly don't recall the second one. When was that model live? And wasn't there another one before the third one, which I think was the WotLK model?
---
Yes please
---
Heartbeat actually applies to npc’s as well. That’s why mobs will break free from sheep or sap even if they aren’t touched.
---
Alternatively, 
---
Yah, take the delivery run (visit first inn keeper), 
---
Then run on to the capital city for the exploration, flight path, and hearthstone (if desired) and any talky quests the capital has to offer. 
---
Then take your level 2, back out and just kill neutral npc's until you unlock a quest in the first hub.
---
You'd be way ahead of the pack.
---
Basically it means your 29 gnome rogue twink can have Goblin Rocket Helm.

---
Eh I’d rather be able to talk to my whole server and not just my layer.
---
It DIDN'T take 2 years then and it WON'T take 2 years now
---
the lag time from release to the first BG was 7 months. That's if you started DAY ONE. I would expect it to be like 3 or 4 months now, but possibly as short as 2.
---
No one's in the world, everyone's on WSG. Oh wait, why?
---
Classic Beta, BFA and 1.12 are all installed.
---
Hit boxes really are something that is going to take getting used to as a mage kiting with frost nova. I’m bewildered sometimes when I get hit from so far as a gnome. But I guess I really need to factor in the size of the mob.
---
Can people from stress test still login?
---
It's a minor point but in an hour of the stress test I had a random save my life and we spoke briefly regarding that. I can go literally weeks in retail and not speak to a single person or feel thankful for their impact on my play session.
---
Usually if you know the quests really well and there is no competition for quest mobs you can do it in 45 minutes. A new player will take about 1.5 hours and a new player with a lot of competition could take up to 2 hours.
---
Horde?
---
There's more to a boss fight than dispels, interrupts, and maximizing DPS.
---
An example from current tier: Mekkatorque fight, a portion of your group gets shrunk and has to jump into the adds to kill them. On harder difficulties, you can't see the sequence of buttons you have to press yourself, so you have to coordinate your group to kill the adds.
---
It's still about knowing your class and tactics on a raid boss, but it's much more difficult to execute, especially on mythic.
---
Or Onyxia, or Kazzak, or really any vanilla raid except Naxx.
---
"You think you did, but you didn't."
---
1 hour, skipped popular quests and grinded mobs
---
what a great idea, ps. you should listen to countdown to classic podcast :D
---
I did numerous 20 man Strat undead runs, and a few up to 40man. So yep.
---
It will be in phase 2 based on this twitter thread from Ion. Its nice that Ion responded in this way but its not really a great way to communicate with the player base. [https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641)
---
Unreal engine really pops models with more than 128 to 512 resolution. So It seems I will make this with all the models. Gigapixel AI really is an an awesome tool for older games.
---
I had him too, I loved him so much, he was my main pet up until MoP I think. I'd love to tame him again for Classic.
---
Nice! Thanks for the tip!
---
If it's like the stress test, you might have 2 layers with 3k players each, and then a few more players join, sparking the creation of a low-pop 3rd layer. Some of the players reported being in a low population layer, and there are screenshots of a mostly-empty Goldshire during the peak of the stress test.
---
imo if there is a way to exploit it, someone's going to.
---
Hah! Can’t wait to buy my kid an account and ground him to the best game ever 😂🤣👌🏻🔥
---
This is exactly the route my brother and I have taken with our father. At first we would say we don't give him a hard time for his hobbies so why does he do it for ours. 
---
He continued to be pretty petulant about it. So we went on the offensive and started referring to his love of sitting down watching endless amounts of television as mind numbing. We called him out for being a hypocrite. He goes off on a rant about how he works so he deserves to do what he wants after work. My brother and I both work as well. 
---
When we pointed this out, he says that what we choose to do is still childish. We decided there is no reasoning with him and just don't talk to him very much. When we do it usually devolves into him attacking our hobbies and interests, almost out of nowhere. 
---
The most ridiculous part is that he also blames our poor relationship on the two of us. He's constantly in a state of feeling victimized. It's really pathetic honestly. And ironically incredibly childish.
---
Vael the guild killer, i love that boss
---
Back in the day Blizzard hosted a wow-video contest and that's where we got illegal danish from
---
It would be pretty amazing if they did one again
---
Establish a rule that you can't use music that was published after 2006
---
because they do not do a lot of damage and if you are melee swinging you cannot be casting shadow bolt or wand.  both of these abilities will be dealing the majority of your damage.  Any other spell you cast will do more damage than equiping a firestone and meleeing a monster when you are spirit stacking.  Are you going to find a bunch of of the tiger cloth gear greens and do 2 more damage per melee hit while you are taking tens and hundreds of melee damage because you are face tanking a monster with cloth on?  
---
The fire stones do not add enough damage to a melee attack.  They are not balanced to make a melee wizard archetype out of a warlock.  they are worse than a shaman's flametongue totem damage addition to your melee swings.
---
I work in Real Estate, Property management and Security.
---
Between phone calls and emails i have time to log in and grind for 15-30 minutes at a time.
---
While doing security I can just play the entire 6 hours from my closed office while watching cameras. Nothing ever happens.
---
You can be a raid healer spamming chain heal and get put in the melee group since you dont have mana tide. I did this on a private server. My guild loved having 8 shamans. You'll just have to go full resto during progression or once you start getting into aq.
---
They exist. There's also a high elf quest giver NPC in Badlands and a hidden one somewhere else.
---
Then stick to private servers. We’ll see how “alive” they’ll be once classic goes live.
---
Casual is not an insult. The thing is the best thing about Classic is the journey and the destination, whereas BFA is literally just the destination. And I believe the journey IE. Leveling, professions etc. is the casual element of WoW, whereas the destination is the end game content raids/pvp grind which is not casual.
---
So yes I believe Vanilla is much friendly to casuals and thus a more casual game.
---
Right? Lol. I’m pretty thankful to the person who told me to stop auto melee attacking mobs with my wand and to use the spells I trained when I first started..haha
---
How can you hate questing in a game that is 90 percent questing but still play it? Sounds like a job to me
---
There's a high elf in Northwatch Hold in The Barrens as well if I remember correctly.
---
However, we will be getting the original Sylvanas obviously.
---
How was Warlock in Classic? I neved played classic (started very late in TBC) and wanted to try it but I have no idea what to play. I am thinking either druid, warlock or priest. I am more of a casual player and most of all played resto druid and other healers before.
---
No I gotcha, I was responding to Rocky's comment about patching out/in stuff people don't like.  
---
Like I said, I'm all for the progressive order stuff came out originally. I didn't start at the very beginning of vanilla so I would like to see what the world was like then.  I just don't personally think the original timetables should be the exact same.  Say maybe 6-8 months wait for WSG but not 2 years or something, maybe like half as long as original or whatever.    I do agree with the other poster above that the player base is mostly going to be a big dump at the beginning of this release and not so staggered the way the natural progression was at original release.
---
And millions don't. Congrats, you won the lottery and are bragging about it like you worked for it.
---
u wanna give up a wolf for a kodo? alright...
---
Thanks. I'm guessing questing through mulgore as an orc from level 1 gives me less rep than if i was a tauren then?
---
What does the Soda clip have to do with this?
---
If you like Kodo, there is always [morrowgrain](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3804/morrowgrain-to-thunder-bluff).
---
So then, is driving to work not a part of your day? Or does the global clock stop while BusyWheel drives his Dodge Stratus into the office? 
---
Azeroth is a virtual world, the physical (virtual) distance between IF/SW where you formed the group and the dungeon...1/2 the world away is part of the dungeon experience—at least until wrath. 
---
Trekking out from the relative safety of a capital city and needing to fight and survive ones way to the necromancer school or schoolmance, the infested city of stratholme, or the fortress of dwarves and orca within BRM is absolutely part of the journey. Dodging gankers is part of it too.
---
You can take 10 into every instance except: BRD, Dire Maul, Strat, and Scholo. Yes, even Ragefire Chasm can be 10-manned.
---
I didn't realize that they automatically maxed if you were facing another player character. Hmm. Maybe I just never needed to since I was a Priest.
---
world PVP for the fun of it
---
Yep, fair enough. I definitely got very excited for a hot moment.
---
What a great info, wow! i never knew about it when we were riding
---
Right? Remember that rare in MoP that dropped the potion of ancient knowledge? Camped 24/7 by people popping in and out spamming LFG invites...
---
This may not be exploitable in the exact same way, but if people find out a way to exploit it, it will be exploited.
---
Yup that's what I did. Plus, once your guild has a raid on farm status, they won't notice that you're not full holy as long as the raids continue to go smoothly!
---
Orc hunter=  25% stun resist, +5% pet damage, +extra attack power from racial, +axe specialization
---
Much better than nelfs
---
I posted a screenshot the other day from sept 2006 that shows a key ring. I thought they got rid of it to give us extra backpack slots in a patch though.
---
Layering is intended to deal with the problem of "huge population of tourists on launch and lower population after the initial newness wears off".
---
Blizzard is pragmatic.  They know there's going to be a population spike at launch and that'll fade away to leave the game with its long term playerbase.   But the game world was only designed to be able to hold a certain population comfortably -- we're not talking *server ability* here, we're talking the world's size, how many mobs are in it, their respawn rates, etc.; and how many players that was designed to support.
---
So they have two options to deal with the initial population spike: either 1) put up a lot of servers, all of which will turn into ghost towns after the launch day looky-loos are gone -- or 2) put up a smaller number of servers, based around their estimates of the long term player base, use layering to survive the initial player spike, then turn it off when the populations have dropped down to what the world can support.
---
Option 1, itself, leaves them with two avenues in the long term: A) merge servers after the player base has settled down -- which, in the meantime while they're waiting for the population level to settle down, leaves players on sad, empty servers; or B) just leave the servers as-is and expect players will migrate to the handful of 'servers everyone plays on', and then eventually just move everyone off the others and shut them down.
---
The problem with 1A is name conflicts.  The problem with both 1A and 1B is that the periods of underpopulated servers might chase players away from Classic entirely.
---
However, if they go with option 2, they have better long-term options:  A) the population drops down to what they expect and the servers will all just magically be at the right population and nobody ever has to play on an over-populated or under-populated server; B) the population ends up *higher* than they expected and they have to do a server split, or C) the population ends up *lower* than expected and they have to do server merges.
---
Obviously 2A is the simplest, they don't need to do anything and it just works out.  2C is basically the same as 1A.  But for the server split of 2B, splits are easier than merges -- they both have community impacts, but splits don't also involve people losing the name they've grown to feel like they own.
---
The long term prospects of option 2 with layering are better than option 1; so layering is the best option to go with.
---
I didn't endorse layering. 
---
How would sharding the early zones affect everyone for months?
---
raiding and chasing items 
---
friends 
---
pvp
---
bosses that actually feel epic
---
bunch of other stuff
---
Agreed Let's hope layering works well on launch. However expect it to be a complete shit show and that way we can't get dissapointed ;)
---
alliances are casuals
---
StormX on youtube, not feral, mostly stance dance, but this guy is a beast and kills everything in his way
---
EU vs NA ping
---
XD XD XD XD
---
Yeah. The one where you go immobile for a few seconds but are also like a localized nuke going off lol. I had it on my pally and it was always fun going to one of the completion bar WQs, gathering up a ton of mobs, using Consecration and DoS and being like 60+ percent done in 10 seconds.
---
because undead rogues look the best
---
You can literally gear up without needing to do LFR once.
---
There we go.  I feel better now.
---
/r/classicwow boomer meme. nice nice.
---
I would have liked to have that chance again as well. It was amazing the first time, when my Shaman was lvl 15 or so at the time when WSG was introduced. I had a blast being the flag carrier and running through the area as a ghost wolf after level 20. A lot of people just standing outside WSG portal and dueling. And the fact that your level did not matter that much in the bracket, because nobody was twinking. Though I understand that it would hurt the world pvp aspect of the early game if WSG would be open at launch.
---
You and me both, though I will have addons for UI/RP stuff. Nothing Quest Helper-y, though. I want questing to be just like it was back in the day; read the text to find out where to go and watch for landmarks on the way there.
---
Oh shit I didn't even know there's another one coming so soon! Well you're definitely in for that at least, but if your launcher got updated just today then I'd still say it's probably the actual beta because it seems a bit early to invite people for the next stress test. But I suppose you'll find out in a bit when the servers are back up lol
---
Sounds good to me.  I was confused bc I started right after bg's opened and knew the game hadn't been out 2 years by then, but my memory is foggy these days lol
---
Just give me TBC classic server, continue vanilla servers, add fresh servers so people can start from scratch. Win/win/win with 0% chance Blizzard fucks something up
---
I just want to give a big shout-out and thank you to all of you at Wowhead for providing such wonderful information. I've been using you guys for years. I love the formatting and quick and easy-to-use platform that you have created and kept up to date.
---
Best of luck to you and yours going forward in this adventure that is Classic.
---
it bugged the encounter and you didnt have to break any eggs.
---
Is Kara the one with the chess match mechanics? Whatever raid that one I've ALWAYS wished I got to experience when it was relevant content.
---
Strat was changed to a 5-man in patch 1.10.
---
All the dungeons except BRD, Dire Maul, Strat, and Scholo can be 10-manned. However, the only dungeon where quests will complete as a 10-man is UBRS.
---
Taurens have their own starting area...
---
It's called ALL OF MULGORE
---
How's middle school going?
---
The first one is MUH QUEEN but aesthetically I like the 3rd one.
---
I think if there's one thing that needs to be perfected before launch, it's layering. Even if it's only a temporary mechanic, it can affect so much long term, especially with how much savvier players are today than they were 14 years ago.
---
I hope it won't be around past a few weeks though. I'd really like to get familiar with my server community as early as possible in leveling. Layering still doesn't offer that sense of community since each layer is essentially temporary.
---
That's a great idea.
---
The warlock is one of the few classes I've never touched. In classic, are they fun and challenging? I'm not looking for  highest dps, but do they have a spec and play style that is super dynamic, has somewhat involved rotations, and a requires attention to timers/cooldowns/dots? Nothing is worse than spamming the same 2-3 spells for me. I want to be completely engaged in every pull, solo or dungeons. 
---
I know they were rare classes in vanilla because of their lower dps output, but I don't care about that if the other aspects shine. 
---
Is a warlock for me?
---
Nope. No Additional content.
---
Vanilla is vanilla.
---
A few beta streamers:
---
Tribe 1v1
---
Perplexitycya
---
Preach
---
Frostadamus
---
I know there is a few more. They are all playing on the same server though.
---
Why can’t wowhead just let their be adventure and exploration for once. Let people ask each other for help. Everything on retail gets looked up on wowhead. You have to consider what you are doing to the game.
---
It's not just money though, it's hiring talented people who can fix these things. 
---
Fixing a glitch in WoW is not anywhere near impossible, it just requires their attention.
---
That's true, but in all fairness, the leveling aspect is really short in comparison, so sludging through it isn't too painful. BUT that's not how it should be in the first place, and blizz really dropped the ball with leveling big time.  
---
Their whole reward structure went down the drain, it's almost funny.  
---
I really hope they take what's good in classic and steer retail into that direction. I like the new raids, dungeons, m+ system, animations and spell effects. The updated graphics, story telling, cinematics and arena / RBG's.  
---
**But it's missing spirit**, and purpose. I miss being happy about new loot, I miss grouping up with people on a regular basis, I miss world pvp, I miss leveling slowly and accomplishing something, I miss meaningful crafting a LOT.  
---
Therfore, I hope classic will be a huge success and blizz realizes where they went wrong maybe.
---
Alliance will stay away from playing locks, because undead have will of forsaken, so a undead rogue (which is plentiful) will beat up on a lock. The alliance usually main on gnome mages, pally and nelf hunters. Horde main on undead rogues, orc hunters, and undead warlocks.
---
It's likely the internet connection, as Asmongold pointed out from his POV. Asmongold immediately said "Your internet is trash, I've seen him play better" and he's EU
---
Those are meant to be mini-dungeons.
---
Or were.
---
Like areas you gotta go into like that and explore, those are "mini-dungeons". They're not officially anything other than questing zones, but that was the intention from Blizz.
---
"Nerf Druids" - Azgaz feral PvP fun.
---
I think 1-3 were classic, good luck emulating though, he was a guild leader and got fed AQ40 gear which was actually good for feral spec.
---
&gt; I think they're working on a classic version.
---
I really hope they are. There wasn't much about BfA I enjoyed when I tried it out back in October, but I immediately fell in love with that addon.
---
POG NOPE
---
https://www.wowhead.com/thousand-needles-quests?filter=34;1;0 I count a little more than 3.
---
Looks like it to me
---
What do you mean you haven’t earned those looks? You’d have to earn what you xmog to
---
Oh good. I was really worried about this.
---
no one on this subreddit knows how to take a fucking screenshot
---
There is ZERO diference between that and seeing someone in your zone when layering is gone running ahead of you and getting it first. You're literally not seeing the big picture...
---
Yes but classic staying true to vanilla meaning no taunt for prot paladins and no class tuning.
---
I was there from launch till early Legion before moving to Area 52 and faction switching.
---
The server had died long before that, but it was my home for so long it was really hard to move on.
---
There are rumors this is just a display bug unfortunately. I hope you get in though!
---
Blizzard said its a visual bug to everyone that got into the stress test. Since the servers are offline to EVERYONE we can't confirm this yet, once they're online we'll see if we still see them offline or not
---
I get no servers when I try to log in to stress test... mebbe?
---
Thanks for the input all. Im sweatin bullets with a rosary between my hands.
---
For now. Who knows what will happen a year or two from now. TBC or go the Old School Runescape route? Both?
---
Looks like someone's waiting for you.
---
The incident was not fake, it really happened, but the video you typically see online was a reenactment. At least, that's how I understood it. Kinda hard to find a source on which is true (whether the whole thing was fake, or just the video).
---
Reminds me of this:

The solution is simple, allow 20,000 players on one starting zone and let time fix it out. If there at 5000+ players in 10 meter area, just make the respawn time an algorithm to the amount of players, in this case itll be a 1 second respawn for mobs.
---
Well shit I forgot about that - the chickens were limited to gnomes and dwarves too werent they?
---
One thing I noticed on private servers - which I really hope doesn’t bleed into retail classic - was the absolute tryhards who want to rush instances and mock you/talk shit or complain if you don’t go fast enough (specifically me as a warrior, having never played warrior or tanked before)
---
I am going to abuse it to get an advantage. It's cheap but unless they fix it, I'll use it.
---
Yes, they should be... with the launch of TBC
---
Oh god here come the vanilla gatekeepers
---
It’s confirmed on Twitter by blizzard.
---
Thanks for the kind words &lt;3 We're having a great time so far working on it.
---
Classic wow for as boring as it is for most in raids, has a really good ability suite for pvp. 
---
When you watch arena tournament videos in  modern wow it can be really difficult to follow the action, even if you are well versed in the game.
---
Classic wow is much more easily digestible. There is still a high skill cap, but the abilities are more visual and easier to understand. 
---
I think the pvp video scene will really take off again. It will probably start with the over edited alt rock/screamo tracks but will pretty quickly evolve into a new format we havent seen before...or maybe they just evolve to good music and tasteful editing. who knows.
---
Yes, that is the one.
---
You only really need 1 imp lock for the tank group. Other than that you'll probably all be running DS-Ruin.
---
I asked a R14 that question once while helping him fight people at thorium point.
---
His answer was "a priest that isnt healing is basically a waste of a spot".
---
Never looked back since.
---
Also dungeons have a min requirement to get into. Can only go so high. 
---
I doubt you see a finished SM Cath even if they can zone in. Very dense mobs. Would take hours and the probability of respawn catching up to them almost assured. Would have to be 3 Hunters, a Warrior and Healer. Even then the last room would be a nightmare.
---
In regards to the Felhunter, he can only devour magic when he’s within a yard or so of the enemy, correct? Are there certain buffs/spells you always recommend purging? Like a frost mage’s ice barrier if it’s a 1v1?
---
Too flat on top to be needles
---
you're good dude.
---
I guess the point I was trying to make in my posts is how certain people insult you for liking something, or say you're bad for liking those things. (usually mothers.) when the things they like are basically the same thing with a different flavor. WoW vs Candy Crush. Beer vs Wine. Computers vs Television. etc. hypocrisy.
---
Soul shard.
---
I know he was around in TBC, not sure about vanilla, but Zybak was incredible.
---
Yup I played from aus on us servers with 250ms in vanilla/tbc and deadzone kiting is not an issue at all. Something is very borked here.
---
In the beginning of vanilla you were able to take a full raid into any dungeon.  Specifically UBRS and Stratolhme you needed 8+ people to clear them, it was basically impossible to do them with a 5 man team.  I'm not sure if they nerfed the dungeon's difficulty once they lowered the limit or we were able to outgear the difficulty when it happend.
---
Either way, having 10k people on a server and having layering are both changes. 
---
I prefer layering, even with all it's flaws, as 99.9% of people wont be abusing it and it'll be just fine.
---
You guys don't have this quest in your database. Just something I noticed a while back:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?quest=4974
---
The analogy was more about how vanilla puts you in situations where you are more likely to make friends naturally.  There are situations all throughout leveling and in the game where you are naturally introduced to friends.  In retail you play and then finally at endgame you have to go and find a guild.  That whole process is natural in vanilla and makes finding friends a lot easier.  
---
When people are around and you have common goals, it's a lot easier to make friends than having to go search for them on your own.
---
so what your saying is i have either an invite OR a bug? keeping optimistic here
---
But the technology creates a whole host of issues.  Look at this thread and the countless others with people complaining.
---
It was the same way in vanilla.
---
A guild will be doing MC and Ony for longer then 6 months just saying, to get 40 people gear
---
Elune horde
---
Nope. I had the same thing. Apparenly beta is back up and now I have "no realms available." Sorry mate.
---
Beta keys are srs business quit trolling ;(
---
I almost feel bad for those poor Ragged Young Wolves, Frostmane trolls and Crag Boars.
---
That's blizzlike tho.
---
He constantly takes contrarian views, very often ones he doesn't actually believe, just to piss off his chat. It is definitely an act.
---
"I'm right because I know I'm right, and everyone else is wrong" is like his catch phrase meme. He's very much a trigger streamer.
---
I guess that is where I wasn't sure how many locks are typical for a 40 composition how many need an imp, etc... Thanks for the input.
---
Hey Kaleido911, if you’d ever like to come on the show and talk about the old days then let me know!
---
No, fuck that.   They should just do Classic TBC, and offer a one time xfer to those servers.
---
This was brought up like yesterday and what seemed like a silly thing to bring up or even check.
---
but Blizzard is listening and checking every. little. thing.
---
When they mean't every lamp post. They mean't EVERY lamp post.
---
But does the on hit effect benefit from +spelldamage?
---
If you're talking about raiding, basically the entirety of Molten Core is immune to fire damage. Much of BWL is as well, if I remember correctly, too.
---
The machine gun imp is a fun build for PvP, though. People ignore him and he can wreck them pretty fast - especially if you have [The Black Book](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19337/the-black-book).
---
Or Cody.
---
Just messing around some. I heard someone say in the stress realm that he made level 5 in 40 minutes. Not sure if he was solo or group. Or if he was AOE mob grinding or not. Sorry I just heard him say it in general bc someone asked them if their time was fast or not. Can't remember the class.
---
there is, you can see them and you can at least kill them if opposite faction or not run after it because you know he will get there first.
---
ill be pissed more if my ore dissapears
---
I quit then rerolled Horde on Onyxia during Vanilla. 
---
Was with Archaic and for a very brief time ran with Surge.
---
Not double....only one fucking you is Blizzard :)
---
Only real answer
---
PvP - Both classes are very good WotF is still a very strong racial but fear in PvP will not be your main issue. You also mentioned you will be playing horde that means less warlocks against you and for fear you will have insignia. Your biggest issue will be that insignia does not remove stun therefore Orc racial for chance on stun resist 30% (25%+5% base stun r.) is very OP against classes that use stun and that are your biggest counter. Orc race is pretty much best PvP race in Vanilla as how incredibly OP It is. On top of that you have 5% bonus demon damage which is small but why not.
---
PvE - I would say the same. WotF lets you break few fear mechanics in PvE and you can continue dmging. Stun resist you have also chance to resist some and you have 5% dmg.
---
But play what you like.
---
I will play Undead for both Rogue and Warlock as I cannot stand orcs in cloth armor or as a rogue It just doesn’t feel right.
---
Remember when people told you for years ‘No Vanilla’? That is what you ‘No changes’ people sound like. Let Blizzard keep you guys on your no changes server while the rest of us get to experience new content that still maintains the same feel and gameplay style of Vanilla. And don’t bother with slippery slope fallacies claiming it’s the first to to LFD.
---
Back when fear actually did something. I love it. Pvp was so much more exciting back then with talent points and everything else.
---
Did the rep actually say that you are in the beta though? Because the same happened for me, a new PTR popped up earlier today and I can see the realm list on the beta. But everyone here is saying that that doesn't mean you got into the beta seeing as everyone from the stress test can see that screen now.
---
sure we believe you. post the CS TICKET
---
Hell, 33-year-old me did the same thing this past October when my ex got me to try out BfA. Rolled up a dwarf to play with her and, as soon as I was able to tame a pet of my own,^1 dropped everything and made for Mulgore to find and tame a kodo for a little piece of home.
---
^1 ^At ^level ^13. ^Gods ^I ^can't ^wait ^to ^get ^back ^to ^*proper* ^hunter ^play ^in ^August.
---
This is correct. When target is slowed under a certain threshold it is supposed to remove the leeway mechanic. For now it seems to be impossible to deadzone which was a main strategy against warrior. Also leeway adds 2.5-2.6 yrds iirc.
---
So, you dislike the best horde mount, and want the worst?
---
This post is confusing. It says:
---
&gt;Starting on the afternoon of May 24, we will be enabling the PvP Honor System and the Warsong Gulch Battleground in the WoW Classic Beta realms.
---
Then right after:
---
&gt;Beta players are invited to queue for Warsong Gulch from 12:00 p.m. PDT to 4:00 p.m. PDT on Saturday, May 25 and Sunday, May 26 as we try to spin up as many instances of the battleground as possible.
---
I don't understand when WSG will start,
---
They're what you describe for leveling, but in raids, you're mostly using shadowbolt over and over and over again.
---
Going against the grain  for 60 levels + end game when everyone and their mother is playing Frost Mage.
---
One example, I guess.
---
I started a private server a few days ago to get back in to things. I now have a lock, a mage, a priest, a rogue, a druid, and another lock
---
&gt; Blizzard will fix this for classic
---
lmao you wish
---
I still show the alpha, pve and pvp offline

This would completely fuck up the horde/alliance dynamic when it comes to fighting for resources.

Ok, thats pretty damn fast but I believe it

It's all about how small the servers will be for classic. There is no universal server, you have your population and thats it. If someone is spamming your name in chat and how you are a skank bitch you can't be trusted, you will be remembered.

!remindme 2 hours
---
Ppl who insist content after naxx have propably never even done it, neither will they ever
---
This right here - this is that shit where you lose everyone, because you're not even willing to commit to it yourself.
---
"yeah guys its theoretically possible, but lol, even I'm not dumb enough to actually try it"
---
I respect the effort you put into this, but you're not even willing to back up what you talk about by doing it yourself. Nobody is arguing that shamans are able to tank while leveling, where you're deceiving everyone including yourself is that you're a viable raid tank. Until you show me a video of a shaman tanking raid bosses, trash etc... and being utilized as a tank instead of just a oddity, you're full of shit.
---
It's a thing that will have to happen or they kill the game just as surely by pushing content out too fast. 6 months per phase gives us a roughly 3 year timeline until full release of everything. That keeps away from the mistake they made the first time not leaving enough time for people to complete naxx, and allows slower more casual people to sort of keep up. 
---
If they do what some on this sub have suggested and push content out to please the hardcore, the game itself will die faster than it should. I agree the no BG's thing is a bit crappy, but that's how they decided to push the content out and we shouldn't have short windows on raid content just because of it.
---
Very true, some hate it some love it, its become a different game and is missing some of the great stuff of Classic and has improved other stuff
---
Except dkp can be corrupted with collusion (see mages and warlocks) and leads to things like feral druids getting dft (they get all raid gear at minimum bids / most their raid gear is from dungeons giving them the ability to stock dkp).
---

&gt;Flying mounts in general are terrible imo.
---
The only instance I've seen of a 'good' flying mount in a game is Guild Wars 2. Their gryphon is pretty fantastic. You can't afk with it. You can't just totally ignore terrain with it. It has its own handling mechanics and everything. And the flights not 3d swimming.  
---
If that were the state of WoW's flying i think we would be in a pretty good boat.
---
This worked in Vanilla too as far as I can remember it was a real skill back then though because lag was unreal.
---
Enjoy the vanilla servers dieing. Because half the server goes to tbc.
---
&gt;entitled attitude of convenience at the expense of everything else

you're like a poet.

LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS TO PRESS! And he's not even max level. I can't even imagine a world where you would have less buttons to press at max level than this. That just wouldn't make sense.

I was really sure that fall damage was too low. RIP my memory.
---
No one in retail thinks LFR means anything. Sorry.

---
Alliance. Guild was Red Hands alt guild Green Hands
---
Thanks, seems like it's just not showing up in the searchbox while/after searching for "for the horde".
---
yes, you're right about this, but 3 months in i'm guessing most ppl would have farmed their bis so the impact would not be crippling on the economy.
---
in raids they are a 1 buttom spam like mages. Sometimes they bring banish to the table for cc but no. Veeeery simple rotation. Maybe rogue is for you it sounds like? Classic wow is so much more than combat mechanics tho. Dont expect combat to be the carrying point of classic. (Almost all classes are more complicated to play in pvp than in pve) There combat can actually be fun.
---
So far it seems like people are getting true enjoyment out of it. I think a lot of people truly overlook how much community and other not so tangible things made classic WoW a unique enjoyable experience... all the quirks and bugs with it.
---
Yeah it seems fast but at the same time we grouped and took a couple minutes to get together and start grabbing quests/tagging mobs.   
---
Next stress test I'm going to see how quick I can do 1-10. Private server wise in the past I did Orc/Troll area in 2 hours. Curious to see how far the private ones were off.
---
Others have suggested it might not in WPVP but does in BGs.
---
In either case, the person with lower skills hit harder, so that's not what is borked.
---
Thanks! Keep up to good work!
---
You're kind of quoting me a bit out of context here. The pont I was trying to make was:
---
The ability to farm what is effectively multiple copies of the same resources by layer hopping.
---
&gt; We have absolutely ZERO idea beyond mere speculation and some early clips on the beta that this is even going to be a thing.
---
The idea we have now is what the ground truth is on Beta, which is that you can hop Layers in the same way you can hop shards on Modern WoW. With that ground truth in mind, it means that.. as it currently is implemented, yes, you can farm resources in duplicated, parallel copies of the world by transitioning between Layers. Sure we can speculate that this will be different come release, but as it stands.. right now.. it isn't, and we have no evidence to lead us to believe that it will be any different. So the best option for everyone right now is to give feedback on the matter and hope Blizzard can do something to prevent this system from being abused for economic advantages.
---
Rogue weapon
---
I mean, there’s literally been posts on this sub asking for group finder and lfr in classic. It’s not to much of a stretch when people have literally asked for said “slippery slope fallacy”
---
Paladins hands down. Buffs, blessings, survival, mana efficiency shooop around the pillar.
---
Even more so a case, smaller population means less competition from high end guilds.
---
Privates had top guilds from CN/NA/EU all competing, now it will be a cakewalk.
---
I'd say the glider in Archeage was pretty good. Alltho i only played that game for the first 4 months or so, maybe it changed after that.
---
I don't remember lfg in BC.
---
Then people will complain about geared “t4” characters ruining bgs and how it’s unfair they get 1 shot and stand no chance.
---
I agree. There are so many areas that they could fill out on the vanilla map that would still be in essence "vanilla". Like the caverns of time or mtn hyjal.
---
R2, do you is fucking?
---
Own selfish reasons! The dress wearers are being selfish! Your argument is vacuous.  
---
If you have 3 ms wars and only 1 mage, then the “15%” damage loss is a fair tradeoff, with regard to your “utilitarian dps” argument.
---
Your Assumption that there is only one warrior with MS and a massive amount of mages is just that, an assumption.
---
Your strategy is arbitrary, because it makes assumptions based on other assumptions that can quickly become incorrect when even minor changes occur in the facts (ala raid composition/gearing/player competency )
---
This is why no one has any business telling someone else how to spec.  You take competent players and adapt according to the situation.
---
When the bosses are dying and the loot is flowing and moral is good, there is no selfishness.  When people start thinking they have any business telling other people how to spec their toons, start feeling that their personal enjoyment is somehow threatened, they are free to fuck off to a new guild.
---
I have seen these guilds collapse several times (not only in vanilla).  When min max try hard a like yourself concentrate in a guild, it is inevitably doomed to fail, because of the animosity you mentioned feeling by someone being “meme specced”
---
I am not sure if that would be a smart move. Seems more likely they may eventually up both prices by a small amount.
---
I hope that once they release all the content they make raids that are not further gear wise but side content equivalent to the various tiers with different itemization. Maybe some love to specs that have a good talent tree but without great gear, like feral druids or other hybrids.
---
As a horde lock, let me just say Brez is the vanilla version of Soul Shatter.
---
Reality is that is only the rule for launch and likely through Naxx. None of us can read the direction and life cycle of the game once it progresses through live.
---
That's not a great tagline.
---
'classic: made for clickers'
---
You guys are missing block values on shields. See here: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=23043/the-face-of-death
---
Yeah it was definitely 1.4.
---
That's too bad.
---
WoW 5 is Stress test
---
What? I don't even know what you are saying because you make an exclamation, backed it up with no evidence except a random image? What?
---
It might help you level the profession a little, but other than that it's useless.
---
I would love tbc if the raid gear was actually good for pvp. That was one great thing about vanilla, I could use my raid gear and pvp with it, instead of being useless.
---
Yep, that's on our to-do list, will need to be addressed soon as we set up a filter for that stat.
---
I think this may have been removed in one of the later Vanilla patches
---
Nah, if you love transmog I'm going to assume you didn't play when what your armor looked like was valued.  One of the main reasons MMOs were good was because what you looked like correlated with your accomplishments in the game.  Even if you didn't have the good gear, you saw the one person that did and it inspired you to try to get it.  To have that T5 piece in BC meant you were the shit.   Now that aspect is completely gone and it just takes so much out of the game.
---
I read too fast for the text to appear and it just ends up pissing me off
---
Did Vancleef on a particular server that picked up Nost's project as a level 18 shaman healing, with a 23 druid bear tank. Vancleef hit hard enough during his 25% health "enrage" to shred off large portions of the druid's health per swing, to the point where I had to mana pot, get OOM anyways and have the druid tank stomp + selfheal to get through the encounter when only Vancleef was left. And that was *after* bugging out 3 out of 4 of his adds. Maybe your group outgeared / outleveled it, or it feels like you're bullshitting a bit.
---
He doesn't know pepeLaugh

https://i.imgur.com/Ai1qoJm.png

You know there is no reason they can't do *all* of that, right?
---
"If you have 3 ms wars and only 1 mage, then the “15%” damage loss is a fair tradeoff, with regard to your “utilitarian dps” argument."
---
Okay sure, but when does this ever happen? When do you have only 1 mage in a raid? Its not just mages, its only 1 caster dps. You yourself said you prefer a balanced class distribution in raids. Are you really out of arguments now that you have to make up such a silly example?
---
Its not selfish to be upset that a member of the raid is cutting your dps in half for no good reason. Its the same as getting upset if a healer is sniping your heals during a raid. Dumb dumb dumb. You are too dumb to argue with further.
---
I can't think of the video/scene you're mentioning off the top of my head, but as a classic feral pvp enthusiast I can recommend some of my faves

you can search "druid" or "feral" and find most if not all of the ones I'm about to mention but my specific favorites were:

---
Yea id definetly go this build ONLY on non fire immune raids. But on said raids the dps should be respectable.
---
Lvled a wlock and priest to 60 in pservers and a lock + mage to 60 in retail vanilla. Got more time on my lock on the pserver than back in 2005 and what I can say is. .. The biggest neg for many people is micro managing pet and dots doing most of the work. They are very slow with no movement abilities. The pros of playing lock is that you have plenty of tools and do well in duels and you do fine in raids. Even more so in Aq and naxx.
---
Hunter? The ability to have the pet aggro while you run past and feign death. The ability to ranged attack while moving. You can farm many dungeons this way
---
I feel like you named most of them. I never did it, but apparently stealth classes can loaded sneaking around dire maul.
---
Took them 3 hours, and you think they chain pulled?   They're also basically twinks.  Everyone is giving them shit.
---
Not really, most xmogs are an amalgamation of past content and don't hold any value in current expansion.
---
Good old Humar. I got him in Wrath when no one really cared about him anymore but it was still a great feeling
---
Mmmm ya I'm remembering that now. When it actually worked it was a cool flavor touch. But now I remember trying to tag them before they'd disappear.
---
Exactly, I don't have a gripe with anyone's personal hobbies. What they do on their own free time is their business, if it brings them joy then thats a great thing. 
---
It's when that person extols their hobbies as superior,  and yours as a waste of time, that bothers me. But I think we are in agreement about this.
---
&gt; Asmongold runs are IRRELEVANT for this topic. ALl of those guys played on private servers
---
He hasn't touched a single private server before beta though, he was always a retail player.
---
Once you could turn off all EXP twinking really got a lot of new possibilities
---
about that lvl 20 mount...
---
Aside from the Barrens this is probably the most nostalgic zone in the game for me. 
---
My first introduction to Vanilla was at my mates house and I have a vivid memory of being sat behind him taking turns playing a level 14 Orc shaman leveling in the barrens. Coming from Runescape we couldn't believe have large the world was and decided to just run as far as we could and explore the entire world to see what's out there which eventually lead us to the great lift. I have such a strong memory of staring down into the abyss wondering what was at the bottom of the cliff and then finally plucking up the courage to take the lift down only to be met by skull level Heyenas and Kolkar. As a noob I remember it being inconceivable that a player could be powerful enough to venture down there and take on what lied ahead.
---
It hasn't really died down, the JMods are very active and they meme a lot at /r/2007scape and twitter. A few of the most active JMods have parted way with jagex over the past year, but some others have picked up their roles, too.
---
i think you're reading into this way too much
---
Haha
---
Do you think really well geared druids are going to be op in flag running in a world without mounts, at least crossing mid?
---
Many of the raids are and will be accessible to many because they all stay relevant even when new raids come out.  Many groups will still do them to farm for mats and recipes.
---
What's up with the annoying Twitch-speak everywhere? What the fuck is pepeLaugh? So dumb sounding.
---
Thanks for the info and reply! :)
---
Do me a favor and go outside. Your crazy is showing.
---
These streamers are basically twinks.  Their gear is quite insane for the content they're doing.   Most people would be walking around in really shitty whites and greens.
---
We have to speak up when theres bullshit like this. If not then blizz will let this fly just like server hopping/shard hopping bullshit that happens in BFA
---
Plus im currently always high af during raids, 14 year old me wasnt high af during raids lol

An early indication of autism.

---
The president of Blizzard Entertainment gets asked, "what do you think of Classic?"
---
And his response if, "It doesn't matter what I think."
---
What conclusion would you draw from that statement?
---
It's funny to think about. People hate how BfA is only about the end game and everything else is ignored, yet in Classic they only care about the end game.
---
You got me... smh
---
There seem to be waaay more ppl that wanna play lock on release than on pservers. Played lock on nost/Lh and ye they were pretty rare. Now they seem to be nr 4th spot on player choice slightly above priest. Warr/Mage/Rogue/Lock/Priest/etc. I hope they wont be overcrowded this time around since a bit of their charm is them being a bit more rare than other non hybrid classes.
---
just wait 90 days guys I promise it will be ok
---
you will have Classic soon enough
---
3 months
---
take a deep breath
---
you can do it
---
getting all worked up about it makes no sense
---
(Almost) Anytime ;)

TBC in 18 months after launch, that's what I want.
---
One of the main reasons I’m rolling gnome is due to being small, so it’s nice to have it confirmed that I will have the original smallest possible gnome size
---
It was definitely a neat idea, but it has outlasted its welcome by a lot of years. They should drain it.
---
Oh god, THAT'S something I haven't thought about in awhile....

TBC was garbage and killed Azeroth.

1.14 or bust!

I think so but my alliance experience is quite limited ;)

&gt;according to my calculations, we have a 32.33, repeating of course, chance of survival.

How could anybody actually think the video wasn't a joke after hearing that...

---
Dude if you've honestly completely drained 1.12 Azeroth of all experiences in less than 6 months, you must play 10 hours a day and have no life. It'll take most people 2-3 months just to hit 60.

Make an alt, and start setting up your own little economy of symbiotic professions between them so it's easier later. If you level two toons to 60 and "get bored" with them in 4-6 months, you might need help.
---
Thanks mate!
---
There was a classicast episode (either Mark Kern one or the one with one of the Nostalrius devs) where it was said that J Allen Brack was actually supporting classic so this is just wrong
---
That sounds sexy

oh my god. thats me. except its videos. "that vizsla isnt as good as looking as ours" etc.

warrior without a doubt
---
There is actually.  One, it's not worth doing both.  Two, if they make new content/gear, then it means players can't xfer to the CTBC server.

INTP-T - Alliance - Warlock - DPS - PVP Focus

Also an indecisive altaholic
---
It means he can dislike it all he wants, but the numbers are speaking for themselves. If you think he isnt planning on milking the fuck out of this you're sadly mistaken.
---
Depends on some factors, but primarily hunter or mage.
---
We don't exactly know how good DME aoe gold farming is. It's been a very dominant gold farming method on all private servers and it has been changed around so so many times. We'll have to get more information to see how good this is.
---
Hunter diremaul tribute solo was possible in vanilla, and with skill you can get it down to do 5 resets per hour granting you on average 120ish gold per hour without disenchanting, and upwards of 150 (depends on mana pot and large brilliant shard prices). This is absurdly overpowered, and I strongly recommend blizzard to nerf/remove it because it was discovered very late in vanilla and never abused like it will be on classic. But I fear the #absolutenochanges crowd will kill me in my sleep or something.
---
You are being downvoted but this is a good thing. If it turns out that you could not use this script in vanilla, this should be fixed.
---
Old school TM vs SS battles.

!Remindme 96 days "/console ffxglow 0"
---
No, you will die.
---
You can off-tank a bit until your early 50s, but that's about it. You will melt under heavy fire in endgame PvE content. Chainmail only does so much.
---
Source: Played an ele/resto sham in ye olde days and did have to do some minor off-tanking and even tossed in as main damage sponge a few times back then, thanks to people pulling while the tank was afk or any of the other weird things people do when they're impatient. It'll do in a pinch, but it's not something you'll want to be doing after you wipe over and over.
---
You can't hold enough aggro with Earth Shock and your healers will be OOM before you know it, and as mentioned chainmail just doesn't cut it. Plus side: After you all wipe, you can just self-rez. But that's kind of not the point! haha
---
Warlock, you'll have much less dps than mages and alot less fun than mages and have to farm endless shards, but atleast you'll get invited for cookies and summons
---
Just because they are the most gear dependent? That is the only reason I can think of
---
I don't think you can get away from spamming the same 2-3 spells in vanilla raiding. Mages spam frost bolt/fire bolt, warlocks spam shadowbolts and keep a corruption up there's a debuff slot, warriors spam bloodthirst and heroic strike, rogues do the same. Healers are in the same situation. Warrior tanks probably have the most abilities that they use. Shield block, heroic strike, shield slam, revenge, shouts, taunt if the boss allows it (few do).
---
Well, there's a few things I suppose, though it might not be exactly what you mean.
---
You will rank up faster and get the better gear faster, which benefits warrior the most because of how powerful they get with gear and weapons, more so than other classes.
---
You'll learn your class better, which affects high skill cap classes such as druid more.
---
"The last one has been carefully verified."
---
Thank god those guys are serious about gnome height
---
I'm going to get that set, 100%!
---
Apart from warrior, rogue. The skill cap of a rogue is incredibly high.
---
I don't think I've made a wow friend since before they were introduced, and aside from early Cata, I've been continuously subscribed since then
---
Indeed. This will be an interesting era. Not once on my server (Which I shall not name but it generally pertained to time and roman numerals) did I see a single Boomkin.
---
I suspect to see genuine interest in Moonkin in Classic and a great deal of Warlocks. Not to mention WAYYYYY more players everywhere.
---
I look forward to this.
---
That he knows his reputation regarding Classic is tarnished because of his Infamous “you think you do, but you dont,” and his response is now is a perfect way of acknowledging that Classic is made for the community.
---
Yup I thought I might be in until everyone said they were in
---
We understand. But invalidating the progress of classic is foolish and was the beginning of the end of vanilla.   
---
No thank you. Do not repeat the mistakes of the past!
---
This is 2019, gamers would throw absolute tantrums if they have to queue for 5 hours.
---
Exactly. Merges should be a last resort. Layering for a few weeks to maybe months is far better. Especially if they make it difficult to exploit.
---
GW2 is an excellent game, but it commits what, to me, is one of the cardinal sins of MMO design: unlimited instant travel. It's a lot of fun to explore the great big world ANet built the first time through, but once you've found all the asura gates and can simply pop 'round everywhere in the blink of an eye Tyria feels about as expansive as my living room.
---
That's one of the things WoW really got right, IMO: everyone has access to some degree of instant travel in the form of hearthstones (as well as class abilities like teleport/portals, recall, etc) but, outside that fairly limited utility, if you want to get somewhere in Azeroth your only option is to hoof it. Which means everyone is out in the world far more than they are in other games, making it feel much more populated and alive.
---
"[account name] - You’re Invited to the World of Warcraft Classic Beta Test"

---
Definitely! ;)
---
It's so obvious that you don't do mythic raiding.
---
He didn't get to play the game early, so instead of doing what the purpose of beta was hes being immature and not wanting to report bugs
---
Its not min max try hard to not want a MS warrior ruining raid dps for no reason. Its common sense.
---
I liked this.
---
World PvP will still be happening because the Honor System is in. All of Azeroth is about to be a bloodbath, as well as BGs.
---
TBC was actually a polished vanilla giving all specs a place to be while still maintaining the mmorpg feel of the world.
---
Now I know you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
&gt; DW tanking is a thing as soon as the gear permits it, meaning hit cap, defense cap, decent armor stat without shield 
---
Factually wrong. DW tanking happens in spite of your defensive stats. You use consumables to make up the difference and rely entirely on your healers to make sure you don't get instagibbed. DW tanking involves virtually no def and certainly allows for full crushing blow potentials since the only way crushing gets pushed off the hit table is with shield block.
---
Becasue of the above, bears do just fine (better than dw tanks) in raids. Stop spreading bad information please.
---
That part for pvp ranking is soo true, second job. It killed the hype for game for a lot of people.
---
So that’s what it looks like when you get to heaven.
---
Hi, /u/Krissam
---
I dont really see the problem with a faster content pace? Its not like the slower, more casual people miss out on anything but atleast the hardcore crowd doesnt get bored and forced to raidlog that quick.
---
I think OP is just passionate and it sounds like you are NOT.
---
Wait, TBC killed Azeroth? I think thats a bit heavy handed, no?
---
My personal dream past classic would be an alternate timeline.
---
- Blood Elves rejoin Alliance, clean-up the northern EK questline/dungeons/raid
---
- Raid/dungeon to see another Arthas/Illidan fight in game, maybe Sylvanas can die in it and we get a new Forsaken leader
---
- Evil Draenei, proper "eredar", Velen is a demon-prophet, makes a portal and comes through it first, we stop him with the help of a "good" Medivh
---
Dunno, maybe a little nerdy and corny, just curious how a different story could end up.
---
Put it as wallpaper. Love it. 1 question tho. Where is the hunter of the bear? and bear is new model?
---
IIRC this was in game at release (dont quote me if I am wrong)
---
OMEGAMAD
---
The first problem is that finding talented software engineers is hard, the second is that some bugs are just really hard and time consuming to fix. First you need to identify the problem, then figure out how to reproduce it, then find a fix for it and finally test that it does not break anything else.
---
Not saying that Blizzard can't fix them or that they don't have the money, nor that some of their problems are hard to reproduce, but sometimes now matter how much money and time you have you can't speed of the process all that much.
---
It takes a whole different level of hardcore gaming to get exalted with them in phase 1.
---
Tier 2 in pvp is great.
---
Yeah, I really wish there was more communication and engagement with the faithful followers of Classic through all of this. I have the same questions about Brack, and other developer's opinion that were around from the initial release. What're their thoughts on Classic now? What are the possibilities of the future and will the reception of Classic WoW potentially impact the direction of retail BfA, and beyond? There is just a complete disconnect from the players and I think I was hoping this would diminish during this process. 
---
This is a one time thing that Blizzard is doing. We're only going to relaunch the Classic version of WoW one time. Blizzard is missing the chance to stir excitement by getting back to their roots and in touch with their fan base. I really feel this is a complete missed opportunity and paints a picture for the level of passion, or lack thereof, in this project.
---
I mean if he doesn’t like classic should he just lie and tell you he is super excited. Or does he have to like it because you do?
---
Will they ever tune classes? Like balance them in anyway?
---
Feign death breaks a lot of the content in the game, especially in the dungeons.
---
Solo the best farm in the game should be going to diremaul tribute and solo farming that. You can just feign death all the way to the last boss where you kite. 
---
And because of the way the way that dungeon rewards you for skipping bosses....You get a big boon when finishing
---
Given that he previously very publicly shut down the idea of official Vanilla servers and received a ton of backlash for it, I interpret this as his way of admitting that he was wrong, that people do enjoy the old game and there is a genuine interest in seeing official Vanilla servers become a reality. It doesn't matter what he thinks, Classic WoW is bigger than him at this point.
---
PepeLaugh HE DOESNT KNOW LULW
---
If blizzard hasn't put time and effort into stabilizing potential gold farms they'll have done themselves a disservice.
---
Obviously new servers. Any new content you add to vanilla is going to make the old content superseded anyway. We might as well make sure the new content is actually half decent.
---
😈
---
Literally "come to the dark side we have cookies"
---
Yea, but I'm not sure that was around back then?
---
I was thinking the same shit today man..
---
Didn't do Deadmines, i was just telling of my general experience with dungeons on Nost.
---
Fair enough, thanks for the explanation.
---
I was thinking strictly in terms of aesthetics but the convenience factor makes sense.
---
Ahhhh... sweet sweet nostalgia. I remember skipping school and playing early morning questing in this area.
---
pls dont post here again
---
Ice barrier would be one yeah - any magic effect that isn't explicitly undispellable is fair game. Pally bubbles, innervate, basic buffs. Anything that you can recognise that has a decent cooldown is a good pick.
---
Devour can also be used on yourself to remove negative effects like polymorph, druid root, freeze traps, silences...all on a hell of a short cooldown. It's a great ability. It's not melee range either, I think 30yards? can do it from some distance anyways.
---
neither can you, and they got more time than you.
---
Running around is way faster.
---
Calling something logic doesn’t make it logic.
---
You don’t seem to know what that means so stop using that word.
---
15% loss of caster damage is exactly zero if there are zero casters. (Improbable but not impossible).
---
If there are zero casters and 1 mortal strike warrior, and using mortal strike is even a  1% increase in the warriors dps, then the 1% increase is greater then the 0% loss for.
---
Your unstated assumption is that increased dps is defined as intrinsically good (this is forgiveable considering it seems relatively self evident, though not categorically true)
---
This example is one situation where your statement will not be true. Because you used the word “never” one example of it being incorrect will result in a statement being logically false. I have offered one example of the statement being incorrect therefore your statement is LOGICALLY false. (Please Stop using that word cuz you are doing it wrong).
---
As I mentioned before, maximizing raid dps may seem like an inherently better option then the alternative, however in situations where maximizing raid dps comes at the cost of other desireable raid outcomes, it may not be the best goal of a raid composition.
---
For instance, if you have been getting lucky with mage gear drops, and your mage Corps is very highly geared, it might beneficial to only bringb1-2 of your most undergeared mages, so as not to waste the mage loot that drops in a raid.
---
In such a situation, not only does your argument against the MS warrior fall apart, so does the whole assumption that the end all be all goal of a raid should be to maximize the dps of the raid.
---
Does blizzard post any kind of material to back up these claims?
---
The Classic List spreadsheet is recommending it for Phase 1 lol. But there's been a number of inaccuracies with the list, so a theoretical BiS but unlikely. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1246215761
---
Why couldn't you just have posted this classic without dragging some streamer into it? Did you do it for more Karma? You are better than this
---
"No realms are currently available"
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
What? I’m sorry I didn’t know this was a hot topic or something taboo...
---
I was left curious, I’m excited for classic
---
True facts.
---
This is why I've never been too invested in raiding. I don't want to maximize numbers and do a 3-spell rotation. I want to interact with, adapt, and overcome the enemies. 
---
Which is where PVP is.
---
The old style.. God we used to be such video game losers and I LOVE IT
---
Your opinion is exactly the same as the 25 other people who posted this same shit an hour ago
---
SM locks increase the survivability of the raid though and it isn't god awful outside of raiding. Unless you're in a very hardcore guild and pushing the meters I wouldn't bother with DS tbh.
---
it does not matter because the coefficient is so low also you will die before the opponent does if you honestly plan to try this in any setting beyond pve.  in pve you will live but have a lot longer to level up, quest because you have extended downtime.
---
Not really. There are only a couple tauren-only quests. You can do 99% of the Thunder Bluff rep rewarding quests as an orc.  
---
If you want a kodo, you are absolutely doing yourself a favor by going to Mulgore to start.  
---
[](https://i.imgur.com/U37X5zR.png) to see what zones to level in for TB rep.  
---
Ignore the numbers listed in this document though, they're based on private servers and are greatly inflated vs the real Classic numbers. Expect roughly 50% decrease in Classic.
---
PServers with for example diremual tribute being possible have always had completely fucked up economies and literally leveling hunters solely to farm tribute being very popular among raiders.
---
July 16. It was "teased" at Blizzcon, time to follow through Blizzard
---
His mom is a gnome?
---
They did for the dungeon bosses, but that was one of the only cases they've shown iirc
---
BFA is a result of Ion and Brack, so yeah who cares what he thinks.
---
I am a bit worried about Classic in that regard. Vanilla leveling was always great because new people kept starting every day. That kept the zones lively, dungeon groups full and bg's stocked. I'm hoping that classic doesn't turn into barren leveling zones, longer bg queues and even longer dungeon grouping.
---
At the end of the day he reports to the BOD, which report to the shareholders. We generate the shareholders money by giving Blizzard our monthly sub. If he’s going to shit and smear it across the wall and we eventually leave, he will be replaced and the wheel will continue.
---
I think you believe this guy has ultimate power. He has a good amount of power, but will be told to STFU if needed.
---
Dunno why Wrath gets so much love from this community, given Ulduar, ICC and Death Knights are the only things going for it.
---
Northrend, to this day, is the worst continent, and the dungeons were nothing to write home about either. A lot of what makes modern WoW suck in the eyes of the classic community had its origins in Wrath. In these aspects, Wrath is, to me, the worst expansion in WoW's history as future expansions inherited Wrath's problems that are like a genie out of the bottle - very hard to reverse. Cataclysm, which tried to introduce some difficulty back into its dungeons, incurred the wrath (no pun intended) of the player base, and thus the dungeons were nerfed hard.
---
Replace Wrath with Mists of Pandaria or Cataclysm at launch, which managed to still be pretty damn good experiences in spite of inheriting some of Wrath's poor decisions, and then we might be onto something.
---
You can't go from fair to "more fair" unless you've *tipped* in one direction.
---
Last night on the classic beta I spent like 2 hours trying to run from the night elf spawn to Orgrimmar on my night elf. I died like 50 times in STV but it was fun as hell and felt so good once I finally got there.
---
Idk why but stuff like that on regular wow just isn't fun anymore.

I was not in the stress test. I first noticed yesterday afternoon and was able to play all day yesterday.

Here is a link to my [Launcher](https://imgur.com/AvFCCyF) and [Realm List](https://imgur.com/UzWMWh8)
---
Best meme of a song I’ve ever seen lol
---
You're right, I glanced at it earlier and mixed up rank 1 with level 1. So yea, they'd be grouped in with the rest of the cast &amp; projectile ranged. Guess that leaves Hunters as slightly better than Rogues as slightly better than Priests, and none of them better than melee who are already right next to the mob.
---
what is this orc armor? i struggle since some armors look so bad on them, this is awesome
---
The bait was real today, gotta be honest it kinda ruffled my jammies
---
But doesnt the gear warrios need just even the playing field anyway ? Or did I just misunderstand it?
---
Hi, /u/Artonkn
---
You're not getting an invite, neither will I
---
I mean its more popular on alliance because of night elf for atheistics, only mail user and shadowmeld. Therefore its less popular on horde than alliance. :)
---
They'll die either way though. People that already have naxx on farm by that point aren't just going to keep bothering, as there's no motivation for you to bother
---
Azgaz 1 and 2 just had her in basic MC/Ony gear. 3 is when she got AQ 40 gear, but, it's still an awesome series to watch.
---
I also played on Elune but on Alliance
---
Played a Warrior (named October) and a Paladin (named Crystal) hey ;)
---
&gt;they literally can't survive without the support of an old god..
---
Where the hell did this come from?!
---
It did.  It was there from the start to encourage people to keep questing when there wasnt much endgame content yet.
---
Sorry for joking, my bad
---
SOLO: Playing solo warlock is one of the most efficient and capeable classes. You have good variation and possibilities with the different demons while soloing. If you play it safe you can play a warlock with little attention, though you can also challenge yourself and kills several mobs at the time though that requires that you have a good vision of your surroundings and master all the small things. Examples could be your feared mob is about to run in to another group, so you quickly cast CoR to break your own fear from the mob. Warlocks has so many options and tricks when playing solo, that almost any death could have been countered.
---
Dungeon: Much the same as soloing, a good warlock knows when to fear a mob, a better warlock make sure to CoR cancel the fear before it pulls. Summons and soulstones are also much appreciated by dungeon members.
---
Raids: Warlocks are certainly not bad dps, I know people like to compare them to mages and say they are much worse. But while its true that mages are slightly betters its in no way as much as people think, the reason for the misconception is the mages ignite where the damage is only counted as coming from a single mages but in practice generated by all. This means that you will see some mages very high on DPS meter, specially rankings, but its an unfair view because 80% of his dps might be ignite which was generated by all the mages in the raid but the dmg only accounted to one, Good raid leaders knows this. However you fear of casting the 2-3 same spells most of the time is certainly true, a lot of the time its just keep up your curse and corruption and spam shadow bolt. And keeping corruption up is not even that big of a deal if not specced nightfall, and you raid has another good use for the debuff slot.
---
Sorry for the grammer, is on my way out so was written quickly, feel free to ask away if you have any questions.
---
I would say druid, a great druid is one slippery gypsy to lock down.
---
Not bc I was there and it was the first one on the left
---
A fully geared warrior in organized PvP is a literal wrecking ball. They dominate.... HARD
---
No, as they've announced. The 1.12 classes, talents, dmg skills etc etc are in their final stage and they will never be changed. 
---
No changes.
---
This is where Destiny fails.
---
Participation rewards for guaranteed incremental progress doesn't create any sense of mastery or challenge. It's just time sunk. And its boring as fuck.
---
Had to double check I wasn't on warcraftmovies.com.
---
I remember people running t6 4set with sunwell, but also the crafted mace was used a fair amount wasn't it? I honestly don't remember what else people used
---
Exactly and that is what they do when they get reports in, LIKE the Joana dmg bug that was confirmed a bug with shaman totem.
---
Let people report and discuss
---
I'm so sad over the bait they did today :(
---
12am CDT happens when this comment is 7 hours and 46 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/AESXpHGCS
---
I actually belive that most streamers will lose to the players that have been farming private servers for the last decade.
---
That would make sense, especially considering if they want to test this queuing system for WSG. Even the streamers have asked for more people.
---
But lets not forget that "common sense" is not common with Blizzard. Just because we like Classic, does not erase years of suspect decisions and poor planing on their part.
---
Here, your unstated assumption is that lhh is the only plate item with hit on it.
---
Iirc 5% hit is the hit cap for warriors, resulting in “100%” hit rate of yellow attacks.
---
This is lower for Orcs and humans due to facials.
---
Now here is a question for you, what is the “bis” (I hate this term cuz it was not widely used in nilla) gloves for a dps warrior in vanilla?  This is some obscure shit and not even many people knew about it during the live version of the game but since you claim to be a try hard expert on the subject, I assume you know.
---
“Bis” glove slot for dps warrior =???
---
That third option is one change I could really get behind, if you know what I mean. \*wink wink nudge nudge\*
---
Alright thanks, I haven’t really been following classic stuff that closely so appreciate the info
---
I disagree. I think the beginning of the end was around the end of WotLK and the launch of Cata. WotLK was my favorite time in WoW by far.
---
fucking jebait
---
When the fck is there ever 0 casters in a raid? Your extremely contrived counterexample is utterly irrelevant and you know it. Alright Ill change my statement. In nearly every raid, a mortal strike warrior is hindering raid damage. And I still hold to this: There is no good reason to be MS in raid.
---
Is this really the argument you are going with now ? Srsly?
---
wait, when was Benediction added to the game?
---
I am in full beta access.
---
You can get the rep needed by farming elementals in silithus. Do the pre-quests for aqual and you should be able to have douses for first raid.
---
First step towards recovery. I am proud of you
---
RemindMe! 96 days doo diss
---
kinda? IT DID FOR HOURS :(
---
Reminds me of my first time running Mauradon with my hunter. I was absolutely fascinated the place, the sense of ancient-ness about it. I wanted to spend 10+ minutes in every room just drinking in the scenery and ambience.
---
The rest of my group were treating it like just another dungeon run, however, and I didn't want to cause problems so I swallowed my disappointment and hurried to keep up.
---
To be fair, I'm a very slow player, so by the time I was finally level-appropriate for the dungeon the game had been out for well over a year. Half the group was probably running alts, and the others probably just didn't care as much about stopping to smell the roses as I did.
---
Which is all perfectly reasonable, of course, but it didn't make the experience any less disappointing at the time.
---
It was. Any mage who had to sheep on majordomo can attest to heartbeat resists.
---
Remember when raid healing was literally mashing one button as fast as you could? It would even cancel spell casts until like 1.6 or 1.7 or so.
---
Classic is built on the Legion client. So it showed up as PTR for Legion.
---
It might have been in there too but I was talking about a ClassiCast episode I listened to on youtube (realize it has streamers so it may not be popular here but I listened because they have wow classic devs on there I wanted to hear from) they’re like 3 hours each so I can’t rewatch to find but I know it was either Mark who said it or the Nostalrius dev they had on there
---
It's Might set
---
Fair enough, can't argue with that. :)
---
It was not a bait no announcements was made stating a new bundle of invites gone out like there has been in the past.
---
Then be smart and skip that quest.
---
I did [human paladin](https://i.imgur.com/sL47lwJ.jpg) exploration / fedex in 1:05 - ending with [these](https://i.imgur.com/XbrcwHN.png) flight points and ready to start heading to Teldrassil for some easy 5-8 - i've redone the route since then, and should be able to manage ~50-55ish min.
---
During that time, I came across like 3 or 4 mobs I could have tagged (but didn't) cause shit was crowded (got in 30 min after start)
---
Gotta get ahead of the pack early and stay there.

Well grats!

They've addressed this. There will be server sharding/instancing/layering at a very high level at launch, and it'll slowly fade away over the initial weeks after.
---
You won't be playing with every single other person on your server.
---
I agree with all of this. I truly do not understand why so many people hate the existence of LFR so much. 
---
There are def some real morons in LFR but it’s honestly more entertaining than it is upsetting because i men’s...it’s LFR, who cares?
---
“LFR ruined the game” is a statement that just doesn’t make sense to me. There are lots of things wrong with Retail but I think LFR is not one of them.

Daddy Vanilla with those HARD gear checks.

---
Mage/Lock if you want to afford flasking for every raid. Goes for warriors too but tanks would obviously get help from the guild with that.
---
They don't have less DPS than mages, I would say they have about the same or better in prolonged fights.
---
The big issue warlocks have in vanilla is that they have no threat reduction, which severly limits their DPS capabilities, they also crit really really fucking hard which means than two shadowbolt crits in a row with the 20% bonus damage debuff = raid is probalby fucking dead.
---
They get threat reduction from tier 3 (which is the only viable item set for warlocks besides some crafted gear like Bloodvine).
---
Mages have some threat reduction their talents I believe, which is the biggest advantage they have.
---
Warlocks are also better on alliance side because of paladins (horde and alliance have different metas due to shams/palas) where there is no fucking way in hell you can get a shaman in your group concistently as horde for threat reduction, but you can that sweet salvation buff from pallys whenever which helps out warlocks a lot (and yes mage are still ahead because of their even greater threat reduction).
---
Warlocks are also self-sustained, and you can do comps like 4 warlocks + spriest in a group which means that the warlocks will basically self-sustain and not stress the healers out too much from lifetapping.
---
Thanks. This is pretty much how my route looks. I would be about level 5.5 and be in Menethil with 2.5 silver (before repair). Takes right about 55 minutes.
---
I was a field marshal (13) as a resto druid. Druids were amazing at escaping, cc, and sustain and burst healing.

Thanks!  I will look into the "pro leveler" perspective as I wish to go as fast as possible.
---
Asmongold, Esfand, and StaySafe are setting up a premade for WSG in a few mins. Combined they have over 100k viewers right now, and it hasn't even started.
---
Warlocks got some good speccs for everyone, and is even viable speccs (except for early raiding). And after reading your requirements, locks is for you, raids is most likely 2 - 3 spell, you use + banish at some bosses, but if you get a "dot slot" on raid, you will need to keep track on the timer for dots and banish. But for dungeons you have so much different oppertunities for how you wanna play (with the different speccs). Solo you have much abilities you can use depending on the situation you're in. No days will be alike. DPS to locks scale good with gear, so the dps is gonna be awesome AQ40+ raids.

Don’t go off wowhead added date because wowhead didn’t exist prior to 1.11 so everything on wowhead was added in 1.11 or later.

---
You are using feral Druids and hunters to compare damage? You forgot ret pally and shadow priests. They all suck. 
---
Locks are needed for one? Boss 
---
You don’t have a shit ton of utility. You have some.  Your most important thing is buffing mages and melee dps. You should not need to summon in raids. Soulstones are wipe prevention that other classes have. And if you are buffing your groups with pet you aren’t playing your best spec and giving up further ground to mages. 
---
And in AQ and naxx raids when locks have heir best spec they have to put up curse and hit shadow bolt that’s even more boring than fire mages. 
---
Remember me in a year when you aren’t breaking top ten damage in raids.
---
For personal dps DS is the best, for making the raid survive SM is better. DS is also kinda useless outside of raiding and if you're progressing you have to use a shard every try which quickly adds up with all the other stuff you need shards for. SM lets you PvP and raid very well but with the same spec, that's extremely rare among dps classes. 
---
There is also the MD spec which is rarely used, but I found it pretty fun. Essentially you sac your affliction talents for Master Demonology, which means you won't have the 20% extra lifetap talent or instant corruption. MD can be useful in a number of ways; the felhunter gives you 60 resistance which is nice when tanking twins or PvPing, the imp lowers your threat by a lot so it can be useful on some fights and also makes it less likely that you'll get squashed by trash because you happened to crit too hard, voidwalker decreases physical damage taken which is also nice for PvP and the succubus gives you a 10% damage buff to all damage, mostly for PvP as well since DS gives you 15%. I really liked being able to switch my pets around based on what I'm facing. If you have a weak main tank then you'll hit the threat cap anyways and you have to stand around waiting for the tank to catch up. Might as well pull out the imp so you can continue dpsing. 
---
In the optimal scenarios it shouldn't be an issue, but raids are seldom optimal and good MTs are exceptionally rare.
---
It's not so much about surviveability (which, all going well, shouldn't be a concern for anyone but the tank group) so much as SM-Ruin using Nightfall which slams face first into the Debuff cap. 
---
Both specs do approximately the same damage, but even at 16 using a debuff slot on corruption is a hard sell. If you're on Blood Pact duty you can make the arguement so you don't sacrifice personal DPS for the utiliy you're providing but having a number of other warlocks beyond that using corruption works out at a DPS loss vs more debuffs with stronger shadow bolts.

According to this, if you haven't restarted battle net, you still might be able to get to the beta test realm  [https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1132027144320835585](https://youtu.be/ySX_X7mkERw)
---
I don't know how much of a reference it is, especially since BRD isn't out, but maybe it'll add something to the argument (especially if the beta eventually will let people play that far), I do know that it wasn't hard to the point where certain bosses and mobs weren't soloable even on that level.
---
For example, Lord Rokhor (the stone elemental boss early on) I know that I as well as many other druids solo'd as feral for the idol he dropped, and shards. I also have a video showing my brother on his 60 rogue soloing the dark keeper (granted, gray / green mobs) but it might be worth keeping around.

Hi, /u/zenecence
---
They won't understand you because of the language barrier so I don't think yelling gibberish constitutes communicating.
---
No, I am pretty sure Bloodpact is stronger than the priest fortitude buff so you want at least one lock with imp specc in the maintank group.
---
How are they a huge asset? They have curses and ok damage. Are needed for what bosses just twin emps in a year? And their damage is not as good as mages or rogues or warriors
---
It wasn't about that particular boss fight, that's the only one that came to mind when trying to reference it though. I really enjoyed the theme of the place
---
fucking jebaited man im dead inside
---
Oh you can say that, but on retail I opened my M+ cache and got a Wombat of Slaying but it didn't Titanforge and didn't have a gem slot and so now it's useless and what am I supposed to do other than grind for another RNG roll at a Wombat of Slaying that has all the RNG align perfectly so my Wombat of Slaying will be the best Wombat of Slaying and not some useless non-TF piece of shit?\\
---
Man who can have fun when your Wombat of Slaying doesn't Titanforge for like... three straight weeks?!?
---
Your first point is just made up nonsense.  If they have 5 million Classic players, they have a reason to do it.  See?  They get a million people wanting TBC, they go off to their server.  They get a million wanting to stay where they are they do.  They get a million that want new content, they go to the new content servers.  The rest cancel or whatever.  So your first point is just nonsense.  You have no idea how many people will want to play Classic, so you can't say it's not worth doing both.
---
Two: It is as simple as letting you pick to stay where you are on stable Classic, moving on to a TBC server, or to move on to a new content server.
---
There's no reason they have to let you move over to a TBC server after you've been on a new content server.
---
I’ve been enjoying Tribe’s stream a lot too
---
That might have been very true in vanilla, and some of that is today (escaping and sustaining) but now with better players, druids are terrible pure pvp healers cause of constant dispels on their hots, and no hot stacking. They're just so much worse than priesta and paladins at healing but too valuable as an DX
---
they were. The PvP mount i think was the only one that wasn't.
---
Other people being bad doesn’t make you good. And I don’t believe you, no way you were doing any damage on bosses as level 58 with what 3 hit?
---
What? Did they change the sizes? The screenshots yesterday clearly showed they were NOT the correct height.
---
Kraun as well
---
Proof?
---
Blizzard has also said its buggy right now. I'm hopeful they get it right for launch.
---
Yup you seem like the kind of guy that calls homosexuality immoral
---
Even in T2 progression this was requested of us, especially on Chrom/Nef. Thankfully we had 5-6 warlocks in the raid so we were not constantly swamped by 35 people opening trade for healthstones.
---
I'm a bit worried that we won't be seeing a lot of locks in raids, so the few that will be there will just have so much more work.
---
Is that, [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker)?
---
i couldn't find them. i only saw the ones on the boat and i think some by the cat-griffins on the one side. i never saw as many as that link shows.
---
Right! Took over a decade and not even past launch and people are asking for changes. If there will be anything they'll copy everything to a TBC realm. It makes the most businesses sense for return on their investment.
---
I really understand the issue, but in 2 weeks after launch, it shouldnt be tough to Remove atleast for “High-end” zones
---
tier 1 warrior battlegear of might
---
Mean't?
---
His mom played a NE Druid, lol
---
Buddy I ain't playing to break top ten dps in raids.  I'm playing to chill, have fun and enjoy some boss content. Using your logic you would only have fury, rogue and mage dpsing in raids, that's just not how it goes down. 
---
Probably not a popular opinion on this sub, but racing to 60, min maxing, and trying everything to squeeze out every last drop of dps just isn't necessary in a 15 year old orc simulator that been completed years ago.
---
not really, at the end of the day  nejoy working 9-5 :)
---
Boomers DansGame
---
lmao calm down jew
---
You won't be able to use these in-game. My guess is OP plans to make a promo video.
---
Should be in the game at launch and require level 55 to get but also need exalted with the argent dawn faction. I would look into how long that takes. Could be a while turning in the scourgestones.
---
played spriest on nost. I can 100% back this up.
---
No, they don’t. Show me proof against warriors and mages who know what they are doing come AQ
---
Why don't people only play three classes? Warrior, priest and rogue, right?
---
Hi, /u/Mister_Coggy
---
Once Warlocks get the gear behind them they'll actually overtake Mage dps and feasibly compete with Warriors &amp; Rogues for top dps (though Warr will probably still take it). As you say the issue with warlocks isn't the numbers they can put out, it's their ability to manage the threat they generate.
---
At level 30 you shouldn’t have any white gear equipped.
---
I had a love/hate relationship with it. Id always die from aggroing mobs that seemed to always be just around the corner lol.
---
I used to work as a Video Remote medical interpreter Spanish/English. I had two computers, one transmitting my medical calls the other one playing wow. I LITERALLY had to play while I worked cause becoming an interpreter is a 1-2 year process that doesn't train you psychologically to witness some of the things I've seen. Decided to start playing while on a call. Providers never could tell, it gave me peace. Win/win. 
---
Those were fun times. I got burnt out though. I had like 7 lvl 120s.
---
The script worked in Vanilla, as well as the zoom out distance increase script.
---
The hell was this downvoted for?  Lol. Yall crazy.
---
Blizzard CS has posted on twitter saying this is a bug. If you can use reddit you can use google.
---
Yes and as president of a company it makes sense for him to believe "look how far we've come and what we can do now!" and also wanting to push forward and not zip backward.
---
But then the community is like "all of this is just worse versions of the original, let us play the original again"
---
His position is going to normally conflict with vanilla fans because most companies don't look to return to their origins like classic is about to do.
---
I'm glad he can have his beliefs and we still get what we want.  That's pretty solid.  A lot of companies will drown themselves before giving in to what is a tantamount reversal of their vision and goals.

Another example while in a group.
---
If layering is the culprit this may be one of the saddest what could have been. This is why it so important for this to not extend past launch.

I used to use this to swim up the side of stranglethorn vale on my low level horde on the way to deadmines

Reference screenshot was on a pserver
---
Screenshot was from a pserver
---
You are going to have a lot of fun. It will actually be easier to find a raid spot too
---
well but thats two conditions right ? geared warrior AND organized pvp (or just a privat healer in general). A normally geared warrior is still insane with a healer as far as I understand it right ?
---
It is 6% with 305 weapon skill on a lvl 63 boss. For a 1 handed or 2 handed warrior, not dual wield. 8.6% I believe for 300 weapon skill. But ppl just get 9%. 
---
BiS gloves are gauntlets of annihilation I believe. But Edgemaster's or even ACLG could be better depending on your other gear.
---
Mythic raiding is absolutely not a joke.
---
And don't forgot the harbor was a close flight away from IF also.
---
Sonic Syndicate and Soilwork might as well be the official licensed soundtrack for old WoW PvP
---
? No queues. New layers as players login
---
Eventually most people who stick around will do naxx and there will need to be more reason to keep logging on.
---
Hmm yeah but all is rarely well for most guilds. Especially when you're pushing into AQ and Naxx those extra 500-ish HP will save a lot of people from being bursted into the ground. I'd argue that the tank group is actually not the group that needs the imp, it's the healer group. A tank with 10-11k HP will hardly notice that extra 500 HP whereas a priest even with world buffs has a hard time climbing over 4k HP. Bear in mind also that flasks will probably be extremely expensive and rare on Classic compared to private servers.
---
I won't argue that SM is better for dps than DS, it definitely isn't, even with corruption and NF. It's just better for the raid.
---
Because of Private Server values, as usual.
---
how do you have new water graphics
---
Idk, my brain just autocorrects its self to that.
---
Ha! That also does ring a bell. I am really looking forward to going to all these spots again. My memory doesn't seem to be as great as others that played Vanilla WoW but once I start seeing those old quests and areas I know it's all going to click again.
---
are you spanking it to videos of dogs?
---
Can we still get ontop of the gurubashi arena gate?
---
A normal geared warrior is good but not the same level as a fully geared one. Warriors scale with gear, the more time you put in to perfect your gear, the more you will realize that in PvP.
---
Not if they're Survival for PvP
---
Oh my god. Same thing happenned to me a few hours ago. I started the beta client just in the sheer hope I got a beta invite or something, and I saw all the beta realms offlines, so I got super excited thinking I could log in when they got online. Well, rip.

[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker)
---
I see it as healthy distrust of a large corporation who's continued design philosophy turned one of the greatest games ever made into something not even resembling a shadow of an MMORPG. They've done it with the best of intentions, but they've continually made small iterations of convenience that have turned the game into one with zero social interaction. They have said what their intentions are, but they have before made compromises that they've been proud of in the moment, but they'll admit was a horrible mistake years after the fact. And I think you're reading too much into how people are sperging. People will be upset and rage on the internet, but that's happened before, this stuff isn't life or death. I've lived without classic before, and if they fuck it up, I will live without it again.
---
I have to wonder how many people screaming about people using AddOns in various twitch chats ever raided in vanilla. Decursive was LITERALLY 1 button to autotarget a cursed player, and decurse; just smash one button over and over. AND it synced with everyone else running decursive so you don't all grab the same targets... OP as hell. Not to mention the AH Addons which were basically AH bots.
---
Hello all. I would like to introduce a guild by the name of BourbonRaiders.
---
Goal: Family oriented guild looking to casually complete end game raid and PvP content.
---
Raid Hours: Friday and Saturday 8pm-12am CST (subject to change).
---
Website: bourbonraiders.guildlaunch (.com)
---
\*Guild website is a work in progress.
---
Faction: Horde
---
Server: PvP; CST. Will give more detail when we learn more about the different servers.
---
My BattleTag: Breakout#1905
---
We have a discord and will send invites as needed.
---
\*Again, we are a family oriented guild. We will complete raid content, but at our own pace. 
---
\*Guild is growing.
---
\*Have updated website and Discord.
---
 Lionel Hutz will get right onto it, right after his lawsuit against the makers of The Never Ending Story.
---
You're not. They say it's the correct height, but it looks like they're using [the Legion height numbers](https://i.redd.it/zc8squd0xxz21.png) where male Gnomes are 5.6 inches taller and female Gnomes are 4.8 inches taller. [Example](https://i.redd.it/zc8squd0xxz21.png).
---
Ye, a tip, don't comment on r/classicwow about:
---
* Changes
---
* Streamers (exception: to hate on them)
---
* Any negative about vanilla wow
---
Good Luck
---
Try not putting Immolate on your targets. It generates a lot of threat due to how much of its damage is up front, and it honestly isn't all that mana-efficient a spell anyways at lower levels.
---
It’s really not that bad when you don’t just cherrypick the end of the quote. Before that he says 
---
“It’s had a huge community impact, it’s created a lot of bonds and friendships. Not being able to experience that game felt like a bit of a tragedy. So that was part of the lens as well was like ‘hey this game should exist, we should find a way for this game to exist!’
---
THERE YA GO! TAKE MY UPDOOT!
---
You sound like someone who doesn’t deserve it. Throwing a fit because you feel you’re entitled to something. :|
---
Considering [this screenshot](https://i.redd.it/zc8squd0xxz21.png) it looks like they've decided to use the height values from Legion.
---
literally two comments up you have one... The hivemind is not a real thing buddy
---
Nice I caught a 12 and 10 on my Tauren in bloodhoof village on my way to 75!
---
All I can tell you is that if he demo shouted at 28 seconds, this video would have a different outcome.
---
No you need 2 locks for CoR and CoE. 
---
And you don’t need rogues after bwl.
---
raiders have always had an advantage over pure pvpers.  shit like deathbringer's will in wrath or the fucking agi vial/dot trinket in cata were beyond broken.  not to forget legendary weapons.  shadowmourne, cata staff, rogue daggers were all fucked
---
God I always hated that. The game wants you to play together but those quests take forever in a group. There’s a reason they made quest items drop for all group members in later expansions.
---
Good advice my guy
---
I wonder what should I tell my boss and colleagues when I take a two week vacation from 27th onwards. Maybe I should quit and become a streamer.
---
Does perfect gear mean "full naxx gear etc." or literally the best gear that is available at the time. During MC times for example ?
---
Trust me.  They will.  You have absolutely no idea just how much balance whine will start pretty soon, especially if classic reaches any size at all.
---
There will be demands for future expansions, demands for classic specific rebalances, demands for 'just the talents'.
---
I played vanilla.  I remember the whining.  Just wait until the first rogue dies to a reckoning bomb, or warriors overtake everyone in DPS because theres no expansion to reset everything in sight.  Everyone will be talking about skill floors and skill caps and talking about mechanics they miss and then people like me will be sat here laughing because we were then when all this began the last time.
---
Paladins and shamans especially will be ultra whiny because their classes suck.
---
I'm glad, I always turn that shit off.
---
I disagree. 
---
LFR is trivial. 
---
But Heroic takes effort and Mythic is very challenging. 
---
LFR simply allows casual players to see portions of the game that they otherwise would not have a chance to see. The loot rewards are so significantly lower that they don’t even compare to Heroic or Mythic. Like the difference between a LFR geared toon and Herioc geared toon is comparable to the difference between a level 50 toon and level 60 toon in retail.
---
Awesome. I played in Vanilla beta (closed/open) and the first almost 2 years of release. I always came back when new expansions came out with the exception of the newest one and always left a bit disappointed. I was trying to recapture that sense of community and accomplishment and it never did it for me so I just left after a week or two of playing.
---
Very much looking forward to classic WoW. From the streams I watched it looks like exactly what I am looking for is happening. Definitely going Horde again, race likely Forsaken but class I might spice it up.
---
AV is 51-60.
---
Changing between layers should be manual and have a cool down. You have to log out, select a layer (that your friends are on) then log back in. Then it'll have a 1 hour CD or something. This way you can get your entire guild on the same layer. Perhaps they tell you what layers are high and low pop etc.
---
I had this and the grind was intense. I was lucky because I had guildies who would run Strat repeatedly and give me the tokens.
---
I couldn't skin the mobs in the starting zone.
---
Screenshot was from a private server presumably. The server (maybe even MangOS default idk) might initialize gnomes with a smaller scale value than was on 1.12.
---
Looking back at [some 2006 PVP video](https://youtu.be/XXNcTcf8TJg), gnomes actually seem to be the Classic size. Though it's hard to tell with the closest reference to a dorf being an orc.
---
Blizzard trying to push e-sports for arena sucked. Suddenly every spec had to be balanced around its effectiveness in arena.
---
I give it three months.
---
I really don't trust the format of this article, summarizing a chunk of time and an idea in one paragraph, than starting the Brack quote from... what? What part of the discussion was this? What did the interviewer exactly say when Brack said the line? Context is important, and if the interview was actually mentioning his statement from 2013 he would probably want to address that as "It doesn't matter what I think, but how the community feels."
---
There is always a chance, yes. Is it a very good chance? Not even remotely close. From what we have heard, almost everyone who got in was either a streamer, friend of streamer, or a 2004-2005 account. Even with an old account it was VERY rare to get in. There were over 1,000,000 players in the first few months of Vanillas launch.
---
Oh look, more fun for content creators.
---
Every zone that had geographic changes is worse off for it. 
---
I miss old Barrens.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/AjDABPzBxEAE6wNMBA
---
Something like this is my prefered specc, you get a lot of utility, and raw damage. If you do 5 mans you have the improved imp, and for soloing you get the improved voidwalker tank (which is really useful for optimal glass-cannon DPS build)
---
The wrinkle in builds like that is you don't have improved shadow bolt. This maxes your own personal dps at the expensive of not helping to keep the buff rolling and just leeching procs off the other warlocks.
---
Sure, and unless they fix duping I'm going to abuse that too
---
Another variation on the same playstyle could be  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0kV0hoZxVMdVMhx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0kV0hoZxVMdVMhx) , which is a bit more enhance focused, but with crit instead of cooldown reduction.
---
The way I'm thinking is that the main thing limiting Shaman dps is mana; if you want to get the maximum damage per mana possible its probably most efficient to drop the cooldown reduction talents and cast time reduction talents for more melee damage and crit. I'll have to test it more when the game comes out, and it might end up being painful to cast lightning bolts at their normal cast time but this is the most mana-efficient build I can think of. It depends on just how mana hungry shaman is in classic I suppose, and if 3 second lightning bolts combined with the later payoff of an elemental devastation proc is better than just autoattacking with windfury weapon. This is mostly theory, I can't check until game releases.
---
well they said that they've reached their preferred amount of players for the beta, so i think it's kinda pointless now. might change their minds in the future tho, you never know.
---
There were a couple raid bosses in MC where I would literally just spam the one-button decurse the entire fight while trying not to stand in fire.
---
Perfect means best you can have at the time. I do not know any BiS lists but there is a time when R14 gear is really really strong and then later Naxx gear starts becoming better.
---
Ppl forget that he was a founder of WoW...
---
Warriors have to swap between tank and dps gear all the time, while Hunters and Locks don’t. They most certainly do not get priority.
---
It's random friend. I didn't make it into the beta or stress test. My account is from 2004 AND I was accepted into the original beta.
---
Damn, the quality is way better than the original. Is there a software that does this or something? I'd love to improve the quality of my PvP video from vanilla era
---
&gt; I want to release a game in 2019 and tell people that they might need to wait 3+ days before they can play regardless of if they paid for the game or not
---
Want me to tell you how I know you're under 30?
---
Or the pserver is wrong.
---
Layers are part of the same server.
---
Oh damn, it works PagChomp
---
As for LHH, Yea I would say r10 helm is better overall but w 2 hit you can wear more mitigation pieces and LHH is easier to obtain early on. I would argue its also better than executioners but I guess you could wear that instead.
---
I tried to make one myself but it isnt good &gt;:(
---
Cobbled stones, take me home, to the place I belong,

I'm in my 30s and I like that too. Right mix of funny and mature.

Then propose an alternative or shut the fuck up

---
This feels like Santa Claus all over again.
---
*cries in prot pally*
---
Layers are part of the same server and are only going to be in the game for a small amount of time. Won’t be worth the trouble
---
You need rep for mounts not from your race.
---
Great post brotha, breaks up the toxic posting I’ve seen as of late, really got me in the mood to prep and play. Cheers.
---
It's completely random, with the exception of popular streamers (for publicity), so this is pretty false.
---
Very concerning actually
---
Rank 1 players losing to a crew of rag tag pver's. AMAZIN.
---
Range dps are not filler, nor is all the utility provided by every class in some worthwhile capacity.
---
&gt;Warriors have to swap between tank and dps gear all the time
---
No they don't, they probably have a few pieces its not a full set.
---
The reason you have all the DPS warriors collect tank gear is just because of the shield-wall CD, which reduces damage by 75% anyways, so its not like you need to be bis geared to tank for 10 seconds.
---
Onyxia bag is a hunter/lock bag, there is no arguing against it.
---
How does mage and warlock differentiate rotation wise in regards to PvE? I know that Warlocks are basically spamming SB for the entire raid, will it be the same with mages, just frost/fireballs instead.
---
Fucking LOL
---
I really really doubt it considering people have been playing vanilla since TBC came out.

Or he was an altoholic who also liked to spend hours exploring and talking to random people in town...like me.
---
11 months to hit 60...
---
Yea, I guess 90% of the playerbase being unable to play for half a week is "simpler". 
---
Somehow I don't think the shareholders will see it that way.
---
You can buy them from the vendor after completing the quest yes.
---
Most of it are just sillybeans who never got far in vanilla, and think tryharding/being a dick about raid comps will somehow translate into their raid clearing Naxx.
---
You forgot buffing every five minutes.
---
Wow man
---
Holy clicking, lol. But still cool to see what that gear can do.
---
Seeing posts with word like “noggenfogger elixir” is the reason I am back
---
She has the peripheral vision of an owl. You'd be surprised how good she was compared to others.
---
Dominate PvP with it.
---
PvPers were PISSED that PvP gear was basically worthless, and T3 for a lot of classes was better for PvP than it was raiding.
---
TBC went the other way and made PvP gear strong enough you could replace several tiers of PvE with it.
---
Personally I'd rather a complete divorcing of PvP and PvE gears.
---
A idea I had:
---
PvP gear has the stats of a green of it's level. This means you can still do quests/grind in the world with it, but it won't intrude on raid gameplay as it's too weak.
---
PvP Armor has resilence, which reduces damage by up to 50% at maximum par-value (BEFORE armor).
---
PvP Weapons have PvP Power which acts like resilience penetration. in addition all attacks against other players are increased by 20% damage as long as you have at least 1 PvP weapon equipped (maximum of +20% bonus).
---
Assuming you have a full compliment of PvP weapons vs a full complement of PvP armor you deal full damage if all the gear is the same tier. 
---
However higher tier weapons have higher amounts of PvP power so you'll need higher tier armor to compensate. This gives a reason to keep pushing higher while also keeping PvP more about skill and tactics over just over-gearing your opponents.
---
meanwhile, PvE gear isn't bound by any such restrictions and can have blue/epic stats etc, and will end up with much better stats than what PvPers can get, but the bonuses of the PvP gear will close the gap as trying to kill a PvP geared player will feel like attacking an elite or dungeon boss to PvE geared players.
---
A first crack at the idea.
---
Are we referring to the same build because the build i'm referencing would be similar to this.

---
Definitely has imp SB
---
They said account age mattered, so it’s random but weighted at least.
---
would you pick a pile of crap over a cup of icecream?
---
Hey there, I know this is a few days old but I'm in a similar predicament here between Warrior and Druid, but I DO care about PvP. How would you compare those classes there?
---
One of the appealing aspects of Druids to me is that they have a lot of specs that can function in a PvE and PvP environment simultaneously - HotW for tanking/healing/pvp, Moonglow for balance pvp/resto pve, swiftmend/charge for healing pve and flag carrying pvp, etc. I don't know if Warrior has similar options.
---
Warrior is appealing to me in PvP due to being able to burst and kill people, but everyone always says they're trash without a pocket healer. Druid is less gear dependent, which is nice, but they have so much less killing power that I'm not sure if it's worth going for...
---
If by 10 minutes you mean 20 hours, then yea, maybe.
---
Without him classic probably wouldn't have been what it was.
---
Is it? (dont bomb me for this) this was among the oldest issue on classicmangos core (privateserver core) and after researching they fixed it
---
That's fascinating, actually. I guess private servers spawn gnomes in with whatever size the model happens to be, while on official servers they always have a size multiplier added? I can't think of many other ways this could possibly have happened.
---
Something that is not mean. Mean't
---
Isn't all of BRS 10 since UBRS and LBRS is the same instance?
---
old player : Man there needs to be adventure and exploration, like in the old days !
---
same old player 14 years ago : let me look that up on thottbot
---
People are stupid, if you don't know that by now then I feel for you. It really depends on what you want to do. Mage is missing from your list as the de facto ranged dps btw. Warlock is also very good, hunter has a role, pally is actually a really really strong tank healer later on in the game and has necessary buffs for the raid. If your guild plays well with a druid, they can be strong healers as well. Shaman is crucial for horde raids as much as pally is for alliance. I can go on and on and on
---
GJ Asmon &amp;Company :)
---
All you need for access to Classic WoW is an active WoW subscription
---
With your WoW sub?
---
&gt;A great many seem to believe that Warriors, Priests and Rogues are your only tank, healer and dps choice, respectively.
---
Nobody says that.
---
The pserver somehow got the wrong size of models that comes from the CLIENT not serverside?
---
Trap
---
It's called gish gallop. Look it up.
---
So, tbh I wasn't entirely sure and it seems I was wrong, at least to some degree, strange that we haven't seen anyone use it in the beta yet though
---
The proof: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1 
---
"Fixed an issue where Warrior "Battle Shout" was causing too much threat. "
---
This doesn't say how much threat, but it was probably somewhat significant if they felt the need to nerf it
---
It really isnt but thats ok.
---
It requires a subscription, that's all. One sub gets you access to modern WoW and Classic WoW
---
The private server can only be wrong about things stored on the server. Models were not stored on the server.
---
Yep, resilience was awful. Remove that and I like tbc ten times more, though flying mounts might be the single most ruinous thing to happen to the game.
---
What do you mean? No purchase needed. It’s rolled into your sub for live. This is really old info. All you will need is a WoW account that is active.
---
Yes, but I don't think mages crit as hard
---
Lol.
---
He logged into a different layer, not another server.  You are mixing up the word layer and server.
---
That doesn't contradict anything? There are just different layers on one server and he got into a new one. I think I read there are only going to be 3-4 layers per server too so it's not unlimited in exploitation.
---
You need an active wow subscription, you can subscribe to the free version of wow and never spend a dime on the actual game, just the monthly sub
---
&gt;I’m actually missing the Bloodfang chest piece in that picture. I never did get it, even going back years later. The one in the picture is Tier 1.
---
Oh, that's right. My eyes was just locked on the awesome shoulders ;)
---
IIRC, you can kill your own faction members there. Could be wrong though. 
---
And I think a random chest spawns in the middle once a day with some good loot.
---
How zones should be, 
---
SMALL
---
UNIQUE
---
and in direct contrast to the surrounding zones.
---
Remember going from Thousand Needles to Feralas for the first time???!?!
---
Nah, BWL+ is where they start to "mutate". The more you dedicate to gear the warrior the bigger the payoff. In PvP they end up overpowered, especially in organized PvP. With that same gear, you will most of the time also "oneshot" people in 1v1, esp in WPvP if you open with charge, even if they also have gear. It just scales better than the others. 
---
Naxx+ is just bullshit. If you get gear from there you are literally broken.
---
Same goes for DPS, once they reach AQ40 gear, they are the best DPS in the game, only rivaled by mages and naxx geared DS/Ruin Warlocks, and that still depends on the fight.
---
But of course man! He doesn't get a chance to get his "perfect rotation and strategy" down before release!
---
It's a brand new game that has many mysteries that are unsolved.
---
Not even slighty close and definitely not the same thing.
---
inb4 deleted
---
Flying mounts weren't nearly as destructing as LFG/LFR tool and all the other QoL features / removal of RPG features.
---
I stand by that dungeon/raid/group finder absolutely cost this game its soul.  It wasn’t worth it.
---
Such a cool story! I was able to play during the stress test but damn, it was some of the most fun I've had in a while! Have fun during the beta! Hopefully I'll get invited lol
---
But they specifically said that that's the correct height and it has been verified in the 1.12 client
---
Yeah hum, where's that picture from ? Also, did you notice how the first gnome is not in the same position as the other and the camera is further away potentially making us think the character is smaller due to distance ?
---
My dad used to manage a self storage business where we lived on sight, we used to play WoW for hours on end in my dad’s office while no customers came in... such good times.
---
Here you go. A build that will be absolutely superior.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Ii0bZrxzzThoZgx0tM0z
---
Your build has several down sides.
---
No improved lifetap, you will be using it all the time.
---
No shadowburn, strong ability if you have spare shards or if the enemy will die soon
---
No destructive reach, really important for a raider
---
And the fact that your imp will oom in 20 seconds, after doing only a couple thousands of damage.
---
Classic
---
right. Spearmint will be along to delete any post that he doesn't prefer.
---
Dude Mages are some sick DPS....Locks can get there too at a certain point.
---
You're right, they never forget to put Mage on the list!
---
mount collectors &gt; pvpers
---
I remember the exact same thing.
---
The 1-6 was never an issue when new servers would launch back in vanilla launch of BC.
---
Seems odd about the correct height, when we literally have vanilla client screenshots that says it is different. Like pservers don't script the standard size of model, that shit comes DIRECTLY from the game files in your client, and guess what pservers use the original 1.12 client.
---
So either something is terribly wrong with how blizzard is testing things, or it's a miss understanding and they mean the serverside(like attack range etc.) size not the client size, you know the models actually look.
---
It may seem like they differ but I assure you they do not. Always ends with the same argument in the comments about the game being completely ruined and shit
---
I am no programer, and also not that great at Google sheets. I don't know how to make the sheet populate and update with data from Armory (assuming Classic will have it). Would definitely be a great addition though.
---
Some of the other stats you mention have so far not been included to keep the number of columns down. DKP and attendance is something I am planning not to handle in the sheet, no.
---
Who can update the sheet will be up to the leadership of the guild that uses it. They could just make the sheet available for every member to edit, or they could have officers or specific people handle it. I think it would be great if everyone could edit their own entry but not change anything else, but IDK how to do that :P
---
Or Shamans for totems + Chain heals in Raids
---
Really good hunter on Esfands team, great job putting pressure on the druid if you see this.
---
This was working in Vanilla. I remember doing this. 
---
I have no source or any info to support my claim, though.
---
I guarantee you, if people make noise about this, Blizzard will confirm it true.
---
So I can’t play with my Battle.net friends from other servers?
---
Yeah, i believe that new PTR account was the one for the stress test that i never noticed. NO beta here :(
---
Hordes side was so scuffed for the first few minutes whilst they tried to get into a discord together F
---
You can see all those years of education have paid off for me
---
I dont understand deleting posts personally. Unless they are racist or something, let the community police with up/down votes. Thats what reddit is for no?
---
you could probably just rename the executable...
---
So if it isn't random, why have some people who have started in BFA gotten an invite , yet I haven't as a day 1 player?
---
Didn't show up until 10 yards? Are you sure about that buddy?
---
Thats just isnt true
---
How did AH addons work back then? I remember always being so poor and couldn’t figure out how people played the auction house.
---
The shoulders are the best part for sure. My favorite set in the game by far.
---
No.  Welcome to classic
---
haha right. feel like most weren't on their A-game w/ keybinds till BC.
---
Yes sir. It's one of the reasons i'll actually try "classic!" Now where did that blue 1.4 spd off hand dagger drop.....hmmm....
---
They don't have to. The damage difference between SM and DS is pretty small.
---
It was never my thing but I know tons of people were super stoked about doing that on my PvP server.
---
F R E S H
---
I still think his statement is not entirely wrong, with all the people calling for buffs of mobs due to skill increase and other aspects to be different to "fit better the idea of vanilla" not what it actually was.
---
It is condescending as fuck too.
---
well yeah I don't disagree there but at the same saying he played since cata/legion with no proof is also very inaccurate. his gameplay is pretty trash no doubt, no idea why he said he's one of the best warriors out there. I thought he was joking at the start but idk no more. his whole persona is very sketchy and he gets a lot of shit lately which some of it is justified honestly but it's still a shame for this tool. I actually liked some of previous content on youtube before he started milking shit out. you could tell the guy was passionate to game and articulated his words well enough. I feel like he should stick to creating youtube content instead of making himself look like a fool
---
Well if there are less people playing modern then there will be less people will be selling tokens for gold so the gold price will skyrocket (probably with some help from blizzard themselves) forcing more players to pay the subscription. So unless you’ve already queued those 15 months I reckon you’ll get 10 months at best. 
---
Also what many people seem to forget is server transfer/name change was a thing in classic and will be making a return in classic wow around the time of AQ is released so they always going to have that revenue stream.
---

Ok, first of all you aren't guaranteed an invite by being day 1 player, there were millions of people who played in 2004-2005. I did say it was possible for a BFA player to get an invite, just much much rarer. If you look at all the posts of people saying "I got in" they almost all had 2004-2005 accounts. There were a few oddities but mostly it was older accounts.
---
Same as always. Moms credit card.
---
Well, if you ask me then its fine. I don't want post-Naxx content.
---
Because it's R A N D O M
---

---
The voidwalker has sacrifice which makes it almost always more valuable than the other pets.
---
You can maybe to Affliction with Siphon life and life-drain spamming, but that will also mean that you will often be at low HP in the open world, leaving you vulnerable to chain pulls or ganks.
---
My preferred method is just have the void tank, dot up the target and wand them to death, and conserve mana as much as possible.
---
There's 3 versions:
---
A) No caps at all, you could literally 40 man dungeons if you wanted. This was changed in I believe patch 1.3 or 1.4, before diremaul.
---
B) 10man strat/scholo/brd &amp; 15man blackrockspire. Diremaul was always locked to 5man.
---
c) Strat/scholo nerfed to be more reasonable for a 5man, and a 5man cap added, blackrockspire nerfed to be 10man dungeon and 10man cap added.
---
I don't remember when C was, it was quite late. 
---
As for quests I'm not sure. 
---
Either way we're getting the nerfed dungeon versions, and probably the normal 5man and 10man caps that 1.12 version brings. Honestly no real reason to try go back to previous versions specifically because as blizzard only has 1.12, they don't have the info for how it was pre nerf.
---
Rogue/mage
---
Definitely the most fun and skillful.
---
Alot of cc and stunlocked target will be taking free frostbolts into his face.

---
I had forgotten all about easyheal I think it was.
---
Its random in the essence that they arent hand picked, yes. It is not R A N D O M in the way that everyone has equal chance of getting in. You are right but you dont even know why
---
All of this twinking was done in Vanilla and BC. EXP off came in WotlK I think
---
Thats what I thought but seems "mods" are just normal people letting their own opinions get in the way. Not just this thread but many threads
---
What monitor is this?
---
It would be phase 2 assuming that content is progressed. It appears it debuted in 1.3, which would be in phase 2.
---
OR the private server has its own version of the client for download (as some do), and they either erroneously or consciously altered the scaling on the model.       
---
          
---
Did the private server from which the screen shot was taken ever explicitly claim that their gnome scaling was 100% accurate with vanilla? Or are people assuming that any/every pserver was attempting to maintain parity with vanilla on such things?
---
Mage probably if you are interested in farming, make more gold quicker and invest it into buying BoEs or other shit and farm more.
---
Community was worse than this subreddit back in vanilla/TBC... not sure what you think you remember, but it was bad.
---
Not that I am complaining mind you... I feel everyone should develop some thicker skin and learn from it.
---
Who was it?
---
Looks like icehud
---
And fury warrior is best dps.
---
Ask them who they want healing their tank? That's a paladin.
---
He’s not your buddy, pal.
---
Bring me one too :o 
---
Plat for you bud !
---
insta-dots is good against kiting classes I guess, and locks can also purge of Viper Sting/freezing trap  if they are using felhunter I think.
---
It was brilliant
---
First of all, quote where your philosophy of "X% for Y years of playing" is stated, and not some bullshit based off some Reddit posts. Otherwise, it's random.
---
I'm curious...  Were you looking for friends or just playing the game as designed and so since you didn't need to make friends to do stuff you neglected to reach out and do it?     
---
I'm always confused by posts like yours because I've made friends new friends in game in every expansion I played.  A lot of it because I raid lead a group of friends but we always needed a few extra people so I did a lot of recruiting.  Mythic+ dungeons were also means to force you to make friends if you didn't already have a dedicated group.  Did you just not do higher level content in previous expansions?  IMO higher level content has always worked the same for every expansion, you gotta reach out and make friends to be able to do it.

I usually sit at 120 from Scandinavia.

That's literally the only mechanic besides "run out of you have debuff"
---
It's so obvious you are ignorant to how difficult mythic actually is since you've clearly never done it.
---
but the models are stored in the game client aren’t they?
---
No need to explain, i was underlaying my vision. Ive been playing WoW since march 2005.
---
Or, they want to fix the old Vanilla problem of gnomes having to swim in places all the other models could run and are just telling you it's the right number.
---
There were raging debates about it when it first came out.
---
Allakhazam existed back then, as did Thottbot.
---
These kinds of sites are not new.
---
They already state if Classic performs well theyll look into setting up TBC and Wrath servers respectively.
---
have they said what the release plan is for phases?
---
Warsong Gultch Enemy Flag Carrier should not be shown on the map in Classic. Watching Asmon's stream right now and they're showing both on the map. I distinctively remember the EFC wasn't shown on the map

Not sure why you got down voted man, blizz said "layering" is different from sharding because it stretches the whole half of the map and people wont shard at random intervals. obviously if your phasing between these layers at random intervals it doesn't matter if it stretches half the map or just the zone because the effect is exactly the same. one way to fix it would be you only change layers when on the loading screen between the halves.
---
I was huge on twinking then, with a friend of mine. I took forever hitting max level because I had 3 different twinks that my brother helped fund. I honestly don't think I will do it this time around though for some reason
---
I feel ya. I enjoy watching some of as much as the next guy, but I fear these guys are going to greatly change the overall experience. I'm going to try and avoid streamer servers, but I fear that will be easier said than done. I imagine every server will have at least a couple...
---
The old talent system absolutely had its flaws, with a few talents like Improved Slam being pointless trash, the vast majority of the trees do genuinely allow for a huge variety of valid builds to choose from. I've been doing a lot of research into Paladin trees in preparation for classic, and it's kind of amazing how split people tend to be on builds to use for particular roles, and the small fiddly bits on top of that. Even if you plan to be PvP Ret paladin, there's still valid choices to make between deep-Ret, reckoning ret, holy-ret, and shield vs two-handed,

19/29 bracket here, if you ever venture out feel free to hit me up
---
"layering" looks so bad I will probably just stay on my pserver.
---
i wll not mind at all if they buff raids and dungeons HP significantly to offset the game just being easier now in general due to knowledge and itemization
---
Yeah, because the #nochanges crowd would totally not spiral into total meltdown when they implement a cash shop, cosmetics or "p2w" stuff. There is no room for that.  
---
Also I support the choice, why wouldn't I ? They offer support and a controlled enviroment. Just because someone took their product, offered it for free, doesn't mean blizz is obliged to do so as well.
---
He didn't. He sacced his vw and almost instantly summoned a new one, but it took hin a second and a half or 2.

How will the imp deal damage if you demonic sacrifice him? Plus wouldn't the 12% threat reduction increase my personal dps be a decent margin.

I’ve played all brackets, 19/29 just seem too narrow.
---
For me it was purely entering the city for the first time. Walking up to the gate, seeing the forges, all the people. I was really blown away, and I've loved it since.
---
Soooo uh why did this get removed.
---
It came with TBC, same as multiple zones that came with Cata. If i show you videos of everything that was cut from Vanilla, you might go crazy.
---
But im sure blizzard will start working on a re-release of a game along with Retail, their other games and their intend to expand on the mobile marked.

Im sure that you will get a dedicated team just for WoW classic, to make sure it will never derail in they start making new content for classic.
---
To make sure that no new content surpasses Naxx, so it wont turn the game into a powercreep ride, filled with catch up mechanics.
---
To make sure we will never end up to a point where new content removes the reason to play the old content.
---
To make sure that we wont end up with WotLK 2.0, where ToC and IC virtually removed 80% of the game, the moment they got released.
---
To make sure that fundamental changes wont be made, and eventually screw the vanilla feel.
---
You ask them to essentially start working on 2 MMOS at the same time. Good luck.
---
Reading the undead description and opening experience really makes the undead look evil. Says they aren’t even that close to the horde and have their own nefarious plans essentially.
---
too cool, Thanks!!
---
I could see them not releasing it to later...but who knows. I would prefer phase 1 include ALL Ony/MC items. Which includes petrified leaf.
---
Right because they cant read/interpret values wrong, it's not like they crash every other day because of errors...
---
Maybe the dwarves are too short 😂
---
If you don’t have a stack of 300, you aren’t ready to raid
---
Upvoting too, would like to hear Blizzard on this.
---
Also, I never claimed to be a tryhard expert on warrior dps gear.
---
An Imp Lock is a Warlock who has been assigned the duty of keeping their imp out in the tank group to provide Blood Pacts stamina buff.
---
Most people simply put the imp into Phase Shift where it can't be damaged and write it off in favour of a slightly adjusted SM-Ruin build, but that's wasted potential. What you can do is go for an build like [this] (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IEMb0obZfhVZxxbtM0z) which in addition to trinkets like the arcanite dragonling (stacking debuff that adds flat damage to all fire spells) turns your imp into an absolute machine gun. Can't do it in MC of course because fire immunity, but once you get out of there and into raids where you're alongside Fire mages it gets pretty spicy.
---
Nonsense. Why aren't they fixing all the other vanilla problems in that thread then?
---
Not sure if significantly would ever happen, but at minimum, I'm not sure why they wouldn't try to re-create the Blizzlike difficulty experience with buffed itemization and 1.12 talents.
---
They had a centralized database of the values of items on that server over time, what things sold for, and how they sold, they could auto-populate values a little high (profit) or a little lower (undercut).
---
It even had a market speculation feature, which tied back to *who* was posting the auctions, so you could ruin a specific player's auctions if you wanted to.
---
My memory is a little hazy on the functionality added at the end, but I *do* remember posts about "how to ruin your enemies in the market with Auctioneer".
---
Where are you getting two months form, last I read it's was a few weeks too 1 month.
---
Yep, because communication breeds friendship!
---
49 or gtfo imo
---
Holy shit Mograine coming in to save his lady
---
That is interesting, launch day will still be a shit show and if you dont get ahead of the pack it will remain as shit show for a while.
---
Yeah, I’ve played all the way up to 39 but have been drawn back to the lower ones simply because of the amazing community (visit XPOff if you haven’t) 
---
Can’t wait to get back together with old friends
---
That’s what I’m talking about! I’ll be going shaman.
---
That's a good idea. A lot of the groups are formed near resting zones anyway and it prevents excess node hopping.
---
... I’m that healer! But nah I just say “let me mana up” since talking is part of it all.
---
and his opponents are garbage? man this guy.... no manner at all!
---
Definitely. Warriors suck compared to other classes (like warlocks, hunters, rogues) with shit gear, but become godlike with great gear.
---
I’ll give it a look, thanks! If you ever get back into 39 let me know!
---
Ummm no it was their flag carrier. Enemy flag was not shown. Even Esfan and StaySafe said multiple times they didn’t know where enemy fc was.
---
maybe during a stress test if you are on that. Or give to friend whois and ask them. Otherwise, maybe test them on retail. That will get you most of the way, and refine once you have access.
---
Of all the things to lie about, and for all the reasons, that would have to be the silliest. I'm wracking my mind trying to connect with this logic.
---
I really liked this explanation in a thread about how hard BWL is going to be:
---
&gt; “...it's funny when people keep saying that you can join a casual guild that will bring players with unviable specs. Yes, you technically can, and you might even get carried through most/all of MC and Onyxia. But once you get stuck on a boss like Vael for a few weeks the "try-hard" clique of the guild will start pointing out the DPS below the tanks. Which inevitably leads to losing those tryhards or to losing those players with unviable specs (either respecing or not inviting them). Casual guilds will already have a harder time clearing content, why would they purposely make it even harder by bringing dead weight specs.”
---
Private servers had too small gnomes then?
---
49 bracket was what my friends and I did for years.   At 19/29 it is just about who insta gibs the other guy first... not my cup of tea.
---
When I visited a museum in Italy during Wrath times, the ticket-seller was doing her Icecrown dailies.
---
Fights in mid the entire game, never tries to get flag with team, gets mad when he loses. Pepega
---

"We tested it. It's really fine. Don't check."
---
Mods, can we start cleaning up this crap? I get that these streamers are just meme’ing for attention since everyone knows the majority of us were cleaning this stuff when these guys were still 6, but all this world first crap just needs to get deleted, or relegated to their own /r page.
---
Stop, chop. Just stop.
---
4 months is a long time. A productive player can get to level 60, sort out their professions, epic mount and pre-bis with time to spare.
---
And it sounds like phase 3 will take longer than 4 months.
---
And worlds second loss
---
&gt; Did the private server from which the screen shot was taken ever explicitly claim that their gnome scaling was 100% accurate with vanilla?
---
......ya
---
Most of demonology talents dont matter where they are spent so imp imp talent is there for nothing during raids. Threat shouldnt be an issue as a warlock, never had any issues. You either get salvation or totem to reduce it.
---
Can't remember how long it lasted, but yea.  People would only do 10 man scholo/strat due to how much easier/faster it made them.
---
No headset?
---
My very first toon in WoW was a Dwarf Hunter, I then made a Gnome Warrior for the hilarity of the situation and got as far as off tanking MC but I had such a crappy computer that I'd lag and disconnect and wipe the raid sometimes, I knew I was going to have to end up playing predominantly solo, so to keep interest in the game I leveled a human warlock as well.
---
Then my guild which had come over from DAOC blew up, and I went Horde with some RL friends and have been there ever since. I xfered my original hunter to another server(mistake, had to rename him and it doesn't "feel" like the old Tankbuster that I fondly remembered) got him to 120 and unlocked Dark Irons. I've rolled a DH on each side, and I like the class mechanics(at least to 108), but I just cant stand "being" an elf, no matter how warped. If I could be a Troll DH, I'd be all over it. So, I'm back on Horde side, leveling a few ZTrolls in classes that I haven't played yet. I have no idea what I'm going to play in Classic, maybe an Orc Warlock since my current toons are almost all Trolls(1 UD hunter and 1 Mag Har warrior)

I twinked rogue and Hunter at 19, 29, 39, and 49. For some reason Hunter just feels like shit after all this time though
---
Nothing wrong with massive raid battles like that and all respect to everyone who plans on doing that but that's just not what I have in mind...
---
I never once said you can’t. I said within those activities. Don’t strawman my argument to fight it. Guilds were the same in all stages of the game, and I have been apart of many great and many bad guilds in my time. But that wasn’t the topic.
---
The point was, lfr but mostly lfg removed spontaneous friends that a slower paced, server dependent grouping experience created. You want to disagree with that, by all means.
---
I mean of course they did, is anyone actually surprised by this?
---
Obviously never like pserver with 5 seconds or some shit, but going from 6½ min to say 2-4 minutes happened all the time.
---
Message to Blizzard inc. : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdtKbq3Omkw
---
I updated my comment with Retail vs Beta screenshots. There is not a 5.6 inch difference between the models and there should be!
---
wouldn't a private server using the original client display this behaviour? nameplate distance would probably be an entirely client side thing afterall (the console command to get a similar result might be different mind)
---
This is really good
---
... no it doesn't. You can load the models into a 3rd party program and they're perfect. You have no idea how asset packaging works.
---
There are classes that regularly top meters, and there are classes that provide the buffs (and debuffs) required to help those classes achieve those numbers. A rogue wouldn't achieve the numbers to top meters without a well balanced group with buffs from the shamans windfury, pally buffs, ect.
---
It's literally the game files, the server doesn't handle any of it, it's all on your own client.
---
Events like this were on many layers.
---
In my memory of classic, the main early quests with specific named mobs weren't too bad, you just grouped with people who were standing around waiting for the spawn (like the cougar in The Barrens north of Ratchet).
---
Nameplate range was more like 15 yards, actually. I just tested it.
---
Not warrior, that is for sure.  
---
Not only is the leveling process the longest and most tedious, but the end game requires you tank despite being arms/fury.  This means you need to learn how to be a decent damage dealer as well as learning how to tank.  
---
Granted, neither of those things are 'that' hard in vanilla, but still.
---
If you zoom in enough on any needle its flat.
---
he may have meant "it doesnt matter what i think, because the game will be how it is whether i like it or not"
---
Seriously dude?
---
Game is DOA with layering / sharding. Everyone knows how bad it is. Just more servers &amp; merge the servers if they die off. Stop being lazy.
---
&gt; Screenshot was from a pserver
---
Where are people getting this from? I don't think that's the case, and even if it was private servers do not change the model size, they'd have to go out of there way to edit the game files and then release a custom client. That's NOT how private servers work. They almost all run off the same version of the WoW client.
---
Nope, confirmed not happening
---
draw me like one of your french rogues
---
Streamers are basically just spam farming resource nodes by having people in their chat invite them to a different layer.
---
Economy is going to suck dick in classic.
---
This was such a holy shit moment for me!
---
Rockpounder those faces!
---
a later patch upped the minimum to 4
---
Maybe English isn't your first language, but I think stating "no one is a loser" is getting a bit off track. 
---
First, don't fret about fake internet popularity points.
---
Next: Compare these statements:
---
&gt; If everyone is a winner... then no one is a loser.
---
and 
---
&gt; If everyone's winning... then everyone loses.
---
They're distinct concepts, and one will be perceived as... well, whatever the internet perceives it as.
---
Wish I had friends like you
---
I cant even think of anything that would be a less of a waste than to use the optimal spec...
---
Found the alliance player eh?
---
They never did anything about this in current WoW sharding though, even in its earlier forms.
---
Frost Mages just spam frost bolt as far as I'm aware.
---
Fire Mages are slightly different in that every mage in the raid will all be feeding in to one shared Ignite debuff on the boss. Everybody waits for the best geared Mage to land a phat pyroblast crit to start ignite then eveyone else keeps it going by spamming scorch (which has higher crit %)
---
I wish people would have upvoted me when I said I was jealous.
---
That looks smaller than the beta.
---
The Privies are ruining Classic
---
It seemed like it was something they were set on. 
---
It's stupid though, they are trying to tell players how to play the game instead of just letting us play however we want, and the argument that rushing to 60 for epic mount is completely silly anyway. With regular patch schedule, each phase should last on average 3-4 months, that's plenty of time for anyone to take leveling slow, but also get unarmored mount. 
---
I bet it's gonna be in the in-game shop half a year down the line...
---
While a part of me wants long-range nameplates - and I saw the same result today testing some stuff out - I reported it earlier today too.  It needs to go.  It's not Vanilla.
---
It is clearly bis, but the benefit of it is extremely small compared to the work required. Focus on getting all your other gear first and hopefully you never get around to this.
---
Don't forget that more physical gold will be in the economy with 3~ instances of heavy farm spots active at any time.
---
Yeah I hear after AQ gear hunters and locks can top charts
---
Pretty nice. I would spend two points into Master Summoner so you can instantly summon a voidwalker for shields if you get ganked.
---
It took forever it seemed but I liked it better like that. It made it very rare to find someone fully PvP geared
---
They didn't have to adjust gnome size in the Black Morass for them to fix that issue.
---
Camera, yes, but you cannot change nameplate distance in 1.12 via any script command.
---
i prefer this. where u cannot see it behind objects.
---
If you got skill it's almost god tier. Saw my friend win 1v5 on wsg with bit of abuse of regen from hut and water from mage. He never stepped in a single raid with priest
---
Demonology talent "Fel Domination" with master summoner can make for a 0.5 second pet cast.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZbxhuR
---
I stopped reading at “trust me”.
---
Makes sense, actually accomplish something and not have blizzard give it to everyone later down the road .
---
wait the deeprun tram was actually a thing back in classic? obvious alliance bias on display here! the tauren did not get their zepplin untill what WOTLK?
---
In the entirety of my wow I was more horde than alliance, though its pretty close. Don't just assume people are biased.
---
It's 2 extra slots, deal with it.
---
Most excellent
---
Quin and Snutz had a talk in Quin's chat after these fights, it was really wholesome honestly. Quin was asking what he could do to stand a real chance. Snutz basically said that "I should win every time, 100%". After seeing this, I kind of understand why. The amount of shields he can get during one fight is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Really nostalgic video, absolutely loved it.
---
Well, for whatever reason, the model height of Gnomes in Classic Beta and Retail are the same and they shouldn't be.
---
By that logic they should also make Taurens smaller to prevent them from getting stuck in small huts and doorways.
---
How far did you get and how long did it take? Is blue pvp gear satisfying?
---
R14 is not possible for a normal/casual player.

Sharding the early zones wouldn't, however that's not what they are doing. They are sharding the whole world as you can clearly see from the clip. Silithus is a level 55+ zone...
---
The other guy already said it well, but I'l try to add a few more cents (bear with me It's friday, I'm drunk) even if you had the most talented people implementing stuff, it will still have oversights, and someone will exploit them. Sure WoW has a lot of stuff that could be fixed, but even the fixed versions would always be far from perfect.
---
Essentially the system means you have to farm more honor than others on your faction, that is all it is based on. So how difficult ranking is, depends entirely on the playerbase. If everyone is filthy normies that can only play a couple hours a day, then ranking won't require you to play more than that. If the playerbase has european welfare autists that plays 18 hours a day like me( /s) then you have to play 18h/day to rank. And this is not just "get top honor 1 week", no you need to beat almost everyone on your faction for weeks on end.
---
They were 15 and younger when it came out.
---
are u sure bout that XD
---
My first 60 was something like 13 days played lol
---
yeah, its on random redditors to come up with the solution, amirite? fucking moron. go back to retail
---
Sure. Let's pretend the way content is design has absolutely no influence on the way players interact with one another when doing that kind of content.
---
I have made 1 friend in modern wow since Cataclysm ( As in: People I still talk to after I stopped playing the game)
---
Meanwhile I still have a dozen people I interact with that I met in both Vanilla and TBC. When I started on private servers, guess what happened? Oh, I made friends again that I keep talking to even after I quit the server.
---
The reason is absolutely the way the game is designed. Faulting the players from not making friends when the game offers zero incentive to talk to anyone to complete 99% of the game is pretty disingenous.
---
Asmon is doing more for this game than you are
---
I was just saying make it a 5-6/h grind a day grind not 10-12.. Pve doesnt take this much grind why should pvp?
---
Did it get removed? how can you tell?
---
Not if you really wanna min/max your damage, as a mage your gonna use cone of cold and fireblast for single target too and as a warlock you will have to curse and banish plus maybe squeeze in a corruption as nightfall spec.
---
troll racial you can use on cooldown, wotf you can use when you need to break effect.  so one has more uptime and the other you can go a couple of play sessions and never use.  same with cannibalize, as a mage with unlimited food, it was mostly used as a flex in pvp.
---
tbh, I hated durator so I was either a tauren or undead.  place was just too damn orange.
---
I never knew this. That's really neat, thanks for the info!
---
you can't do the lamina quest without Azuregos though, since Blue Dragon Sinue doesn't exist until Phase 2 either way. (They only added it as a very rare world drop from elite blue dragons in 1.5, which would also put it at Phase 2).
---
yes, that one is just for the quiver, but it doesn't make sense to put in an incomplete quest chain before it's time.
---
I'm more curious to whether T2 will have a low chance to drop in MC until phase 2 begins. But based on their claim that they didn't want people rushing to get something before it's removed, it's likely they'll just keep the BWL pieces in BWL.
---
But stuff that was added later they definitely said would be coming later and drop tables re-jiggered for stuff that was moved around.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "WoW Commands"
---
The entire decline of retail is due to them catering to the casual gamer expo after expo
---
vanilla is anything \*but\* casual. It's harsh, immersion is big, you're forced to walk and run anywhere to get FPs etc, mounts are expensive, the game is tough.
---
The fact you're standing behind your assessment of calling it casual is pretty funny. Relative to retail it's hardcore
---
I sometimes get caught humming this to myself all these years later

There should be 5.6 inches difference between them.
---
this is amazing
---
5.6 inches is 14.22 cm
---
I used to play like 10 hours a day as a kid and it still seemed long, so take that for what u will. And I enjoyed pvping in greens, didn't matter what I had
---
I agree that this actually is an extremely unique scenario where Blizzard is involving the community in the decision making in an unprecedented way which just frustrates me even further when people say that there is no alternative to layering/phasing, that we have no choice, that layering is here to stay whether we like it or not, and when people on this sub totally bury posters who are justifiably worried about it.
---
Blizzard is full of the top talent in the gaming industry, literally the avant garde of programming. but they are also a business that will try and get away with the least amount of effort where they can, essentially min/maxing their resources in a way they think is optimal. Phasing is something that can and needs to be avoided at all costs imo, and it's my job as a consumer of the product to try and bring their attention to it.
---
I was venting my frustration with those people in general, not you specifically, my bad
---
No, again.  Old AV was in Vanilla too, but it was long gone by the time 1.12 rolled around.  Just like these mounts.
---
This is what WoW is all about about for me. Raids and PvP are just cherry on top.
---
I probably had no interaction with this mechanic being on a low population server, but some people from very high population servers might be more understanding of what he's talking about.  
---
All in all it's interesting.
---
well, has anyone tried fitting in any of the chimneys? as a gnome the normal house chimneys can be fit into only barely where nothing else besides cat form or size reductions can get you into one, and i don't think retail gnomes can fit.
---
Was a joke man
---
This is a good find, there SHOULD be a difference.
---
DS/Ruin out dps’s SM/Ruin, only reason to have sm/ruin is to have blood pact for MT
---
Most people consider "viable" in terms of damage dealt, and outside of MC, there arent any short fights. Besides, ret is completely viable, if the player puts in a little effort. :&lt;
---
As a long-time private server player I know what you're referring to. I definitely don't mean to assert that EVERY guild will blaze the content identically, as though it were *that* easy. There are definitely guilds out there probably playing at an ultra casual level and will maybe even be full of players who haven't even played vanilla proper, who will be clueless and of course it will take them time, even with strats available everywhere.
---
Yeah, I know you guys are right. I don't expect perfection at all, I just want the old party system back. No more being paired with random people from another server that you'll never see again, you know? The beta has proven how much people missed those social aspects that allowed you to work with people and make friends with people that play on your server, and likely to see them and talk to them again later down the line. It was a really cool feature that I know I can't be alone in missing!
---
It was 6 sentences Rofl. Gish Gallop actually refers to the number of arguments presented, not the quantity of content. It was all one argument. Good job spending 3 hours looking for that though, instead of actually trying to say anything of value.
---
Lock is an absolutely great PvP'er. Death Coil is one of the few interrupts/CC's that literally can't be dispelled (it has the code word "Horror" instead of "fear" so trinkets/racials can't be used to dispell it. 
---
Fear is an incredibly strong mechanic in general vs everything but Warrior -- especially if you're not going affliction (dots can break it early). They're naturally tanky, have solid regen and some wicked burst. They have two pets that shine both in 1v1 and group PvP (Succubus for control, Fel Hunter for dispells), have built in regen (healthstone), built in resurrection (soul stone). 
---
In massive fights, if you're affliction, you can just dot everyone and help focus down big targets / throw out saves with Fear/Death Coil/Seduce.
---
On top of that, they level almost as well / easily as hunters (pet to tank makes life great, built in regen with life tap + life drain), can easily farm multiple mobs at the same time with VW tank + dots + life drain + fear. 
---
I only played a priest to 32 in classic, and I leveled them as Disc because I was an idiot, I remember it being hard but would've probably had a better time as shadow. 
---
From my recollection spriest in PVP at level 60 was good, but not god tier. I think they ran a mixed disc/shadow build (could be wrong) and were definitely good, and became A-'ish tier in group PvP / arena because of their strong heals &amp; dispells. Very good SPriests were a force to be reckoned with, but from experience Warlock and Warrior were S+ tier (again, from memory, which is mediocre at best). 
---
tl;dr Warlock is really fun and incredibly strong in PvP, also if you end up doing PvE you're gonna want to play Warlock vs SPriest because not a lot of guilds are gonna bring a SPriest over a warlock, mage, or hunter for a ranged dps slot.
---
3d models are scaleable though, they are not pre-rendered, and I know there's gm commands on pservers to change the scale of models so it's possible the values the server uses when it plops the model into the world is wrong. If the client stored your size it would be easy to memory hack and sneak into all kinds of areas.

They're certainly trying to

Wait I thought you're suppose to "stick" to your layer and never see people phasing in and out, you pro-layerers can't make up your minds!
---
Hi, /u/AndleAnteater
---
I can’t remember. 
---
I never reached the top but I remember grinding up tor rank 10 which I think is Lt Commander on the alliance side.  IIRC this was the rank where you completed the Superior gear set for PvP, and back then blue gear was good gear. 
---
I think I got that fairly quickly within about a month or so casually playing on a Warlock and basically just sticking to AV.   Back then ranks would only update on the reset each week so there wasn’t really a lot of instant gratification and it was slow going.
---
10k is way too high though. Like, waaaaayyy too high. Even if you wanna speed up node respawn times, mob respawn times, etc. 
---
10k people on a vanilla server is just ridiculous.
---
What idiot would pay $15 a mo to pay the current iteration of the game?
---
No, it isnt. I play neither Warrior, Hunter or Lock and I agree that Ony bags go to tanks first because they definitely have to carry the most gear and consumables. Might be able to make a point for that one Lock who always bring tons of shards to support everyone but Hunters really not.
---
It will be available today but they’re gonna be “stress testing it” on those times basically
---
&gt;Nothing in the last few expansions feels as amazing as week after week saving up that dkp until chromaggus finally drops your last piece of t2 and you have that full set.
---
What I found hillarious is how in Retail, even if loot was as scarce as it was then. When the final piece of T2 dropped you would not even be happy about it. You would be mad the item did not titanforge instead.
---
Can you imagine a more backwards loot system? Essentially the game just feeds feeding you bad experiences from what should have been a happy moment.
---
It depends how blizzard does the mount system, it was changed in 1.12.
---
I'm not sure if blizzard has stated which one it's gonna be. But here's the differences:
---
1.12: Mounts are cheap, training is expensive, but it trains any kind of mount of that speed. Here you need exalted with a faction to purchase their mounts.
---
Pre 1.12, here the mounts are expensive, and actually BoE. The training is cheap however it only trains you how to ride your factions mounts. So you need a different training for a nightsaber, different for mechno etc, to train that you need exalted with the faction. So with pre 1.12 version you do need exalted with darnassus.
---
Are you asserting that the person who posted it was the person who provided the client for that private server? Because while I saw it posted, I never saw a claim that the poster developed it,  which is entirely different.       
---
           
---
A person could download a client to play on a private server *assuming* it's 100% blizz-like because the XP rates and drop rates are 1x, but they may not actually *know* that the original assets included in the client were genuine or original and devoid of tweaking.        
---
It's a bit on the conspiratorial side of things to suggest there might be some 'home-cooking' happening in the pserver clients that players don't  know about, but IMO it's no more unlikely than Blizzard gaslighting us on gnome size is.
---
If our voices are loud enough we might be able to reach the Devs and show that we, as a community, want to see these mounts in-game. I was disappointed to see their original stance on them but I am hopeful.
---
Weird,   
---
I cannot tell because I am the OP?
---
I actually loved Vashj'ir, that was one of my favorite parts of Cataclysm.
---
No, they really aren't.
---
[This is from Retail](https://i.imgur.com/xuNkfbR.png).
---
[This is from Classic Beta](https://i.imgur.com/SpViMj6.png).
---
But what concerns me now isn't Gnome height, but that the fact Blizzard sees fit to re-write history as they see fit and call it "correct".
---
No idea. I was just hoping it wasn’t because it didn’t end up being beta.
---
I don't even know how to parse this comment. You are way off base.
---
seen on stream:
---
The color of the flag alerts is wrong. The text should be red when an event that is good for horde happens (horde grabs ally flag, horde flag drops, etc), and it should be blue when an event that is good for alliance happens (ally grab horde flag, alliance flag drops or returns, etc).
---
Look you aren't gonna be finishing many quests at the starting zones
---
Can you find me literally any example of a private server that released their own custom client?
---
As far as I know, that's not even a thing, and has never been done. I'm not sure where you're getting that from, but a link would be great. 
---
Private servers run off the default WoW client 1.12
---
yea yea dude, woop woop.
---
because it came out during the era of the Quartet.
---
the Tank, the DPS, the Healer, the Support.
---
It was all fake. The whole thing was a satire of raiding guilds that overthink everything.
---
I'm not following...
---
&gt;If the client stored your size it would be easy to memory hack and sneak into all kinds of areas.
---
No that is serversided.
---
But yes they are scalable, but 1.0 scaling is client side and there's really no reason to think private servers somehow has wrong scaling. Also legion specifically changed the size of gnomes to the value that they are in the beta, so somehow gnomes got bigger in legion, but they are the same size in legion as they are on the beta. That's impossible, so you can prove it, without even using a pserver.

---
I think you mean for PvE, as they don't have paladins in the raid grp, but in PvP horde warlocks are actually superior because they don't have to worry about WotF.
---
No. It is the original one.
---
Shoulders. Head.
---
It's not even about the gear. It's more to do with how the likelihood of a wipe goes up exponentially as you add in more players.
---
Think Baron Geddon's bomb with 40 players stacked in the raid.
---
Or the pull of C'Thun with 40 players.
---
It only takes a single player not paying attention at the right time to wipe the entire raid. The mechanics themselves might be relatively simple compared to retail, but the difficulty of Vanilla was always in organizing and coordinating 40 players.
---
Pservers don't fit into this argument.
---
Sure let me find the logs from 15 years ago. 
---
/S
---
That doesn’t make much sense at all, the model size is client based and not server based
---
Wait wtf. I got in? I'm not going to get banned for this right? LOL
---
Players will be rushing to 60 if that's what they want to do regardless of these mounts being available. 
---
I totally agree with you. I really hope that we don't see them in an in-game shop -\_-
---
Trading cheap, mounts expensive is the way they're going with.
---
I thought that you were suppose to "stick" to your layer and rarely see people phasing in and out... can the pro-layering community make up your minds?
---
Either way, not seeing people on another servers is actually a good thing because it's more authentic to the classic experience, whereas phasing in and out is totally antithetical and foreign
---
Enemy's flag carrier position is show (which shouldn't be the case) but it's glitchy (is not shown/updated if the enemy flag carrier is not in sight range? if so might be working correctly server side but wrong client side). Hopefully someone can test whether the lua API is there or not, but probably need fix since it shows in the UI.
---
The idea of flooding it was neat. The implementation was not. They ruined this zone in retail.
---
And thats the great thing about vanilla, when the new raid tier comes out you still clear the old content. Nothing becomes totally obsolete unlike retail.
---
Someone else mentioned paladins effect in raid groups, but the original comment was geared towards PvE. If you are looking to PvP, horde warlocks are slightly better because none of their enemies (other than in duels) will have WotF
---
No, we're way off. That's 7/21/21 or more often called DS/ruin. When you said 0/21/30 I thought you might be talking about an SM/DS build which would give 25% total +shadow at the expensive of 0 points in destroying.

---
&gt;  If they have 5 million Classic players
---
Ya, right... Get real.   Let's jump back to reality, and talk about real numbers here.  10s of thousands would be an amazing success.
---
things needs to be hard, bad and working agenst the player base so that the player base feels a need to gather up inorder to fight the game properly. but not so hard it is impossible to go it alone. this is the balance vanilla and TBC struck and WotLK coasted on.
---
the game needs to be slow so that grouping up feels meaningful. the game needs to have just barely enough quests for leveling so grouping up and doing a dungeon feels worth it. etc. etc.
---
the benefit and push towards the social is so much smarter in classic than it is in BfA where it is just a system. an other huge issue with retail WoW that just dosen't exist in classic just due to how it is designed is that group content is all content while retail is effectivly solo content untill max level. even dungeons in retail are pretty much solo experiances.
---
In that case, yes OP will need to farm exalted with darn.
---
I mean, use your head man seriously. They spent a shit ton of time and resources to bring classic back. If they just set and forget, people will get bored and move on, basically being completely useless and a loss of profit. It doesn't make any sense. They launched classic with the hope of reviving WoW imo. Keeping it as vanilla for years is absolutely not the way to do that.
---
It's also terrible game design to have it completely stagnant where whatever class is strong remains strong, what sucks will always suck, what money making opportunities are insane are always insane, etc.
---
r14 for normal player - no. 0 % chance of that happening. You need to put at least 8 hours everyday doing battlegrounds non stop with full team ( probably wsg )
---
Yes it does. Models can be rendered in any arbitrary size.
---
"\*Alles\* hat ein Ende, nur \*die\* Wurst hat zwei"
---
close enough tho
---
I believe I recall a thread which pointed out that 1.12 pserver client didn't handle 1080p resolution natively, which caused it to look stretched. That could be it, simply wrong aspect ratio. It's fixed in classic, though.
---
It's a total joke.   Like I said, you outgear the content, and then it's a joke.
---
The point is you have no idea what the numbers are, so you can't decide if it is worth it or not.
---
Yeah I absolutely agree with that! And I know this sharding/layering or whatever they want to call it has problems, but so does unleashing 10 000 players on a single realm on launch as well. I honestly dont know if there is a solution that would appease everyone.
---
What are you not understanding? Walking around, expensive mounts etc. those are casual problems. 
---
Retail has way harder content like mythic raids/plus arena etc. Vanilla simply does not have those skill intensive challenges, the challenges are more along the casual side like leveling/early dungeons being tougher.
---
I am still in beta... but how do I check with this sub why my post was removed :\*(
---
Can't be arsed to put in the effort.
---
I like the drakedog x mute vids. World of roguecraft.
---
So will layers, you'll have to prove your layer was first when they merge with video evidence and time stamps just as you would on different servers as there are no announcements of client recorded achievements
---
Lol good point

My understanding is there was no incident (the things they're doing don't even make sense if you understand the mechanics). The whole thing was staged in order to satirize raiding guilds that overthink everything.
---
Maybe in a clockwork setting but in actual vanilla Locks will only pull ahead of mages in Naxx. During MC/Ony phase their biggest problem besides threat is that there is almost no +Spellhit gear available while mages get +6 hit from talents and Locks get none. Power Infusion goes to mages too because of threat problems. During AQ mages can go fire which gives them the edge again.
---
Atleast thats how it was on private servers, heres to hope that classic changes the meta up a bit.
---
They even mention in the article that this isn’t something for main tanking raids so that’s just irrelevant. Shamans are fine to tank for easier dungeons and as an off tank on some fights. If some guild wants to try it for fun then they are more than welcome to and I doubt they would be in your no-fun guild anyways.
---
i mean, only people who didnt play the game thought that this was real. just looking at their armor and weapons, you know that they have done this dungeon a lot of times.... hell, leeroy even has rend's weapon AND shoulders.
---
That's not jealousy.
---
It's bitterness

We need essays on layering on this sub Pepega

You shouldn’t if you don’t want to. Nobody is forcing you to play 16 hours a day, this kind of entitlement is how we got the current iteration of wow.

What's the source for it being a reenactment of a real event? It's always been described as a scripted satire. The tactics they discuss don't even make sense.

Oh! Is this that place where you plant a bomb on the flying machine in Southern Barrens?
---

---
Lady Vashj was originally sent out to help Illidan because the Old Gods saw him as a possible ally, he wasn't, and she didn't get the memo I guess.
---
It was the absolute bomb. It was the only time the Boomkin was viable
---
Yes but a much less invasive kind of layering that is more true to the classic wow experience and has none of the game breaking negative effects of phasing.
---
nah that's not it. we have lots of people who never played pserver before joining our guild (including me), and we killed Twins in the first raid evening (where ppl need to know what to do).
---
the real reason is 1.12 talents, 1.12 itemization (e.g. Bonereavers Edge), modern stable internet connection &amp; servers, and 14 years of Meta development. **That's** what makes the difference
---
&gt;If at some point Classic becomes so dead that there are barely enough people in the whole game to fill 2 servers, THEN discuss new content (whether post-Naxx or TBC), but post-Naxx content will not be needed for 99% of players for a LONG time because it will take them a while just to reach it, and the top 1% do not represent the entire game.
---
3rd paragraph from the bottom. I am essentially saying that most people will not be able to complete endgame content within a couple of years - we do not need to discuss post-Naxx content right now because the only people who want it NOW are people who will blow through endgame as soon as it's out, which is only a few of them.
---
The server can change the scale of models. This is why some mobs (eg. Herod in SM) are bigger than others despite having the same model. Presumably the same thing is done to gnomes; if I had to guess, all gnomes have their scale multiplier set to more than 1 server-side, and private servers failed to do this so their gnomes are smaller than they should be (ie. whatever base size the model has).
---
Pserver 1.12 doesn't have proper widescreen support.
---
A few locks can use corruption as well, depends on your debuff use. I guess horde can use more because they don't have paladins with seal of wisdom and light. You also have your curse to throw; shadows, elements and recklessness and you can almost always multidot a bit since most bosses have adds. 
---
Frost mages pretty much only spam frost bolt. They do have to manage their mana though, using gems on cooldown and mana pots/evocation etc. If you spec into Arcane/Frost then you have a cooldown as well in Arcane Power and Presence of Mind.
---
Fire mages are a bit difference. Scorch makes the target take extra damage and stacks to five, so every mage will have to keep it up or you'll lose a lot of damage. When things are hectic this can happen a lot, or if the boss teleports etc. Then you have the ignite. Hardcore guilds plan their ignites on the best mages so it grows the most. Most guilds just let it handle itself and distribute the ignite on the combat log website ([Legacyplayers.com](https://Legacyplayers.com)). You also have to be careful with threat and since you can't personally stop the ignite you have to yell into raid comms that all mages have to stop casting fire spells.
---
Did you happen to see the stress tests at all the other day? There was around 6000 people all in the same area, and while it did initially lag a bit, eventually it actually balanced and was running flawlessly. I was really impressed.
---
Yep!
---
Models can be scaled, so it’s possible the picture from yesterday showed a scaled gnome as reference
---
Model height is not stored server side.
---
technically they raised the dungeon difficulty of Scholo and Strath. They needed more people originally but were fairly simple in execution (even for vanilla). The revamped versions had more difficult pulls and forced you into a smaller amount of people to do it with.
---
Literally months of People QQing that they'd made them impossible for people without raid gear to run.
---
It really doesn't even matter tbh.  They won't do both, because it's redundant, and it would cost more money.   The current iteration of Acctivision blizz is money hungry.  That's all they care about now.
---
Why don't you think their's a standalone sub just for classic?   Cuz they want that money.   If they made classic standalone $5 a month, then they would lose a lot of subs from retail &amp; that means a lot of microtransaction sales too.
---
I’m proud of him for trying. Maybe more practice and gear and he would have been better.
---
I quite liked it too, the soundtrack is fantastic as well!
---
Not really. You need 2-3 geared tanks for the front horsemen to take the damage. Otherwise it's just about not getting taunts resisted. You can do this by farming Nat Pagle's Broken Reel from ZG for months and months before Naxx opens, something you could not do in Vanilla as nobody knew about 4HM until the raid actually opened.

One of my favorite world PVP moments happened here in 2006. 
---
I was playing my orc warrior, level 34 at the time. I came upon the goblin/gnome race track questing area and found a 50 something horde fighting off a ?? Alliance and a late 20s alliance. I charged the one in the late 20s range and killed him. Meanwhile the ?? Alliance killed my horse friend and turned his gaze to me. However, his health was quite low and I was nearly full. After a few smart button presses and licking out by not missing him, I killed him and avenged my horse brother. 
---
Ah, good times.
---
Unlike AV which was patched and changed, these mounts were still in Players' inventories and being used throughout Azeroth in 1.12. I understand where you're coming from though, but I personally hope the Devs don't take this approach.

The word *epic* sure has lost its meaning, hasn't it?

---
To make the comparison a bit easier, I recreated the 1.12 screenshot (maybe on the same server as the original, I dunno) at the same angle and brightened both pics. That way you can just swap between tabs to see the difference. [Beta](https://i.imgur.com/9iOueto.png) / [1.12](https://i.imgur.com/Jjs8sBf.png)
---
You are right. Like both of you I am also an OG (Original Gamer) and this possible inexact depiction of gnome height by private server stealing Blizzard intellectual property completly ruined my classic wow experience. I have cancelled my subscription, destroyed my old collector box and won't be playing in august.
---
Quick question, Only because I see this a lot. How exactly are "Privies" trying to ruin Classic? They are bringing forth issues regardless if they are wrong. This causes Blizzard to have to rethink / reevaluate certain things which is a good thing.
---
How do you think Elixir of Giant Growth makes you bigger, or some mobs are bigger/smaller than others? The server can change the model size.
---
But the model can be scaled up or down. Ie. those clips of Omar from the stress test
---
Create a post on this forum and ask for help. Give access to your addon to randoms :D
---
Most pservers can use any vanilla 1.12.1 client just edit the server list file.
---
I mean not every raid group needs to be the fully optimal machine with the only goal to clear content as fast possible. Some people like to be creative and have more fun with their class. Cookie cutter builds are fun too though
---
What, like four people?  It wasn't possible to get that version of the mount in 1.12.
---
I wouldnt know but if you can make your friends my friends, I can let you know ASAP
---
\*wink\*
---
Ascension I think.
---
You can change a models size on the server side. When you drink a shrinking/size increasing potion you just make to model larger too, its not like thats a seperate model.
---
&gt;Those same people wouldn't get past the firelords in MC lmao.
---
Someone is going to be very disappointed in Classic.
---
Its very close with Orcs being slightly better in PVP but undeads looking better in general :D
---
I don't think that's the case though, and even if it was, private servers do not change the model size, they'd have to go out of there way to edit the game files and then release a custom client. That's just not how private servers work. They almost all run off the same version of the WoW client. [1.12.1](https://www.google.com/search?q=WoW+client+1.12.1&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS842US842&amp;oq=wow+client&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i61j69i60.8462j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)
---
People seem to forget that the game managed to survive for several expansions before sharding was a thing.  People dealt with it.  They understood what was going on and lived with it.  Blizzard has had massive launches before without sharding and they should have done that again with Classic.
---
Its really cool you guys still have comments from way back in 2005-2006. You guys do amazing work!
---
People will just say “pservers are wrong”. Better to compare Retail to the Beta like above.
---
I have seen a girl on twitch who got on with F&amp;F but I also read on the forums people not making despite being part of such group.   
---
How do you even make it on there in the first place, are friend of friends eligible, can I be your friend.
---
Linkin Park isn't a trigger warning. The trigger warning is that the music is loud even at minimum volume.
---
That's why private servers still have thousands play on them with the same content that was released 13 years ago. C'mon man, you want new content then play modern. (Is that what were calling it now?)
---
Glory to the Forsaken!
---
Ion talked about wanting to put it in for a limited time
---
No way to tell if your invite to beta was specifically from F&amp;F list. However, I have been on my friend's (who is employee at Blizzard) list since circa 2014/15. I have been invited to most beta's upon release since that date.   
---
It was mid afternoon yesterday when I was invited to the WoW: Classic beta.
---
And what if "as long as necessary" is 6 months?  A year?
---
Im joking
---
been seeing that guy regularly on Asmons stream. He popped off in Armory too
---
Can’t they just run a GM command or something?
---
How did the dev increase his model size on the stress test a few days ago?
---
This may seem rude, but you’re able to have fun with the game and try unique things.
---
Locks can if the MT can hold threat. The hunters are a sad story. On private servers with progressive itemisation they can top dps in MC and most of BWL and when the mages/locks/warriors/rogues start to get hit in late BWL and especially AQ the hunters are doomed. 
---
On Classic however, there won't be progressive itemisation, so the warriors and rogues can go in and get super powerful items from PvP (only rank 10 needed really) and they will easily be on top from MC to Naxx.
---
&gt; Really sucks this guy is the president of Blizzard. 
---
I don't think any CEO would want his current product get embarrassed by a 15 year old version. 
---
If Classic is a hit, Blizzard have a bit of a problem on their hands. I personally think this could be the beginning of a very tough few years for Blizzard if Classic does well. It's a suicide move from a business standpoint.
---
Get a new mousepad and clean your fucking keyboard.
---
&gt; It really doesn't even matter tbh. They won't do both, because it's redundant, and it would cost more money. The current iteration of Acctivision blizz is money hungry. That's all they care about now.
---
It's not any more "redundant" to have BFA along side Classic, than it is to have another progression server for Classic &gt; TBC, or Classic &gt; New Content.  You don't actually have an argument here, you're just arguing for the sake of it.  You just wanted to show up and bitch about this guy's idea.  
---
&gt; Why don't you think their's a standalone sub just for classic? Cuz they want that money. If they made classic standalone $5 a month, then they would lose a lot of subs from retail &amp; that means a lot of microtransaction sales too.
---
It would be dumb to have a stand alone sub for it.  There is no reason to.  We paid $15/mo back in the day to play Classic.  There's no reason they should decide to make it cheaper for people who want it now. \#nochanges amirite?
---
You get SM in the affliction tree though so it would be more like 30/21/0
---
Obviously the actual issue is that dwarves are too short. ^/s
---
What would be the point of permanently scaling them server side?  Wouldn’t blizzard just send out a client hotfix to change the scale in the client instead?
---
Eventually in a year or so? Yeah, I'd like at least something. I'm not hyped for an "official private server".
---
Why? The success of classic isn't just going to make them do more classic.
---
If it's so extreme that Classic retains players better than BFA despite all their recent efforts toward player retention they'll completely re-evaluate what they're doing.
---
People have been telling them, this would show them.
---
Last night purely for people going to check tomorrow don't mind it :)
---
Jesus, fanboy less.
---
yes, i really can't think of one zone from cat i like better than old world. they should have just fixed quests like escort quests and made the world ready for flight. with flight the "tedious" quests become quite doable.
---
They have block/dodge talents and earth shock/rock biter for threat. Unfortunately no taunt outside of stone claw totem
---
na you can see the enemy flag carrier on the map
---
What is the problem? That you are on a 2500 player realm with people that will continue playing?
---
He fucked bro.... he fucked
---
I see your point here, but what happens in 5 years when no content has been introduced and everyone is bored of the same loop? What if, instead of letting it die due to inactivity, they reintroduced content from future expansion but maintained the bare bones basic feeling that vanilla offered? I don't see any downside to doing this.
---
Tell her to go to a marriage counselor.
---
Yes it is. WoW is really good at using the same models for different characters over and over with different color and size. Stop with the bullshit already.
---
They can, but why would they? I don’t doubt blizzard is right I’m just wondering what’s going on here
---
As much as I want authenticity, Nameplates are one of the things that personally annoy me. I can't stand not having them on, and the difference in distance is just an annoyance for me in Vanilla. So much so that when I'm in the usual (retail) distance of a mob and I can't see it on Vanilla I end up pressing V and turning them off/on/off/on because I expect them to be there. Bleh.
---
ALSO...your trinket summons are based on your total engineering skill.
---
So your battle chickens and summoned dragonlings would be level 63 instead of 60 like a 300 cap engineers would.
---
that is impressive then, the exploration XP alone would be a challenge.  I think you're right sometime late in WOTLK was when XP could be turned off.
---
hey, hey!... I liked ashran… but yes, you're right.
---
Classic+ is pretty much WoW 2, i doubt blizzard will make 2 MMOS at the same time. And without a dedicated team, that Classic+ will derail, listening to the player base isn't always a good thing. I mean, it led to BFA. Therefore Classic+ will require even harder work than retail to keep both fresh and "vanilla".
---
If you have 2 servers filled with people, then the game isn't dead. Dead means not enough people to form a group.
---
Fresh servers for those who want to start anew, every 3 year is IMO the best solution. Let these follow the same content release plan as classic will.
---
It's simply ludicrous to expect this game to get new content without replacing the old one, keep the vanilla spirit and never change fundamentals, such as balance (to keep the RPG aspect) and itemization. If they make the mistake to release something harder than Naxx and with better gear, then powercreep and catch up mechanics are inevitable. If that happens we are on the way to BFA.
---
Even a bad dungeon or alternate gearing process could pretty much introduce ToC/IC version 2, you do remember what those did, did you? Most of WotLK content died that day.
---
To prevent this, they will need to essentially hire a whole new team to pretty much make a second MMO. Either this, or we are screwed.
---
There is no such thing as servers for everyone, no matter how you cut it, you need a dedicated team of game designers to make sure that they don't screw up by trying to make EVERYONE happy. 
---
They did it once and that's why people are skeptical.
---
This is an entirely ignorant comment. Your idea is that you have to go full tank or bust or your not serious enough to do it. He was never arguing that we need to see purely shaman tanks everywhere in the game, but if YOU want to do it, here’s how. Sorry that offends you so much.
---
When WSG ends, you're supposed to be teleported to the place that the BG was queued from.
---
&gt;Blackcrow
---
made me laugh soo hard :D
---
Ironic considering what just happened...
---
You realise there's a dozen different items/potions/buffs that change the size of your character? You realise that there are hundreds of mobs that have identical models but are of vastly different size?
---
The server can change the scale of every character on the fly arbitrarily.
---
Hi, /u/wakeor
---
Sorry but I don't even respond to bullshit like this.
---
I'll link my post earlier: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsg3a3/vanilla_addiction_take_care/  
---
My addiction is definitely back that's for sure, probably worth them setting boundaries
---
It was changed in 1.12.1, Blizzard is using 1.12 hence this change will never be put into place(it will always use the old system)
---
I'm not bitter at all! I'm super stoked for the release date and honestly am looking forward to starting fresh, I just love battlegrounds :)
---
I don't think it works like that. I think you have to be "registered" for every game, because otherwise it can cause weird complications of them having to track down those benefitting off a F&amp;F invite of an employee who left.
---
I was in the Overwatch Closed beta via F&amp;F, but I am not in yet.
---
However, a different friend added me he said on Tuesday to the list when I specifically mentioned WoW Classic being the reason.
---
What it comes down to is if he cares about his marriage or wow more
---
I'm confused now you said it's client side then you agree with me in saying it's server side and then say it's actually client side? How I'm reading it anyway. But regardless scale/size is handled server side, not sure why you are so adamant about thinking otherwise, is there a source or is this an assumption?
---
Yes. They are op even with epic mounts chasing them.  At 30 a fapped Druid will be untouchable.
---
There's a level of insecurity in that man's refusal to believe that some players of a certain class might beat other players of another class. We're going to need a professional to work with him.
---
See 3rd paragraph from the bottom:
---
&gt;If at some point Classic becomes so dead that there are barely enough people in the whole game to fill 2 servers, THEN discuss new content (whether post-Naxx or TBC), but post-Naxx content will not be needed for 99% of players for a LONG time because it will take them a while just to reach it, and the top 1% do not represent the entire game. 
---
The point I'm making is there is no point of discussing post-Naxx content now, it will take the majority of the playerbase a long time to reach Naxx, so let that happen, instead of releasing it earlier to appease the top 5% who got bored.
---
\&gt;  Because everyone that picked Server 1 will only ever be able to play with people on Server 1 even with layering going on. 
---
I thought that you were suppose to "Stick" to your layer and hardly ever see people phasing in and out? Doesn't this point imply the exact opposite?
---
\&gt; If I pick server 2 because I wanted to avoid streamers that were on server 1, then 2 months later blizzard tells everyone, "oh hey server 1 and server 2 are merging together" have fun it's going to annoy people 
---
They could just make battlegroups of servers that are guaranteed to merge before the game even launches, giving people a lot of time in advance to plan ahead. They would share the same naming server so all of those problems you mentioned wouldn't exist. It's essentially layering, minus the negative effects of phasing.
---
I'm sorry I have limited time to play. This takes a lot of commitment.
---
DELETE THIS
---
Personally just having someone there who wants to tank and has put in their work to optimize their character to do so has deserved the chance to try. Sure a warr would be better, but what if one of them wants to dps for the night? Fine, let the shaman try. Could be a fun time.
---
Thanks! We went back and added all the Thottbot and Allakhazam comments from that range to our Classic pages too :)
---
It's just a beta m8
---
This. Why is no layering such an unpopular opinion? I understand that the no-changes crowd can be made fun of, but layering is a HUGE change! People should be more vocal about their opposition to it.
---
I'll have a 19 Hunter, a 29 rogue or warrior, a 39 druid, and a 49 priest. All alliance because PvP server.
---
Loch Modan
---
That's some good insight actually
---
You have a friend or family member that works at Blizzard. There is a specific email the employee uses to get you onto the list. They collect your battlenet info and then you wait.
---
If she is a popular streamer, there is a chance she got to work with someone directly who can manually flag someone faster. (IE, someone on the marketing team that might be active in looking for influencers that can quickly flag someone)
---
Yeah, except DS/Emberstorm makes minimal sense, so I thought maybe that's where he was going.
---
Widescreen support doesn't magically make gnomes taller in comparison to dwarves. That's not even an argument.
---
Yeah after some experimenting on servers that shall not be named it appears that in 1.12.1 client the gnome is smaller in size but when jumping to 2.4.3 client, the gnome is now exactly the way it is in Classic beta. I don't know how a whole model can be smaller but somehow it is. Maybe the old client is messed up on modern systems? This is a good example of how we cannot trust private servers.
---
Yes but the base size is the same. You can modify size yes. But are you actually suggesting that private server has been modifying gnomes to be smaller for all time, and that somehow the legion change to increase size of gnomes that made them exactly the size they are in the beta is just a coincidence?
---
If your wife doesn't have sex with you just because you asked her to check a video game for you then you have bigger issues going on
---
And tbh, I would have fun trying to lvl up on a mega server like that, but I understand that it wouldn't really work
---
While you're at it, try to connect with logic why they ruined the most successful game franchise over the last decade. 
---
Blizzard is full of shit. When have they not been?
---
Blame that game store.
---
What? Probably 1% of pvp playerbase had r14 and the gear that comes from that, i am just sayimg why cant it be 10%? Wich is still not even close to what we have today..
---
Since its Horde themed, how about "Barrens Roads" instead?
---
Yeah it's definitely pre-bc patch because the mage has Water elemental as well. Those talents were added just before BC.
---
It's not confirmed until Blizzard blue post confirms it by checking with the reference version.
---
I am - and I will not be able to no-life it, so my only hope of seeing Naxx is if it stays stagnant long enough so people like me can reach it at our own pace.
---
Be that as it may, the easier route is not always the best one. Blizzard is full of genius level talent and a lot of resources, surely they could figure something out. This isn't a totally impossible feat, I've seen other MMOs with  much smaller companies backing their projects pull it off.
---
Usually you have one Lock go SM/Ruin (31/0/21) to provide the Imp buff to the tank group. The spec that you linked is the go-to raidspec for Locks in vanilla as it has the highest single target DPS. By the way 3 points in imp corruption is bit weird, you probably want 5/5 Supression so your curses/banishes resist less. And maybe 1 more point in destructive reach so you can outrange certain boss mechanics.
---
No. 
---
Blizzard is using 1.12.1 people just say 1.12 for short.
---
The gnome is smaller in 1.12.1 but bigger in 2.4.3 (same size as classic beta). Something is going wrong with the vanilla client for some reason.
---
When i did keto i spent a majority of my time shitting so only recommended if youre playing a laptop setup. I can attest to the sustained energy though.
---
That being said i dont think this is the place to talk about keto
---
Or you know... they launched classic to get more players, since it's one subscription for both classic and Retail? The moment classic releases, they will get back what they spent making it, tenfold.
---
And game won't die, dont worry. Pservers and countless classic games are alive and well up to this day. If you are fan, you don't need million people, you need enough. And enough will always be there.
---
Idk if you’re trolling or just genuinely retarded, either way it’s not going to happen.
---
Shiiiieeeettt..
---
The base size is client, but yes the server can scale it.
---
Uhhh Yeah..... if you think Classic is more casual than retail then you’re in a world of your own mate
---
That you leveled with spectral players randomly vanishing in and out of sight.
---
That by the time you hit 30, you've not consistently seen players that are on the same journey you are because you've been cycling through layers instead of cohabiting the same world.
---
That only when you've finally started to finish your journey to level cap, you've realized that you don't know the world you're in because nobody was there.
---
Its pretty clear they are using the Legion model.  Don't people remember when they posted the job listing for an artist to recreate the Vanilla character animations?  They are using the Legion Gnome with Vanilla animations.
---
I'd be willing to accept their 1.12 client for most stuff, but this sort of thing is starting to make me question how accurate it was. There's screenshots of gnomes in vanilla. It's not like this is something nobody can check and we have to trust them. this is just a visual thing. It's actually the one thing we definitely CAN check.
---
You have to remember that there are other gnomes in the world other than player characters. It is a possibility that Blizzard used a base model size, then used a multiplier on PCs to make them more pronounced from other gnomes (or at least, that might've been their intention - I don't know if they actually did that).
---
Hi, /u/lolfade
---
Then it will, if you’re in a hurry, get ahead of the pack
---
Your English "is" considerably better. use "are" if you're talking about more than one thing. :) I'm sorry I had to! Your English is awesome!
---
Give him time. Mechanical players like the ace pvpers adapt very fast.
---
Plus they have time on their side...all they do is play
---
Yes, but those are only temporary and not persistent. So after re-logging or re-launching, they'd be at original size again.
---
I am a digital manufacturing engineer, the only one at my company. I create digital models of manufacturing plants and use machine learning to optimize them. I do a lot of back end work and the others on my team create visualizations and GUIs, and handle operational training of the project deliverables.  I visit the plants for a few days when I start and finish a project and then work remote the rest of the time. 
---
The "special projects" guy that requisitioned my position experimented with how to do projects and got an idea of how long it should take to complete them (3-6 months depending on complexity). We use a licensed software.
---
I wrote a bunch of programs to automate my work by extracting and organizing information from existing plant informational databases. I reduced the development time from 3-6 months to 3-6 weeks.
---
Now I just chill at home 2/3 of the time and do whatever I want. Ive tried completing projects somewhat earlier, but my teams takes longer to do their parts so I'm not the bottleneck. They're always impressed when I'm done a week or two early (in reality I finished months ago).
---
You make a good point, but I'm pretty sure they were trying to put as many people as possible in the same area on purpose to see if the server will stay up. Not to mention there were a few Twitch streamers on there, so I'm sure a lot of the beta audience was drawn to follow them.  I'm with you, I hope classic isn't that crowded on release. Gonna have to try a few servers and see what it's like.
---
how does 1 get it? i never played wow and classic will be something great, i am sure ill play warrior with my friends, and UD mage when we dont play together but not sure what race the warrior is going to be..
---
I don’t think you’re right. It is supposed to end a month in. That doesn’t sound like long term tability to me. It sounds like overpopulation at launch.
---
You’re wrong. The distance is set in the client and not possible to change from the API. Was increased much later.
---
The server can tell the client something I'd a certain type, or someone has a certain effect. Putting presentation logic in the backend of a frontend-heavy application is bad practice.
---
Well, from what I remember it got me into the Diablo 3 Necromancer expansion (not something I specifically requested) got me into Legion Alpha, Legion Beta, BFA Alpha, and BFA Beta.   
---
I just have every game checked in my Beta Preferences list.
---
Context?
---
Someone has too much faith in humanity :p
---
Ah good old 2004-blizzard, back when they still had a genuine love for making a game. 
---
Now it would be: 
---
"Oh yeah take all the time you want leveling, don't rush at all to endgame, the longer you ~~sub for~~ enjoy the game, the more ~~money that goes into our pocket~~ fun you will have! Have any ideas for content that needs even more time gating? Please let us know on our forums!"
---
Was watching a live stream BG. Are enemy name plates supposed to show through walls and structures? I don't remember it being like that during vanilla, only visible enemies.
---
I feel like you're the minority then. Since the classic community has been screaming for an official private server for almost 13 years
---
I had a friend add me to their list about a week ago. Haven't received an invite yet. Not helpful to know, but at least you know you're no the only one :)
---
The Warsong gulch transparent minimap overlay.  Was not in Vanilla.
---
Yeah it's been a while but pretty confident this was before AQ was released.
---
This is actually a fallacy called an appeal to authority. If we only let experts discuss the fields or subjects in which they are experts, the world would be in disarray. You have to point out where exactly my understanding of the technical aspects of servers architecture is, not just say "well you're not a server engineer so you're not allowed to discuss this" - because using that logic, neither are you.
---
it was literally a 10 minute $10 or $15 fix.
---
You started twinking at level 1, just in case. Then you get a friend or pay someone too boost you through the dungeons. I spent almost 2000 gold in TBC into making my level 19 twink Rogue instead of putting it towards my epic flying.
---
Savage
---
Why not just level to 10 and have someone in Darnassus queue you into WSG? That should land you at their battlemasters, and you'll be able to breeze through the starting zone quests.
---
There is a thread comparing sizes of gnomes, they say Gnomea are too big, bigger than they were in vanilla. Blizzard says gnomes are the correct size.
---
Presumably they couldn't change the base model size clientside without replacing the model itself (which would've required a sizeable download because of the way the data was packaged in the client, I think), so they went with the easier option which was simply rescaling all gnomes server-side.
---
"Server-side" is a bit of a misnomer here anyway. All it means is that it's part of the data that's sent to the client by the server (and then cached), rather than being built into the client.
---
Just like almost every other private server value: they guessed. Older servers probably guessed the model scale and every server since has likely just used that same model scale and assumed it was right because how could they prove if they were right/wrong? None of them had an actual original vanilla reference client/database to base things off.
---
It sounds similar to what TSM does today, does it not? I don’t know much about those addons.
---
found the shit tier player
---
As a Night Elf, you don't need Exalted to learn sabercat riding. And Blizzard has stated that they'll using cheap training, expensive mounts in Classic. In actual Vanilla, the riding skill system was changed during 1.12 (generic skill, cheap mounts, expensive training), but apparently this change was done as part of the groundwork to prepare for TBC, so they're reverting that particular change for Classic.
---
Currently in Beta they appear to have the old system where mounts are Bind on Use and riding is mount-specific.
---
You just ruined that for me.
---
I was thinking mostly for leveling I suppose. I was referencing a melderon video ( which now that I've rewatched it, I realized that I remembered it totally wrong). 
---
Here's the video I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ
---
If you skip to around 35min mark, he talks about DPS and the different damage out puts of each shaman weapon buff.
---
probably cause the vast majority of people werent questing.   
---
If everyone present on those layers--at least during the first two hours when I was on--was trying to kill wolves, itd take a whole hell of a lot longer than 45 min to get out.
---
Someone had an old screen cap and w new screen cap exactly as OP describes, and gnomes were smaller before.
---
Well personally I wouldnt mind the layers being big, but I think this was just to test the scaling of the tech behind it.
---
I think it's more likely that they *don't*, but should. My guess is that this is a hackfix to gnome size released at some point, potentially post-vanilla release, where all player-controlled gnomes just have their scale increased "server-side".
---
Those who play classic will be at Battle for Azeroth 14 years from now. For some maybe that's An Inconvenient Truth.
---
Not having access at least saves me from burning myself out on something that's gonna get whiped ina couple months at the latest.
---
Well at least you aren't so delusional that you deny mythic is difficult. Progress.
---
I love watching venruki on his mage stream. Without the chaos of thousands of abilities from classic...it's satisfying to watch.
---
Can't wait to catch the rest
---
I agree with you. I just want them to take their time. I do not want to see new content for at least 2 years, because that's how long it will take someone like me to get to Naxx at my pace, and I'm sure I'm not alone. I have huge ambitions for Vanilla, and I realize they are not realistic because others will get bored of the game much sooner than me, and I need the participation of others or it's not an MMO anymore, but I want to play as EVERY class, EVERY race, and max out EVERY profession (including every branch of professions). I want to have all 10 character slots as Alliance on one server and all 10 slots as Horde on another server. I want to complete every quest, level every profession. I'm a completionist. I know, this is utterly unrealistic, but I will still strive for it, and though we will probably see new content that will make my progress obsolete eventually, I hope it doesn't happen too soon.
---
Damn.. You're closer up to the line than me.
---
Have you asked your friend at all about an ETA? Cause I was told Thursday, but alas it's Friday..
---
Upvoted for visibility, I’m looking for a group of people to play with as well.
---
This could be an awesome feature for in game shop

The only reason you don't want to discuss what comes after is because you're living in a pleasant dose of vanilla nostalgia. We're talking about a finite amount of content, and anyone who has played any game knows that you can only do the same few things over and over again for so long. A necessity for future content is inevitable and talking about it shouldn't be taboo. 
---
I mean, if we had speculative data regarding what happens after we die, why would you be upset with people discussing the afterlife? We all know we're going to die eventually, it's human nature to discuss what comes next
---
My man I’ve played both versions of the game and have been playing since early 2005, Vanilla is way more casual friendly, the experience lends itself that casuals can get much more reward much earlier in the game. Casuals can actually feel accomplishment by getting a mount by 40, hitting 60, finishing a dungeon etc. you won’t get those accomplishment feelings until at least raiding, rates PVP in BFA.
---
What are you not understanding?
---
So maybe dwarves off are off? They didn't give any specifics, they just said they're the right height yet there's a discrepancy between the 2 screenshots so I'd like to know why that is at the very least.

Seems like the problem is just beta testers not testing shit and rather just play the game for fun. I mean I get that, but take 5 mins out of your day find any kind of gnome vanilla footage, and then put yourself in the same position and show the height difference, it's that easy.
---
Discord people advertise guilds on the classic wow channel
---
I know, I lived that "era" and watched wow pvp videos 24/7. I even made two myself... But I never like excessive editing and zooming in and out, it was annoying and people complained back then.
---
humans and undead have it worse. 
---
Sure two races spawn in those spots but 40% of each faction is Human or UD

Um wut ingame shop. And what does one of the most infamous bugs in vanilla have to do with microtransactions

Forgot to say, I'll be playing out of the UK.

Off topic I guess but what a kind customer service interaction.
---
The models for tauren and gnomes are actually smaller than what they appear in-game. In-game the player models are;
---
    Male tauren are scaled to 1.3.
---
    Female tauren are scaled to 1.25.
---
    Male and female gnomes are scaled to 1.15.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Height
---
maybe this is why?
---
People going to launch day or launch week expecting it to be anything other than a shitshow are clearly new.
---
Neat. That's a fun-looking zone. I often explore it on my way to Badlands.
---
thanks, I'll look into that.
---
Decursive as well. Lol.
---
He told me yesterday as well, but yep it's Friday. I haven't asked him since then cause I haven't wanted to bug him. I've heard from someone else (not someone who works at blizzard) that they just didn't add everyone from the list for some reason (which is unusual) and that they don't know when or if everyone will be added.
---
A clean editing. There is actually a lot of recent pvp videos that showcase good fights without the excessive zooming, spinning, etc. You can search it in youtube for "vanilla pvp #classname#" and you'll find plenty.
---
Maybe so, but you certainly don't see a "This Guy Is 50% Bigger" buff on eg. Herod in SM, despite him being bigger than normal humans, or "These Guys Are 30% Smaller" buff on the trolls in the Dwarven starting area, despite them being much smaller than most trolls.
---
There are hundreds of such mobs in the world, and I can assure you they don't have the size of each and every one hardcoded in the client.
---
I don't know how private servers work on the backend, how they send commands, what commands may or may not be run when a character is created, all I know is I am willing to put my faith in the development team behind Classic and if they say something is how it was based on THEIR reference client I am inclined to believe them.
---
I am thoroughly enjoy the people losing their minds over this though. :)
---
Elaborate on zones "with slightly better gear", new dungeons/raids and post- naxx content.
---
Slightly better gear stacks over time and brings up powecreep, eventually making previous content useless.
---
New dungeons have a chance to turn into ToC/IC dungeons v2, you know very well what happened there after.
---
Post naxx content, if its actually harder than naxx, we are back to powercreep.
---
Stacking content eventually will require catch up mechanics. So how do you combat this ?
---
How did he get that shield at the end?
---
Honestly, I feel like your option is the best - refresh servers. Possibly keep a couple of servers stagnant for those who don't want their progress reset every time. I too believe that Classic should be preserved for as long as possible, so people can come back to it and play it again even 10 years from now.
---
can definitely recommend his stream. Crazy good and fun to watch, actually. Solid dudes these two, answer all the chat questions etc.
---
They also got the "world first" Arena Grand Master trinket.
---
It's probably better that they're bigger anyways. If they're smaller it just makes their hitbox /range even smaller. Arc exploisons and frost nova as a gnome is already way smaller than humans. You don't want it even smaller.
---
Perhaps. Time will tell :P
---
You being selfish doesn't negate his point.

Can I be added to your friends list? :(
---
Damn I feel low, begging for beta.
---
It shouldnt be in classic otherwise itll lose its significants of event
---
Thematically, Undead are a better fit - at a glance at least. Of course we all know however that the *first* Warlocks were Orcs. So on lore/theme alone both work perfectly well.
---
Personally I had two Warlocks, both Undead. One started that way, the 2nd was a reboot as a BElf that I later race changed to Undead anyway because I missed it :&lt; Sooo I feel like I should go Orc just for a change, but who knows, I could later regret it (again).
---
Do you know what build you'll be going? Eating corpses offers fantastic synergy to a Warlock, but if you roll Affliction you won't really need it, and definitely not if you go SM/DS. The latter would also make Command fairly pointless at 60, as you won't be rolling with ~~pets~~ minions. WotF is always nice to have, but less important outside of PvP. Blood Fury is *always* useful.
---
Fuck now I can't decide either!
---
Ah, the minmaxer’s curse.
---
I'm saying you can't want to turn around retail's design choices *AND ALSO* want WOTLK, because WOTLK is where most of retail came from. The term wrath babies exists for a reason.
---
You don't think that Blizzard maybe did this themselves?  They literally said on the blue post that they spent a lot of time on this issue in particular.  They are more than capable of checking the size of a character on their CURRENTLY available 1.12 server vs the beta server.
---
That is odd, and yet not encouraging. Same camp here, I don't want to message him everyday that goes by that I'm not in.
---
Seems like it'd be easy to just use us F&amp;F for the next closed beta wave at worst, but the fact that they might not add all the F&amp;F even at all seems way odd.
---
Sure, and you can call me lazy, but i think the better option is fixing the application rather than having a bunch of people renaming their executables.
---
Screenshots can be altered, Blizzard's data can't.
---
He's pretty entertaining and has a super long competitive history.  
---
This is my favorite moment from beta tho;  [https://clips.twitch.tv/BombasticCredulousCard4Head](https://clips.twitch.tv/BombasticCredulousCard4Head)   
---
I was just going back to lakeshire to hand in some quests on my lvl 19 druid when those guys jumped me. So it was really satisfying xD
---
So you're saying:
---
* All the private servers individually set the model scaling for Gnomes to be smaller
---
* A website that meticulously tracks WoW changes and updates is fabricating values
---
* All of us that remember the model heights changing in Legion are wrong
---
All because of one forum post with Blue text?
---
The scenario you are envisioning is just never going to play out realistically. Any time swinging your weapon would be better used creating distance, casting fear or drain life, or dotting other targets. You have nothing that makes your rightclicks hurt whatsoever, and the tiny DPS increase from the stones is not going to change that. I guarantee you, by the time you can create them and actually try it for yourself for the first time, you're going to see what I mean. 
---
That being said, if this is really what you want to do, go for it. WoW is a game, have some fun. Just be prepared that you're going to be less successful than you could have been.
---
What are your reasons?
---
Wait for realm forums.
---
Apparently so in a few vids I watched
---
I guess but the way I view classic is as a celebration of everything vanilla and the Corrupted Blood Incident was part of vanilla
---
rippppp lol
---
Could you elaborate? Do you pump affliction first for nightfall or destruction for shadowburn? Could you link every example specs? 
---
Very interested in this, I'm considering playing warlock because of their pvp capabilities and the drain tanking levelling spec seems fairly dull to me..
---
We still return to and re-play old school games, despite them having finite content. This may be a deal breaker for you, but private servers show us that there is a market in having a stagnant Vanilla server, or at the very least, a Vanilla server that resets every few years.
---
here are some from my vanilla folder if anyone wants to compare
---
[Album](https://imgur.com/a/uNNO24G)
---
That's exactly the point, forcing people to commit. Makes your character feel more real/permanent.
---
Flying mounts did destroy world pvp and world interaction in general to a massive degree. To me the convenience of flying is not worth losing that aspect.
---
I was legit going to say the exact same thing i mean imagine calling some1 a pleb when you havent got a mousepad the size of your desk but a mere pleb sized pad only big enough for the mouse
---
&lt;3 vizslas ftw though
---
So what's the point in layering high level zones then? What's the performance benefit to the server for doing this?
---
Summoning your friend deep down in the middle of the ocean after casting unending breath on the rest of the party.
---
yet here we are?

it was a grind. I grinded hard and still only made it to 12.
---
I'm not saying flying mounts are good, I'm saying they're not the worst thing that ever happened to WoW, which is what Thekota said.
---
The little Payo is pretty entertaining too yeah. Best reactions for sure, 10/10
---
Respec costs are one of the only gold sinks in the game. Epic mount is huge but only a one time, AH is pretty small. Respec costs are really the only way to help curb crazy inflation by taking earned out of the economy
---
"patriotreeman1776" ROFL
---
Good tip I guess. I would still like to talk to a few guilds in the meantime. Do we know roughly how many realms there will be?
---
Here are some talent specs:
---
[The classic SM/Ruin](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/BfDkHxZwAATjA0wE): Works fine in raids, pvp and solo content. A very nice all-round spec for everything.
---
[DS/Ruin](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/AjDABMzgfBAE6wNMBA): This is the top dps spec. It requires you to sacrifice your succubus for a 15% damage buff to be viable, which means if you can't do that then you'll do very little dps. It's okay for farming because sacrificing the voidwalker gives you a pretty substantial HP regen buff which means you can tank multiple mobs in your face. God awful for pvp though.
---
[MD/Ruin](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/AATM0fxMBOMDTAQ): A slight variation on DS/Ruin, you sacrifice your affliction talents (instant corruption and improved life tap) for the Master Demonologist talent. It gives you a buff when you have a demon out; 20% threat reduction from the imp, 10% reduced physical damage taken from the voidwalker, 10% increase to all damage from the succubus and 60 resistance to all spell classes from the felhunter. It's primarily used for the felhunter buff when tanking twins, but it can be used in other ways too. Unlike DS/Ruin, this spec is really strong in PvP, the downside is no instant corruption and you have to lifetap more on longer fights.
---
[PvP dps build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/A4w3XwAFzA04N0A): This is for nuking hard with conflag and Nightfall bursts. Basically zero defensiveness so be careful.
---
[NF/SL](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/AzDk3wTMxfxNAA): Very defensive and relying on dots and Nightfall procs to do damage, basically outlasting the opponent.
---
[The Drakedog](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/ATABzAQ8Df_d): Deep destro spec made famous by Drakedog. Very high burst capability with conflag, does require a lot of skill and gear to use.
---
[NF/Conflag](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/A4w3XwAFzA04N0A): A very high damage pvp spec that is very fun to play in the open world. Requires quite decent gear to pull off.
---
All of these specs can have small variations in them of course.
---
I guess the item you had in mind was not worth mentioning or what?
---
It's not terrible, most classes in vanilla don't exactly have exciting rotations. Warlocks are incredibly fun to play IMO, and extremely versatile in PvP. You will have lots of things to do in every aspect of the game but raiding, which is where a lot of classes repeatedly press the same three buttons.
---
No one is forcing you to open the posts.
---
I think blizzard confirmed sharding on launch to stop that.
---
Fresh servers. That's how Pservers did it, and the game doesn't need millions, it needs enough. Who told you that you should play till the end of time? If you get bored you quit, that simple. But after years when your burnout goes away, you will know exactly what game is waiting for you to return. Don't put time limit on people to "complete" the game before you start asking for new things in something that is called "classic".
---
Bingo.
---
The cost of everything in classic is what it is by Design, it's designed to take up a certain amount of time based on the effort you want to put in, back then we had to prioritize what we really wanted and spend our gold and what we wanted most and that made it feel more earned
---
no u
---
How bout this, insted of trying to relive moments make new ones stop living in the past
---
This was my favorite lmao
---
Man u have TBC talents so it cant be before AQ release :D
---
We’ll get the first one.  
---
The second one is cool, I’ve never seen it! Third looks like WCIII, and the fourth is trying too hard.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/BZzzHxZwA\_DxeQA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/BZzzHxZwA_DxeQA) to level  
---
And a [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/AjDABPD9eBAE4wNMBA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/AjDABPD9eBAE4wNMBA) DS/Ruin at 60 unless I get stuck in the tank group.

Can't this be an illusion created by the FoV/resolution?

I am opted into all games via beta preference. I am sure you are too. I do not think there is any way to tell if you were invited naturally or through F&amp;F.   
---
And yes, my friend is great dude who i obviously consider my friend lol!
---
I was actually under the impression it was not a thing. They confirmed 5.5 minute respawn timers not that long ago, I believe in the interviews in fact that the streamers recently did in Irvine.
---
Right, but it's quite clear from the context of this post that the OP is passing off the entire system as awful during the test cycle of the game.
---
Go mine some copper or something and you can afford respecs.
---
Lol probs just stolen from the internet and claimed as his like most over vids popin up from classic days
---
Wack-a-Mole is also reaction based. Tanking  or kiting is where the true fun is.
---
It affects different classes a different amount. Fury warriors need some serious gear to be viable in PvP and an arms warriors is complete trash in PvE. Full protection tanks are of course trash at both except for tanking. But most classes can do fairly well in both.
---
I know! How dare they release a beta with bugs. I expect 100% polish on test servers!
---
itll be a shit show no doubt. So long as blizzard finds a way for no lifers to not destroy the game on week 3 by stockpiling 20 layers worth of black lotus, azerothian diamonds/arcanite crystals, thorium and icecap itll all be okay. 
---
It being a shit show is authentic vanilla.
---
Grow up.
---
Gotta feel bad for Quinn, retpala is such a useless spec to play snutz basically PvE'd him and still won.
---
That makes some sense, I can see that being the case. I just hope the wait isn't too long.. It almost feels more painful knowing we *should* get in but dont know when that will be.
---
I downloaded a network monitor and I'm planning to test it on the laptop, but out of curiosity I looked up my usage on my home PC and I've used 1.22gb playing BFA in the last 30 days and that includes raiding.
---
There are client-side entities and server-side entities. Dynamic vs not dynamic.
---
Your character is a dynamic entity--it exists in no way shape or form until the server tells you it exists. It sends the data in a character packet, which also sends a race. Many kinds of creatures use a race as a reference rather than a direct model, so if player gnomes were unique in their size, that means the server has to note down each individual character to be a slightly different size.
---
This isn't any extra work on the server's part. It is just one more float (4 bytes of data) that get sent to anyone who meets you.
---
15 threads about changes every day, and you can't see 3 people that agree on proposed change.... And people wonder why blizzard should release that game and never touch it again.
---
Yes and it should be undisclosed so it becomes a surprise when someone accidentally spreads it outside of the raid.
---
I agree they should all be distinct, but most zones in vanilla don't actually directly contrast each other that much and I think it's better being that way.
---
Feralas blends in perfectly with everywhere around it, since Kalimdor is mostly barren arid areas (that IIRC are suggested to have been less arid in the past) with pockets of life and vegetation. If you look at the northern half of EK, it's similar and all blends together great, too.
---
Subtler differences make the world feel more real, while big differences as retail has make it feel like a video game theme park that's there just for you, the player.
---
Just lol at your lunacy
---
Why not just add dual spec?
---
Yeah, resto shaman in AB/WSG feels so bad.
---
I tired didn't get it to work
---
It seems like a quirk they designed on purpose. GMs have been spawning enlarged mobs since day 1.
---
As much as I enjoy the civilised zones of the Alliances, the more wasteland and arid zones of Kalimdor sparks the wanderlust and survivor within me.
---
I was playing on a work issued potato to better recreate the authentic vanilla experience :p
---
Psyche out!!!!

Barrens chat... Barrens chat never changes
---
As a purist in every other aspect I actually agree here. A 20g cap would be better imo as its still a painful amount to spend but doesnt completely cuck you out of being able to respec for raid/pvp.
---
Doing less work / not having to mess with something they aren't sure how to fix? We can't really apply logic to Blizzard's decision making, they ruined their game, nobody else.
---
What’s your alternative solution?
---
Totems suck? rofl. What a baddie. 
---
Might want to try sliding that palacock out of your mouth.
---
&gt; they'd have to go out of there way to edit the game files and then release a custom client.
---
You are incorrect. When models are assigned, server-side values are referenced to determine a permanent and automatic scale. Many models have a permanent scale attached to them only server side--meaning that by changing your model directly, you find yourself at a different scale.
---
These values are server side and not client side, which means they need to be sniffed. Scale command only being temporary is because the command is *intended* to be temporary.
---
Well obviously they *can* scale the size of Gnomes. But why would Pservers trying to emulate vanilla WoW as close as possible decide that gnomes should be X% larger?
---
Blizzard are probably correct, but it's slightly annoying when the only answer we get is "It's correct.". Is it the old client not handling 16:9 properly? Are we talking some base-value set clientside that was updated by the servers during Vanilla (Which would be nuts)? What?
---
Ah jeez, i knew their was a talent that did reduce it but couldn't remember it. Good look.
---
Well invites usually go out around 6 PM PST it seems like so maybe we'll get lucky this evening. I'll me know if you hear anything from your friend. I'll let you know if I hear anything.
---
oh look, the reddit police
---
Threat isn't as big a deal for us on alliance side. Blessing of salv is the bees knees. I think you'd be sacrificing dps to play a meme spec.
---
I did, that's why I'm not praising fake streamers as gods like the 15 year olds watching them.
---
I'd wager that ah fees and repair costs shit on respec costs, you also need to remember that by reducing the cost people are going to respec more, so while i doubt it, it's possible that it actually ends up as a larger gold sink.
---
Exactly. Been saying this for years
---
If classic dont have oceanic servers im going fuck with their shit
---
Weird snapshot tho 21/5/22 ?
---
How many times did you die before you met him?
---
You can also out run the cast, it's basically just stuns you if you are in close range
---
So I'm going to go back through 15 years of changes and figure out the logic of everything, and then compare that to why they would mess with gnome height?
---
I wouldn't even call that a mouse pad.
---
Trade chat when the game launches
---
You're right, but they are constantly cluttering up the front page. This is one of the few exceptions in the past weeks where there weren't 5-6 stupid clips across the page.
---
On 27th of aug we will find out if we get oceanic servers or ddosed
---
You are assuming the default size is the correct size
---
lol, thanks :D
---
And that trade-off is worth it to give up the 10% shadow damage from SM?
---
Ming
---
idk why do you think a forum full of toxic manchilds are a substitute for professional help. Get a counselor
---
Sorry, I don't know if I feel comfortable asking.   
---
Odds are there will be an open beta before launch.  And even tho the end of August seems far away, it will be here before you know it. Potentially making that initial launch of WoW, Log in, Character creation, and taking your first step that much more awesome on live.
---
No doubt. It makes Chromaggus a joke if even mages can remove curses without messing up.
---
What about Devilsaurs tho?
---
It's the other way around. *Blizzard* told the client to change the SCALE field of the player, whereas private servers did not do this.
---
Ahh damnit, thanks for the reply.
---
Both the mage and paladin are using TBC talents and spells. This isn't relevant to WoW Classic.
---
i've read comments from individuals who said that dynamic spawns weren't a thing. the rumors have been out there.
---
AH is definitely not small, as a raider during progression you are gonna spend 200g+ a week on consumables alone not even considering mandatory BoE epics for some classes that really have their price too. Repair costs are also to consider. If you wanna be competitive in classic prepare to farm gold. Alot of gold.
---
yes they basically shattered them all in some way. they wanted to add flying so instead of fixing holes they replaced everything.
---
comments like this show your immaturity pretty clearly
---
This is the most runescape shit I’ve ever seen lmao
---
I'll probably check in with him Monday or Tuesday, as I'm not sure Blizz really sends out invites on the weekend even for F&amp;F. Will definitely check in!
---
All the game models have a base scale, the model file exists in the client. The server scales what model is, based on various effects. Players characters are scaled as you login into the game to appropriate value, so the model stands out. Taurens, gnomes have this done. So yes the model file is storesd in the client, but as you login you get set to the proper size. Private servers used either the default model size which is the same as the npcs and therefore smaller or an arbitrary value that they didn't guess right.
---
Im not much of the creative type so Ill just use something I know as an example of what they could do
---
Its not the level cap that makes Classic great. They could raise the level. There can always be progression. Again why not have a larger game? Its what they did to the gameplay that killed it not the length of the game. 
---
Its not like people got to 50 and was like "they should of stopped at 50 they ruined the game by going to 60!". As long as they keep the same kind of RPG elements. Dont make things easier unless they actually need to be (C'thun). How could they expand on talents and abilities without making it over complicated? Shit keep them the same (again not creative luckily they have a team), if you are ok with where talents and abilities are at now then why not be ok with it at 70. And they could add a few more at least before it gets to be to much
---
Or maybe they do it so you can participate in events? All the post the past 24hrs have been raid bosses in main cities why not have events like that. Why shouldnt the horde actually mount an assault on SW. Not phasing people into another server for an event but actually have it play out. Where level 1s in SW will see Thrall running through killing guards (pvp tag still in play, you dont have to participate) with an army of players at his back.
---
*takes the devs dick out of his mouth so he can speak*
---
you are wrong blizz said so
---
so is botting, but blizzard does what they can to combat it. The alternative is giving Blizzard complete control of your computer while Bnet is running. Thats a non starter. 
---
Just as no layering is a non starter for blizzard. Blizzard needs to do what they can before release to limit avenues for abuse, highlight punishments for exploiting around said abuse, then follow through. If a big streamer is caught and banned for cheating through layering, thatll stop most people. 
---
It won't stop it all, but blizzard nor anyone will ever stop all of something they dont like (just look at the highly successful drug war). All they can do is combat it proactively with code implementation, and fight it reactively with investigations and bans. 
---
I don't know how blizzard figures out when a group join is legitimate. Maybe make layer swapping only happen if you are in a sanctuary, rested zone, flight path or if the person who invited you to the layer changing group is in the same zone as you. Add a 15 min -1 hour buffer on the layer so logging in/out doesnt do fuck all.
---
There are plenty of ways to combat layer abuse if blizzard decides doing so is a priority for them in the name of preserving the health of game servers.
---
When I first saw the name I remember thinking it would be because of the giant thorns around razorfen. But nope, rock dicks.
---
Wow, I'm pretty far from a no-changer, but even I think this one's just a bad idea.
---
While I'd agree that it's a pain, it's one of those fundamental vanilla things that would really change the feel.

Should definitely have green shoulders by 30, helm I’ll give ya though.
---
Yeah if they do classic+ I would be ok with 3 or 4 years before the + comes in. Let everyone who wants to get there and then bring it out. Dont make people who hear about it a year from now think they have to rush. Give it time, come up with something great. In 3 or 4 years time it would be easy enough to get at least even 3 60s for some of the most extreme casual players.
---
Model scale is most certainly determined server side. The default scale is 1, but Blizzard prefers to assign custom values to control it rather than scaling the model in the files. This is why almost every single gameobject in the game **isn't** scale 1.0.
---
\&gt;have a realm with mostly former private server population. on private servers it is known that engineering is tier one profession for both raiding and pvp - &gt; a vast majority will go mining-engi because the realm is fresh. so here is an example that will be extremely likely that most layers will be filled with miners.
---
This isn't the claim that I and other people were responding to. In fact, the statement you just made falls in line with my response. On servers with a given (in your case "high") percentage of miners, individual layers will be expected to have a similar ("high") % of miners as the whole server. That's what "tends towards averages" means. We were talking about individual layers, and we were saying that there's no mechanism to make miners prefer particular layers over other layers, so they wouldn't congregate in one in particular. 
---
You were saying that this won't be the case, and that's wrong if the distribution of miners onto specific layers  is essentially random.
---
I'm not sure why you're bringing up excercises for students, that just seems like weird rambling. What were you trying to say with that?
---
And no, this isn't gatekeeping, this is arguing about what's true and what isn't true. I'm not saying that only statisticians can argue about this stuff, I'm saying that you're using the wrong model.
---
Little changes like that all accumulated and it becomes essentially not classic WoW at all. That's the whole point of getting this game... to get a classic experience including for the most part the quirks, the annoyances, the struggle, accomplishment, etc.
---
I dont think anyone suspects the pictures are altered. But it seems like there was some scaling done to the vanilla models that for some reason didnt carry over to pservers.
---
How, tbis sounds like the best lofe imaginable
---
You suck and you’re ugly as shit
---
Now if only quest items had a dynamic respawn....
---
Took me almost an hour to complete that freaking dun morogh quest where you collect the 3 sets of tools because it was being camped by like 20 people.
---
If they're on the front page then they're what a majority of the sub wants to see.
---
Run with people who are patient and allow you to practice and don't mind a couple wipes
---
Here's how it probably works:
---
Most models are intended to be set to model scale 1.
---
Gnomes at model scale 1 are half as small as a dwarf.
---
Blizzard, some time during the development decided that gnomes were too short for their taste. 
---
Blizzard sets the model scale for all gnomes to a value greater than 1, because it's easier than removing the files for gnomes, leper gnomes, and unique gnomes like mekkatorque and the gnomer mech bosses, then changing them all by and and readding them to the files.
---
Pservers set all player characters to model size 1.
---
People who play on Pservers get used to the tiny gnomes even if they're not in vanilla.
---
I quit WoW in wrath and the way they look now looks right to me, and I played *exclusivly* gnome.
---
I can't be certain; I haven't played since WOTLK (aside from a demo offer for LoD) and haven't kept up with what the auction house addons do.
---
You could, literally, buy out the whole auction house offerings with one click which contained anything which was offered at a lesser rate than X. With another click, you could relist everything. It was definitely detrimental to the game.
---
I was 38 when I got into beta with my brother. Stopped in BC, but dabbled in ps servers on and off. Can't wait to hang out in The Gallows' Tavern again. Hope to see you around. For the Horde.
---
TLDR; /r/classicwow reddit user is triggered by streamers being streamers. Thinks all reactions to enjoying and having fun with a superior release of a game by a streamer is fake.
---
let me play DPS enhancement :(
---
downvote them and move on
---
He isn't entirely wrong. If you're geared or w/e people will scoop you up and invite you to their Discord
---
So have you seen blizzard’s data then?
---
Arms warriors are pretty great in PvE tbh, especially on Horde side with WF and the 2H weapon bonusses. Their only problem is that Mortal Strike takes up a debuff slot so you cant raid as arms.
---
Definitely, but I think Leroy going in yelling was a thing, and they just builded on top of that funny incident, making this sketch, don't you think?
---
OP's gotta be trolling, or hasn't played vanilla.
---
At 60, druids are pretty much essential in every raid.  UBRS, sleep a dragonkin.  Battle rez in 20/40s.  Bear tank for aoe encounters. I could go on.  
---
The only weakness is in 5 mans with no rezzer.  Solution?  Don't wipe.
---
&gt; I don't care who's in the beta, and honestly I don't even want to be in there myself. 
---
Someone is salty they aren't in beta and these "morons" are.
---
They have invited only a part of the lists. Will (or when) they invite the rest? It is not yet known.
---
Oh yeah just some kids right?  Must be a buch a uneducated fucks if they don't share my opinion.  Hurr duur maybe I don't want dynamic respawns AND layering and don't give a fuck who disagrees.
---
Do fury warriors duel wield?...asking for a friend.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "Do et"
---
ooo this works in the beta? Gonna install it tonight. Thanks
---
Do not go there on a RP server, just sayin'
---
Sunder+tab
---
You can search "glow effects" and find the post. It was on the front page recently, might still be.
---
Private servers didn't decide that gnomes should be larger - instead, they likely did not include scaling to make them larger (remember, the conflict is private server gnomes being *smaller*, not larger). Not a concious choice, but an unintentional one.
---
Yeah Chop, better stop. Chop-chop.
---
Hmm when I did that on beta they respawned in 10 seconds
---
It's still not a blue post. Soooo saying it's confirmed isn't correct.
---
Yea they removed them in retail for that reason
---
They ahve counter play unlike any other class
---
I can't auto attack any one elses spells lol
---
Yea I agree.
---
You’ll likely have to spend a fair amount of coin re-specing if you plan on doing both, though lots of people do that. Otherwise, prot warrior is (IMO) one of the easier classes to learn to tank as. Low level tanking is hard no matter the class as you lack spells and talents to help with damage mitigation but as you level and learn the ropes it becomes easier. If you were to get into raid ranking that’s where things become quite a bit more difficult.
---
I think that's the weird part. That would seemingly be the first time to my knowledge that only.. part of the F&amp;F list gets into a beta? Even if it's three weeks from now, it seems like the F&amp;F people should get in?

Don't need it cause it's the warlock spell
---
Orc on war raptor was the shit
---
I am watching asmon now and i forgot how strong warriors are with a support paladin. Anyone knows an actually good classic warrior to watch?
---
he says in the classic wow subreddit
---
The server almost always scales models. This is why almost every single gameobject in the game **isn't** 1.0. Artists draw up the model, and the game developers then scale it as needed server-side.
---
The post is being misread. Gnomes are the correct height, all other races are inferior and wrong.
---
I agree with your points and I do like a lot of the edge/transition areas of zones a lot, especially when elevation and it's relative environment is involved ie; Howling Fjord's northern link to Grizzly Hills. 
---
But.... Felwood to Winterspring? Hellfire down into Zangar? Coming from the snow of Dun Morogh, out of the tunnel to be greeted by towering statues and the grass and evergreens of Loch Modan, then down into The Wetlands. Elwynn to Westfall? sooo good.
---
Oh, that's very good. I was referencing my experience on private servers. Ever since the release day announcement the pops have been surging and any content below lvl 40 is a mess.
---
It's something we'll try to look into - client went public on Tuesday and we've fixed some other bugs, but haven't encountered this particular issue yet :)
---
I don't actually know how Horde warriors do. For Alliance at least, arms is pretty trash when you only have heroic strike. We always let our serious PvP warriors stay arms in farm raids because we didn't really need their dps anyways. I'm not sure if that is common in guilds.
---
Actually, I looked into it a little deeper and you're correct: the base scale for (most? all?) mobs is actually in the client. It's in the DBCs in CreatureDisplayInfo.dbc.
---
That said, there's probably still a way for them to override this from the server, as a hotfixing measure. Whether this is what's happening with gnomes or not I can't say for certain; l
---
What about a red sickness rebuff for layer switching?
---
&gt;There should be 5.6 inches difference between them.
---
Why, exactly?
---
I can't find anything about them ever changing the size of a race on live.
---
When i worked 3rd shift at a call center, i would play all the time.
---
I can't imagine anyone who is over the age of 18 would be watching a streamer unless ironically. Tell me what entertainment value you get in watching https://clips.twitch.tv/ImpossibleCovertMonitorCeilingCat.
---
What does that add to your experience, how is that entertaining at all? Explain it to me. It's obvious in younger years we do dumb shit that we obviously feel dumb and embarrassed about after we get old enough to realize how stupid it is. So that's the only explanation that can rationalize the unexplained appeal of streamers to me at least. Unless you can rationalize it to me any other way.
---
that was rough man.
---
I raided in vanilla, I've been a raid leader as well, and I used threat meters.
---
I've also been a tank, and I understand threat mechanics very well. If you were 1% behind the tank and he had well established aggro (i.e. a crit wouldn't severely spike you), then there are no concerns. If you're at a ranged distance you need to exceed threat by 30% to pull aggro, so you were well within your margin.
---
If the boss had an aggro dump, however, you need to stay behind the second tank, and 1% would be too close IMO - a badly timed aggro dump + crit could put you at the top of the threat table, and that would cause positioning issues even if you feigned nearly immediately.
---
I would absolutely love a wallpaper of each starting zone taken like this...
---
awesome thanks so much for the reply! Yeah I'm going to be playing solo a lot, so pet classes always appeal to me. And I'm not fond of hunter so much. Lock it is! for now at least
---
&gt; 4 Strength 4 Stam leather belt?

&gt; **12 Spirit**
---
Fucking OP, man.
---
The one map I expected to not be full of bugs.  Fuck I was wrong.
---
I still sometimes find myself exploring around in a few starting zones just to see if I could find shortcuts into different areas in Vanilla servers.
---
Most I ever managed to find was a pair of shortcuts that allowed you to run from Northshire to Stormwind/Northshire to Jangolode Mine via the mountains to avoid the mobs and shorten travel time, though from my memory it was a one way trip for the Jangolode route. Still made me feel like I had my own personal secret routes :D.
---
Yeah that was a typo, fixed it ty.
---
What i'm getting at isn't that they made an intentional change to X or Y, it's just that people are saying that the private servers have waltzed in and *changed* values. Simply due to them being private servers which is slightly nuts, because they were trying to emulate Vanilla.
---
I would prefer only DPS’ing but I feel that warriors have to tank a bit no matter what spec they are. Am I wrong?
---
like which ones?
---
I'm salty I have to hear about them constantly. Not that they are in beta. It's become worse because now I have to see posts about them sneezing or making a funny face as apparently "beta feedback"
---
Farm gold
---
Roll a new character
---
Deal with it
---
Pick one of the above
---
Then why are you here?
---
This and the onyxia raid wipe
---
&gt; everyone knew it was fake
---
Definitely false.
---
Bad bot.
---
Very convincing argument.
---
I just think we have a misunderstanding here, I believe Vanilla is the better casual game it has way more challenge for casual players. This is not taking away anything from vanilla, why are you seeming to take offense?
---
How difficult was this to do? I would seriously LOVE to have a render of a Paladin in full T2 with Sulfuras.
---
Yea, on Ally it probably sucks. I mean if someone is approaching rank 12+ its pretty fucked to force them to respecc especially because they wont have time to farm gold if they are going R14 and also consider the big DPS gain for the guild in the long run if you support their grind.
---
Sounds like they are holding a gun against you and forcing you to use their site. :D
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 96.2068% sure that UbiGeofram is not a bot.

What’s fun about the beta anyway? I don’t get it, I want to play the game, not some test version where my characters are going to be deleted.

---
Until we get a blue post on the matter saying one way or another, it's irrelevant what former developers say. They aren't infallible sources of information.
---
The stun is melee range you dont need to face it other way you just need to be more than 5 yards away when it finishes its cast.
---
You also had dm, aq gates opened, all bgs out, naxx open, bwl, zg, class quests, world dragons and bosses......
---
None of that will be in at launch. What’s your point?
---
Ye its enough to make me not want to roll a shaman tbh lol. I can't confirm that though but it was like that on some private servers, as we've seen they aren't always correct
---
It's hard to say. Turn off the new models on retail.
---
Is it not okay to talk about these things?  
---
I played pre-vanilla.  I always thought organized PvP was bad for wPvP.  Why not have the conversation?
---
I'm saying none of that, and if your reading comprehension won't improve by your next reply then I think I'm going to just let you remain mistaken.
---
&gt;All the private servers individually set the model scaling for Gnomes to be smaller
---
No, I'm saying that private servers don't do anything to the scaling of gnome models, which leaves the model at its base size, whereas in retail WoW the server increased the scale from its base size.
---
&gt;A website that meticulously tracks WoW changes and updates is fabricating values
---
No, I'm saying that the method used by whoever wrote that article on that wiki that anyone can edit is not foolproof, because it uses the base size of the model when in-game models can have a scale multiplier applied to them.
---
&gt;All of us that remember the model heights changing in Legion are wrong
---
I never said anything related to anyone's memory, but I will now: you don't remember shit, and you would never have noticed anything being different wrt. gnome size had someone not pointed it out to you. It's likely the actual in-game gnome size never changed in Legion, at least not substantially, because of reasons already explained.
---
Nah, it was server side back then. You can try to find a video or even test it yourself. I can even remember the similar topic on Nostalrius forums that said it was not possible to change.
---
Well actually the reason world pvp died was because there wasnt a reason to venture into the world. You didnt have to do daily's anymore, you didnt have to go to instances anymore, you could just fly away from pvpers and didnt have to call your friends to help you fight.... bgs and arena didnt kill pvp.
---
It was just arenas mate
---
yeah, TBC with heroic badges is where WoW started falling into that trap.
---
I don't know all the details, it's an unique and really weird situation, but there is still hope for us.
---
Hey... Mages too..
---
Warlocks aren't too bad for buffing mages, then they scale pretty well.
---
I'm sorry, I didn't know you could define what 5.6 inches to the scale of the game looks like.
---
Dude, you're wrong about it, you were proven wrong and keep waiving shitty screenshots around.
---
Nah, I don't think many people are saying that. Private server values being 'wrong' doesn't necessary mean it has to be an intentional change - a value not being set at all is still incorrect.
---
Heathen! Sorcerer!
---
Gold sinks are respecs and consumables, engineering etc.
---
Vanilla has enough of em, layering kills it for the casual player tho.
---
That is correct. Taurens, gnomes, most gameobjects, and a lot of other things are not scale 1.0.
---
The artists draw whatever they want, but later if the size doesn't fit, the game designers scale it server-side, they don't ever change the file.
---
no changes
---
I agree at 39 or 49 it feels like some skill is involved.
---
Lol Rip
---
Unless you are a mount collector and you want a few different epic mounts. Blizz has said they are going with the cheap training high mount cost model.
---
Problem is that this isn't a bug. It's a feature that's working as intended. They should just remove this "feature" and be done with it
---
I guess we can continue asking the same questions that have been asked for 2 years instead of looking at classic wow content.
---
I'd beg to disagree.  Arguably, WSG/AV took more players out of the world/more PvPers out of the world and offered items in doing so.
---
I didn't say anything about launch.
---
No it isn't.
---
For every time you could cite a feature that later ruined WoW that appeared in Wrath I could tell you how it was completely different from the way it is now. Hard modes, dungeon finder and dual spec didn't ruin the game on their own.
---
You aren't putting nearly enough blame on Cataclysm.
---
Always a solid choice hope to see you on the battlefield!
---
I think it's pronounced "Rouge"...
---
“Beta testing”
---
I think that most people on this sub are more towards the hardcore player base. I myself am 32 years old and have a huge group of friends, some who played and some who didn't, who are willing to give this game a try this time around.
---
That being said many of them are married and have kids at this point. I'm sure many others here have a similar group forming and those players will level much more casually. I think you just have to keep in mind the amount of players interested without the free time to play like a hardcore player. It's not like a month or two in everyone will be 60... but most of this sub reddit Probably will be.
---
Hunter for her, its easier than rogue and she already knows the hunter basics from retail
---
Come horde in classic and play 39/49
---
Lucifron with decursive was lmao. 
---
auto 2k heal every button press.
---
Honestly every quest spawn item seems to respawn really fast not how I remember it, but who knows.
---
From what I’ve read warriors are asked to tank more often than other classes that have both tank and DPS specs, however, I believe they are also asked to re-spec as they take too much damage in fury and arms. I could be wrong though as I played warlock and hunger in vanilla.
---
Can be yes. Base damage for Imp's fireball is 83-93, +30% from improved imp at 1 fireball/second. Arcanite Dragonlings Fire Breath adds a 30 sec debuff that adds roughly 60 damage to every instance of fire damage taken and stacks with itself up to 5 I believe. That's a lotta damage when you consider multiple people in your raid can carry the Dragonling to spawn it when someone else's expires.
---
getting tired of these bug callouts and just turns out its pservers thats the problem. Reference should be vanilla, not pservers.
---
Classic.wowhead.com has one
---
What is it you think is a bug here?  I see a flag being returned.
---
&gt; It's obvious in younger years we do dumb shit that we obviously feel dumb and embarrassed about after we get old enough to realize how stupid it is.
---
I'm saddened to see that you haven't reached that stage yet.
---
Maybe they are... This thread is starting to make me wonder
---
Changing the mechanics is a bad idea. 
---
Buffing mechanics to account for 1.12 talents and buffed non-1.0 itemization is the way to go. So things hit as hard percentage-wise as they did back then. Buff boss HP so fights last about the same length as well, which also makes healing/mana more important like it was. 
---
It's really pretty straight-forward stuff. 
---
Leaving it how it is, isn't blizzlike either.
---
Christ some people are so unbelievably melodramatic on this subreddit. BGs weren't the "death" of wPvP. It was healthy on OG Classic and Private servers. There are too many places in the world you had to go, and if you were on a PVP server it was unavoidable.
---
Alright will i be able to just download the transparent gifs ?
---
RemindMe! 96 days "Do it"
---
Nah man. He was High Warlord. They got access to those pre AQ
---
Ah, to be new again, lol
---
The 4 problems i see there are these:
---
1: They don't have gameplay designers, they have engineers to recreate what those gameplay designers once did, and are no longer here.
---
2:In the end you still eventually end up with more and more stacking content, it might take 3 years post-Naxx but it will eventually bring powercreep and render content useless. Catch up mechanics are inevitable.
---
3: It's essentially as OP said, WoW 2. This is blizzard, there is Retail WoW, there are more games as well as (sadly) expansion to mobile gaming. How likely in your mind is that blizzard hires a new, fully dedicated team to make &gt;sure&lt; that the game won't derail into BFA 2? Remember that in the end, it's the player who "wants" and that new team should have the skill to protect us from ourselves. This will be a task that will most likely require more work than Retail WoW, because they need to ADD but the can't experiment, they can't innovate, the spirit of Vanilla must be preserved.
---
4: It will eventually cease to be Classic.
---
People often bring OSRS but even these people forget that Jagex isn't Blizzard.
---
Because they're amazing? World PvP is just ganking
---
Hey, man...
---
Mage tables were a great fucking addition to the game. Let me guess, you hated when greater blessings were added too?
---
No way man, I'm the unicorn! (Alliance warlock) also all my friends are alliance lol
---
let me in
---
&gt;Well actually the reason world pvp died was because there wasnt a reason to venture into the world
---
This is just factually wrong.  BG's literally tells the player "hey pvp in this instance and earn rewards" and literally gives PvPers reasons to NOT go out into the real world and wPvP.  Also, it ended up taking WAY more players out of the game world because the team sizes are big.
---
Arena as well.  Offered "competitive gameplay" with rewards attached to it.  Why would anyone want to wPvP at that point?   Exactly, they don't.
---
And yes, QoL over-casualization of game mechanics and removal of community contributed to it as well, but organized PvP is literally the bane of unorganized PvP (wPvP).
---
Well if you read a couple of posts in this thread, every time there's a picture there's a comment "is it privserver?". And one of those were the guy I responded to who alluded to the fact that a privateserver had actively *changed* values.
---
Can you get better pictures? Cause those suck and honestly look different sized to me.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "DO THIS"
---
yeah its gonna be really tough for blizzard when people pay them money to play a 15 year old game.
---
No way man I'm the unicorn! (Alliance warlock) seriously tho all my friends are going alliance
---
I have a reason for not wanting this that’s not just “no changes”. High respec costs push people to pick and stick with a style of play. For example, PvE builds will be slightly different than PvP builds. This way, each player has a stronger identity vs. retail, where everyone can instantly change their playstyle for every situation with no punishment/cost for doing so.
---
I want all of the above in WoW Classic.
---
Male tauren are scaled to 1.3.
---
Female tauren are scaled to 1.25.
---
Male and female gnomes are scaled to 1.15.
---
Rewatch the video closer. I return flag and in the same batch a enemy player picks it up, showing me and my team that I returned the flag, yet a player picked up the same flag I returned and is carrying it to cap.
---
for sure, but I was thinking maybe finding a guild before Classic goes live and start bonding. I don't want to get into a guild based on gear check, I'd rather be surrounded by like minded people. Call me a filthy casual.
---
&gt; There are a few items like Stave of Fur &amp; Claw that would change you into Furbolg.
---
Do you mean Dartol's Rod of Transformation?  
---
We are getting the 1.12 versions of items.
---
I've always shared this viewpoint, that organized PvP mostly decimated world PvP, along with dishonorable kills. Though for a good while there will be plenty of incentives for people to be out in the world in Classic, so enjoy it while it's not a stagnant raid-logging fest, which should be a least a year or two depending on the time between the rollout of new content phases.
---
It certainly didn't help, but I think the real issue is how heavily the honor system favors BGs.  You just won't get enough honor out in the world to help you in the rankings.
---
That's because most vanilla players quit the game before Cata came out. I'm one of them. I don't know a fucking thing about Cataclysm other than it was big gay.
---
There's a similar route to get to blasted lands :)
---
multiboxxer from last nights stress test
---
This is probably one of the only things we can verify to a fairly decent level of certainty. People are just comparing beta vs retail and it looks like they are the same size. They shouldn't be.
---
Dude the nightelf one is in the game. It's called banethil Barrow den. It's basically a raid
---
I have a good one from June 2005. I noticed my mage was smaller than a flower (peacebloom?).
---
[Image here](https://imgur.com/PpfYCrg)
---
Hmm. In the game manual from like 2005 that came with my original copy of vanilla WoW there is a hight chart, and judging from that the 1.12 private server screenshot looks more accurate.. https://i.imgur.com/fbl9IKO.jpg
---
https://i.imgur.com/8vaKXom.jpg
---
One of the biggest parts of vanilla was the massive amount of people. Classic will not be classic with 4k people after 6 months. Just a fair warning to ya. All those dungeon groups and raids will be near impossible to form groups. World PvP will be extremely seldom.
---
Agreed, out of everything, 1.12 classes will probably make the largest difference. Prior, you had paladins who couldn't heal cause they had to spam buffs, chain heal didn't target people lowest on HP, Warriors didn't have the buffed blood thirst or shield slam, Mages didn't have Winters Chill. I know there's loads more, but I don't remember since I haven't thought about it for ages.
---
You think DPS warriors collect tank gear because of shield wall.... Wowwwwww, yeah I won’t be responding to retards on this sub anymore. 😂
---
Servers can scale models without any client side edits and vanilla gnomes were scaled to 1.15 on the release version, private servers are possibly running 1.0 scale?
---
I guess all we can do is check around 6 PM PST on weekdays (unsure if F&amp;F goes out on weekends) to see if we got flagged, since from what I've noticed F&amp;F doesn't follow the closed beta waves
---
No. No changes
---
BG's and Arenas were most definitely a HUGE contributor to the death of world pvp.  Organized PvP is the complete opposite of unorganized PvP...  
---
It literally gave pvpers reasons/rewards to just play organized instanced PvP instead of wPvP.   I remember never giving a fuck about going out into the world and finding people, now it was all about camping outside WSG and just constantly queuing.  
---
wPvP still happened obviously, but not on the scale that it did before organized PvP was introduced.
---
Gotta figure the dragonlings are super expensive no? Are they singletime use or just you make them once and you have it forever just on a cooldown?
---
Not many actually care about the size of gnomes. I care more about whether or not blizzard is right about this. If they aren't, then whatever test client they are using is actually out.
---
Did you not read my post?  I'm saying that they could have given us actual things to do in the real world to promote more interesting wPvP.  They aren't amazing.  They take PvPers out of the world.
---
Sarcasm. You miss the point entirely. Yes, people will pay to play. But that also means that Blizzard have a current flagship version of the game that is worse than what they produced 15 years ago. That is a problem.   
---
It'll basically tell them that everything they're currently doing in retail WoW is wrong. And imagine if Classic overtakes retail even after the next retail expansion? Then what? Blizzard either entirely change their retail game to resemble Classic more (because clearly, what they've been doing over the past 10 years is not what players want) or they just let retail die.   
---
Basically, if Classic is a huge hit, Blizzard will have to go against everything they've done with retail over the last 10 years in the next expansion, otherwise they're rip.
---
Simplest one I could get was find the first female human NPC I could out of the gnome starting zone. 
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/Wcq5ksl.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Wcq5ksl.jpg)
---
Rofl the second guy comes out wel one the first one is over. The warrior was atrocious. This is click bait
---
&gt;You just won't get enough honor out in the world to help you in the rankings.
---
Exactly.  That's another big reason.  People are just filled with nostalgia and MUH NO CHANGES, but they don't realize that wPvP is literally the best thing about WoW and if they expanded on it instead of going the instanced PvP route the game would be better off for it.
---
ppl figure this out now? you knew that already in vanilla it was fake.
---
The whole point of them saying it is to piss people like you off. I think it's hilarious because I watched that clip and then knew there would be a comment just like yours on this post. Take a chill pill.
---
&gt; Except... none of that is true? Their camps aren't "military camps" and they're way out of the way of anyone, in Scourge territory. They're not attacking anyone, the player is sent to kill them all.
---
One of those things isn't true. The blood elves attacked them first in the ghostlands, but this is after a night elf, dressed in full on ninja gear, ambushed the player character while the player is acting in an official capacity for Silvermoon. And soon after it's revealed they were spying. Whether or not their camps are military camps is semantics; they sent sentinels, essentially night elven soldiers, to make camps in the Ghostlands.
---
While the ghostlands is messed up, and the night elves could be there just for containment, the way they go about it is suspicious and actively malicious. The blood elves would be idiots to let them go about their business after what happened. It's a blatant disregard of Quel'Thalas's sovereignty. The Forsaken were there to help contain the scourge, and went through proper channels to do so. The alliance didn't, and their envoy was revealed to be working with a spy who was attacking what amounts to a state deputy working cleanup detail on some hazardous magical fallout. That's essentially what pushed them to the horde.
---
Lastly, I actually agree it's a bad storyline. It's never really brought up again, and much of what happens is pretty vague. That said, it was more than an envoy taking notes on things he shouldn't have been.
---
As opposed to suddenly phasing into an alternate dimension so you can kill Hogger with someone you could not have realistically communicated with?
---
Immersion is an issue either way. Any system relating to how layer hopping works is going to have immersion issues.
---
I didn't like battlegrounds. I don't think it contributed to the death at all but I really hated grinding those instances and forced PvP to stay competitive.
---
I am really split on it. It's probably my least favorite thing in classic WoW but it doesn't ruin it for me. I would prefer it not be there but I know a lot of people like it and since it's part of classic I cede to the community as a whole.
---
Yeah ok
---
you think 2 cut jpegs are solid evidence? I mean, they might be, but that ain't it
---
Lol you're just desperately grasping for anything to be negative about at this point.
---
Oh yeah. Barrens was literally split in two by dragon breath. Durotar flooded. Azshara terraformed to literally look like the horde symbol. Honestly there were a lot of cool things about the cataclysm map... except that there was never anybody around to explore it with due to dungeon finder
---
Damn, I dont even know what to say.
---
Water Elemental and Avenger's Shield being the most obvious.
---
Came here to post this, the max camera distance before that script was wayyyy to close (esp with the monitors we were using back then...) that script was needed. Never saw one for the nameplates though.
---
Omg. Lol. I completely forgot about that. If it doesn't even require mats then that makes it even more painful knowing that as shaman.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Height#Game_models
---
you didnt look very hard, if at all?
---
That was never the problem with LFR or Raid Finder.
---
You're not entitled to being able to do both easily, that's what BfA is for.
---
Any 300 skill engineering spawns will spawn as level 63 instead of level 60 is one that I know of
---
Tell him to lawyer up, hit the gym, and level up a Gnome!
---
Probably increased it during development of the original game and changing the base model would mean they would have to go through all the other gnomes already in the world. This means it would be easier to just slap a modifier on the player character gnomes.
---
[This page](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Height)(unofficial source) seems to support that theory with the following info:
---
It did contribute to the death.  Why wPvP when you can just PvP in instances, queue spam, and earn rewards for doing so?  It took literally every PvPer out of the world... No point in getting slow kills in the world when you can just farm kills in BGs/arenas...
---
I wonder if this has anything to do with it: "The models for tauren and gnomes are actually smaller than what they appear in-game. In-game the player models are; Male tauren are scaled to 1.3.
---
Male and female gnomes are scaled to 1.15."
---
Maybe they changed the model but not the scaling, or visa versa? Or maybe they cancel each other out somehow? 
---
Also, are you sure those screenshots don't show a difference? It almost looks like the classic beta one is shorter to me, I wouldn't think 4.5 would amount to much of a visual difference in game. It's hard to tell though the gnome isn't standing in the exact spot, it's close but not exact when we are trying to determine such a small difference. The angle he is standing at is different, as is the camera angle. Need to post him next to a game object we know hasn't changed in height, not sure what would work maybe a mail box or something, and use a straight-on and level camera.
---
I want to have a kid now just so I can do this
---
? they are saying private servers never scaled the gnomes up by 1.15 server side
---
20g respecs arent 'easy' and BfA stands for alot more dumb shit than just being able to PvP and PvE in your preferred spec.
---
nice catch
---
lol I appreciate the compliment I guess, but no this is my char back when I was clicking all my spells in fellowship of NOP.  I had a much better video of doing all the different glitches like jumping through UC from the top, but unforuntaely lost it in fraps conversion so pretty salty about that.
---
Hopefully they delay organized PvP for a long time.  I want people to realize that wPvP is the best part about the game and should be expanded on instead of organized PvP.
---
I'll check I tried it on the bfa client but it seemed to have no effect. I'll try later when I get home thank you.
---
Material costs can run pretty expensive yes, but it's a trinket so it just goes on cooldown rather than be consumed like grenades would for example.
---
How could I forget?! Ahh the good ol' days of being able to keybind healbot with different ranks of spells too :). (I think it was healbot? Or was that after?) either way, Decursive was literally a prerequisite for being a PUG in our raid...  (for dispellers obviously)
---
How about this one, the flag doesn't even load for him so he doesn't realize that the guy he killed was the carrier xD  
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/HelplessExuberantSwordHeyGirl](https://clips.twitch.tv/HelplessExuberantSwordHeyGirl)

I agree just make it possible and let it happen naturally. Don't make announcement about it at all or any event around.
---
So they say...
---
I don't know if it'll help, but I have [this screenshot from 4/19/2006 (patch 1.10)](https://i.imgur.com/OH3fxFq.png) of a gnome right next to a male night elf.  Don't know if it was changed between then and 1.12 or if it's an aspect ratio thing or just the angle (only decent scale screenshot of a gnome I have), but the gnome looks really, really small here.
---
WoW 2, lets go!
---
Been watching Cdew for an hour or two and his windfury isn't working in Warsong Gulch. I've looked at 4-5 clips and instances and I'm pretty sure the only time there's multiple numbers it's been simply auto animation canceled attacks.  I often animation cancelled on my warrior so that there was more burst. 
---
Here's a clip where you see two times where windfury animation goes off but the target takes only an auto of dmg. Really easy to see when it's slowed down and he's attacking the bear form druid at the end. Attacking the NE warrior at the start is just an auto earthshock auto .

---
I could be wrong but pretty sure I'm right about this... If he reports it that's great but if not hopefully someone sees this and reports it.
---
Ah!
---
when i tanked dungeons i never needed to respec from fury, can easily tank them with a tank offset in your bags, just focus more on splitpulling/ccing the big mob packs, your extra damage makes up for no threat bonus from tanking talents so you hold aggro well, you just have none of the talented defensives.
---
As long as subscriber numbers go up I don't think Blizzard is gonna care.  If they (re)introduce some elements Classic into retail... so what?
---
Lookin good. Lots of days standing atop mailboxes in stormwind or ironforge and being mired by casuals for having that bloodfang + perditions combo, I bet. Seeing people decked out in gear like this was always so impressive, unlike nowadays where everyone's got welfare gear.
---
At least play the real version again, not Pserver bullshit before you come to such a strong conclusion.
---
Yeah there seems to be some Bugs in WSG glad they are letting us test it. Our warrior got feared out of the map twice in one game lol
---
He was an awful dev according to everyone he worked with, and the fact that everything he touches turns to dogshit would support that
---
vashj'ir is low-key my favorite cata leveling zone. never had any issues with it and i totally loved the aesthetic.
---
If you don't actually want to tank, the smartest thing you can do is team up with someone who does want to tank. Tanks are slow levelers and have tough times clearing quests. They would gladly welcome some help, and that cements your place in groups with them.
---
Most people want classic to ultimately be the trilogy.
---
I don't know anyone who wants it to go to cataclysm and beyond.
---
Wrath is a good expansion because it was mostly developed and half released while Blizzard was still under Vivendi. That's the sad fact of it.
---
Ulduar is the best raid/zone ever and ICC isn't far behind. I can confidently say the hard modes of Ulduar are the best I've ever seen.
---
And the great thing about it was the hard modes didn't segregate like normal/heroic did in Wrath or add another burden of clearing an extra lockout every week like normal/heroic later on. 
---
You could choose boss by boss, it was the best thing they ever did as far as Raid design in WoW and for some reason they never did it again. Not once.
---
Wait they released battle grounds?
---
In all seriousness, I don't think it's such a time consuming fix... I don't think ignoring it relieves them of work hours in ANY way. You speak of them as if they were a bunch of rookie programmers who just came out of uni.
---
Now I got lost, what game did they ruin again? I'm sorry for not being familiar with all of Blizz's games, I mainly have only played the Warcraft franchise.
---
You talk like pressing print screen is a simple task, you mad man
---
Don't listen to this guy, they themselves admit they only played Warlock and Hunter.
---
Fury-specced Warriors are better tanks than Prot Warriors. Tanks in good guilds are forced to go 31-Fury for most raid content. Fury = More DPS = More threat = more raid DPS.
---
&gt; Why not have the conversation?
---
The conversation is wrong and intentionally uninformed.  You know if you are here that they have planned phases, two of which will introduce BGs.  You also know that beta testing is to test things.  
---
There is nothing here to talk about.
---
Any chance Wow-head will have a database search bar style format like thottbot or wowdb?
---
I would very much like to use the site but I dislike having to load up tons of stuff I don't care about before I can do a simple item search.
---
If not, I don't be using the site at all most likely.
---
I  really would like to know where these 4k people came from though. I  doubt it will ever drop under 50k. Damn certain private server has over  20k players on it's WOTLK server alone, and out of the big three,  classic was requested the most.
---
It will never &gt;ever&lt; drop to a point where you can't form a group or find a raiding group.
---
"Game  will die without new content" is weak and lazy argument from people  that cannot see how hard it would be to actually implement new content  without breaking the game.
---
Is  it possible? Maybe, is it pretty much blizzard needing to work on 2  MMOs? Yes. Will it be a task, harder than making expansions for Retail  WoW? Most certainly. It's one thing to add new content or expansion, its  whole other animal to add on top, without breaking what is under.
---
But how does one "take a year off"??
---
arms is dogshit in pve in both horde and alliance
---
By the very nature of wow classic is living in the past. So I'm not sure why you're so against making it possible for the Corrupted Blood Incident to happen again. We're going to obviously going to make new memories in wow classic but there's nothing wrong about allowing an event from vanilla to happen again in classic.
---
Yeah, we saw it as an investment. We were also only on BWL at that point and it's not like you need 40 min-maxers to get through that. I'm not sure if we would take them to Naxx though. Maybe one or two won't hurt I guess.
---
We had a rank 12 in BWL once and asscandy dropped, the warrior CL took it for himself rather than give it to the ranker. Pretty stupid tbh and I believe he got fired for it. Some people are just sad.
---
Tacitly applied when you bring up unavailability of 1.12, and people discussing an item at launch.
---
Perp is actually fucking insane too though. That was humiliating.
---
The death of wpvp was people getting their gear from 5 mans and realizing the out of raid prep for AQ and Naxx wasnt worth it for them. So they stayed in town and Bg'd and raided MC/Ony/BWL and ZG. 
---
If not for BGs wow wouldnt have been nearly as popular. 
---
Wpvp finally died in BC with flying mounts.
---
Me three
---
It's for sure correct, I was an unbreakable wannabe, spent more time re-leveling 2h weapon skills than I want to admit to D:
---
I was gonna say rogue. Less upkeep than hunter and she may not like everything that goes along with hunter, even if she plays one on retail.
---
sorry but BGs existed in vanilla, which is sacred ground, so you cannot criticize anything implemented during this time.  please direct all 'world pvp death' criticism directly to flying mounts and arena even though you know those totally epic tarren mill pvp battles stopped happening after battlegrounds
---

&gt;Organized PvP removes all reasons to wPVP. 
---
No it doesn't, I did shitloads of world pvp all through vanilla.
---
What reason do you have to believe that?
---
Welcome to 2019 where people scream at their screen over 2 pixels
---
If they could have alternate distances for players and npc then we could have the benefits of both.
---
glad you didn't get invited. hope your mom doesn't let you play the actual game either.
---
Some people enjoy battlegrounds. I think most do. Wpvp will still happen and it’s fun usually sure but it’s all opinion. I for one welcome our instanced overlords
---
Items that were not able to be obtained in 1.12 aren't going into Classic.  That's all it comes down to.  You couldn't get it, you won't be able to get it.
---
I want to play Old AV.  Old AV is gone by the time 1.12 hits.  It sucks, but that's the way it is.
---
I laughed.  It's sad that "MUH NOCHANGES" is actually not a good stance to have.  We must talk about the bad things blizzard implemented.
---
Possibly, but you state it as though we know for a fact?
---
OP's asking for dungeon tanking though not raid tanking.
---
Because they arent the correct height.
---
https://i.imgur.com/pK6AGXQ.png
---
Streamers reporting actual bugs?
---
But that would be a problem. Classic elements.. They had them 15 years ago and changed them. And now they're forced into going back against everything they've done?   
---
Back on topic, as a president of a company that has to abandon everything you've done over the last 10+ years to go back to something 15 years old, because it was better... Surely, you'd resign.
---
&gt;So they stayed in town and Bg'd
---
Thanks for agreeing.
---
Also yes, flying mounts contributed to the death too.
---
&gt;If not for BGs wow wouldnt have been nearly as popular.
---
Bullshit.  WoW was massively popular anyways, and even if they went in an open-world pvp direction it would've been just as huge.
---
Can you compare with a 2.4.3 client?
---
Same for me as undead. The area was completely over populated, but i was able to skip some quests and just kill any mob I could tag.  Took 57 mins /played to get to 5
---
heh probably a significant contribution towards why so many people in old pvp vids are so terrible. I get the game was new and unexplored but if people were clearing rag and ony with one button addons it would make sense that theyre backpedaling clickers.
---
This is the most stupidest thing I've read the last 6 hours on /r/classicwow
---
The conversation is wrong?  LOL?
---
It's talking about how the implementation of organized PvP directly killed any and all reasons to wPvP out of random encounters.
---
No way dude, wtf!?
---
Cheers! Absolutely my favorite class in terms of flavor and mechanics across classic and nearly every expansion. Have fun :D
---
Do warlocks and mages compete for gear 100% or are some pieces better suited for one or the other?   
---
I have mained mostly warlock up until monk came out where I didn't play much anyway and am mostly considering warlock for classic. I know I love warlock but some of the more tedious things about them I didn't experience much as I never played vanilla at max level.   
---
I will be playing a lot with my best friend who is a mage though.   
---
Will we always compete for gear?  
---
Seeing as I do have some desire to try a new class, would it be worth rolling as something else so as to not compete for gear?
---
And in endgame do mages generally get priority over warlocks for early gear since they do more DPS?
---
Insight into how easy it is to gear up by someone with experience would be appreciated. Thanks!
---
RemindMe! 95 days “classic settings”
---
Oh shit, you're right. Here, let me edit my comment.
---
You are beyond retarded, you are advocating to ban people who play to win and use any system they can.
---
You blizzdrones brought this to yourself with your "But muh first 4hours of launch experience!11", you will face the consequences.
---
Flurry axes, flasks, edgemasters or any form of preraid BiS craftable? Yeah good luck getting that you will have to farm a month to catch up just slightly. Naturally most top end resources are under strict restriction since they are camped by said top guilds.
---
At least you can quest at launch instead of running for 5minutes with a group and killing lvl 4-6 mobs for a bit, grab flight points and get explore xp.
---
(:
---
DECADES BEHIND, dork. I was winning WSG in 2006.
---
Automatically downvote any streamer spam unless it's really important. I think they pay people to spam their videos. The videos always have ridiculous facial expressions as well like they are trying to appeal to little kids
---
I mean, there’s a history of it and if you had to travel there and people could also travel there to watch, I’d dig it. Not “talk to guy to queue”. But you’re talking to someone who was disappointed when they added WSG / AV / AB battlemasters to the game.
---
Wasn't there a wiki post comparing heights before and after blizz changed it?
---
100% patch 2.0  
---
Your pala buddy had a patch 1.11 weapon which he for sure bought with honor seeing how his other gear would make no sense for an actual rank 14 player - especially since he's unranked and you couldn't "turn off" your rank title until 2.0, and you literally cast summon water elemental which wasn't added to the game until patch 2.0
---
SNAP JAWWWW
---
Yes... Skills do effect pvp in vanilla defense and weapon skills have an effect here... Welcome to vanilla 😉
---
From what i remember even in tbc there was still plenty of world pvp hell my time leveling in stranglethorn vale was an absolute blast.
---
Anecdotal evidence.
---
Instanced PvP literally sucked 90% of the players out of the world because they wanted to farm BG's for rewards.
---
Loser
---
if people liked wPvP they would do wPvP, even with BGs enabled.
---
since no one organizes wPvP, we can assume people don't like wPvP, because they clearly love/prefer BGs.
---
That's great if they enjoyed battlegrounds.  I'm simply saying organized PvP killed wPvP on a bigger scale.
---
I do about LFR maybe normal. The vanilla raids are easy, but not easy enough that you can literally ignore everything and just hit the boss until it dies.
---
Druids have the highest burst heal in the game.
---
What the hell did pservers do then when they added dynamic spawning? What an interesting situation
---
But they shouldn't add BGs. BGs were the start of the decline. At most they should have BGs temporary. Real vanilla is world PvP
---
&gt; Horde Player here. What is this?
---
A woman.
---
Horde doesn't frequently see those, I understand.
---
They're lvl 30 twinks. Getting WW axe at 30 is 100% a twink move.
---
leveling in zones =/= max level wPvP
---
Yes wpvp happens while leveling, that's a given.
---
wPvP in TBC was basically non-existent in comparison to vanilla.
---
God I wish human females were real..
---
LoH would like to have a word with you XD
---
I refuse to believe it.
---
It has nothing to do with liking wPvP over organized PvP.  It has everything to do with people gaining rewards for NOT wPvPing, and directly makes wPvP less rewarding for everyone that wants to.
---
WSG was basically a small arena. The whole flag capture thing was ridiculous. WoW was originally about attacking actual towns and cities, like it was a real world
---
Anecdotal evidence. 
---
It didn't at all there was still a lot of world pvp happening on pvp servers. Guilds fighting over bosses, towns being camped. I started multiple fights at TM/SS that escalated to raid vs raid fights. Anyone that played on a pvp server during the release of BG's knows how active the world still was.
---
on horde nem
---
I went through a bunch of first kill vanilla pictures and gnomes definitely look to be the right size in the beta.
---
&gt; they don't realize that wPvP is literally the best thing about WoW
---
thats completely subjective though. You're claiming something is "literally the best part" but not everyone likes PvP or wPvP. 
---
There's nothing wrong with BGs being added to Classic. Running BG groups with friends was my favorite part about playing in Classic. 
---
There will always be people farming or doing events in the world and you'll be able to wPvP people but if you expect massive battles to be happening constantly you'll be disappointed cause it won't be like that all day long even if BGs never get added.
---
https://i.imgur.com/dj75Ut2h.jpg
---
Should be pretty easy to replicate
---
Duh I'm dumb. That's right. It is 6. Crazy what I remember and what I don't from playing WoW. There's some obscure shit I'll recall like one of the first undead quests showing a mirror to Lilian then forget stuff about classes I actually played hahaha!
---
Still probably can't find Mankrik's wife, too. GG me.
---
They dont stack in vanilla. Best bet is to get a soul shard bag.
---
It's a lot to take in for sure
---
Don’t give up that easily brother. The community has got tons of shit changed. I know time is short, but you never know
---
but did you need to level it? i'd imagine you only pvp'ed in enhancement and nothing else, and in pvp all skills are scaled to current level max anyway.
---
u either no life it to get ahead of the pack or u wait a week to come in after the "hype"
---
At most they should limit world pvp. Real vanilla is battlegrounds. Theyre both just opinions. World pvp will always exist. Bgs will always exist.
---
People used to hide flags for hours, wall jumping and glitching into places
---
If he's making the shareholders money, why would they want him to resign?
---
We do, because Tauren are MOD_SCALE_X 1.3 on Legion, but scale 1.0 is shorter than they were pre-Legion. Ergo, vanilla had to be above 1.0, and the same is almost certainly true for gnomes.
---
wPvP is the best thing about WoW.  Period.  Why else are we playing this game again?  Oh that's right, the community, the feeling of an alive world.  wPvP is the epitome of that.  Organized PvP is robotic.
---
&gt;There's nothing wrong with BGs being added to Classic.
---
It takes PvPers out of the world.
---
That I can't answer. I always leveled it D:
---
Agree somewhat. Fortunately we'll have quite a while before WSG is released.
---
ok with the caviet of not crippling the healer :P
---
WOW :o
---
wow, that's insane..
---
Mythic should be the only difficulty. Been saying this for years lol. I know it would never happen and I would feel bad for the casual players but I value the feel/immersion of the game world a lot more than most people I think
---
Private servers are based on code from vanilla client.
---
Not current.
---
Theres a clear difference.
---
And I played back in 2005, my account is still dated May 2005.
---
I remember Gnomes being much shorter than dwarves.
---
The gnome female in Classic alone is much meatier than it was back then. There are also tons of actual pictures and video from vanilla wow (reminder yt came out in 05)
---
Reminder that 1.12 that blizzard is using is running on the same code and engine revision as.... DRUM ROLLLLLLL
---
BFA.
---
And they rescaled the models after some expansion, dont remember which.
---
Taurens used to not be able to go through certain places where other races could.
---
Gnomes used to swim in PUDDLES.
---
RIP zerker rage isn't until 32
---
Couple years for end game content? Quite the exaggeration there. There are already guides on everything because the game was conquered before. There will be addons in no time telling you where to stand for raids. The influence of media such as YouTube and twitch is massively available to make learning fights a trivial task
---
Classic isn't "/u/trannykiller 's personal vision of Vanilla".  They are recreating 1.12 pretty closely to the roll out of its content.  If they leave out BGs for you, then I should be able to tell them something I want left out.  Soon there won't be anything left because people will just keep telling them to leave stuff out.
---
...k
---
Useful, but I pefer the extra mana.
---
Entire BG compilation videos with  00's techno/metal.. Yees, gimme.
---
Classic servers are correctly scaling player models to be larger than the NPC gnomes. The private server reference seem to not do this.
---
The private server gnome is too small.
---
Yes, the conversation is wrong because you know they aren't going to make Classic have zero BGs.  They've already told you the roadmap.  The roadmap includes BGs.
---
It was added towards the end of vanilla with the pre-BC patch. There were also a number of mobs in scholo that got switched to the new bloodelf models at the same time, and some hunters up at the lodge.
---
I fully believe that things like wPvP kills, faction leader kills, etc. should matter.   It would be nice is each of those categories had its own "pie" of points to be distributed each week rather than the endless wsg farm we have today.  Why increase your piece of the WSG pie if you can get more points by playing AB or AV, wPvPing or organizing a city raid?
---
BGs were added later on, probably after the original talented team began quitting. The guys who built the BGs probably included the guys who made arena and feminized the horde in TBC
---
Uh. Player models should not be larger than other npcs.
---
That has never been the case.
---
I played vanilla, I played bc.
---
Never was an NPC gnome smaller than the player model.
---
Don't stack, no. You can get a bag, though. I'd just use a normal bag.
---
For raiding don't expect to summon or give healthstones to anyone but tanks and healers. Everyone needs to go on their own and mind their own.
---
Some cases you may have extra shards on hand so do what you please. Other than that I have the same rules for a mage: nobody gets food or water but the tanks and healers.
---
I never expected anything else when I raided. I don't expect ports, stones, food or water if I'm a DPS.
---
If you're running some PUG 5's then you can also do the same just to be nice, I usually did without anyone asking.
---
I sorted by controversial and 95% of the posts are from either this sub or r/WoW. I haven't been around here long enough to know if it's just recent events or if this is the usual and it's as toxic here as everyone says.
---
In the sea of controversy I stumbled upon this post. Some could see it as a low effort karma grab, but to me it's ones man's attempt to give us three minutes and fifty seven seconds of tranquility in these trying times.
---
I'm sorry that, at the time of this comment, you are at 43% on karma.
---
Take my updoot.
---
Second one was added towards the end of vanilla with one of the pre-BC patches.
---
Exercise some god damn self control.
---
&gt;It didn't at all there was still a lot of world pvp happening on pvp servers. 
---
But there wasn't nearly as much happening as there was before BG's were implemented.    
---
\&gt;Guilds fighting over bosses  
---
Would happen either way with or without BG's.  
---
\&gt;towns being camped  
---
Didn't happen nearly as much after organized PvP came.  No reason to waste time wPvPing when you could be earning rewards/ranks.  
---
\&gt;Anyone that played on a pvp server during the release of BG's knows how active the world still was.  
---
I played literal pre-vanilla all the way through WOTLK, the best parts of WoW, on a PvP server (Illidan, arguably one of the crazier ones) as a ROGUE that loved wPvP.  I felt the direct impact of organized PvP killing off wPvP.
---
Super cool that you still have them
---
&gt; I’ll raid two times a week and enjoy shooting the shit with my mates. Much respect to the mythic raiders but I don’t have the time for that anymore, but I’m glad for the options that classic brings.
---
If you're interested, there are two-night mythic guilds on almost every server. I'm doing uni and working so 2 nights is the only option. We just downed mythic Jaina last week.
---
Are you NA? Myself and two others are recruiting people and we just got to 25+ people today. If you’re interested just PM me. We’re planning on going horde/PVP, not too hardcore but not complete casuals either. We plan to at least clear through BWL.
---
Btw if anyone else is interest PM as well.
---
Right, so you're actively lying about how inactive the world was. Sweet, glad we cleared that up.
---
There needs to be more dewey in memes
---
I believe that's me in your screenshot.
---
I have 20 active WoW subscriptions spread across 10 bnetaccounts. 
---
One of my accounts is from 2005.
---
7 of my accounts got invited for the stresstest, but not a single one has been invited to the actual beta.
---
So... I'm not sure if I'd consider myself particularly lucky.
---
Imagine wanting blizzard to fix a playerbase problem, learn to play the economy.
---
Stay at home dad
---
The main problems occurred not from having BGs, but when arenas were introduced. Not due to there being arenas - but due to the beginning of balancing classes around arena comps.
---
That same media is telling me that AQ40 and Naxx will be prohibitive to casual players because of the amount of farming they require for nature/frost resistance, etc. - which means it’s not prohibitive to casuals, it’s just time consuming, so once casuals are able to clear Naxx, then I’ll say the game needs new content (or TBC, or a reset).
---
Hunters are pretty different in classic, she might not like the lack of quality of life improvements the class received over the years.
---
I suppose it depends on what people consider wPVP is.  When people look back fondly of Arathi and Tarren,  these happened because BG's weren't a thing.
---
Once BG's came out those things pretty much died.  Sure you'd still gank people here and there,  but giant groups fitting in the world rarely happened after.
---
Because having the talk is worth it.  I want people to understand that wPvP died when organized PvP became the go-to.  We have the ability to do what we want as a community.
---
Don't turn off the game for 93 days.
---
You doooo make a good point on sporadic burst healing but WE BOTH KNOW THATS EXTREMELY MANA INTENSIVE AND SWIFTMEND DOES HAVE A CD :) But yes, valid point my furry friend.
---
another zone ruined by cata.
---
Lordy. Don't suppose there's any courtesy getting tipped for summons like mage portals?
---
So did everyone have to update the beta client too?
---
&gt;retail mythic raiding is no joke 
---
At no point in wows history has any raid had a serious requirement of reaction speed or anything truly mechanically challenging. The fastest point you need to clear in any raid is like 350ms. The average person has a reaction speed of 200ms and the average higher level reactoin speed is like 160ms
---
Counter strike is difficult, star craft is difficult, league is difficult, wow raiding/pvp has never and will never be in any way difficult
---
It's Kharanos. The place you're thinking of is Misty Pine Refuge.
---
a crit regrowth into swiftmend can be quite a bit of burst, but it's really expensive mana-wise. there's also nature's swiftness for a big fat healing touch
---
The max camera script was disabled in Legion, not wrath. I remember being pretty upset by it.
---
Opened up Classic reddit and saw this post.
---
I had so much fun in that group :D
---
Super excited for classic!

Well no, but the radiation certainly can't be good for you
---
Tanking any dungeon as fury should be fine. 
---
Mostly just sunder. Save rage at the end of each pull to have plenty for the next pull. 
---
The only fancy thing I could say is, if you are starting a big pull with 25
---
They 100% did exist, i rolled on multiple new servers in vanilla. Every single start area on those servers was an absolute moshpit of players, very similar to private server launches, significantly more people than the recent stress test. I don't remember having to wait ever having to wait all that long for respawns.
---
I don't know exactly when blizzard added in their current system of dynamic spawns, but i remember in WotLK farming for steamweedle rep near ratchet. I'd farmed there for hours so i knew the rotation perfectly. You would do one lap, the spawns would still be 5 minutes, you would do your second lap, and the spawns would be start speeding up and continue to speed up until you could be killing with every gcd.
---
This is litterly how I feel though I don't mind BFA, and I check every hour except when sleeping...
---
OG Pals For Life made a bunch of other funny videos just for shits, A Rough Go was just the one that took off massively.
---
I meant the base model.
---
What you're saying is completely SUBJECTIVE, whether you wanna admit it or not. You're delisional if you think everyone plays just for the wPvP. 
---
I've played with so many different people in vanilla. Some loved to just level alts, some loved to just farm gold and support friends and their guild, some loved raids and dungeons, some loved wPvP or ganking, and some loved BGs. 
---
They is no one best thing about Vanilla, that's make makes it so great. The world is massive with so much to do and experience.
---
Just because you prefer one aspect over everything else in the game that doesn't make it the hands down best thing about Vanilla.
---
Maybe you should start your own pServer and not add BGs and just make it all about wPvP. Start your own community that has the same mindset as you or start a grassroots community and have lots of people all go to the same server on launch. So then all of you can focus on wPvP for the while length of vanilla.
---
Fortunately.  I hope they wait an entire year so we can see the direct impact organized PvP has on world PvP.  People will feel it.  Less city raids, less random giant fights, less TMvsSS fights, etc.  
---
I just wish they would expand on wPvP and add some shit that makes it more enticing.
---
I didn’t even know that was possible but... I also play on a potato of a laptop so... that may be why...
---
Nah you’ll be fine. I used to play with 30ms back in Canada and now on retail/private I get 200-250 since I’m in Australia. You get used to it within 15 minutes and it’s honestly not bad, this isn’t a Shooter game :)
---
You’ll be fine
---
It only begins
---
Unless you quested in the shimmering flats *Shiver*

---
Anyone remember Legiondaries farming? D:
---
It's not worth it because it's never going to happen.  They are *never* going to make Classic have no battlegrounds.  If they do, I'm not going to even bother playing because what I love *most* about WoW is AV.  More than anything else they've ever done, I love AV.
---
It showed but only after a certain amount of time IIRC
---
No they still happened frequently. Mass fights would break out in farming areas all the time. LHC was a constant shit fight, I dunno what dead ass servers you guys played on but I never had any issues finding and starting fights.
---
We are starting over again with a modern classic client. That's it. If you want to petition for changes down the line then fine.
---
Can you update this post if you get in the next hour and 12 minutes? That will be 6pm PST.

they seem about the same to me!

&gt;What you're saying is completely SUBJECTIVE
---
It's simple and mathematical.
---
More players queuing organized PvP for faster/easier PvP rewards == Less players randomly wPvPing for fun.
---
Hahaha thanks mate. Appreciated.
---
This video filled me with nostalgia from my super limited amount of time spent playing classic (right before BC was released). Hopefully you enjoyed the trip down memory lane like I did.
---
Sadly, no. This is uploaded by the original creator of the video from his old files, the source recording is higher res than whatever was uploaded to WarcraftMovies and reposted to Youtube years ago.
---
They are using 1.12 because that is the furthest back backup that they had. It does not mean it is the best option. 1.12 has many obvious degenerated forms of WoW. Consider AV for instance. Even the battleground they do have is a cut down version which no one actually likes
---
I think there will still be world pvp, which I am looking forward to the most. But I would also like to do alterac valley, if I'm spelling that right.
---
6pm PDT happens when this comment is 1 hour and 10 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/xy7GA4NlJ
---
Imagine doing this up to 16h a day while grinding for r14. 
---
PepeLaugh OH NO NO NO
---
Arenas and BG's are one in the same.  They take PVPers out of the world.
---
Yeah, but I find that outside of raiding bfa has nothing I want to be doing. I’ve felt that way for a long time in legion and wod before that. So I’m stopping live and will just enjoy classic. It feels better to me.
---
We'll have to rely on community events I think. A year seems like a long time, and there will be a lot of whining about releasing BGs sooner rather than later.
---
Let's see what happens.

---
Just looked at my screenshots.
---
The "taller" gnomes are correct.
---
Eyes above the gloves is a good indicator.
---
Fun fact, if you make that joke over at r/wow you will get banned dont be like me
---
Actively lying about something I directly experienced as a wPVP loving rogue?
---
Okay.
---
Divine Intervention on the mages so they can AOE...
---
literally everyone is disagreeing with you. You are the one outcast out of thousands.
---
They stayed in town and bg'd over logging out ya dingus. By the time AQ and Naxx were out people had exhausted the other content and the barrier to entry was too much for most. But BGs existed, so they played those. If not for BGs they wouldnt have been online.
---
BGs were so massively popular it isnt even funny. Until LFR, the vast majority of wow players never saw the inside of raids.
---
O.O
---
Totally in the same boat man, my dad bought wow day 1 of vanilla release, prior to that we played Warcraft 3 together on a LAN with two POS computers and then played wow together. He got bored of it super fast, maybe a few days in, but I stayed with it and have played every x pac. I haven’t played quite as much in recent x pacs as I usually end up doing everything in the first month or so and get bored and switch to a pserver. I was a youngster at the time when vanilla released but will always remember the fun we had together.
---
I don't care about the roadmap.  I care about the actual game.
---
We have https://classic.wowhead.com/database which has the database search bar in the center, like thottbot.
---
However the search bar is also at the top right of any page and there shouldn't be extra things to load up before you can use it. Typing terms into the search bar on any page should still return database suggestions, and hitting return takes you to a page of results.
---
Amazing thank you
---
Or maybe the people who make the game know more than a bunch of whinging fucking children who most likely never even played in Vanilla and have no fucking idea where these screenshots are coming from or any fucking idea how the game is fucking coded. I want classic, but people like you are demonstrating clearly that this shit stain of a community doesn't deserve it.
---
I got added on Tuesday and got my invite yesterday afternoon.
---
Oh sorry I guess it’s been too long ! Thanks for the precision
---
The real classic enthusiast wont play for long if they keep sneaking in stuff like this. I've heard all of phase 1 will have layering now? 
---
Already catering to the casual experience, we all know where that can lead.
---
Most of us don’t have beta keys and so we are “experiencing” it thru streamers.
---
It’s not great content but it’s very obvious why it’s popular right now.
---
Are you a non english speaker? What you are saying is subjecting. That is facts.
---
Many people who will play vanilla don't like wPvP or PvP in general. 
---
wPvP is not "literally the best part". For you, sure it's your favorite part but it's not the end all be all best part about vanilla.
---
&gt;It's not worth it because it's never going to happen.   
---
Sorry, I don't subscribe to defeatist attitudes.  
---
If you love organized PvP over wPvP you're just part of the problem that eventually made the world feel stale and robotic.
---
Glad I could enhance your enjoyment of this awesome game :)
---
It doesn't matter what the best option is.  It matters what we're getting.  There's no point in crying about wPVP dying with BGs because you know you *are* getting BGs.  That's my entire point: your thread is pointless.
---
Yupp you betcha. I will confess I didn't play during classic, I'm pretty sure others had Nature's Swiftness equivalents. I was more speaking in comparison to Pally's who's kit is designed for big, consistent  mana efficient heals.
---
Nice ninja edit trying to make me look dumb.
---
What do you even mean by "base model"
---
The player model is the base model.
---
Player gnomes were about crotch height on dwarves.
---
They are super chunky now.
---
Private servers run on literally vanilla code and have been since they first popped up back in 06.
---
Nobody is talking about Blizz doubling the debuff slots for some reason. Its going from 8-&gt;16 from the jump, and all content balanced around 8 slots (AKA everything before ZG) is going to take a serious difficulty hit. 
---
On top of the game being theory crafted to death &amp; generally more competent players, im extremely concerned for how trivial things will be. 
---
We need legitimate buffs to dungeons and early raids at the least.
---
I dont see any bragging. He pointed out that he's not a streamer. PS: I totally have beta access and you don't haHA
---
Can you unequip it off cool-down?
---
&gt;Nope.  
---
&gt;It's simple and mathematical.  
---
&gt;More players queuing organized PvP for faster/easier PvP rewards == Less players randomly wPvPing for fun.
---
You can ignore this all you want, but MORE PLAYERS DOING INSTANCED PVP == LESS PVPERS IN THE WORLD.
---
I wonder if most Bethesda testers also play WoW instead of testing their own games
---
- Did you find any issues today Stevie?
---
- Absolutely nothing! It is 100% ready to be released.
---
*quickly alt+tabing from WoW to Fallout76*
---
if you summon a Canadian maybe
---
1. i would agree that, on the surface, this is true. the orcs, trolls and tauren's architecture is well known for its mud huts and tiny tents, and for giving off the message ''we just got here'' as opposed to the alliance, who have spent centuries building up their towns and cities. 
---
the blood elves are known for their brightly colored, regal-looking buildings. they exhibit elegance and grace, in a faction characterized as being rough and dirty. it is a big contrast, and i see how that could be jarring. 
---
i would argue that it's not all that bad, though. it reminds me quite a bit of the forsaken's architecture, which seems to be based on the idea of gathering in broken down buildings, the shattered remains of an ancient once great civilization. sound familiar? again, i see how it could be jarring, but surely no more than taking a zeppelin from durotar to tirisfal is.
---
2. i don't agree with this at all. i'm not accusing you of anything, for the record, only offering my own viewpoint, but i feel as if a lot of people who say this have only done the most superficial and shallow look into their culture. 
---
they went through a disastrous event that nearly destroyed their civilization, and when they rose from the ashes, they came back to a world that certainly did not want them. they wouldn't take this laying down, and with the help of their new allies, they went kicking and screaming into a new dawn... am i talking about the orcs, tauren, trolls, undead, or blood elves here? 
---
yes, that's generalizing a bit, but hopefully you get the idea. they went through horrible things, and sometimes they did horrible things. one of the biggest bads in the warcraft universe attacked their homeland and slaughtered their people. in the wake of this tragedy, as they still fought off the scourge, the alliance was already sabatoging them. the forsaken reached out to them, and they allied with the horde in the name of survival. classic underdog race, but with better hair.
---
3. not going to go too indepth on this one. blizzard seems to toss around the word extinct like it's candy at a halloween party, and (don't quote me on this, i might be wrong) i seem to remember several vanilla races being described as nearly extinct, like the night elves, or just part of a very tiny group to begin with, like the darkspear. and you can't really fault the lore for the actions of the players, although i do wish we had more diversity.
---
4. at war with the orcs? yes. at war with the trolls? well... the amani trolls, yes. not the darkspear, who are the trolls allied with them. there's even a quest in eversong where you help a darkspear captured and (eventually) murdered by amani. 
---
as for the undead, i certainly believe that they could harbor some resentment. the quest givers in ghostlands even behave like you're shocked by the presence of forsaken and explain what is going on. i do think it makes enough sense for them to accept their help when the leader of the forsaken is one of their great heroes who died protecting them, and the forsaken themselves have plenty of blood elves in their ranks. in any case, it seems more an alliance of convinience than anything, not ''i love you guys now''.
---
5. hard agree on this one. character development is good, but i enjoyed the moral greyness of early blood knights.
---
anyways i just really like blood elves and wanted to offer my two cents, for discussion
---
I will do this next stress test, can't figure out how to open the console without logging in. :nobetaformesorry:
---
&gt; hunter getting absolutely dicked on by SL locks
---
Not that surprising since most of Hunter's defensive power comes from kiting potential, hard to do against a DOT heavy caster. That said, if you ever get to the stage with [Renataki's Charm of Beasts](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19953/renatakis-charm-of-beasts) you become a real big threat for them due to your insane upfront burst and more max range. Plus, in higher level BGs you don't see SL builds that much since it tends to have less damage and can be dispelled.
---
Some of us are realists.  You wanting them to leave out BGs forever isn't going to make it happen.
---
Having it at 80 is how it should be. the 10yd thing is just junk, it always was.
---
Depends on the guild and/or Warlock. I used to farm at least 30 soul shards before each raid for the sake of making Soulstones for the Healers/Tanks, and Healthstones for whoever opened trade with me.
---
I would personally get annoyed about summons though. I would refuse to do them if people had time to get there on their own, especially if I was personally an hour early to the raid location.
---
&gt; They stayed in town and bg'd over logging out ya dingus 
---
Yep, they avoided wPvP because it was better, safer, easier, more casual to just spam queue BG all day.  
---
Herp derp.  
---
\&gt;BGs were so massively popular it isnt even funny.  
---
Actually, it was funny!  SO funny in fact, that it killed wPvP.
---
They don't need many mechanics for them to be hard. Naxx is pretty fucking hard just from a dmg standpoint. Vanilla Naxx dmg values was the same as for wotlk Naxx for most fights.
---
Quick, someone measure how tall he is!

"We had simply run that dungeon way too many times with pick up players who trampled over those eggs and caused wipes,” said Vinson. "
---
There's no quote saying precisely that it happened but it's probably drawn from real events, that's just what I think, should ask them to be sure
---
Montages with melodic metal &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; boring af commentary vids from this decade.
---
You’ll definitely notice it but its quite playable. &lt;60 is optimal if possible. 200ms is when you start running into problems.
---
&gt; if you don't have the time or don't prepare for raids then you shouldn't be able to access them. That's what makes them special and dangerous and elite feeling.
---
That's what leads to less than 1% of your population seeing content that your developers worked months on, well done mate. Well fuckin done ...
---
You are a complete nutter. The only the reason classic got made is people asking for it. The reason a million changes happen all the time is a million people asking for stuff and blizzard filtering out the voices
---
&gt;muh majority rules
---
I don't give a fuck if 99.9% of you disagree with me, you're all wrong.
---
It's simple, really.
---
MORE PLAYERS DOING INSTANCED PVP == LESS PVPERS IN THE WORLD.
---
I just don’t get it. Blizzard is giving us Classic as a gift when they never had to and everyone wants to whine and cry about every stupid little thing. If you don’t trust Blizzard so much go and play on a private server.
---
I play with constant 180-250 ms since I live in South America... In general it's not that bad and you get used to it, although it can be a pain to interrupt fast casts, and it's nearly impossible to interrupt at 80%+... the cast will go off regardless and you'll lose your kick. Other than that no biggie
---
wtf dude? Are you ignoring my whole message? I'm not agruing that BGs pulled people out of wPvP. Of course it did. 
---
You're saying its bad because wPvP is the best part of Vanilla.
---
It's not the best part for everyone and you're not the most important person who is going to play in vanilla. 
---
There are tons of people who are looking forward to playing BGs. Me included. It created tons of amazing and memorable moments.
---
Its the base model in the game files, which after that is scaled to the size they thought was best in game.
---
odds are this is true though mark kern said the same thing
---
Did they remove these paintings from the live game?
---
Yes, but this makes it nigh impossible to be sneaky and that is big a problem for wpvp
---
Yikes.  A realist would recognize that wPvP was directly affected by organized PvP.  It's simply math.  
---
 MORE PLAYERS DOING INSTANCED PVP == LESS PVPERS IN THE WORLD.
---
"My view of what is best about WoW is right, and everyone else is wrong!"
---
Followed by:
---
"How dare you say this conversation is pointless!"
---
agreed, if for no other reason than if you haven't worked somewhere for years you can be misremembering things.
---
You work a tiring job, it takes a lot out of you mentally. You get home, you're tired, you just want to zone off for the night. So you pop into an LFR run and just mash buttons mindlessly to chill out. What's so wrong about that? I'll just never understand this blind hate for LFR.
---
Did no one read the general chat?!?!
---
Biggest upvote I’ll ever give 🤜🏼🤛🏽
---
They are lol
---
Everyone is wrong.  They're just following the herd on this because "MUH BGS ARE SO FUN" but it directly contributed to the downfall of wPvP in the process by offering easy rewards.  
---
God I love seeing all these things surface than run contrary to what most ‘no changes’ purists believed.
---
Vanilla
---
Identifying and abusing vulnerable systems like that is one of the best ways to get them fixed. In a perfect world nobody would exploit janky shit like sharding, but the reality is that people will. It's on the developers to fix it
---
Getting summoned is usually done in a group, so it’s really just a group courtesy done for free like mage water. It’s rare a random person would msg you trying to get you to summon (although it does occasionally happen and they’ll probably give you a gold if you can find 2 people to help).
---
&gt; they could have given us actual things to do in the real world to promote more interesting wPvP
---
wpvp is dumb.
---
/s ?
---
Mean not. I mean't to offend you
---
makes sense, explains why gnome mounts(all mounts) are bigger than other races. anyone have a pserver screenshot of a gnome on a mount?
---
**Blizzard dev team early 00's:** Hey, let's make a zone that's the exact same biome as Durotar.... but it's a canyon! And with cool rock formations and lifts.
---
That being said, I frikking love 1k Needles. A relativley compact zone with cool quests and beautifull aesthetics. Fairly peacefull PvP-wise too
---
We understand why it would be a convenience at launch, anyone can.
---
Blizz then selves had said their will only be phasing st launch. 
---
Now theyve come up with this layering solution for the first few months??
---
What's next? They'll say we need it even longer or make up some lazy excuse of how they cant support classic without it.
---
We simply dont trust their word for these things.
---
Well sure but that's straight up research and y'know, work.
---
I didn't deny that wPVP was directly affected by BGs.  Nowhere have I made that claim.
---
You thinking wPVP &gt; BGs doesn't make it the case for everyone.
---
So you can't be a holy paladin on Wednesday evening for a raid event, then next day a Retribution on the battlegrounds?
---
LOL are they trolling, a non native english speaker, or just ignorant?
---
They don't understand the difference between opinions and facts.
---
I like wPvP but it's not MY favorite part about vanilla.
---
Yeah no beta for me either (possibly because I refuse to pay a sub just for a chance of getting in a beta :p )
---
most people into pvping value 1v1 potential more than battleground power, even though paladins have better battleground power than shamans, the horde racials are busted in 1v1s.
---
so what ends up happening are the hardcore pvpers roll horde on pvp realms more often than not leading to an imbalance.
---
